"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Henry Allingham, the world's oldest man and the oldest surviving British veteran from World War I, has died at the age of 113, his care home said Saturday. Henry Allingham was a founding member of the modern Royal Air Force. Allingham died in his sleep at St. Dunstan's care home in Ovingdean, England, the home said in a statement. Born on June 6, 1896, Allingham was active until his final days, having celebrated his 113th birthday last month on the HMS President with his family, the care home said. The Guinness Book of World Records Certified Allingham as the world's oldest man last month, St. Dunstan's said. Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Gordon Brown both paid their respects to Allingham on Saturday. ""The queen was saddened to hear of the death of Henry Allingham. He was one of the unique generation who sacrificed so much for us all. Our thoughts are with his family at this time,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement. ""I had the privilege of meeting Henry many times,"" said Brown. ""He was a tremendous character, one of the last representatives of a generation of tremendous characters. My thoughts are with his family as they mourn his passing but celebrate his life."" Born in the East End of London during the reign of Queen Victoria, Allingham was brought up by his mother and grandparents. His father died when he was a baby. He joined the Royal Naval Air Service as an aircraft mechanic in 1915 after his mother died. Allingham was the last known survivor of the Battle of Jutland, considered the greatest battle of World War I. He was serving aboard the armed trawler HMT Kingfisher, which was sent to meet up with the British fleet as it fought the Germans off what is now mainland Denmark. The battle still holds the record for the most gun-armed battleships and battlecruisers engaged in a fight, according to Britain's Ministry of Defence. In 1917 Allingham was sent to France to support the Royal Flying Corps. His job as a mechanic was to service the aircraft and recover parts from downed planes, but pilots would often ask their mechanics to fly with them, so Allingham would sit behind the pilot and drop bombs or operate the machine gun. Allingham served in Flanders until that November, when he moved to the aircraft depot at Dunkirk, France. He stayed there until the end of the war. Allingham was a founding member of today's Royal Air Force, which was formed in 1918 when the Royal Naval Air Service merged with the Royal Flying Corps. He married his wife, Dorothy, in late 1918 and left the RAF a few months later, in April 1919. But Allingham remained a reservist, and during World War II he was called on to find a solution to the German magnetic mines that were bottling up the English harbor of Harwich, on the Essex coast. Allingham and his team devised an effective system to neutralize the mines, after which every ship was fitted with a neutralizing device using the system. His dedication to the military and the memory of fallen troops never wavered. In his later years especially, Allingham was often seen at memorial events, even though he could no longer walk and had to be transported in a wheelchair. ""Henry was always determined to ensure that today's generation does not forget the sacrifice of those who died on the Western Front,"" St. Dunstan's said in a statement after his death. ""Until recently, he regularly visited schools and attended war-based events as an ambassador for his generation."" Asked once at a memorial ceremony how he would like to be remembered, Allingham brushed off any thought of it, saying people should instead remember those who died in the wars. ""Remember them, not me,"" he said. He was made a chevalier in France's Legion of Honor in 2003 and was promoted to officer earlier this year. In awarding him the honor this year, the French ambassador to Britain thanked Allingham on behalf of French President Nicolas Sarkozy for his part in protecting France during both World Wars. The Royal Navy celebrated Allingham's birthday last month by throwing him a party aboard the HMS President. A birthday cake and card signed by the First Sea Lord was delivered by fast raiding craft of the Royal Marines, and he was given a decanter of Pussers Rum, his ""favorite tipple,"" on behalf of the Fleet Air Arm. Allingham's wife, Dorothy, died in 1970. Their two daughters both died in their 80s. He is survived by six grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren, 21 great-great-grandchildren, and one great-great-great grandchild, all of whom live in the United States, the care home said. Since 2006, Allingham had lived at St. Dunstan's, a care home for blind ex-servicemen and -women on the southern English coast. He had lost his sight as a result of age-related macular degeneration. ""Everybody at St. Dunstan's is saddened by Henry's loss and our sympathy goes out to his family,"" said Robert Leader, chief executive at the care home. ""As well as possessing a great spirit of fun, he represented the last of a generation who gave a very great deal for us. Henry made many friends among the residents and staff at St Dunstan's. He was a great character and will be missed.""","Henry Allingham died in his sleep at a care home in Ovingdean, England .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Consumer advocate Clark Howard revealed to listeners of his radio show on Wednesday that he has prostate cancer. Radio show host Clark Howard says doctors diagnosed him with prostate cancer in its early stages. Howard is one of the best-known consumer experts in the country. He has a nationally syndicated radio show and a new weekend show on CNN sister network HLN. He also has written several books on consumer issues, including two that made The New York Times best-sellers list. ""I just wanted to give it to you right form the horse's mouth, what's going on with me,"" Howard, 53, told listeners Wednesday during this radio show. The cancer was detected recently in its early stages, he said. His doctors had monitored his health for about 2Â½ years after a routine test came came back with unusual results. The test was a Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test to measure antigen, substances that stimulate an immune response in the body. If PSA levels are up, the chances of prostate cancer rise, and Howard's levels were such that his doctor gave him PSA tests every 90 days to monitor antigen levels. He also had biopsies to test for cancer. The fourth and most recent biopsy found a ""very, very small isolated pocket of cancer,"" Howard said. ""Prostate cancer caught early is not a walk in the park, but is not really that big a deal,"" Howard said. ""I just wanted to clear the air because rumors take on a life of their own."" According to the American Cancer Society, one in six men will get prostate cancer in their lifetimes, and one in 35 will die of the disease. Although its numbers are not yet complete for 2008, the organization estimated that during that year, there were about 186,320 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in the United States and about 28,660 men died from the disease. Among famous men who have been treated for prostate cancer are former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and actor Robert De Niro. There are various options for treating prostate cancer, all with different approaches. The American Cancer Society recommends considering things such as age, other serious health problems, stage of the cancer and side effects of treatment when selecting a method of treatment. Howard said his main point in talking about his diagnosis was to increase awareness among men. ""Guys put themselves in danger by not going to the doctor,"" he said. He spoke to female listeners as well as the men. ""Be a nag. Get your guy in to see the doctor, especially if you're 40 and up,"" he said.","The Atlanta-based consumer advocate makes announcement on radio show .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When emergency crews scramble to a celebrity's home and it turns out to be a false alarm, journalists don't usually write about it. Cher made the most of a false alarm, offering admiration for emergency personnel who came to her house. When the celebrity is Cher and her publicist issues an entertaining response to a reporter's call, some entertainment writers can't resist. The electronic call for help sounded at Cher's Malibu, California, home at 11:16 a.m. Thursday, spurring a flurry of activity. Ambulances and fire trucks rushed to the singer's residence, sending journalists to their address books for Cher's contact information. Her publicist, Liz Rosenberg, quickly responded to CNN's questions with this e-mailed explanation: . ""Just spoke to Cher who confirmed it was a false alarm but said she never saw so many cute firemen and paramedics in her life,"" said Rosenberg's response. ""She added there was an especially gorgeous black-haired ambulance driver that she is really sorry she didn't get to meet. Maybe there'll be another false alarm ...""

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Fight police misconduct with a cell phone, the NAACP says. The century-old civil rights organization has launched an online reporting system that lets users upload cell phone images of alleged police abuses. The Rapid Report System also lets users send text messages and e-mails about alleged misconduct. ""We know that most of police officers around the nation are excellent public servants. But the few who violate people's rights are often not held accountable,"" said Benjamin Jealous, president and CEO of the NAACP. ""Research has shown that there are many barriers to reporting incidents of police misconduct, including intimidation at police departments and a lack of trust in the integrity of the system, among other reasons. This breakdown leads to an absence of public safety and a deterioration of the quality of life in many communities of color."" The NAACP unveiled the online system Monday at its national convention in New York City. Users can post images from their cell phones or online. Cell phone footage has repeatedly helped spotlight alleged police misconduct in recent years. The fatal shooting of an unarmed man in Oakland, California, on New Year's Day made headlines and spread across the Internet partly because of cell phone video. The killing sparked large protests in Oakland and led to a murder charge against the transit officer.","NAACP unveils new program to allow people to report alleged police misconduct .

"(CNN) -- Billionaire oilman T. Boone Pickens is sinking billions of dollars into a new wind farm in Texas. It is likely to become the biggest in the world, producing enough power for the equivalent of 1.3 million homes. CNN's Ali Velshi asked the oil legend why he thinks wind could be the answer to this country's energy problems: . T. Boone Pickens explains his investment in a 4,000-megawatt wind farm to CNN's Ali Velshi. Ali Velshi: Tell me about the wind. Now, you are buying, for a start, more than 600 wind turbines from General Electric. You're going to put them on this big tract of land in Texas, and you're going to generate a lot of electricity. What happens to that electricity? Tell me where you think you're going to make your money and how this is going to help the situation in America. T. Boone Pickens: Well, that's the first step to a 4,000-megawatt wind farm. This is 1,000 megawatts. We start receiving those turbines in mid 2010. We will have the total 4,000 megawatts finished by the end of 2015. That power will go into a transmission line that will tie into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas system in the state of Texas, and it will be transmitted downstate.  Watch why Pickens is willing to spend billions on wind Â» . Velshi: What's your view of wind power? It's one of several things that we should be looking at in terms of powering our homes, electrical power? We get most of it from coal and natural gas, and some from nuclear. Are you thinking it's one of the formats of power we should be thinking about, or is this going to be bigger than we all thought? Pickens: The Department of Energy came out with a study in April of '07 that said we could generate 20 percent of our electricity from wind. And the wind power is -- you know, it's clean, it's renewable. It's -- you know, it's everything you want. And it's a stable supply of energy. It will be located in [the] central part of the United States, which will be the best from a safety standpoint to be located. You have a wind corridor that goes from Pampa, Texas, to the Canadian border. And it has -- the wind, it's unbelievable that we have not done more with wind. Look at Germany and Spain. They have developed their wind way beyond what we have, and they don't have as much wind as we do. It's not unlike the French have done with their nuclear. They're 80 percent power generated off of nuclear, we're 20 percent. Velshi: I'm fascinated by wind power. I love going by a field of these turbines. And I think they're fascinating. You don't happen to think they're attractive, and you're not really putting them on your land. You're going to be using other people's land to put these things on. Pickens: That's right. And it's very clear, these are my neighbors. And they want them. It generates income for them. A turbine will generate somewhere around 20,000 [dollars] a year in royalty income. And on a 640-acre tract, you can put five to 10 of these on the tract. And you don't have to have them if you don't want them. Velshi: And it's quite common that people who maybe have a piece of land, they might be farmers or something like that, this is extra income to them by making a deal with somebody like you who is going put these things up, if they don't mind having them on the land. Do they get the electricity from it or do they just get a royalty check? Pickens: A royalty check. But look at Sweetwater, Texas. That town was 12,000 people, then went down below 10,000. The wind came in, it's above 12,000 in population now. The local economy is booming. That can be repeated over and over and over again all the way to the Canadian border. Then you have a solar corridor that goes from Sweetwater, Texas, west to the West coast, and that solar corridor can also be developed. But we are going to have to do something different in America. You can't keep paying out $600 billion a year for oil.","Oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens planning 4,000-megawatt wind farm .

"(CNN) -- The economic downturn may take its toll at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, which opens Wednesday night. But as always, the show will go on. Eli Roth and Brad Pitt are men on a mission in Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds."" Studios are cutting back on parties and all the glitz that goes with them, according to news reports. Moreover, there will be fewer people around to cover Cannes, as news organizations around the world trim costs. (Several, in fact, have tightened up by eliminating their movie reviewers.) Nevertheless, those who attend may see a bumper crop of good and intriguing films, Variety's Jay Weissberg told Reuters. ""We've all been hoping Cannes would pull something out of the bag to make us feel good again. On paper, they have."" Leah Rozen, film critic for People magazine, said there are several promising contenders for the Palme d'Or, Cannes' top prize, as well as a number of notable movies premiering out of competition. ""What Cannes really is, is an international festival, and you really see world cinema,"" she said. ""This year, there are 52 films that are going to be represented, of which 20 are in competition.""  See Rozen talk about some of this year's promising works Â» . Two of the films in competition are American: Quentin Tarantino's World War II movie, ""Inglourious Basterds,"" and Ang Lee's ""Taking Woodstock,"" a tale about the 1969 music festival. Tarantino told The New York Times that he's been hoping to do a war movie for years. ""You've got to make a movie about something, and I'm a film guy, so I think in terms of genres,"" he said. However, the maker of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown"" added, that doesn't mean what he ends up with resembles what he started with: ""It's simply the spark that starts the fire."" ""Inglourious Basterds"" was inspired by a 1978 Italian film that starred Bo Svenson (""Walking Tall, Part 2"") and football player-turned-actor Fred Williamson (""Black Caesar""). Tarantino's film, which he characterized to the Times as ""not a remake,"" stars Brad Pitt and Mike Myers. Cannes has been good to Tarantino; he won the Palme d'Or for ""Pulp Fiction"" 15 years ago. Buzz has been high on ""Basterds"" since Tarantino announced the project several years ago. ""Taking Woodstock,"" the new film by ""Brokeback Mountain"" director Lee, is based on the book by Elliot Tiber, whose hotelier parents owned a musical festival permit in Bethel, New York, where Woodstock was held. The cast includes Liev Schreiber, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Emile Hirsch, Imelda Staunton and Eugene Levy as Max Yasgur, on whose farm the festival was finally held. Other films in competition include Lars von Trier's ""Antichrist,"" Jane Campion's ""Bright Star"" and Pedro Almodovar's ""Broken Embraces.""  Gallery: Some of Cannes' recent winners Â» . But this year's Cannes festival is attracting plenty of attention for its out-of-competition films as well. The festival is opening with ""Up,"" the latest animated work from Pixar. ""That sort of breaks convention to open with what is, basically, a fancy cartoon,"" Rozen said. Also at Cannes will be Heath Ledger's last film, ""The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus."" The Oscar-winning ""Dark Knight"" actor died during the making of the Terry Gilliam film; Gilliam managed to complete it by doing some rewriting and casting other actors -- including Jude Law, Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp -- to play Ledger's part. Despite the interest in seeing Ledger, the film is still struggling to find a buyer, though Entertainment Weekly recently reported that a Los Angeles screening went over well. Cannes, which also functions as a huge film marketplace, may widen the net in attracting distributors. But much of the fun from Cannes comes from the films that emerge from nowhere. Recent winners of the Palme d'Or include 2000's ""Dancer in the Dark,"" which established singer Bjork as an actress, and ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,"" a Romanian film that ended up topping many critics' lists in 2007. ""One thing that always surprises me is that some of the films you have the lowest expectations for turn out to be terrific, and sometimes the bigger films turn out to be disappointments,"" Rozen said.","Quentin Tarantino's new film, ""Inglourious Basterds,"" playing Cannes .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Her name was Margaret. She had an answer for everything, even questions I didn't ask her. She dominated team meetings, nearly jumping out of her chair with ""Look at me!""--type comments aimed directly at the boss. There are some tactics to help you survive team destroyers. The rest of us sitting there, jaws slack with amazement and disgust -- we were merely a load she had to carry on her back. His name was Mike, and he hadn't done a full day's work in years, but he sure knew how to draw us into his life of woe. One night at 10 p.m., I found myself finishing his report on deadline. He couldn't be there, he said, because his father was sick. By that point, I wasn't even sure he had a father. But there I was, alone, frustrated, and exhausted, in a state of loathing for work so intense I wished I could ditch it all. Oprah.com: The truth about saying no at work . And that is exactly where a dysfunctional co-worker --or as I call them, an ""un-teammate"" -- can put you. It's a crying shame, because working alongside a good team player is one of life's most fulfilling experiences. She makes work enjoyable; she makes it feel like something bigger than a paycheck. Working with team destroyers, well, destroys all that. They slow work down; they sap its fun, trust, and creativity. And in the process, they invariably undermine the candid and energized debate that characterizes any successful group. So why aren't they all sent packing? In good organizations, most are --eventually. But many team destroyers are like workplace Houdinis, escaping damage to their own careers while making everyone else look bad. These are the people you must survive. But how? The answer depends on the type of un-teammate you're dealing with. Generally speaking, there are five: Boss Haters, Stars, Sliders, Pity Parties, and Self-Promoters. Each species has its own way of poisoning the environment and its own antidote. The first thing you can do is start with the assumption that virtually every team destroyer is an unhappy person. No one tries to damage co-workers, a team, or an entire organization without being a bit emotionally damaged themselves. Oprah.com: 6 signs you're in the wrong job . Boss haters, stars and sliders . Let's start with the boss haters -- you know the type. Harry will tell you his disdain for authority is a reasonable reaction to the tyranny of incompetent bosses. Elizabeth will tell you she refuses to be oppressed by corporate lackeys. Other Boss Haters have personal issues behind their nitpicking resistance to every directive from above. I once met a manager who told me, ""For a long time, I hated all my bosses because my father was a cruel authoritarian --I almost ruined my own career. Thank God I came to my senses."" Such conversion experiences are rare, however. Most Boss Haters persist, using every kind of subterfuge from eye-rolling to outright belligerence, until management loses patience and ousts them. Some Boss Haters are hard to extricate because of union rules or special skills. If that's your situation, your best approach as the peer of a Boss Hater is a freeze-out. Don't belabor Harry's resistance or try reasoning with Elizabeth. Simply isolate; refuse to listen to their ongoing complaints. Once they're cut off from the group, Boss Haters tend to lose their energy. Now for Stars. Make no mistake -- organizations could not survive without their results. Fortunately, many key players are Stars largely because they are the best kind of employee, inclusive and inspiring, but some Stars can develop into real bullies. My team at a consulting firm had to endure Chad, an articulate (and, yes, brilliant) economics major from M.I.T. whom our clients adored. (Like other people in this piece, his name has been changed.) Sensing he was untouchable, Chad would bulldoze his ideas through the team process and ridicule anyone who dared to disagree. Another group I worked with suffered through Gwen, a marketing ""guru"" who'd been stolen away from another firm to bestow her genius on us. She passively disrupted our discussions by not participating, her silence sending the message ""This nonsense is beneath me."" We didn't have much recourse. Few bosses want to hear nattering about a goose that's laying golden eggs. Your best option in terms of self-preservation is to accept Stars for the good they do and ignore the bad. I've seen only one other approach work, but it's hard to recommend. This technique involves playing to a Star's weakness -- the need for constant praise. As strange as it may seem, many Stars are deeply insecure and cannot receive enough ego stroking from bosses. Co-workers can play the same game, thereby drawing a Star back into the team process. But don't try this unless you really feel the love for your own Chad or Gwen; a phony intervention won't work. Sliders are former Stars, resting on their laurels and undermining their teams with apathy. Their unspoken excuse is ""I've proven my worth around here; I don't need to scramble anymore."" Take John Smith, a crusty old newsman who had won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting in Vietnam. I met him when we were both assigned to the same investigative team 20 years ago. The young reporters, myself included, fairly trembled in John's exalted presence, but within weeks, it became obvious to us that he had no interest in interviewing sources or late-night stakeouts. He preferred to sit around the office drinking coffee and telling war stories to his in-house fan club. Fast-forward to the end of the project: a front-page article under the byline -- you guessed it -- John Smith and the newspaper team. The editors knew John had done minimal work, but in the newspaper business, one way of keeping score is by the number of Pulitzer Prize winners on staff. My solution at the time was to moan and groan with my teammates about the injustice of it all. What a waste. Sliders will always live inside a protective bubble that no peer can pierce, because they deliver tangible value to an institution. Don't bother griping; instead, buck up and join the Slider's fan club, respecting him for contributions you can only imagine making. With that mind-set, you might even be able to turn your Slider into a mentor. To this day, I remember what John Smith taught me about reporting -- when I finally dumped my pointless indignation and asked him. Oprah.com: 10 ways to love your job right now . Pity parties and self-promoters . Pity Parties are those un-teammates who have an excuse for every act of inaction. Their computer melted down. Their elderly aunt came to visit or, like Mike, their father is sick. The most expert Pity Parties concoct long-running sympathy stories: bad backs, bad marriages, bad childcare, and so on. I don't want to sound harsh. Sometimes people really do need time off or special accommodations, but Pity Parties make an art form of wriggling out of responsibility, and you're left wondering if you're a heel for resenting them -- or a dupe for helping them. Your best strategy is to steer clear of Pity Parties and their appeals for help. You'll need to steel yourself to say no as often as humanly possible, even if they promise you, ""This is the very last time."" The line I ended up using with Mike was ""I'm in a bind too. Did you ask Rory for help?"" (Rory was our boss.) That response did not put an immediate end to Mike's ways; he went looking for other enablers. Still, it sent the signal -- both to Mike and my co-workers -- that I would not cut side deals. When enough of us started saying no, he left us alone. The final form of dysfunctional coworker is the Self-Promoter, like ""Look at Me"" Margaret, who saw every team assignment as an opportunity for personal advancement. In their pursuit of fame and glory, Self-Promoters occasionally sabotage peers. I once had a co-worker who used staff meetings, with the boss in attendance, to vociferously attack every other writer's work as ""hackneyed"" or, her favorite word, ""superficial."" If we pushed back against her critiques, she accused us of being competitive with her. There was no way to win. Usually, that's the case with Self-Promoters. They can drub you with their narcissistic ""logic"" -- they're right; you're just defensive -- and wear you down with their egocentric career campaign. But they can't smite everyone forever. After a few promotions, the moment comes for every Self-Promoter when they need a favor or help, and there is no one left to ask. So keep your head down and wait. And most important, keep overdelivering, even if your local weasel tries to steal all the credit. Self-Promoters might get more praise than they deserve, but in any good organization, real team players ultimately get what they deserve: respect and admiration. If you have any doubt about that, you might ask Margaret. I stopped working with her years ago, but I recently heard that the company asked her to move on -- just when she thought she had achieved the position of vice president, the goal she'd been gunning for. Colleagues tell me she interviewed for jobs for a year afterward, but with less than enthusiastic references, she couldn't land one. She ended up going out on her own as a consultant, and I just learned she's a tireless and admired mentor for young women in a leadership program in Boston. I don't know what she tells them, but I can venture a guess: Do everything you can at work to be a great team player, and learn to survive (and thrive) around those who are not.

"(CNN) -- Financial crisis-stricken Iceland formally applied for European Union membership on Friday, a day after lawmakers narrowly backed a government plan to take the island nation into the economic and political bloc. Icelandic PM Johanna Sigurdardottir pledged to take Iceland into the EU during April's election campaign. A copy of the application was submitted to the Swedish government, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, Iceland's Ministry for Foreign Affairs confirmed in a statement. Iceland's economy was devastated by the collapse of the island's banking system last year, leading to the resignation of the country's government. In elections in April, center left leader Johanna Sigurdardottir was elected prime minister after pledging to take Iceland into the EU. On Thursday, Iceland's parliament, the Althing, voted in favor of the government plan by 33 votes to 28 with two abstentions. ""This is a historic day for Iceland,"" Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson said in a statement. ""As a European nation already deeply integrated into European structures... we now look forward to taking the next logical step, in close cooperation with our European partners."" Welcoming Iceland's application, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said: ""The decision of the Icelandic Parliament is a sign of the vitality of the European project and indicative of the hope that the European Union represents. Iceland is a European country with long and deep democratic roots."" Iceland already benefits from a free trade arrangement with European Union member states, latterly as a participating member of the European Economic Area, which was established in 1994, and formerly through a bilateral free trade agreement with the EEC, the EU's predecessor. But Icelanders have traditionally been skeptical of the benefits of full EU membership, fearing that they would lose some of their independence as a small state within a larger political entity. At present three other states in southeastern Europe -- Croatia, FYR Macedonia and Turkey -- are candidate countries for EU membership. ""I am pleased that the EU's enlargement agenda may soon extend to Europe's north-western corner as well, with Iceland, a country with deep democratic traditions, in addition to our continued commitment to South East Europe,"" said Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn.","Iceland applies for EU membership after lawmakers back government plan .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A hearing to consider who will raise Michael Jackson's three children has been delayed another week, while lawyers work to avoid a court battle over custody. Debbie Rowe said she married Michael Jackson to avoid the taboo of having childrien out of wedlock. The delay -- the third one this month -- was announced Friday afternoon by a Los Angeles County Superior Court spokesman. Debbie Rowe, Jackson's ex-wife and mother of his two oldest children, has not publicly revealed whether she will challenge Katherine Jackson, his 79-year-old mother, for custody or visitation rights. Katherine Jackson gained temporary guardianship of her son's children soon after his death last month. The two women have been working to ""privately and amicably resolve"" the matter since Jackson's death, a Jackson family lawyer said. Rowe's lawyer said this week that she was not asking the Jackson family for more money in exchange for dropping a possible custody challenge. A close friend of Rowe said she has been grieving Jackson's death -- grief made more painful by paparazzi hounding her and media reports vilifying Rowe by depicting her as a heartless woman who would trade her kids for cash. ""Debbie's a very caring, wonderful, warm person,"" said Marc Schaffel, who met first met Rowe when he worked for Jackson. ""She's a very humble person. People, you know, don't give her credit that she was a friend of Michael's for over 30 years."" Jackson and Rowe met when she was working as a nursing assistant in the Beverly Hills office of Jackson's dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein. Rowe said in a 2003 interview, later obtained by ABC News, that she became closer to Jackson in 1996 when she consoled him after his brief marriage to Lisa Marie Presley ended. ""He was upset because he really wanted to be a dad,"" Rowe said. ""I said, 'So, be a dad.' He looked at me puzzled. That is when I looked at him and said. 'Let me do this. I want to do this. You have been so good to me. You are such a great friend. Please let me do this. You need to be a dad, and I want you to be.'"" She told the interviewer they married in 1996 only to ""prevent some of the taboo of a child out of wedlock."" While Schaffel would not say if their relationship was sexual, he said Rowe had ""a true, true love there for Michael."" Their first child, Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., was born in February 1997. A daughter, Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson, was born the next year. Details of how the children were conceived and who was the biological father have been closely guarded amid much public speculation. The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got a $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents. Jackson later agreed to additional support. Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children. A California appeals court later ruled her rights were improperly terminated, opening the door to a possible custody battle. Rowe claimed in the 2003 interview that she still had ""some influence"" over how Jackson raised the children, citing his practice of covering their faces in public as her idea. ""That was my request, not his,"" she said. ""I am the one who's terrified. I am the one who's seen the notes that someone's going to take his children,"" she said. She said the children don't call her ""mom"" because she did not want them to. ""It's not that they're not my children, but I had them because I wanted him to be a father,"" she said. Rowe, 50, lives on a farm in Palmdale, California, about 60 miles north of Los Angeles, where she breeds horses and dogs. ""She spends time with all of her horses and her dogs,"" Schaffel said. ""If one of her horses is sick, Debbie will stay up all night long caring for them. She'll sleep on the floor in the barn with a horse if he's not well. ""Debbie doesn't run out to all of the social events,"" he said. ""You don't see her shopping on Rodeo Drive. She's not hitting the hot spots. She's not trying to be in the limelight. Debbie is just as happy at home in her very modest, humble, horse ranch."" When Hollywood's paparazzi surrounded her outside a restaurant near her ranch earlier this month, she showed flashes of anger and frustration. ""Are you ready to fight for your kids?"" a photographer repeatedly shouted. ""Are you ready to get your butt kicked?"" she replied, as she walked through the swarm. Schaffel said Rowe wants privacy and she's ""just trying to go on with her life."" ""She doesn't react well with the paparazzi,"" he said. Rowe's lawyers have stepped up their efforts to bolster her public image by firing off warning letters and demanding retractions when they see reports they think are wrong. One letter sent Tuesday demanded the New York Post retract its report that Rowe had agreed to drop her custody claims for $4 million. ""Ms. Rowe has not accepted -- and will not accept -- any additional financial consideration beyond the spousal support she and Michael Jackson personally agreed to several years ago,"" Eric George said in the letter. ""Among the several contenders for overzealous and inaccurate sensationalism, the New York Post has now seized top honors,"" George wrote to the paper. ""It would be easier to identify those few background facts that are accurate than to catalog the number of blatant falsehoods in your story."" ""The Post stands by its story,"" New York Post Editor-in-Chief Col Allan told CNN. Rowe also filed a lawsuit this week against a woman who claimed in a TV interview to have e-mails from Rowe saying she didn't really want to raise the children. The suit asked that Rowe be given any money paid to the woman for the interview.

"(CNN) -- An air-supported roof over the Dallas Cowboys' practice field collapsed during a heavy thunderstorm Saturday afternoon, leaving 12 people injured, authorities said. An aerial view of the scene shows the Dallas Cowboys logo amid the ruins of the indoor practice facility. About 70 people, including more than two dozen of the team's rookies, were in the facility when it was blown down shortly before 3:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET), team officials said. Two or three suffered serious injuries, but none were believed to be in life-threatening condition Saturday night, said Dr. Paul Pepe, Dallas County's emergency medical services chief. CNN affiliate WFAA reported Cowboys special teams coach Joe DeCamillis, the son-in-law of former NFL head coach Dan Reeves, suffered a broken back. DeCamillis was seen on a stretcher wearing a neck brace. A line of heavy thunderstorms was moving through the Dallas area at the time, he said, but no other damage to buildings was reported, said Mike Adams, a dispatcher for the Irving, Texas, fire department.  Watch the roof collapse on players, coaches Â» . Arnold Payne, a photographer for  WFAA, was shooting the Cowboys' practice session when rain began falling ""tremendously hard."" ""I noticed the walls started to waver ... and then I noticed that the lights that were hanging from the ceiling started to sway, and it wouldn't stop,"" Payne told CNN. Shortly after that, he said, ""It was as if someone took a stick pin and hit a balloon.""  Watch Payne describe being inside when structure collpased Â» . Payne said Cowboys staff photographers were up in the metal framework beneath the canopy to film the practice session and ""actually rode the building down with the storm."" At least one was in surgery Saturday night, he said. ""There was nowhere for them to go, and it fell so fast -- it just collapsed as if it was being imploded,"" Payne said. Video from CNN affiliate WFAA showed the roof caving in during a heavy storm, sending players, coaches and a handful of reporters and photographers scrambling to escape. Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones told NBC that about 27 rookies from the NFL team and members of the team's coaching staff were inside the suburban Dallas facility at the time. ""They did not get good warning there, and the structure did collapse,"" Jones said, speaking from the Kentucky Derby in Louisville. ""We're assessing who's injured at this particular time.""

"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (CNN) -- Twenty well-behaved boys sit on the floor in two rows, quietly eating a humble lunch of flat bread, water and beans. The ""lost boys"" of Swat enjoy a humble lunch of flat bread, water and beans. Their hair is neatly combed and they are dressed in spotless Pakistani shalwar kamiz long shirts and baggy trousers. These boys are orphans, and they are lucky to be alive. ""Sir, it was very dangerous,"" explained 15-year-old Mohammad Nawaz. Last Friday, Nawaz and his friends escaped from Pakistan's Swat Valley after their orphanage ended up on the front-line of the government's war with the Taliban. When hostilities resumed in Swat two weeks ago, Pakistani soldiers from nearby barracks commandeered the roof of the four-story orphanage in Swat's district capital, Mingora, to use it as a lookout. They built sandbag bunkers on the roof, and buried landmines in the orphanage's playground. Then, Taliban militants laid siege to the building. Nawaz said ""many"" insurgents armed with rocket launchers and Kalashnikov assault rifles surrounded the orphanage.  Watch more on the boys' ordeal Â» . About 50 terrified orphans, accompanied by adult support staff, cowered in a back room on the ground floor. Shaken by the explosions and small-arms fire around their building, the older boys, some aged 16 and 17, tried to console the youngest children, some of whom are as young as seven. They were all crying. It wasn't until last Friday that the first batch of orphans were able to escape. ""We had to ride on the roof of a bus,"" said 16-year old Mohammad Yusuf, a soft-spoken teenager with the beginnings of a beard appearing on his chin. After a creeping, traffic-choked, three-hour drive from Mingora, the boys and their teachers begged for a ride from a passing vegetable truck. Yusuf said the boys rode the rest of the way to Peshawar sitting in the back of a truck on bags of peas, stopping only when the truckers had to remove the cargo to have it washed.  Watch more on the situation in the Swat Valley Â» . ""When the peas were washed and loaded again, we all got wet,"" said Yusuf, laughing. Now the boys are relatively safe and receiving some counseling from therapists at a shelter in Peshawar provided by another Pakistani charity organization, the Dost Foundation. The children have seen more then their share of violence during two years of intermittent fighting around the Swat Valley. When asked about the worst moment two boys immediately responded ""suicide bombers,"" making explosive gestures with their hands from their chests. Due to the orphanage's close proximity to a Pakistani army base in Mingora, the boys were often witnesses to the aftermath of Taliban attacks. In one incident a suicide bomber blew out all of the glass windows of the orphanage. Opinions were split among the boys about the Taliban. ""They want Islam,"" said Nawaz, referring to the Taliban's demand for the imposition of Islamic sharia law across Pakistan. The proposal resonates with many Pakistanis, who are frustrated with corruption in the country's judicial system. ""The Taliban dropped the price of public transport,"" Nawaz said, adding, ""Plus they used to help sort out traffic jams.""  Watch more on the refugee situation Â» . ""We are angry with the Taliban,"" argued Yusuf, the 16-year-old. ""There is no rule in Islam that allows you to behead someone."" Since the arrival of the boys in Pakistan's western city of Peshawar, social workers have been trying to help them relax. They spent the weekend playing cricket in the small yard of their half-way house, watching movies and on Sunday getting a tour of the city. Several boys said they were looking forward to seeing an airport for the first time in their lives. But orphanage director Muhammad Ali was wracked with worry about their future. Out of sight of the children, he broke down weeping. ""I am the father of these children,"" Ali said. ""This is not an orphanage, this is our home... now finished."" Ali spent the afternoon on Sunday desperately trying to call a final group of 24 boys who were trying to escape from Mingora. They left on foot, because the road out of Mingora was mined and there was a shortage of vehicles for the evacuation of refugees. Ali said the orphans, accompanied by adult administrators, had split into groups of five, with three older boys equipped with a cell phone and cash leading two younger boys. By nightfall, the orphans had walked for hours. They spent the night on the floor of a religious school outside Mingora, after authorities re-imposed a curfew in the Swat Valley. On Monday evening the children arrived exhausted and dirty in Peshawar after traveling more than 24 hours. One of their adult chaperones estimated they had to travel on foot for more then 20 miles before eventually finding vehicle transport to complete the journey. Administrators said one of the boys, named Ubaid, somehow became separated from the rest of the group, and ended up staying behind. They say he is back at the orphanage in Mingora, being cared for by the Pakistani soldiers stationed there. ""It was a long, chaotic journey and experience that I will never forget,"" said Imran Khan, one of the orphanage's wardens. He said he had spent part of the journey carrying on his back a boy with a spinal problem. ""Swat used to be known as paradise on earth,"" Khan said. ""Now it has become hell on earth."" More than 360,000 people have fled the conflict zone since May 2.","Boys flee their Swat Valley orphanage after Taliban attack their home .

"(MENTAL FLOSS) -- When we think of economic crises in America, two periods come to mind -- the Great Depression and whatever it is we're in the middle of right now. But the U.S. stock market has crashed more times than we'd like to admit. Historically, our economy has been brought to its knees by everything from greedy bankers to horse illnesses. Horses, cows, whales and a failed copper scheme caused economic panics earlier in U.S. history. So let's take a deep breath and remember that panics are just part of the American way of life. 1. The Panic of 1873: America stops horsing around . During the late 19th century, the American economy relied on horses the way it depends on gas today. Horses unloaded cargo from ports, transported goods from city to city, worked the farms, supported the army, and served as the emergency vehicles of choice. Without them, the American workforce would have ground to a halt. And that's exactly what happened in 1872, when an estimated 99 percent of all horses in America contracted equine influenza. The highly contagious strain started in Canada and spread through New England to the South in a matter of months, leaving horses across the country too weak to stand and coughing uncontrollably. Street buggies stopped running, paralyzing commerce in the cities. Railroads were stymied because trains run on coal -- coal that was hauled out of mines by horses. And as the horse flu spread, U.S. military troops had to go into battle on foot (they were fighting Apache Indians at the time). More tragically, a fire in Boston raged for three days because there were no horses to carry water. The flames destroyed more than 700 buildings, causing an estimated $73.5 million in damages and killing at least 20 people. The ""Great Epizootic,"" as it was called, spiraled out of control in less than a year. At the height of the panic, as many as 20,000 businesses failed, a third of all railroads went bankrupt, and unemployment spiked to almost 15 percent. The economy took nearly a decade to recover. Ironically, nearly all of the horses recuperated by the following spring. 2. The Winter of 1886: When the cows don't come home . During the second half of the 19th century, cattle ranches in the American West were thriving. From the Montana grasslands to the Texas prairie, ranches were attracting investors back East and across the pond in Europe. But by 1886, things were getting dicey. Overgrazing, coupled with a hot and dry summer, had left the plains almost bare. Then came the snow. Known as the ""Winter of Death,"" the following season saw one of the worst cold spells in recorded history. More than half the cattle in the West froze to death, unable to move in the thick snow. Ghoulish firsthand accounts describe the bodies of dead cows stretching for miles across the horizon. When the spring thaw and floods came, thousands of bloated corpses floated into the streams and rivers. Some ranchers quit the business entirely and didn't even bother to round up their surviving cattle. Mental Floss: Bold business scams that failed miserably . By the end of 1887, the disaster had wiped out more than half of the United States' western cattle and debilitated the national economy. Most cattle investors went bankrupt, and thousands of cowboys were left unemployed. But more than anything, the winter of 1886 put an end to all those turn-of-the-century, idyllic fantasies of open-range ranching in the Wild West. 3. The Panic of 1907: Captains of industry to the rescue! The Panic of 1907 started the way many panics do, with a greedy capitalist. Multimillionaire Augustus Heinze, who had made his fortune mining in Montana, believed he had enough control over the copper industry to corner the market. With the help of several major banks, he concocted a scheme to buy up all the shares of United Copper. But Heinze had overestimated his prowess, and the scheme failed, bringing down Heinze, United Copper, the banks, and many, many stockholders. Mental Floss: Who is Ponzi and what was his scheme? The debacle sent ripples of anxiety throughout the market, and investors started pulling their money out of banks altogether. After one of New York City's biggest trusts went under, panic ensued, and the stock market collapsed. At the time, there were no central banks in place, so the federal government had no means of bailing out businesses or injecting cash into the economy. It just stood by, idly waiting for a hero to save the day. Amazingly, one did. James Pierpont Morgan, banker extraordinaire, rescued the American economy. He propped up many of the failing banks in New York by twisting the arms of other financiers, and he assuaged investors' fears by backing up the market with his own vast cash reserves. Before long, Wall Street was on the mend. The government also learned its lesson. With the panic resolved, it created the Federal Reserve, ensuring that it could buttress the economy during hard times. Since then, the government has taken a more active role in financial matters and relied less on the kindness of robber barons. 4. Whale of a Crisis: The collapse of America's first oil industry . During the early 19th century, America was one of the top oil-producing countries in the world. But it wasn't petroleum the nation was exporting; it was whale oil. By the mid-1800s, the high-risk, high-profit business was the fifth-largest industry in the United States. Mental Floss: 6 things you probably don't know about oil . At its height, the American whaling industry produced more than 10 million gallons of oil a year and sold it for $1.77 a gallon (about $35 per gallon today). Better still, an American fleet of 1,000 ships had exclusive access to the North Atlantic territories, which ensured profits. What could have stopped such a juggernaut of an industry? For one thing, other sources of oil. In 1846, Canadian geologist Abraham Gesner developed a technique for distilling kerosene from petroleum, and within a few decades, kerosene had replaced whale oil as the most popular fuel for lamps. Another reason for the decline was that the whales were dying off. The enthusiastic slaughter throughout the 1800s drove some whale species to extinction and put others on the brink. With so few left to hunt, the cost of whaling became prohibitively expensive. The final blow to whalers came during the harsh winter of 1871, when the North Atlantic ice trapped and crushed the bulk of the American fleet. Although American consumers didn't suffer as the country switched from whale oil to petroleum, coastal towns in New England and the Mid-Atlantic languished, and shipbuilders and fishermen found themselves out of work. By the time of the Civil War, whaling ships had become so worthless that Union soldiers loaded a fleet of them with stones and sank them into Charleston harbor. The hope was to blockade the South from the port, but when the plan didn't work, the ships were no great loss. America's first oil industry had been tapped out.

"(CNN) -- July is on track to be the deadliest month yet for British troops supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. Air Chief Marshall Jock Stirrup says the sacrifices of British forces are worth it. So far, 15 British servicemen have died in Afghanistan this month, mostly in connection with Operation Panther's Claw, the British-led offensive in Helmand province that is mirroring a similar operation by U.S. Marines in the same area. Britain's deadliest month in Afghanistan so far has been September 2006, when 19 died -- 14 in a single incident, the crash of a Royal Air Force plane near Kandahar. The sudden spike in British deaths has triggered an outcry in the United Kingdom over the mission there and whether it will be successful. ""Every casualty is sad, every casualty is deeply felt by us in the military. I mean, they are part of our military family. The losses, of course, are felt most by the real families of those involved and the bereavement is terrible,"" Air Chief Marshall Jock Stirrup, the chief of defense staff for Great Britain, told CNN in an exclusive interview. But earlier, he pointed out, at the same time the 15 British troops had been killed, at least 197 Taliban forces had been confirmed killed in fighting.  Watch questions being asked about the sacrifices Â» . ""These casualties are pretty one-sided. Sad though our losses are, they are very small compared to the losses that the enemy is taking,"" he said in an interview at the British Embassy. Stirrup, whose position is equivalent to Adm. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the government wants people to know that the sacrifices are worth it. ""This is a military operation and on military operations, you engage in fighting. That's why we have militaries and, sadly, you take casualties. The real issue is, first of all, are we getting something of sufficient strategic benefit to justify the price that our people are paying?"" he said. ""Secondly, are we doing everything we can to ensure that we achieve that strategic benefit with the minimum possible number of casualties? And those, I think, are the key arguments in which we have to engage."" The British military has been criticized for using vehicles that cannot withstand the blast of a roadside bomb. Stirrup told CNN that the British troops are conducting missions that forces them out of protective vehicles. ""You can't engage with the population of Helmand from inside several inches of steel. You have actually to get out on the ground,"" Stirrup said. ""Our people have to get out there, they have to engage with the population and close with the enemy and that, alas, exposes them to risks and sometimes those risks materialize. Have we got the right equipment? Well, we have excellent equipment on the ground and our troops will tell you that."" But Stirrup admits that while the United Kingdom is constantly updating the equipment sent to Afghanistan, the results are delayed. ""It takes time for industry to produce the new equipment. It's ordered, it's being delivered, but it's delivered over time, so it's always that gap, if you like, between identifying that change requirement and being able to deliver it on the ground,"" Stirrup said. He said there is one British serviceman who won't have to worry about the dangers of Afghanistan: Prince William. ""Prince William is second in line to the throne. That produces certain difficulties to his employment in a combat environment,"" he said. ""I'm not going to say one way or the other what we will do for the future. What I will say is that he is training at the moment to be a search-and-rescue helicopter pilot, which is a tremendously demanding occupation. It's professionally demanding. It also is at times pretty hazardous, and I think he is going to find that challenge enough and reward enough in the short term."" The prince's younger brother, Prince Harry, served in Afghanistan for about 10 weeks until news of his deployment was leaked by a U.S. Web site. He was then pulled out to keep his unit from being targeted specifically aimed at him.","15 servicemen have died this month, compared with 19 in September 2006 .

"(CNN) -- A second person has died during construction for Madonna's upcoming concerts in Marseilles, France, authorities said Friday. Firefighters leave the Stade Velodrome stadium in Marseille after the accident on Thursday. The second fatality was a 32-year-old British citizen, the British Foreign Office and a high-ranking police official said. It was not clear whether the person was a man or woman, but the next of kin had been informed, the Foreign Office said. A 53-year-old French man was killed Thursday when a crane collapsed at the venue, a fire department spokesman in the southern French city said. A third person was in critical condition, said Alexandre Lanzalavi, a spokesman for Marseille Hospital. Two other people were in hospital and required surgery, and seven others were treated and released, Lanzalavi said. Madonna said Thursday that she was ""devastated"" to hear about the death. ""My prayers go out to those who were injured and their families, along with my deepest sympathy to all those affected by this heartbreaking news,"" Madonna said in a statement issued by her representative, Liz Rosenberg. At least one Madonna show had been canceled, Rosenberg told CNN. The accident happened when a crane collapsed while lifting a large metallic truss -- a structure from which lights hang -- into place, Lt. Thierry Delorme of the French Navy told CNN. In Marseille, the fire department is a part of the Navy. An investigation has been launched into the cause of the collapse, he said. Some 27 fire engines and 80 firefighters responded to the emergency when the accident occurred about 5:15 p.m. (11:15 a.m. ET). Madonna was to play the first of five concerts for her ""Sticky and Sweet"" tour at the 60,000-seat Stade Velodrome on Sunday. The singer was in Udine, Italy, when she heard the news, Rosenberg said.

"(CNN) -- For most people in the world, freedom of religion is of such paramount importance and warrants all the legal and constitutional respect and protection. It is fair to say that this concept has been imbedded in numerous people's mind such that any accusation of its violation almost automatically triggers waves of condemnation. A woman reads a state media newspaper Saturday in Beijing with coverage of Tibet. That may explain why so many people, especially in the West, are so agitated if they conclude that the Tibetan question boils down to freedom of religion, or, even worse, to its violation. However, their agitation will be significantly muted if they are reminded that, while freedom of religion is of paramount importance, it is equally important to keep church and state separate, lest disasters and tragedies ensue. In this light, it is important to be reminded that what those Tibetan diaspora outside of China want to restore is a unique and anachronistic system which mixed church and state into such a lethal institution: clergy and nobles accounting for barely 5 percent of the population ruled over millions of serfs who were dealt with as chattels and animals, with no single iota of human rights. That was not ancient history, that was Tibet barely 50 years ago.  Watch a recent history of Tibet Â» . Anyone in a major Western country advocating freedom of religion to the disregard of separation of church and state will be either marginalized or held with ultra suspicion. If a clergy does so in the United States, his church will lose tax exemption and all the other privileges of a religious institution. Mankind knows too well that mixing church and state together can be a recipe for disasters, especially in a diverse and heterogeneous society.  Watch Victor Gao discuss Tibet with CNN Â» . Therefore, what looks as a matter of freedom of religion to many people in the West is viewed by China more importantly as a matter of separation of church and state. But why such sharp contrasts? Many people in the West eagerly embrace the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader. China would wish His Holiness were indeed nothing but a spiritual leader, otherwise many problems would have been much simpler to resolve. What looks like a spiritual leader to many in the West is viewed by China as less a spiritual leader than a political activist with dangerous political motivations.  Watch an online address by the Dalai Lama Â» . But why such sharp contrasts? It goes without saying that religious differences need to be handled with extra care and sensitivity. Human history has been plagued with wars and conflicts either in the name of religion or in the excuse of religion with ulterior motives. Therefore, whenever religion is touched upon, normally ""your religion for you and my religion for me"" is a good guidance for avoiding calamities. If anyone in the West wants to convert to Tibetan Buddhism and revere the Dalai Lama, or the 14th Dalai Lama to be more accurate, as not only a spiritual leader, but as the reincarnation of all the previous 13 Dalai Lamas and, more amazingly, as the reincarnation of the great God Avalokite Svara, China, rather than having any grudges against him, probably would treat him with all the due respect as a true believer. But China views many Western sympathizers of the Dalai Lama, especially those Western politicians, as having ulterior political motives aimed at infringing upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. But why such sharp contrasts? The Tibetan issue has become a major divider and sensationalizer in the world today. But if reason prevails over passion, the following simple truths may be shocking to learn for those much agitated people: . Therefore, let's avoid mixing apples with oranges, or oranges with apples. Let's avoid any double talk. If one is using ""Free Tibet"" as an expedient alternative for ""Independent Tibet,"" then don't complain about China's wrath at his real motivation. If one is advocating freedom of religion to the disregard of the separation of church and state, then don't complain about being accused by China as a hypocrite. If one is mesmerized by the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader or even the reincarnation of God, he should not accuse China for being cool-headed enough to see through the religious veil which covers major political agendas. For those who warn China that, being in his mid-70s, Dalai Lama's earthly years may be numbered and his eventual passing away may turn Tibetan diaspora and some Tibetans in China into violence and terror, the word of caution is that, now that the whole world is caught in deteriorating financial and economic crisis, any attempt to use violence and terror to further damage global stability and security will be condemned as a public enemy and dealt with as such. It is ludicrous to fancy that any threat of violence or terror will bent the will of China. On the other hand, China needs to continue the dialogue with the Dalai Lama and his followers both at home and abroad, and seek a mutually convenient solution. From China's perspective, the bottom line is loud and clear: if the Dalai Lama is indeed nothing but a spiritual leader, then the solution can be quick and easy; if the Dalai Lama is wearing the spiritual hat for political purposes, then nothing will be easy. As for me, ever since my first trip to Tibet, I have been telling everyone I know that you need to visit Tibet, at least once in your lifetime, because Tibet is so unique, so extraordinary, so magnificent, so holy, that not visiting Tibet may be an eternal loss and regret.","Victor Gao: Important to consider church-state separation on Tibet debate .

"SARGODA, Pakistan (CNN) -- Mohammed Iqbal said he has been told by his landlord to pay up on debts and is left with a choice facing others in this impoverished corner of Pakistan: Sell your children or a kidney. This man's landlord forced him to pay off money he borrowed for his children's medical bills. For the 50-year-old Iqbal, there is only one option. Despite a law passed in late 2007 banning transplants for money, he has decided to sell his kidney and has already been for pre-operation tests. The sale will net him between $1,100 and $1,600. ""What's incredible here is the law that bans the operation he's going to go through came into place in 2007,"" said CNN's Nic Robertson. ""He's still able to go to a doctor, the doctors given him advice, that's what he has to do under law... He's going to make money out of it 100,000-150,000 rupees, and that is absolutely illegal. Yet, in just a few days, he's expecting to sell his kidney."" Iqbal was not alone in facing this difficult decision. Others in Pakistan's rural heartland have opted to sell their kidneys. One of them was Rab Nawas, who was deep in debt about a year ago to his landlord after borrowing money to pay for his wedding and to cover medical bills for his wife and six children. He, too, faced the choice: sell his children, his wife or a kidney.  See photos of Pakistan's impoverished kidney donors Â» . ""I am helpless. Should I sell my children? Should I go sell my children? So, it's better I sell my kidney. I had to return the money,"" said Nawas, who now bears a foot-long scar that wraps around from his back to his belly and is too weak to work the same hours he could before.  Watch Nawas show his operation scar Â» . People bearing the tell-tale scar of an organ removal in the villages around the farm where Nawas works are not hard to find. At one point, there were about 2,000 transplants a year -- with 1,500 of them going to what the government said were so-called ""transplant tourists."" The 2007 law was aimed at ending Pakistan's dubious status as one of the world's leading organ bazaars. Nawas sold his kidney after the law was passed and said the procedure was performed at the Rawalpindi Kidney Center in the northern city of Rawalpindi. When he went to the Rawalpindi center, after CNN asked him to show where the procedure was done, he said a doctor told him they did not have a record of his operation because they destroy such records when a patient leaves. The Rawalpindi clinic -- which prior to the law was a leading user of purchased kidneys -- told CNN that it abides by the law and does not get involved in deals between kidney donors and recipients. ""Standing there it's hard for me to fully understand the courage it took for him to make the journey. In this country, he has few rights, and even less security,"" said CNN's Robertson.","A law passed in late 2007 bans selling organs for money .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI had surgery on his right wrist Friday after he broke it in a fall, the Vatican said. Pope Benedict XVI arrives at a resort in northern Italy's Val d'Aosta region Monday. He broke his wrist Thursday. The pope left the hospital Friday afternoon and was returning to his summer home in Italy's Val d'Aosta region, spokesman Father Federico Lombardi told CNN. Doctors administered local anesthesia and put the pope's wrist in a cast, Lombardi said, adding the procedure was minor. ""There is no particular reason to cause alarm,"" Lombardi said. The pope, 82, fell Thursday night in his room in Val d'Aosta, a mountainous region of northwestern Italy, the Vatican said. The pope arrived there Monday. The pope ""tripped or slipped in his room,"" Lombardi said. ""It was dark, in the middle of the night. It was not due to dizziness. The fact that the Holy Father waited to go to the hospital shows that it was not serious."" He was taken to the hospital in the region's central town of Aosta on Friday morning after celebrating his daily private Mass, the Vatican said. Benedict's schedule for the coming days must still be confirmed, but Lombardi said he believed the pope will be able to hold his weekly Sunday Angelus from his summer home this weekend.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. military is distributing pamphlets in eastern Afghanistan in an effort to find a soldier who has been missing for more than two weeks, the military said Thursday. A soldier mans a weapon at the rear of a U.S. Army helicopter over Afghanistan in May. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for kidnapping the soldier, who has not been identified, along with three Afghan soldiers. All went missing on June 30 in southeastern Afghanistan. The military believes the soldier may have been moved to various locations, including across the border into Pakistan, U.S. military officials said. There are two versions of the pamphlets, which are in the Pashto language and were made available to CNN by U.S. Forces Afghanistan. One shows the image of an American soldier shaking hands in a group of kids with the message, ""One of our American guests is missing. Return the guest to his home. Call us at ..."" and lists a phone number. The other shows a U.S. soldier kicking down a door, and then an outstretched hand with the superimposed image of a soldier, his head and arms drooping, and the words, ""If you do not release the U.S. soldier then ... you will be hunted,"" Capt. Elizabeth Mathias, a U.S. military spokeswoman, said Thursday. Soldiers have posted and handed out the pamphlets across Ghazni and Paktia provinces over the past 24 hours, Mathias said. Days after the soldier went missing, a senior U.S. military official said, he and the three missing Afghan soldiers were captured by low-level militants and then quickly ""sold"" to the clan and network led by warlord Siraj Haqqani, who is believed to be deeply involved in the action. The Haqqani clan operates on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistani border and is well known to the U.S. military. The soldier apparently left his small outpost on his own on June 30 with no apparent means of defending himself, the official said. Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said the U.S. soldier visited a military post in the Yousaf Khel district in Paktika province, got drunk, and was ambushed while returning to his car. Sangeen said the soldier was taken to a safe place. Paktika and Paktia provinces are adjacent. CNN could not independently verify Sangeen's claims. A source with the U.S. military denied the claim that the soldier was drunk. ""The Taliban are known for lying, and what they are claiming [is] not true,"" the source said.","Taliban says it kidnapped U.S. soldier, who has not been identified .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Fight police misconduct with a cell phone, the NAACP says. The century-old civil rights organization has launched an online reporting system that lets users upload cell phone images of alleged police abuses. The Rapid Report System also lets users send text messages and e-mails about alleged misconduct. ""We know that most of police officers around the nation are excellent public servants. But the few who violate people's rights are often not held accountable,"" said Benjamin Jealous, president and CEO of the NAACP. ""Research has shown that there are many barriers to reporting incidents of police misconduct, including intimidation at police departments and a lack of trust in the integrity of the system, among other reasons. This breakdown leads to an absence of public safety and a deterioration of the quality of life in many communities of color."" The NAACP unveiled the online system Monday at its national convention in New York City. Users can post images from their cell phones or online. Cell phone footage has repeatedly helped spotlight alleged police misconduct in recent years. The fatal shooting of an unarmed man in Oakland, California, on New Year's Day made headlines and spread across the Internet partly because of cell phone video. The killing sparked large protests in Oakland and led to a murder charge against the transit officer.","NAACP unveils new program to allow people to report alleged police misconduct .

"(CNN)  -- Comedian Joan Rivers and real estate mogul Donald Trump -- that's a twosome never known for mincing their words. Joan Rivers appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Monday night and explained her explosive confrontations. Trump selected Rivers as this season's winner of ""The Celebrity Apprentice,"" and they appeared on ""Larry King Live"" Monday night, full of their classic candor. Among the topics covered: Rivers' long-running war of words with runner-up Annie Duke, her dust-up and make-up with Clint Black and the ""reason"" she is against same-sex marriage. And the Donald explains why Rivers had what it took to emerge the winner. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: Donald, was it a tough decision? Donald Trump: Well, it was. Joan fully understands it was a very, very tight race. And Annie [Duke] was terrific and Joan was terrific. In the end, I decided to go with Joan. She displayed tremendous courage. She really took a lot of abuse over the course of 14 weeks. King: Joan, in last night's finale, you beat poker champion Annie Duke. You and Annie were still at each other up until the final moments. Let's take a look. [King shows a video clip from ""The Celebrity Apprentice""] . Annie Duke: I do not know a boardroom in this country where someone would be allowed to say that someone would spit on the ground and drown their mother in it, where someone would be allowed to call their friends Mafia, where someone would be allowed to say that someone is worse than Hitler. If that happened in a real office... Joan Rivers: You're not worse than Hitler ... Duke: ...in a real boardroom. Rivers: Hitler never had PMS. Duke: This is what I'm saying. If it happened in a real boardroom, she would have to be fired or that would be actionable. Rivers: ... I have run a business for 20 years honorably. I have never fired anybody. I am the Number One jewelry business on television, with honor. [End of video clip] . King: Oh, boy. Rivers: Yes, oh boy. Trump: And, Larry, that was the nice part.  Watch Larry King's interview with Rivers and Trump Â» . King: Joanny, where did you come up with that 'worse than Hitler' crack? Rivers: Oh, I don't know. You know, you're always saying things. Hitler is the worst villain in the world. So when you really get furious at someone, you say, 'Oh, you're a female Hitler' or something, you know? It's just an expression. But I stand behind it. King: What did she do to you? Rivers: She was very duplicitous ... there was so much mud-slinging, which I'm not going to go into. I was told she said she wished I would die; she said I was a cancer. King: What did you make of that squabble, Donald? Trump: Well, I liked it very much. ... Especially this morning, when the ratings came in, because it was a ratings bonanza last night for NBC. King: What does Joanny get now? Trump: She got $250,000 plus she raised hundreds of thousands more during the course of the 14 weeks. But she gets $250,000. That goes to God's Love We Deliver, which is a great charity in New York. King: What surprised you about this contest? Trump: Well, I was just impressed with the intelligence, with the energy and verve that Joan had. I mean, Joan's energy was beyond everybody else's. And she wasn't necessarily the youngest person on the panel. King: Joan, what surprised you about this experience? Rivers: How it became so much more than a television game or a show. It became absolutely something I wanted to do. It was like I was going to win for my charity. King: What got you so emotionally involved, not just with Annie, other contestants? Rivers: Larry, I play totally full-out. And you get very worn down. It's all these weeks and weeks of getting up at 5:30 in the morning, working until 11:00 at night, no assistants to help you. You're out there on the firing line. And, you know, the differences arise and show very quickly. You know who's good, you know who's bad, you know who's a liar, you know who's lazy, you know who's brilliant, you know who's a good worker. And after a while, you just play -- it becomes ""Lord of the Flies."" King: Joan, by the way, written a Web exclusive for us about her ""Celebrity Apprentice"" win. Click here for Joan Rivers' blog, exclusively on CNN.com . King: Do you think you'll ever make up with Annie? Rivers: Well, I went over afterward; I went over to congratulate her, and I made her stand up. ... Nobody lost last night, for God's sake. No one heard of Annie Duke before this show. Now everyone's heard of her. Her charity made $700,000. ... And what did upset me was on the way out, her whole group gave us the finger and booed. And I thought that was .. not good. Not good. King: Why does this get so dramatic? Rivers: Because it's ""Lord of the Flies."" You have no sleep. King: Weren't you and Clint Black kind of mad at each other for a while and now it's OK? Rivers: Oh, yes. Clint is a chauvinist. My joke is now he wouldn't even let his wife have Equal in her coffee. You know, that's Clint. But Clint is Clint. You get very angry at him, but at least you know that's Clint. You know what's going to be dealt to you. King: What did you learn from doing this? Rivers: So many people in this country are counted out from the age of 60. When I walked in, I looked them all over, I thought: 'I can take you all with one behind my back at 75.' King: Did you expect to win? Rivers: Truly, no. Donald plays it so close and so intelligently. I did not know until they called out her name. I really thought they were going to say, Joan you're wonderful, but you're too emotional and blah, blah, blah. And Annie raised so much money -- which, indeed, she did. I was in shock and thrilled. Rivers: Can I say one thing quickly? King: Quick. Rivers: Gay marriage, I am so against it because all my gay friends are out. And if they get married, it will cost me a fortune in gifts.","Joan Rivers infuriated ""Apprentice"" rival Annie Duke over comparison to Hitler .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The defense secretary will not ban smoking by troops in war zones despite a recommendation to do so by a Pentagon-commissioned study. Defense Secretary Robert Gates says he does not want to compound stress in combat zones by banning smoking. Secretary Robert Gates' decision stems from concern about the stress troops face, said his spokesman. ""We are fighting two wars right now, using a force that we are demanding more of than we ever have before. They are under enormous stress and strain, and the secretary does not want to compound that stress by taking away from them one of the few outlets they have to relieve that stress,"" Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Wednesday. A new study commissioned by the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs recommends a complete ban on tobacco, which would end tobacco sales on military bases and prohibit smoking by anyone in uniform -- including combat troops in the thick of battle. According to the study, tobacco use impairs military readiness in the short term. Over the long term, it can cause serious health problems, including lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. The study also says smokeless tobacco use can lead to oral and pancreatic cancer. Morrell said that Gates has not seen the report and will consider the recommendations to move towards a goal of a smoke-free military. ""There may be things we can do to try to move towards that goal. But he has been very clear to me, up front, that one of the things he is not prepared to do is to restrict the use of tobacco products in combat zones,"" Morrell said. Anti-smoking activist Richard Daynard said Gates' decision was logical. But he predicted that, as smoking is banned on military bases outside combat zones, ""then the problem over time will resolve itself, even in combat zones."" The founder of the Tobacco Products Liability Project likened the situation to that which prevailed during the 1980s, when smoking aboard U.S. commercial airlines was banned. ""There was an exception for the cockpit, at least on some airlines, on the theory that you probably don't want your pilot, if he's hooked on nicotine, to be cold-turkey while he's trying to navigate your plane."" But, he said, the exception has been phased out. CNN's Adam Levine and Tom Watkins contributed to this story.","No ban despite recommendation to do so in Pentagon-commissioned study .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- In the enchantingly original and romantic (500) Days of Summer, Summer (Zooey Deschanel) is a girl -- capricious, alluring, and not entirely knowable -- and Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the greeting-card writer who convinces himself that she's ""better than the girl of my dreams."" Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel fall in love -- for a time -- in ""(500) Days of Summer."" Five hundred days is the duration of their relationship, but the movie presents those days out of order, as an impish romantic flipbook, so that we keep skipping forward and back -- from, say, day 8 to day 154. Most romantic comedies have half a dozen situations at best: Meet Cute, Infatuation, Pop Song Montage, Contrived Mix-Up, Angry Breakup, and Final Clinch. ""(500) Days of Summer"" is about the many unclassifiable moments in between. Director Marc Webb, working from Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber's witty script, stages each scene as a vivid snapshot memory, and his sense of play is boundless. The film leaps in a heartbeat from the furtive glances (and shared fixation on the Smiths) that ignite an office love affair to a rooftop-party reconciliation that plays out, via split screen, in two simultaneous versions (how the hero wants it to be and how it happens) to a morning-after-the-first-sex saunter that evolves, with joyful hilarity, into a musical number scored to ""You Make My Dreams."" This has to be the first movie ever to give equal props to Morrissey and Hall & Oates. ""(500) Days"" is like a mood ring cued to the ups, downs, and confusions of modern love. It's a Gen-Y ""Annie Hall"" made by a new-style Wes Anderson who uses his cleverness for humanity instead of postmodern superiority. None of it would work, though, without such lived-in performances. Deschanel makes the lovely, sensuous Summer just precocious enough to know what she wants without coming out and saying it, and Gordon-Levitt, with his junior Springsteenian chin jut, lets you read every glimmer of hope, pain, lust, and befuddlement beneath his nervy facade. It's a feat of star acting, and it helps make ""(500) Days"" not just bitter or sweet but everything in between. EW Grade: A . CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Ramin Ostadhosseini needed to vent, and this gathering seemed the place to do it. Teens at Camp Ayandeh learn how to blend their parents' history and culture with their contemporary lifestyles. ""I get Raymond, Roman and sometimes Ramen noodles,"" he told the circle, describing how non-Iranians butcher his name. This group felt his pain. Here, sprawled out on a manicured lawn at Emory University were dozens of youths attending a weeklong summer camp designed to generate discussion on what it means to be Iranian-American. Like many attending Camp Ayandeh -- or ""future"" in Farsi -- Ramin has parents who were born in Tehran and immigrated to the United States after the Iranian revolution in 1979. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, six years after the revolution, Ramin grew up with two distinct and, at times conflicting, influences: the American side that met him at school and the Iranian one that greeted him at home. It's a first-generation story as old as the United States. It's so common that Ayandeh counselors said the camp was created three years ago to address both Iranian and American parts of a new generation of Iranian-American youth -- a community they define as being ""hyphenated.""  Watch campers learn how to accept their backgrounds Â» . ""We're really becoming mindful of how we define things,"" said Natasha Sallahi, a first-time counselor and aspiring filmmaker. ""We realize that sometimes one word doesn't cover it all. So we're trying to create better definitions ... by putting two things [Iranian-American] together."" Camp Ayandeh is sponsored annually by Iranian Alliances Across Borders, a largely volunteer organization funded by individual donors and PARSA, a California-based philanthropic organization. First established on Thompson Island off eastern Massachusetts, Ayandeh began its gradual migration south the second year -- setting up at a campgrounds near Fairfax, Virginia. Iranian-American teens from high schools across the nation now flock to the new Georgia address to learn about their heritage and ask questions that range from relationships and college admissions to sexual orientation and discrimination -- issues that can come with distinctly different social parameters than their parents were once accustomed to in Iran. Camp counselor Siavash Samei remembers such angst all too well. ""There was not a single person that I could look at and say, 'He is me,' "" Samei said, describing an absence of elder Iranian-American role models. "" 'He is what I can do. He can snap and he can dance. And at the same time, he can talk English without an accent.' "" After two years as a camper, Samei returned this summer as counselor to help answer many of the same questions that plagued him a few years earlier. The typical adolescent anxieties and struggles were mixed with another layer of cultural confusion. ""As a high school student, I had a horrible time,"" he said. ""One day I would come into school very dressed up thinking, 'I'm looking Iranian.' One day I would be wearing the baggy pants and dressed completely American. And I had no clue which one was right."" According to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 400,000 Iranian-Americans live in the United States. The largest wave of Iranian immigrants came to the U.S. immediately following the ouster of the Shah of Iran and the Islamic-led revolution in 1979. Nearly three decades later, a new generation of Iranian-American youths are struggling to define themselves in these ""hyphenated"" communities. Bobak Moazami, a 17-year-old kid from Manhattan's Upper West Side, said he likes to think of himself equally as part of both communities. ""I eat American food for lunch,"" he said. ""Every day at school I have a grilled chicken sandwich. Then I come home and have chelo kabob or qormeh-sabzi."" For many of these students, traditional Iranian dishes such as qormeh-sabzi -- a stew of herbs and beef or lamb -- are a part of a heritage that at one time could only be preserved by their families. But with campers rediscovering pride in their cultural heritage, these teens are learning how to blend their parents' history and culture with their contemporary lifestyles. Put simply, why not appreciate the old-world beats of the tonbak alongside the edgy lyrics of Kanye West? At Camp Ayandeh, games of ""vasati,"" or Iranian dodgeball, and Iranian dancing sessions are scheduled next to public speaking and college prep workshops. And the campers bring their bicultural experiences back home. ""I read about American literature in the morning [at school],"" Moazami said. ""We talk about great English poets like Shakespeare and Lord Byron, and then I come home and experience another set of great [Iranian] poets such as Hafez and Saadi."" Nava Behnam, a 17-year-old who's attended the camp twice, has a story that started out slightly different from most of those at Ayandeh. Unlike many of the American-born campers, Behnam immigrated to the United States at 5 after being born in Tehran. She has experienced little in the way of Iranian culture and tradition outside her home in Rockville, Maryland. ""I was never really surrounded by it too much,"" she said. ""Or if I was, it was Persian gatherings with my parents where I'd sit in the back and be bored and have nothing to do."" Twelve years after arriving in the U.S., Behnam is part of a loyal following that returns to Camp Ayandeh each year. ""I come here to find my roots and to come to terms with where I belong and where I come from,"" she said. After going to Camp Ayandeh, Behnam said she now has ""an appreciation for Persian culture and our customs,"" even though she still describes herself as ""just another teenage girl going to high school in America.""","Camp Ayandeh helps Iranian-American youth come to terms with both cultures .

"(CNN)  -- Somalia's interim prime minister said Thursday that he has spoken to one of two French hostages seized earlier this week by gunmen who stormed their hotel in Mogadishu. Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke said the government will hold Hizbul Islam responsible for the safety of both men. Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke told a news conference at the presidential palace in the Somali capital that the hostage said he was in good health and is being treated well. Sharmarke said three low-level security officials have been arrested for their involvement in the kidnapping. The Somali government is negotiating the release of the hostages, who are being held by Islamist militants, he added. The two French nationals -- who have not been identified -- were abducted Tuesday when a group of about 10 armed men raided the hotel where they were staying. The French Foreign Ministry said the two were on an official mission to help the Somali government with security. The ministry has not divulged any details of its efforts to release the hostages, saying only that it is ""mobilized."" The two advisers had apparently told the hotel they were journalists, something that the media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders has criticized. ""We hope these two advisers are freed quickly, but we are shocked that they were passing themselves off as journalists,"" Reporters Without Borders said. ""They were on an official mission and had no need of cover. Their behavior endangers journalists in a region where media personnel are already in danger."" Sharmarke said the two hostages were kidnapped by the militant group Hizbul Islam but later were transferred to Al-Shabaab. Both Islamic insurgencies are trying to topple the current Somali government. Eyewitnesses said a group of gunmen stormed into the Sahafi hotel, which is frequented by foreigners, and took the two blindfolded and bound hostages on foot toward Mogadishu's Bakara market, a stronghold for Islamist insurgents fighting against the Somali government. The Somali prime minister said that the government will hold Hizbul Islam responsible for the safety of both men. He did not say if any demands had been made for the hostages' release. Hizbul Islam is led by Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, a bitter rival of Somalia's transitional president, Sheikh Sharif Ahmed. The two men once shared leadership of the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia, which opposed the presence of Ethiopian forces in Somalia. The alliance split because the two leaders disagreed over whether to use force to oust the Ethiopian forces. Hizbul Islam and Al-Shabaab have continued their fight in Somalia despite the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces earlier this year. The United Nations had hoped that the withdrawal of the Ethiopians and the election of Ahmed -- an Islamist -- to the post of transitional president would help quell the insurgency in Somalia. The Islamist insurgency is led by Al-Shabaab -- an al Qaeda-linked group that is on the United States' terror list. It wants to overthrow Somalia's weak, transitional government and implement a radical version of sharia, or Islamic law. Fighting in Somalia's capital city has displaced 200,000 Mogadishu residents since early May, according to the United Nations. Journalist Mohamed Amin Adow contributed to this report.","Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke reported hostage said he was in good health .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A former engineer for Rockwell International and Boeing was convicted Thursday of economic espionage and acting as an agent of China, authorities said. A Delta IV rocket launches on March 10, 2003 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Dongfan ""Greg"" Chung, 73, was accused of stealing restricted technology and Boeing trade secrets, including information related to the space shuttle program and the Delta IV rocket. U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney convicted him on charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage; six counts of economic espionage to benefit a foreign country; one count of acting as an agent of the People's Republic of China; and one count of making false statements to the FBI, according to a statement from federal prosecutors. Carney presided over Chung's three-week bench trial last month. In a bench trial, there is no jury and the judge decides whether to convict a defendant after hearing testimony. Chung was free on bond after his arrest by FBI agents and NASA investigators in February 2008. He was taken into custody after Carney's ruling was read. Chung, a native of China who is a naturalized United States citizen, was employed by Rockwell International from 1973 until Boeing acquired its defense and space unit in 1996, and by Boeing thereafter. He retired from Boeing in 2002, but returned as a contractor, a position he held until September 2006, prosecutors said. Chung held a ""secret"" security clearance, authorities said. ""For years, Mr. Chung stole critical trade secrets from Boeing relating to the space shuttle and the Delta IV rocket -- all for the benefit of the government of China,"" said David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security, in the prosecutors' statement. ""Today's verdict should serve as a warning to others willing to compromise America's economic and national security to assist foreign governments."" The case against Chung resulted from an investigation into another engineer who obtained information for China. That engineer, Chi Mak, and several of his relatives were convicted of providing defense articles to the PRC, authorities said. Mak was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison last year. According to evidence presented at trial, individuals in the Chinese aviation industry began sending tasks to Chung via letter as early as 1979, federal prosecutors said. Over the years, the letters directed Chung to collect data related to the space shuttle and various military and civilian aircraft. In his letters back to China, Chung referenced materials he had already sent, including 24 manuals relating to the B-1 bomber, which Rockwell had forbidden for distribution outside the company and federal agencies. In addition, between 1985 and 2003, Chung traveled to China several times and met with government officials. His contacts in China discussed these trips in letters and recommended methods of passing information, authorities said. In a 2006 search of Chung's home, FBI and NASA agents found more than 250,000 pages of documents from Boeing, Rockwell and other defense contractors in the house and in its crawl space, prosecutors said. They included ""scores of binders containing decades' worth of stress analysis reports, test results and design information for the space shuttle."" Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a $500,000 fine, authorities said. The charge of acting as an agent for a foreign government carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage and making false statements to federal investigators each carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Chung is set for sentencing November 9.","Dongfan Chung, 73, convicted of economic espionage; acting as agent of china .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- A federal judge ordered 10 municipal police officers arrested Saturday in connection with the slayings of 12 off-duty federal agents in southwestern Mexico, the attorney general's office said. The recent spate of violence was sparked by the arrest of high-ranking drug cartel member Arnoldo Rueda Medina. The federal officers' bodies were found Tuesday on a remote highway in Michoacan state, where at least 18 federal agents and two soldiers have been killed since July 11 due to drug-related violence. Video from the scene showed three signs, known as narcomensajes, or narcomessages, left by the killers. They all stated the same thing: ""So that you come for another. We will be waiting for you here."" The officers arrested Saturday are on the police force in the city of Arteaga. Mexican President Felipe Calderon, whose home state is Michoacan, responded to the violence by dispatching 1,000 federal police officers to the area. The infusion, which more than tripled the number of federal police officers patrolling Michoacan, angered Michoacan Gov. Leonel Godoy Rangel. He called it an occupation and said he had not been consulted. Authorities said Wednesday they were searching for the governor's half-brother, who they say is a top-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana drug cartel. The cartel is blamed for most of the recent violence in the state. The governor's brother, Julio Cesar Godoy Toscano, was elected July 5 to the lower house of Congress. The governor has publicly urged his brother to surrender. There were no reports of his apprehension as of late Saturday. The sudden spike in violence followed the arrest July 11 of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, described as a high-ranking member of La Familia. La Familia members attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda shortly after his arrest, authorities said. When that failed, cartel members attacked federal police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities. Under Mexican law, the officers arrested Saturday will be held for 40 days while officials determine whether to formally charge them.","Officers arrested Saturday are on the police force in the city of Arteaga .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Alternative treatments are as varied as the regions of the world they come from. And while they attract skepticism from some Western medical practitioners, they are an undeniable part of global health. Shark cartilage is a popular dish in Japan where it is regarded as having health benefits. In parts of Asia and Africa, 80 percent of the population depend on these treatments as their primary form of healthcare. Shark fin has long been used in traditional Asian medicine. Shark fin soup is regarded as a tonic that promotes general well-being, and shark fin has even been claimed to have anti-cancer properties. Shark fins are mainly composed of cartilage, a type of connective tissue found in the skeletal systems of many animals. In Japan, they are sold by herbalists as a powder, in tablet form or as whole fins. While shark fin has been used for centuries in Asia, in recent years it has become more popular in the West. A book called ""Sharks Don't Get Cancer,"" published in 1992, popularized the idea of shark fin as an alternative cancer treatment in the West, and powdered shark fin is now sold as dietary supplement. But scientific evidence doesn't support the idea. A 2000 report by researchers at George Washington University Medical Center in Washington D.C. said more than 40 tumors had been documented in sharks, skates and rays. Clinical studies on cancer patients, including a 1998 study by the Independent Cancer Treatment Research Foundation in Illinois, haven't shown cartilage powders to have any anti-cancer benefits. Cancer Research UK, an independent cancer-research organization, states ""We don't recommend alternative therapies such as shark cartilage, as there is no scientific or medical evidence to back up the claims made for these 'treatments'."" The use of shark fins has also been criticized by environmentalists who say the practice is threatening shark populations. In addition, environmental groups say that fins are often cut off live sharks at sea, with the bodies thrown back in the sea to drown, a controversial practiced know as ""finning."" The ancient art of herbal healing also remains highly popular in Africa. In South Africa, the name given to the practice is muti. In Johannesburg's Faraday market muti practitioners sell wares that are popular with locals and tourists alike. Illnesses are diagnosed by ""sangomas,"" who employ techniques including communicating with the spirits of ancestors. ""Sangomas"" then refer their patients to ""inyangas,"" who supply muti treatments. ""Inyangas"" make use of South Africa's diverse flora and fauna, selling treatments made from herbs and animal parts. Roots, bark and leaves are all used to prepare infusions that are said to cure ailments ranging from headaches to skin rashes. Other muti medicines deal with psychological conditions, curing nightmares, bringing good luck and warding off evil spells. Acupuncture is one of the most widespread of all traditional treatments. An ancient Chinese healing technique thought to date back at least 2,000 years, acupuncture is now widely practiced alongside modern medicine in the East and West alike. Traditional acupuncture works on the idea that energy, known as ""qi,"" flows along pathways in the body, called meridians. According to acupuncture theory, if these meridians become blocked, ""qi"" cannot flow freely and illness can result. Diagnosis of ailments is carried out by, among other things, feeling a patient's pulse and inspecting their tongue. Marian Rose of the British Acupuncture Council told CNN that an important part of the diagnosis process involves asking patients a range of questions about their well-being, including their digestion, sleep patterns, and health history. Treatment involves inserting fine acupuncture needles at critical points in the body in order to stimulate the flow of ""qi,"" described by Rose as ""the body's motivating energy."" Traditionally, acupuncture can be used to treat headaches, chronic pain, asthma, depression, addiction, and problems with the digestive system. Acupuncture has been the subject of extensive research and in the West the practice has been studied in terms of modern medical knowledge. Dr Mike Cummings is the medical director of the British Medical Acupuncture Association, which promotes Western medical acupuncture. He told CNN that research has shown acupuncture to be effective at treating pain in particular. Cummings says that it is believed that when an acupuncture needle is inserted into a muscle, it stimulates nerves. That affects the spinal gate, where sensory input is modulated, reducing activity in pain pathways. Whether backed by medical science or simply by years of use, traditional treatments remain popular and as more research is carried out, some may even come to complement modern medicine.","Even in the era of modern medicine, traditional treatments are still widespread .

"Editor's note: LZ Granderson is a senior writer and columnist for ESPN The Magazine and ESPN.com, and has contributed to ESPN's Sports Center, Outside the Lines and First Take. He is the 2009 Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) award winner for online journalism and the 2008 National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA) winner for column writing. LZ Granderson says criticism of President Obama by the gay community has gone too far. (CNN) -- Far from flowing rainbow flags, the sound of Lady Gaga and, quite honestly, white people, stands a nightclub just outside of Wicker Park in Chicago, Illinois, by the name of The Prop House. The line to get in usually stretches down the block, and unlike many of the clubs in Boystown and Andersonville, this one plays hip-hop and caters to men who may or may not openly identify as gay, but without question are black and proud. And a good number of them are tired of hearing how the gay community is disappointed in President Obama, because they are not. In recent weeks, one would have thought the nation's first black president was also the nation's biggest homophobe. Everyone from Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black and radio personality Rachel Maddow to Joe Solmonese, the president of Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest gay advocacy group, seem to be blasting Obama for everything from ""don't ask don't tell"" to Adam Lambert not winning American Idol. In their minds, Obama is not moving fast enough on behalf of the GLBT community. The outcry is not completely without merit -- the Justice Department's unnerving brief on the Defense of Marriage Act immediately comes to mind. I was upset by some of the statements, but not surprised. (After the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, President Ronald Reagan's initial handling of AIDS and, more recently, Katrina, there is little that surprises me when it comes to the government and the treatment of its people.) Still, rarely has criticism regarding Obama and the GLBT community come from the kind of person you would find standing in line at a spot like The Prop House, and there's a reason for that. Despite the catchiness of the slogan, gay is not the new black. Black is still black. And if any group should know this, it's the gay community. Bars such as The Prop House, or Bulldogs in Atlanta, Georgia, exist because a large number of gay blacks -- particularly those who date other blacks, and live in the black community -- do not feel a part of the larger gay movement. There are Gay Pride celebrations, and then there are Black Gay Prides. There's a popular bar in the heart of the nation's capital that might as well rename itself Antebellum, because all of the white patrons tend to stay upstairs and the black patrons are on the first floor. Last year at the annual Human Rights Campaign national fundraiser in Washington, D.C. -- an event that lasted more than three hours -- the only black person to make it on stage was the entertainment. When Proposition 8 passed in California, white gays were quick to blame the black community despite blacks making up less than 10 percent of total voters and whites being close to 60 percent. At protest rallies that followed, some gay blacks reported they were even hit with racial epithets by angry white participants. Not to split hairs, but for most blacks, the n-word trumps the f-word. So while the white mouthpiece of the gay community shakes an angry finger at intolerance and bigotry in their blogs and on television, blacks and other minorities see the dirty laundry. They see the hypocrisy of publicly rallying in the name of unity but then privately living in segregated pockets. And then there is the history. The 40th anniversary of Stonewall dominated Gay Pride celebrations around the country, and while that is certainly a significant moment that should be recognized, 40 years is nothing compared with the 400 blood-soaked years black people have been through in this country. There are stories some blacks lived through, stories others were told by their parents and stories that never had a chance to be told. While those who were at Stonewall talk about the fear of being arrested by police, 40 years ago, blacks talked about the fear of dying at the hands of police and not having their bodies found or murder investigated. The 13th Amendment was signed in 1865, and it wasn't until 1948 that President Harry S Truman desegregated the military. That's more than an 80-year gap. Not to be flip, but Miley Cyrus is older than Bill Clinton's ""don't ask, don't tell."" That doesn't mean that the safety of gay people should be trivialized or that Obama should not be held accountable for the promises he made on the campaign trail. But to call this month's first-ever White House reception for GLBT leaders ""too little too late"" is akin to a petulant child throwing a tantrum because he wants to eat his dessert before dinner. This is one of the main reasons why so many blacks bristle at the comparison of the two movements -- everybody wants to sing the blues, nobody wants to live them. This lack of perspective is only going to alienate a black community that is still very proud of Obama and is hypersensitive about any criticism of him, especially given he's been in office barely six months. If blacks are less accepting of gays than other racial groups -- and that is certainly debatable -- then the parade of gay people calling Obama a ""disappointment"" on television is counterproductive in gaining acceptance, to say the least. And the fact that the loudest critics are mostly white doesn't help matters either. Hearing that race matters in the gay community may not be comforting to hear, but that doesn't make it any less true. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Blacks tired of hearing about gays' disappointment in Obama .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Once he roamed the streets, moving from shelter to shelter. Now, Oliver Gomes rubs shoulders with Washington's elite. Oliver Gomes says working in the halls of Congress gave him the motivation and money to get off the streets. Squatting next to a white wall outside a Senate hearing room recently with a cell phone glued to his ear, Gomes is being paid to hold a place in line for a lobbyist at a hearing on the climate-change bill. Gomes -- 6 feet tall, with long curly hair pulled back, wearing a polo shirt and shorts -- is one of the contracted men and women holding places in line for this hearing. Many have been waiting since midnight to ensure their clients a seat. By 9 a.m., more than 100 people are lined up for the hearing. Only 10 seats are available to the public, and the first 10 spots are held by line-standers. The rest are shut out. Though the practice is controversial, Gomes said it has lifted him from life on the street. ""Sitting in the halls of Congress made me feel a little better,"" he said. ""It elevated me and made me feel like, well, you know, maybe I do belong here, maybe I can contribute even at that little minute level.""  Watch Gomes tell his story Â» . As the need for couriers on Capitol Hill declined with e-mail and fax, courier services like Quick Messenger Service of DC, Inc. have added the service of contracting men and women to hold places in line for lobbyists at hearings. The seats are valuable to lobbyists because the hearing is often their only face time with legislators. For big hearings with limited availability, line-standers may wait 20 to 30 hours. They're paid anywhere from $11 to $35 an hour. Gomes was living in a shelter when he started line-standing. He said working in the halls of Congress gave him the motivation and money he needed to get off the streets. He now makes extra money by recruiting men for the line-standing services from the homeless shelters where he used to stay. ""When I was down and out and I was on the Hill and I had that little bit of hope that while I was actually here, it gave me the incentive to dress a little better, more professional,"" Gomes said. Many of the contracted line-standers are homeless or formerly homeless like Gomes. Williams Howard Johnson Jr., one of Gomes' recruits, found his bright yellow button-down shirt, green patterned tie, and slacks at a donation center because he wanted to dress well for his job. ""That comes from being a part of something that's really meaningful to not only me but to society,"" Johnson said. Johnson was among those who had been in line since midnight for the 10 a.m. climate-change bill hearing, but he said he was happy to be there. ""I'm a part of something today and I'm very happy about that,"" Johnson said. Although Johnson and Gomes are glad to have a job and a feeling of importance on Capitol Hill, many people are opposed to the practice of hiring line-standers. Kalen Pruss, a fellow at the Internet environmental group avaaz.org, and her group of cheering green T-shirted environmentalists were shut out of the hearing. ""It's very unfortunate that the people who come here to line-stand always beat us here cause they can stand here all night,"" Pruss said. John Winslow, director of linestanding.com, said the committees might be creating the lines by limiting the number of seats for the public in the hearing rooms. At this hearing, some of his clients that paid for line-standers to wait at midnight were not able to get into the hearing. ""It's really a question of logistics, how many people does the committee want to service,"" Winslow said. ""And it seems like overwhelmingly they try to limit the number of people who attend these hearings and that just drives up demand artificially."" Critics see the practice as just another way lobbyists are buying influence on Capitol Hill. In 2007, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri introduced legislation to ban the practice of line-standing. ""I have no problem with lobbyists being in hearings, but they shouldn't be able to buy a seat,"" McCaskill said. ""It seems to me that if we are going to make sure lobbyists aren't buying meals for senators, and we are going to make sure lobbyists aren't buying elected officials gifts, then we ought to make sure they aren't buying seating at a public hearing."" Maria Foscarinis, an advocate for the homeless, thinks it's ironic that some of the most powerful people in the country are using some of the most vulnerable to hold a place in line for them. ""They're likely to be standing in line for people who well may be opposed to universal health care that would be a benefit for poor and homeless people,"" Foscarinis said. ""And yet they may be standing there for the purpose of access for the interests that are opposed to their own.""","Contracted line-holders stand for hours to ensure their clients get seats .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A hearing to consider who will raise Michael Jackson's three children has been delayed another week, while lawyers work to avoid a court battle over custody. Debbie Rowe said she married Michael Jackson to avoid the taboo of having childrien out of wedlock. The delay -- the third one this month -- was announced Friday afternoon by a Los Angeles County Superior Court spokesman. Debbie Rowe, Jackson's ex-wife and mother of his two oldest children, has not publicly revealed whether she will challenge Katherine Jackson, his 79-year-old mother, for custody or visitation rights. Katherine Jackson gained temporary guardianship of her son's children soon after his death last month. The two women have been working to ""privately and amicably resolve"" the matter since Jackson's death, a Jackson family lawyer said. Rowe's lawyer said this week that she was not asking the Jackson family for more money in exchange for dropping a possible custody challenge. A close friend of Rowe said she has been grieving Jackson's death -- grief made more painful by paparazzi hounding her and media reports vilifying Rowe by depicting her as a heartless woman who would trade her kids for cash. ""Debbie's a very caring, wonderful, warm person,"" said Marc Schaffel, who met first met Rowe when he worked for Jackson. ""She's a very humble person. People, you know, don't give her credit that she was a friend of Michael's for over 30 years."" Jackson and Rowe met when she was working as a nursing assistant in the Beverly Hills office of Jackson's dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein. Rowe said in a 2003 interview, later obtained by ABC News, that she became closer to Jackson in 1996 when she consoled him after his brief marriage to Lisa Marie Presley ended. ""He was upset because he really wanted to be a dad,"" Rowe said. ""I said, 'So, be a dad.' He looked at me puzzled. That is when I looked at him and said. 'Let me do this. I want to do this. You have been so good to me. You are such a great friend. Please let me do this. You need to be a dad, and I want you to be.'"" She told the interviewer they married in 1996 only to ""prevent some of the taboo of a child out of wedlock."" While Schaffel would not say if their relationship was sexual, he said Rowe had ""a true, true love there for Michael."" Their first child, Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., was born in February 1997. A daughter, Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson, was born the next year. Details of how the children were conceived and who was the biological father have been closely guarded amid much public speculation. The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got a $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents. Jackson later agreed to additional support. Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children. A California appeals court later ruled her rights were improperly terminated, opening the door to a possible custody battle. Rowe claimed in the 2003 interview that she still had ""some influence"" over how Jackson raised the children, citing his practice of covering their faces in public as her idea. ""That was my request, not his,"" she said. ""I am the one who's terrified. I am the one who's seen the notes that someone's going to take his children,"" she said. She said the children don't call her ""mom"" because she did not want them to. ""It's not that they're not my children, but I had them because I wanted him to be a father,"" she said. Rowe, 50, lives on a farm in Palmdale, California, about 60 miles north of Los Angeles, where she breeds horses and dogs. ""She spends time with all of her horses and her dogs,"" Schaffel said. ""If one of her horses is sick, Debbie will stay up all night long caring for them. She'll sleep on the floor in the barn with a horse if he's not well. ""Debbie doesn't run out to all of the social events,"" he said. ""You don't see her shopping on Rodeo Drive. She's not hitting the hot spots. She's not trying to be in the limelight. Debbie is just as happy at home in her very modest, humble, horse ranch."" When Hollywood's paparazzi surrounded her outside a restaurant near her ranch earlier this month, she showed flashes of anger and frustration. ""Are you ready to fight for your kids?"" a photographer repeatedly shouted. ""Are you ready to get your butt kicked?"" she replied, as she walked through the swarm. Schaffel said Rowe wants privacy and she's ""just trying to go on with her life."" ""She doesn't react well with the paparazzi,"" he said. Rowe's lawyers have stepped up their efforts to bolster her public image by firing off warning letters and demanding retractions when they see reports they think are wrong. One letter sent Tuesday demanded the New York Post retract its report that Rowe had agreed to drop her custody claims for $4 million. ""Ms. Rowe has not accepted -- and will not accept -- any additional financial consideration beyond the spousal support she and Michael Jackson personally agreed to several years ago,"" Eric George said in the letter. ""Among the several contenders for overzealous and inaccurate sensationalism, the New York Post has now seized top honors,"" George wrote to the paper. ""It would be easier to identify those few background facts that are accurate than to catalog the number of blatant falsehoods in your story."" ""The Post stands by its story,"" New York Post Editor-in-Chief Col Allan told CNN. Rowe also filed a lawsuit this week against a woman who claimed in a TV interview to have e-mails from Rowe saying she didn't really want to raise the children. The suit asked that Rowe be given any money paid to the woman for the interview. CNN's Kay Jones contributed to this report.","Lawyers for Katherine Jackson and Debbie Rowe working to avoid court battle .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- New Haven, Connecticut, firefighter Frank Ricci, the lead plaintiff in perhaps the most controversial case involving Judge Sonia Sotomayor, said Thursday that Sotomayor's rejection of his reverse discrimination claim had undermined the concept of a merit-based civil service system. New Haven firefighter Frank Ricci sued after the city threw out results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam. Ricci was one of a group of 20 mostly white firefighters who sued the city of New Haven after it threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, including Sotomayor, backed the city in the 2008 case Ricci v. DeStefano. The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. The ""belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed,"" Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""It only divides people who don't wish to be divided along racial lines. The very reason we have civil service rules is to root out politics, discrimination and nepotism. Our case demonstrates that these ills will exist if the rules of merit and the law are not followed.""  Watch firefighters testify Â» . Ricci also criticized Sotomayor's 2nd Circuit for disposing of the case in an ""unsigned, unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph."" Sotomayor was not present when Ricci spoke. She left the session after concluding her remarks earlier Thursday. Sotomayor argued before committee members Tuesday that her ruling in the Ricci case was decided on the basis of ""a very thorough, 78-page decision by the district court"" and followed an established precedent. ""This was not a quota case or (an) affirmative action case,"" she said. The case was a challenge to a firefighter test that had a wide range of difference between the pass and failure rate of different groups. The city of New Haven, she noted, was at risk of being sued by employees who could show they were ""disparately impacted"" by the test. New Haven city officials, after a number of days of hearings, decided they wouldn't certify the test but would instead attempt to develop a test of equal value in measuring a candidate's qualifications without having a disparate impact, she said. The question before the 2nd Circuit, Sotomayor said, was whether the city's decision was based on race or its understanding of what the law required it to do. The Circuit Court ruled that it was based on the latter. Based on established legal precedent, the 2nd Circuit decided that the city's decision was proper under established law. The Supreme Court, however, applied a new standard, she said, based on a different area of law. If she were ruling on that case today, she said, she would be bound by the new standards set by the Supreme Court. Ricci was one of several witnesses who testified both for and against Sotomayor. Linda Chavez, head of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity, which opposes affirmative action, argued that ""it is clear"" from Sotomayor's record ""that she has drunk deep from the well of identity politics."" It is impossible for Sotomayor to be a fair judge when she has ""shown a willingness to let her policy preferences guide her,"" Chavez said. Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel testified on Sotomayor's behalf, arguing that her opinion in the Ricci case was, in fact, an example of judicial restraint. It followed a string of legal precedents dating back almost three decades, he said. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also testified in favor of Sotomayor, telling committee members that she is an ""independent jurist"" with a ""sharp and agile mind"" who would bring ""a wealth of unique experience"" to the high court.","Frank Ricci one of 20 firefighters who claimed reverse discrimination in promotions .

"OXFORD, England (CNN)  -- You might expect Oxford and Cambridge universities to ask prospective students to compare the works of Chaucer to Boccaccio or to explain the theory of relativity. Cambridge students may have to field questions in the application process that would baffle some observers. Instead, Oxford wants to know: ""Would you rather be a novel or a poem?"" Cambridge asks applicants: ""What would you do if you were a magpie?"" The idea, say administrators at the two ultra-prestigious schools in England, is to see how well prospective students can think, not just how much they know. ""What we're trying to do is move students out of their comfort zone,"" said Mike Nicholson, Oxford University admissions director. ""Many students will have a body of knowledge, and they may be expected to be trusted on that in the interview. What we want to do is take them beyond that point and get them to start thinking for themselves.""  See examples of the application questions Â» . In the United Kingdom, 90 percent of students are educated at state schools. But 53 percent of Oxford University's students come from state schools. That seems to indicate that wealthier students who can afford private schools have an advantage.

It costs $300 for a day of mock interviews or $1,500 for a full weekend course. Oxbridge says 47 percent of its clients get into one of the elite colleges. The overall success rate for all applicants to the two schools -- commonly referred to as Oxbridge -- is 24 percent, the tutoring company says.

"(CNN)  -- A Maryland man believed to have shot and stabbed his wife and three young children to death before killing himself with a shotgun was having money problems and left a note saying he suffered from ""psychological issues,"" authorities said. Five people, including three young children, were found dead in this house in Middletown, Maryland. Christopher Wood, 34, may have slashed at least some of his family members in the killings and used a small-caliber handgun on others, Frederick County Sheriff Charles Jenkins said. He was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted shotgun wound at the foot of the bed where the bodies of his wife and 2-year-old daughter lay, the sheriff said. Wood's sons were 5 and 4 years old, authorities said. His wife, Francie Billotti Wood, was 33. The boys were found in their beds in a single bedroom, the sheriff said. Authorities did not release the names of the children. ""These are horrific incidents,"" said Jenkins, who said he couldn't remember another homicide in the past 20 years in Middletown, a one-stoplight town northwest of Baltimore. ""No one should ever have to be exposed to this."" Jenkins told CNN that at least five notes apparently handwritten by Wood were found inside the home. While the notes didn't immediately tell investigators what prompted the killings, they did provide some insight into possible problems. ""There is some indication in at least one of the notes that there might have been some psychological issues with Mr. Wood,"" Jenkins said. There was ""a mention of some medication"" in that note, according to the sheriff. Jenkins said the sheriff's office had no record of domestic violence or other family disputes at the Wood's home. He said investigators also have learned of money problems for Wood, a salesman for CSX Railroad. ""We are aware there were some, maybe, debt problems -- some financial problems,"" Jenkins said. Cpl. Jennifer Bailey said deputies went to the home shortly after 9 a.m. after Mrs. Wood's father called. Her family had not seen the Woods for about a day and her father forced his way into the locked home, finding the bodies, according to Jenkins. Authorities said a shotgun was found next to Christopher Wood's body and a .25-caliber handgun was found in a ""container"" in the kitchen. The sheriff said other weapons that could have been used to stab and cut the victims were found, but he did not say what those weapons were.  Watch sheriff's department's statement Â» . Francie Wood's family were longtime residents of the Middletown area. Her brother had recently retired from a career as a sheriff's deputy, Jenkins said. The family had moved to town from Florida about four months ago. ""We're all in shock,"" said the Rev. Kevin Farmer, the family's minister at Holy Family Catholic Church. ""This was a family, though they hadn't been with us very long, they are an integral part of our community."" Watch views from the crime scene Â» . He said the road the Woods lived on is a shortcut to the church and he would often see the children while riding a scooter he uses when the weather is good. ""They would always stop and wave and get big eyes as the scooter came by,"" he said. ""They were very happy kids."" Jenkins said autopsies will be performed on the bodies over the next few days and that it could be weeks before the results are ready to be released. Jenkins told CNN that at least five notes apparently handwritten by Wood were found inside the home. While the notes didn't immediately tell investigators what prompted the killings, they did provide some insight into possible problems, the sheriff said. ""There is some indication in at least one of the notes that there might have been some psychological issues with Mr. Wood,"" Jenkins said. Cpl. Jennifer Bailey said deputies went to the home shortly after 9 a.m. after Mrs. Wood's father called. The family had not been seen for several days, Bailey said. Authorities said several weapons, including a shotgun, were found inside the home. Christopher Wood had been an employee of CSX Railroad, Jenkins said. He said the sheriff's office had no record of domestic violence or other family disputes at the Woods' home. ""In my entire career, just about 20 years, this is probably the worst tragedy I've ever been a part of or ever seen in Frederick County,"" Jenkins said.","NEW: Note indicated father was having ""psychological issues,"" sheriff says .

"(CNN) -- It doesn't matter that they can be feverishly hot. Or that crowds make for long food lines or the tickets may be hard to come by. Bassist and vocalist Esperanza Spalding performed at this year's New Orleans Jazz Fest. Music festivals worldwide attract thousands of fans wanting to hear their favorite artists live or discover under-the-radar musicians. Each major festival has its own special twist, specific to the event and city that hosts it. From the notorious mud baths at Glastonbury, England, to the breath-taking mountains surrounding Fuji Rock in Naeba, Japan, these are events that festival-goers wait for all year.  Experience the New Orleans Jazz Fest Â» . Our guide prepares music fans worldwide for the best festivals this summer and later in the year. GLASTONBURY, Somerset, England June 24-28 ($255) Glastonbury has been around since dairy farmer Michael Eavis first held a free two-day festival on his farm in 1970, and it's long been the festival in England for seeing the biggest and best bands in the world. It also may be the muddiest -- heavy rain in several years, most notably 1997, turned Glastonbury into a muddy bog. Everyone from Radiohead to Jay-Z has headlined the festival, and with more than 700 acts each year, there is something for everybody. Some of the proceeds from the festival go to Oxfam and Greenpeace. This year's headliners include Franz Ferdinand, Blur, and Bruce Springsteen. ROCK AL PARQUE, Bogota, Colombia June 27-29 (free) The Rock al Parque festival, launched in 1995, has become South America's biggest rockfest in recent years -- some 320,000 people traveled to Simon Bolivar Park in 2006 for a weekend of Colombia's top rock bands and renowned international headliners. Funded by Colombia's culture secretary, the free festival has included some of rock's biggest names, including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Manu Chao, and Bloc Party. In the days leading up to Rock al Parque, the festival organizers host a series of panel discussions on music production, management, and the recording industry. ROSKILDE, Denmark July 2-5 ($220) Since 1971, the rock festival in Roskilde has hosted the top names in music, from Bob Marley to Bob Dylan. It is the biggest summer festival in northern Europe, and the ""Arena"" stage boasts a 17,000-capacity tent, the largest in Europe. The festival has a daily newspaper and a 24-hour live radio station and is also home to the annual ""Naked Run,"" where the first naked person to cross the finish line receives a free ticket for next year's festival. Some 80,000 will travel to Roskilde to see headliners including Coldplay, Oasis and Nine Inch Nails. EXIT, Novi Sad, Serbia July 9-12 ($105) Created in 2000 by three university students as a protest against former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, the electro-focused festival in the heart of Serbia was named Europe's best festival in 2007 by fans voting in the UK Festival Awards. Over 200,000 people attended Exit last year, dancing at all-night raves in the gorgeous surroundings of Petrovaradin Fortress, an 18th-century castle near the Danube River. Some of techno's biggest names will be on hand to celebrate Exit's 10-year anniversary, including Moby, Kraftwerk, and The Prodigy. THISDAY, Abuja/Lagos, Nigeria Dates tba . The THISDAY festival in Nigeria -- launched in 2006 by the editor-in-chief of Thisday newspaper, Nduka Obaigbena, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the end of slavery -- is the biggest music and fashion festival in Africa. According to Obaigbena, the festival is meant to highlight the positive progress being made in Africa, and find sustainable solutions for the continent's problems. The theme of last year's festival was ""Africa Rising,"" and it showcased some of the world's best-known artists including Jay-Z, Rihanna, and Usher. Stay tuned for this year's lineup. FUJI ROCK, Naeba, Japan July 24-26 ($410) Japan's biggest outdoor festival takes its name from Mt. Fuji, the site of the first festival in 1997. Fuji Rock has been set amongst the cool forested mountains of the Naeba ski resort for the past ten years -- gondolas and hilly trails transport people from stage to stage, and the streams and forests between them are the reason why Fuji Rock has been called the most beautiful festival in the world. It's not just about the scenery, though -- over 100,000 people will trek through the mountains to see headliners Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, and Weezer. LOLLAPALOOZA, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. August 7-9 ($190) Rocker Perry Farrell began Lollapalooza in 1991 as a farewell tour for his band, Jane's Addiction. The biggest grunge rock festival during the '90s disappeared for awhile around the turn of the century, but it was revived in 2005 as a more traditional ""big weekend"" destination festival in Chicago. The past few years at Grant Park have been marked by hot summers, huge crowds, and even bigger bands. The anticipated crowd of nearly 200,000 is staggering, as are this year's headliners: Kings of Leon, Tool, Depeche Mode, and Beastie Boys, just to name a few. BESTIVAL, Isle of Wight, England September 11-13 ($205) The trendy Bestival, the original boutique weekend festival on the Isle of Wight, is the best way to end the summer festival season in Europe. Bestival boasts a yearly fancy dress competition -- last year's was ""30,000 freaks under the sea,"" and 2009 is the year of ""Outer Space,"" so make sure to dress accordingly. Thousands of Bestival-goers will witness an eclectic lineup including Lily Allen, Massive Attack, and MGMT in the picturesque surroundings of Robin Hill Park. For family fun, look no further than Camp Bestival, a three-day family festival at a castle by the sea in July. PARKLIFE, Australia Late September-Early October . The Parklife series of one-day music festivals kicks off the summer festival season across Australia. The dance-focused fests have featured heavyweights Justice, MIA, and Muscles over the past two years. The day-long festivals are followed by an official ""After Life"" party that runs until the early hours of the morning, so be prepared for a long one if you're one of the estimated 100,000 people attending a Parklife gig in one of several cities across Australia at the end of September. WOODSTOCK, Johannesburg, South Africa November 27-30  When people think of Woodstock, South Africa isn't necessarily what comes to mind. But for the past decade, the festival has been the biggest youth music event in that country, hosting a variety of both well-known and upcoming mainstream and hip-hop acts -- not to mention a variety of extreme sports stunt acts, paintballing, and flea-market stalls. Woodstock may not have the star power of the legendary American festival -- but with the wide range of music and outdoor activities it presents, its promoters aren't lying when they say that boredom simply isn't an option. SUNBURN, Goa, India  December . Sunburn Festival launched in December 2007 as South Asia's first electronic music festival, and featured heavyweights like Carl Cox and John 00 Fleming. Located seaside in Goa, on India's west coast, the festival has its roots in ""Goa Trance,"" a type of pulsing, transcendental electro music that became popular in the early 1990s. Sunburn again treated more than 5,000 electro revelers to a three-day party by the beach in December 2008. The festival's founder has said Sunburn will always be free to attend, and it is not to be missed if you happen to be in India in December.","CNN has put together a list of some of the best upcoming music festivals .

"(CNN) -- Chinese authorities were explicit: Tear down the nation's first sex-themed amusement park before it gets going full steam. Visitors catch a glimpse of Love Land, billed as China's first-ever sex theme park, in southwest China. Love Land had not opened its doors yet, but authorities in the city of Chongqing -- a sprawling metropolis on the banks of the Yangtze River -- got all hot and bothered over the park's plans to display naked human sculptures, giant replica genitals and a photo gallery on the history of sex, the state-run China Daily reported. Lu Xiaoqing, park manager, told the newspaper he got the idea for building Love Land after a visit to a sex park in Jeju, a popular destination in South Korea. Love Land would include sex-technique workshops and sex education to help adults ""enjoy a harmonious sex life,"" Lu said. ""Sex is a taboo subject in China, but people really need to have more access to information about it,"" he told the newspaper. ""We are building the park for the good of the public."" Whatever Lu's intentions, the newspaper said Chinese officials saw it another way: ""vulgar, ill-minded and misleading."" The park was to open in October but was demolished over the weekend -- thongs, replicas of derrieres and all. Reactions posted on the Internet were varied, according to the China Daily. Some thought sex was best left behind closed doors, while others argued that a real need for sex education existed in China. ""Sex is a matter of privacy. It is not for publicity,"" said Xia Xueluan, a sociology professor at Beijing University. The officials in Chongquing apparently agreed.","Love Land was to display giant replica genitals and photo gallery on history of sex .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Questions surrounding Judge Sonia Sotomayor's past speeches generated more controversy in the final day of her Supreme Court confirmation hearings Thursday, as Democrats again called her a mainstream jurist and Republicans portrayed her as a liberal activist likely to legislate from the bench. Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor greets Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, Thursday. One GOP senator said Sotomayor's most controversial speeches ""bug the hell out of me,"" an expression of frustration as Republicans tried -- with little success -- to get Sotomayor to reveal more about her personal views in her fourth and final day of questioning. GOP critics also summoned New Haven, Connecticut, firefighter Frank Ricci, who was the lead plaintiff in perhaps the most controversial case in Sotomayor's appellate career. Ricci testified that her 2008 rejection of his reverse discrimination claim had undermined the concept of a merit-based civil service system. In a potential sign of Sotomayor's strong political momentum, however, Senate Republicans indicated they do not intend to filibuster her nomination on the Senate floor. They also indicated their belief that the full Senate would vote on her nomination before breaking for its August recess. Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said he plans to put a confirmation vote for Sotomayor on the committee's calendar for next Tuesday. The committee's questions once again touched on a range of hot-button issues, including gun control, abortion, same-sex marriage, the death penalty, and the role of international law in American jurisprudence. ""I think you're a walking, talking example of the best part of the United States of America,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, told Sotomayor. ""It is my belief that you are going to be a great Supreme Court justice."" South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham was less complimentary, telling Sotomayor that she has ""said some things that have bugged the hell out of me,"" but he quickly conceded that her judicial record has ""been generally in the mainstream."" ""Your speeches are disturbing, particularly to conservatives,"" Graham said. ""Those speeches to me suggested gender and racial affiliations in a way that a lot of us wonder, will you take that line of thinking to the Supreme Court in these cases of first precedent."" But, Graham conceded, ""to be honest with you, your record as a judge has not been radical by any means. ... You have, I think, consistently, as an advocate, took a point of view that was left of center."" Graham defended the importance of probing Sotomayor's political beliefs by highlighting the high court's 1955 landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, which mandated the desegregation of schools. The ruling was ""instructive in the sense that the court pushed the country to do something politicians were not brave enough to do,"" he said.  Watch Graham talk about Sotomayor's record Â» . The personal views of Supreme Court justices matter, he argued, because ""you're not going to find a law book that tells you"" how to rule on contentious social issues such as same-sex marriage or whether there is a ""fundamental"" right to bear arms. Sotomayor later fired back at the Republican line of questioning, asking Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, if he wanted a judge who pre-decided cases before hearing the evidence and facts.  Watch Sotomayor's record on discrimination Â» . ""Would you want a judge or nominee who came in here and said, 'I agree with you, this is unconstitutional,' before I had a case before me?"" Sotomayor said, adding: ""I don't think that's a justice I can be."" She noted that the Supreme Court spends considerable time on cases, including Second Amendment cases involving gun control -- an issue Republicans have repeatedly emphasized during her confirmation hearings. The National Rifle Association, unswayed by Sotomayor's assertion earlier in the week that she recognizes an individual right to bear arms, announced Thursday that it is opposed to her nomination. ""We believe any individual who does not agree that the Second Amendment guarantees a fundamental right and who does not respect our God-given right of self-defense should not serve on any court, much less the highest court in the land,"" said a joint statement by Wayne LaPierre, the NRA executive vice president, and Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Reform. Sotomayor repeatedly said she recognizes an individual right to firearms in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in the 2007 case District of Columbia v. Heller. The high court in that instance ruled that a sweeping handgun ban in the nation's capital violated the constitutional right to ""keep and bear arms."" Sotomayor refused to say, however, whether she believed the right is ""fundamental,"" which in legal terms refers to whether a federal statute applies to the states. On gun control, as in other issues, Sotomayor repeated that the Constitution and facts of the case would be the basis of her rulings. The highly charged issue of affirmative action surfaced most prominently later in the day, when Frank Ricci testified before the committee. Ricci was one of a group of 20 mostly white firefighters who sued the city of New Haven after the city threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals -- including Sotomayor -- backed the city in the 2008 case Ricci v. DeStefano. The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. The ""belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed,"" Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ""It only divides people who don't wish to be divided along racial lines. The very reason we have civil service rules is to root out politics, discrimination, and nepotism. Our case demonstrates that these ills will exist if the rules of merit and the law are not followed."" Ricci also criticized the 2nd Circuit for disposing ""of our case in an unsigned, unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph."" Sotomayor was not present when Ricci spoke. She told committee members earlier in the week, however, that her ruling in the Ricci case was decided on the basis of ""a very thorough, 78-page decision by the district court"" and followed a firmly established precedent.  Watch Ricci testify at hearings Â» . The Supreme Court applied a new standard, she claimed, based on a different area of law. If she were ruling on that case today, she said, she would be bound by the new standards set by the Supreme Court. Ricci was one of a long list of witnesses who testified both for and against Sotomayor. Linda Chavez, head of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity, which opposes affirmative action, argued that ""it is clear"" from Sotomayor's record ""that she has drunk deep from the well of identity politics."" It is impossible for Sotomayor to be a fair judge, Chavez claimed, when she has ""shown a willingness to let her policy preferences guide her."" Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel testified on Sotomayor's behalf, arguing that her opinion in the Ricci was case, in fact, an example of judicial restraint. It followed a string of legal precedents, he claimed, dating back almost three decades. FBI Director Louis Freeh and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also testified in favor of Sotomayor. Bloomberg told committee members that she is an ""independent jurist"" with ""sharp and agile mind"" who would bring ""a wealth of unique experience"" to the high court. Committee Republicans, unswayed by such assertions, once again examined Sotomayor's controversial statement that a ""wise Latina"" could reach a better decision than a white man. Asked what she would say to people offended by her remarks, Sotomayor said that she regrets that she has ""offended some people. I believe that my life demonstrates that that was not my intent to leave the impression that some have taken from my words."" Sotomayor was also asked to explain her remarks from a 2001 speech in which she said she agreed that ""there is no objective stance but only a series of perspectives -- no neutrality, no escape from choice in judging."" She told the committee that, in every case, the two opposing parties view the facts from vastly different perspectives. ""You can't just throw up your hands and say I'm not going to rule,"" she said. There is a choice in judging, which means ""you have to rule."" CNN's Dana Bash and Peter Hamby contributed to this report.","NEW: Senate wraps up Sotomayor's confirmation hearings .

"(CNN) -- The chairman of Tennessee's Democratic Party wants a Republican legislative aide fired for sending out a ""reprehensible"" e-mail depicting President Obama as two cartoonish white eyes peering from a black background. Sherri Goforth, a Tennessee state senator's aide, said she mistakenly sent the image ""to the wrong list of people."" Obama's image is in the last square of a collage containing portraits of the previous 43 U.S. presidents. The e-mail, which was sent to other GOP staff members, was posted on the Internet Monday. Sherri Goforth, an administrative assistant to state Sen. Diane Black, R-Gallatin, has admitted she sent the e-mail May 28 with the title ""Historical Keepsake Photo."" She said, without elaborating, that she mistakenly sent it ""to the wrong list of people."" According to the Tennessean, a Nashville newspaper, a note on the e-mail said it was paid for by the Tennessee Republican Party, but GOP officials denied they produced it. Black leads the Tennessee Senate Republican Caucus. There was no comment from the White House as of Tuesday afternoon. Black rebuked Goforth but didn't dismiss her. ""I want to be sure that everyone understands that the communication was sent without my knowledge,"" Black said Tuesday afternoon. ""It absolutely does not represent the beliefs or opinions of my office. I want to be very clear about that."" The senator said as soon as she found out about the e-mail, she consulted the Legislature's human resources office, then followed their advice. ""Ms. Goforth did get a verbal reprimand as well as a very strongly worded reprimand, written, that was put in her file that if this should ever occur again, that she would be terminated,"" Black said.  Watch Sen. Black discuss her response Â» . ""This is an employee who has had a stellar record,"" Black said. She added that Goforth has worked in state government for more than 20 years, and has had a clean record. ""We followed policy. And that's what you do when someone breaks the rules, you follow policy,"" she said. A phone message left for Goforth by CNN was not answered. ""Is this indicative of what Senate Republicans think about our commander-in-chief?"" asked state Democratic Party Chairman Chip Forrester in a statement posted on the party's Web site. ""I am calling on Sen. Black to reject this racist smear and fire this staffer who, on state government time, on state government computers, using a state government e-mail account, launched this bigoted attack on our president,"" Forrester said. ""Keeping her on the staff would send the message that this type of behavior is condoned by the Senate Republican Caucus."" ""This e-mail is reprehensible, insults the office of the president, and is embarrassing to all Tennesseans regardless of political party,"" Forrester said. Goforth told Christian Grantham of the Web site Nashville Is Talking that she had received a letter of reprimand from her superiors but will remain on the job. Grantham said Goforth told him she felt ""very bad about accidentally sending it to the wrong list"" of people. ""I inadvertently hit the wrong button,"" Grantham quoted Goforth as saying. ""I'm very sick about it, and it's one of those things I can't change or take back."" Forrester, in his Web posting, said, ""Ms. Goforth does not seem to understand what she did wrong. She has apologized for 'sending [the e-mail] to the wrong list of people.' I believe that any list of people would have recognized this e-mail as offensive and hateful."" State Rep. Johnny Shaw, D-Bolivar, a member of the black and Democratic caucuses, said Goforth should be dismissed. ""I don't think a reprimand is enough. I think this lady needs to go. I don't think she should be a part of the people who represent the state of Tennessee,"" Shaw said. He said Goforth and Black, as well as Republican Lt. Gov. and Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey, should make public apologies for the incident. ""I am appalled. It's despicable. It's disgusting. It should not have happened, but it does happen,"" Shaw said. ""It is the president of our country that we're talking about."" Several other black Democratic lawmakers agreed Goforth should quit. ""The last thing we need in the state of Tennessee is to send out the impression and the image that we are still stuck in some backwater mentality and culture that feels it's OK to depict the president of the United States in that fashion,"" state Rep. John Deberry Jr., D-Memphis, told CNN Radio. Forrester added: ""Unfortunately, Sherri Goforth's e-mail joins the list of shameful episodes by Tennessee Republicans, from the infamous 'Birds of a Feather' direct-mail piece that featured black crows with the heads of Barack Obama and [African-American] Rep. Nathan Vaughn, to the ""Barack the Magic Negro"" song that former Tennessee GOP Party Chairman Chip Saltsman sent to RNC members during his failed campaign for RNC chair.""","E-mail shows U.S. presidents; Obama depicted as white eyes on black background .

"(CNN) -- ""A gruesome scene"" is how one investigator described the aftermath of five killings in Tennessee. A sixth body was found in Alabama. Police gather outside one of the scenes of mutliple slayings in Fayetteville, Tennessee, on Saturday. Kristin Helm of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation told CNN on Saturday that authorities have Jacob Shafer in custody in connection with the deaths. She added that authorities are not looking for additional suspects. Huntsville, Alabama, Police Sgt. Mickey Allen said Tennessee authorities told him a man confessed to a slaying in Huntsville, Alabama, and to five other killings in Fayetteville, Tennessee. Allen didn't identify the man. Shafer has been questioned by the TBI and is expected to face murder charges, Helm said. Sheriff Murray Blackwelder, who held an afternoon news conference, called the slayings ""one of the worst crimes Lincoln County has ever seen."" He didn't describe how the Lincoln County, Tennessee, victims died. Dr. Bruce Levy, medical examiner for Tennessee, was working to identify the bodies found in that state, Helm said. Fayetteville police responded to a call to South Lincoln Road about 10 a.m. (11 a.m. ET), Blackwelder said. Police found three crime scenes and five bodies on that street, he said. The five victims, some of whom were related, were found in two homes, Helm said. Investigators think the killings occurred either Friday night or early Saturday, she said. The sixth body was found at a business in Huntsville, Sheriff Allen said. He said he is unsure of the connection between the crime scenes in Tennessee and Alabama. Huntsville is about 30 miles from Fayetteville. ""We have no clue yet as to what unfolded there and how it relates to here,"" Allen said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- London commuters crammed onto buses, scrambled for taxis, cycled or simply walked on Wednesday as a strike by Tube workers shut down most of the subway network. Commuters queue for packed buses in London on Wednesday morning. The strike began Tuesday at 7 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) but the first full effects were felt during Wednesday's morning commute. The strike was set to last for 48 hours with a normal service resuming Friday morning, according to Transport for London (TfL), which runs the city's transportation network. The RMT trade union called the strike after talks with management over pay, job cuts, and disciplinary issues broke down. ""RMT doesn't resort to industrial action lightly,"" General Secretary Bob Crow said in a statement. ""The fact is that Tube workers have been driven into walking out today."" Transport Commissioner Peter Hardy said the talks had been making progress on all issues and he urged the RMT to return to the table. ""The RMT leadership says we were close to a deal,"" Hardy said in a statement. ""If that is the case, then they should call off the strike, return to talks ... and resolve this issue without any more disruption to Londoners."" TfL was running extra buses and free shuttle services across the River Thames during the strike. Electronic travel cards used for the TfL network were temporarily being allowed on all train lines in greater London, it said. While most services on the Tube were shut because of the strike, one line -- the Northern line -- was running normally and five others were running on a reduced schedule, TfL said. ""It's been really good,"" a girl on Oxford Street told CNN about her commute. ""The Northern line is running perfectly."" Still, some bus services were packed with commuters who normally ride the underground trains or who failed to find a taxi. ""I think we'd all like to strike for more money, but unfortunately we can't,"" said one woman at Oxford Circus, where the Tube is closed. Others hit the pavement and walked. ""It's OK -- quite refreshing,"" said a man on Regent Street. He said he had just walked from Liverpool Street Station, a train station as well as a Tube stop that is more than 2.5 miles away. The RMT represents about half of the 20,000 employees on the Tube, a TfL spokeswoman said. Other unions including Unite and TSSA represent the rest, she said, and were not on strike.","London transport system crippled as Tube workers go on strike .

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Carl Azuz and this is CNN Student News! It is the first day of June and our last week before summer break. Thank you very much for joining us. First Up: A Look Back . AZUZ: First up, a major move for the country's largest automaker as General Motors is expected to file for bankruptcy today. This comes one month after Chrysler, another of the so-called ""Big Three"" U.S. car companies, did the very same thing. Under the terms of General Motors' bankruptcy, the company will be reorganized and essentially taken over by the government. Thirty years ago, GM made up more than 40 percent of U.S. auto sales. Today, that number is 19 percent. The company's reported more than $90 billion in losses since 2005. As the bankruptcy process begins, Christine Romans looks back at the history of GM and the American car. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Henry Ford started at the beginning of the last century with four wheels and a running board; 1908 was the birth of American car culture. That same year, General Motors was formed in Flint, Michigan. It wasn't until 1925 when the ""Big Three"" was complete with the formation of Chrysler Corporation. JOHN DAVIS, HOST, MOTORWEEK: When the Big Three emerged, they not only emerged as rivals that really gave Americans much better automobiles at the time, but they also cemented the American automobile as a world standard. ROMANS: ""As goes General Motors, so goes the nation."" That phrase defined America's economic power for much of the last century. PETER MORICI, ECONOMIST, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: So many folks were either employed at General Motors or the other two major car makers, making steel and all the other components that go into cars. It just meant that if the automobile companies were prospering, the country was prospering, too. ROMANS: Today, there are 74,000 rank-and-file GM workers in the U.S. But in its heyday, GM was the largest industrial company in the world; a technology leader. By 1979, 600,000 people worked for GM. Those good jobs helped build America's middle class. DAVIS: It also allowed us to migrate out from the cities to have the quarter lot in a suburb, to basically get away from a lot of the congestion of the metropolitan areas. ROMANS: General Moters was the company that revolutionized what we drove, how we thought about our cars, and how we paid for them. GM invented auto loans and the model year. It was the first to hire designers instead of engineers to create new car concepts; think big fins and chrome of the 1950s and 60s. And everything changed. Ford adopted flashy fins with the Ford Fairlane, as did Chrysler with the popular Desoto. Automobiles from the Big Three put their stamp on popular culture, from music to movies to television. What's considered to be the first rock and roll song ever recorded was ""Rocket 88"" by Ike Turner, about a GM product.

AZUZ: It may have started as science fiction, but these days, practically all of us, including the government, spend time in cyberspace. But President Obama says we're not as prepared as we should be, as a government or a country, for cyber-attacks. That's why he's planning to create a new position: cybersecurity coordinator. Jeanne Meserve explains the new job. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEANNE MESERVE, CNN HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Hackers cut power to a skyscraper and then reprogram it to play Space Invaders in a spoof video on YouTube. But cybersecurity is not a laughing matter. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It's now clear this cyberthreat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation. MESERVE: Americans use the Internet to bank and shop and talk to one another. Electricity, water, transportation all depend on it. But every day, there are attacks. The White House estimates in the past two years cybercrime has cost Americans more than $8 billion. And last year alone, hackers stole one trillion dollars worth of business secrets. Military and intelligence networks have been penetrated, and tests have shown a cyberattack can destroy critical infrastructure, like this generator. President Obama says the country is not prepared. OBAMA: From now on, our digital infrastructure, the networks and computers we depend on every day, will be treated as they should be: as a strategic national asset. Protecting this infrastructure will be a national security priority. MESERVE: The president will hand pick a cybersecurity coordinator to integrate policies across government, work closely with the private sector, and coordinate the federal response to attacks. Still unknown: who will get the job. JAMES LEWIS, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: If you get the wrong person, or you put them in an office that doesn't have very much power, you can have the best plan in the world and it still won't work. MESERVE: The plan is short on specifics, though the president says government will not dictate security standards to private industry, and will not monitor private networks or Internet traffic. Security experts say they generally like the steps the administration is taking, but warn there are many more steps to take on the long road to securing the nation's cyber-infrastructure.

"(CNN) -- Some Iranian-Americans, watching the post-election unrest in Iran, say the tug-of-war between the people and their hardline government has come to a head after three decades. Crowds demonstrated in Los Angeles, California on Monday, June 15 over the Iran election results. ""I am absolutely convinced that what we are witnessing is a turning point in the history of the Islamic Republic,"" said Dr. Hamid Dabashi, professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York City. ""Even if the Islamic Republic survives this crisis, it will no longer be as it used to be,"" added Dabashi. The contentious election results between conservative incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and reformist challenger Mir Hossein Moussavi sent many Iranians protesting in the streets, while others celebrated Ahmadinejad's apparent victory. Kaveh Afrasiabi, who has taught at Tehran University and Boston University and identifies himself as an independent, told CNN that Ahmadinejad's widespread support in rural areas and small towns was the reason for his win. In results announced hours after the polls closed, Ahmadinejad received more than 62 percent of the vote, a figure hotly disputed by Moussavi's supporters. With the credibility of Friday's election under scrutiny, how the Islamic Republic of Iran overcomes it and reclaims its legitimacy in the eyes of some of its own citizens and the international community remains to be seen. ""There is good reason to believe that many if not most of the pro-Moussavi demonstrators are gladly taking an opportunity to safely protest something bigger: their enormous discontent with the entire system as it stands,"" said Shirin Sadeghi, a Middle East analyst for the Huffington Post. The unstable political, social and economic climate has some scholars questioning the future of the Islamic Republic. ""They are either going to crack down severely or they are going to cave in -- it could go either way,"" Dabashi said of the conservatives who now dominate Iran's government. Many Iranian-Americans say they see this as their opportunity for change. ""This is the best chance Iranians have to evolve to a better situation,"" said Dr. Ali Nayeri, a professor at the University of California at Irvine. That chance has sparked an unprecedented wave of spontaneous demonstrations not only within Iran but also thousands of miles away from Tehran --- scenes unparalleled since the 1979 revolution. ""Thirty years ago we had the war with Iraq. Now we have an internal war with our president and the fundamentalists,"" said Reza Goharzad, a political analyst who worked with Moussavi when he was prime minister of Iran. Goharzad, of Southern California, was among thousands of voters to cast an absentee ballot. ""This was the first time I voted in 30 years,"" said Goharzad. The enthusiasm that drove record numbers of Iranian-Americans to the voting booths was overshadowed by disappointment when a shortage of ballots prevented hundreds from voting. In addition, the election results were announced before many of the voting booths in the U.S. had closed. Alex Vatanka, senior Middle East analyst at IHS Jane's, a provider of defense and security information, said Iran's supreme ruler, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, may have miscalculated the mood of the country when he endorsed Ahmadinejad's victory before the country's election authority made the final call.  Khamenei has since asked the authority, the Guardian Council, to recount some of the votes. But Moussavi is asking for fresh elections. Goharzad, like many other voters, questions the legitimacy of the election. He wants to know where his vote went. A student activist in Dallas, Texas, echoed that sentiment. ""The election volunteer at my voting location said that they had 500 ballots, which was not enough for the thousand or so people that turned out to vote,"" said the activist, who wanted to remain anonymous because he plans to visit Iran soon. For the first time, Iranian-Americans say, the post-revolution generation has seen the power of their unity unfold in masses. They say this has given Iranians at home and abroad hope that reform could be within their reach, if the ruling mullahs are willing to allow it. ""We are seeing a rise of a new generation of Iranians who are not taking it anymore,"" said Dabashi. ""This is no longer just about this election, this is full-fledged civil disobedience,"" he added. The divide within the Islamic Republic has pitted the reformists against the conservatives. ""The big difference between these protests and the student riots of 1999 and 2001 is that we are seeing senior caliber officials like Mir Hossein Moussavi,  Mehdi Karrubi and Mohammad Khatami and Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani supporting the demonstrations,"" said Vatanka. Karrubi is a former Parliament speaker. Khatami and Rafsanjani are former presidents. Some experts say where Iran is headed actually has a lot to do with its past. ""Rafsanjani made no secret of his disdain for Ahmadinejad ahead of the election, and even back in 2005 when he lost the second round runoff to Ahmadinejad,"" said Sadeghi. Rafsanjani is chairman of the Assembly of Experts and oversees the 86-member body, which is responsible for appointing the supreme leader and monitoring his performance. Behind closed doors, Iran's political parties are caught in the middle of a power struggle between Supreme Leader Khamenei and Rafsanjani. Rafsanjani's role as chairman of the assembly gives him the ability to influence that body's attitudes toward Khamenei, Vatanka said. That could only add more fuel to the political fire and social unrest in the streets, analysts say. Politics aside, at the end of the day, Iranian expatriates such as Mitra Gholami, who participated in the historic 1979 protests, feel a sense of deja vu. Gholami, now an Atlanta resident, fled Iran with her three children 15 years ago. ""I want people to have a normal life,"" said Gholami. ""I want them to have freedom.""","Some Iranians-Americans believe the Islamic Republic possibly is eroding .

"(CNN) -- The recent hacking of a Twitter employee's personal e-mail account is raising questions about the security of storing personal information and business data on the Internet. A Twitter co-founder says password toughness is important to online security. The Web has been buzzing since a hacker allegedly broke into a Twitter administrator's personal e-mail account about a month ago and used that information to access the employee's Google Apps account. That account housed some of Twitter's private financial documents and notes, according to Twitter's official blog. Some of those documents circulated the blogosphere on Wednesday, and TechCrunch, a technology blog, published a Twitter financial forecast. The hacker sent 310 documents to the tech site, according to a post by Michael Arrington, TechCrunch's founder and co-editor. In what appears to be a separate incident, a hacker broke into Twitter chief executive Evan Williams' wife's e-mail account and then accessed Williams' PayPal and Amazon accounts, Twitter says. It's unclear what if any impact the incidents will have on the future of cloud computing, the idea that documents and computing power can be stored ""in the cloud"" of the Internet rather than on desktops or laptops. Many tech blogs are weighing in on the hacking's impact. Some see the incident as an indication of serious security flaws at Twitter. Others say it's a sign Twitter has gotten big, and any rising company makes a good target for a cyberattack. People outside the Silicon Valley micro-blogging company, such as Twitter account holders, reportedly were not affected in the incident. ""This was not a hack on the Twitter service, it was a personal attack followed by the theft of private company documents,"" Twitter co-founder Biz Stone writes on the company's official blog. Google's suite of online applications, which allows users to share and store calendars, spreadsheets and text documents, is not to blame for the hacking, Stone said in the post, adding that Twitter continues to use Google Apps. ""This isn't about any flaw in Web apps,"" Stone writes. ""It speaks to the importance of following good personal security guidelines such as choosing strong passwords."" Security experts say it's best for users to create new passwords for each of their online accounts. The passwords generally should be complicated, combining letters, numbers and symbols. And they should be changed often. CNET, a tech site that partners with CNN, says the hack highlights how interconnected information is online -- and how vulnerable that setup is to attack. ""Although it seems that Twitter has been thrust into this situation a bit unfairly, a hack along these lines could have happened to the executives of more Web companies than anybody would like to admit,"" Josh Lowensohn and Caroline McCarthy write on the news site. ""What it really highlights is the extreme interconnectedness of the social Web: with the likes of e-mail contact importing and data-portability services like Facebook Connect now commonplace, a savvy hacker can have access to multiple accounts simply by accessing one."" Ken Colburn, a computer security expert, recently told CNN.com/Live  that Google Docs are ""as secure as anything you're going to do on the Internet. It's not any more or less secure than Microsoft Office."" Writing for Mashable, a blog that covers online social media, Stan Schroeder says the latest Twitter breach proves the micro-blogging site needs to address nagging security flaws. ""There have been so many problems [at Twitter] over the past couple of months that it's getting hard to keep track of them,"" he writes. ""It's time to fix it once and for all, because these security issues are a dark shadow looming over the otherwise bright future of this company."" Adam Ostrow, editor-in-chief at Mashable, says the hacking is ""another embarrassing moment in Twitter's torrid growth, but nothing that's likely to bring the house down."" Peter Kafka, senior editor at AllThingsD.com, offers another analogy. ""This looks roughly akin to having your underwear drawer rifled: Embarrassing, but no one's really going to be surprised about what's in there,"" he writes. Another debate happening online concerns TechCrunch's decision to publish some of the information stolen from Twitter. Arrington, of TechCrunch, writes that ""a few of the documents have so much news value that we think it's appropriate to publish them."" Still, ""there is clearly an ethical line here that we don't want to cross, and the vast majority of these documents aren't going to be published, at least by us,"" he writes. Some, including TechCrunch readers, have criticized the blog's decision to publish any of the information. Twitter has said it is seeking legal counsel on the matter. ""We are in touch with our legal counsel about what this theft means for Twitter, the hacker, and anyone who accepts and subsequently shares or publishes these stolen documents,"" Stone writes on the site's blog. Ostrow, of Mashable, writes that there's nothing ""really juicy"" in the Twitter documents. ""The bottom line seems to be this: your Twitter accounts are safe, but there are a number of documents that Twitter would rather not have published publicly in other people's hands,"" he says. ""But if you're expecting something really juicy (like, how Twitter plans to make money), you should probably prepare to be disappointed."" What do you think of the news? Are you worried about security and cloud computing? Do you use Google Docs and will you continue to? What about TechCrunch's decision to publish the info stolen from Twitter? Feel free to chime in with comments below.","A hacker allegedly broke into a Twitter administrator's personal e-mail account .

"Editor's note: Ralph J. Begleiter teaches communication, journalism and political science at the University of Delaware. During two decades as CNN's ""world affairs correspondent,"" Begleiter was the network's most widely traveled reporter. Ralph J. Begleiter says the Pentagon's new policy on media access to coffins of war dead is a milestone. NEWARK, Delaware (CNN) -- The reversal of two decades of policy on images of returning war casualties is an important and welcome milestone for the American people. The Pentagon's decision announced Thursday allowing media coverage of coffins of war victims returning to Dover Air Force Base -- if families agree -- restores to its rightful, honorable place the immense value of the sacrifice American troops make on behalf of their nation. It allows the American people to honor the dignified and respectful return of war casualties to home soil for the last time. Although no one should have a veto over the nation's ability to pay respects to its fallen troops, I believe most families will decide that their sons and daughters deserve to be recognized publicly for their sacrifice. These men and women enlisted in the military for their nation. They fought for their nation. They died for their nation. Their return should be respectfully and publicly acknowledged by their nation. The ban on images of returning casualties started accidentally, and without any reference to the ""privacy"" of the families of those who gave their lives in service to the nation. The accident of media history occurred in December 1989 when poor White House scheduling placed President George H.W. Bush before live television cameras just as the first American casualties were arriving at Dover Air Force Base from the U.S. invasion of Panama. CNN and two other major TV networks fired up their split-screen technology, showing on one side the president joking with White House reporters just before the Christmas holiday -- and on the other the sober images of flag-draped military caskets being carried ceremoniously by honor guards across the tarmac at Dover. After the holidays, the president appealed publicly to reporters to ""help me"" overcome a public impression that he had been insensitive on TV about the returning casualties. News media had been covering the return of war casualties since World War II. Some military personnel believe the showing of those images -- and others from the jungles of Vietnam -- contributed to a gradual growth of anti-war sentiment during the 1960s. Just days before the Gulf War began in January 1991, the new media policy was formalized in a cable sent by the Defense Department to its posts: There would be no media coverage of returning casualties at Dover or other stops along the way home. The directive made no mention of anyone's privacy but portrayed the ban on coverage of returning casualties as an effort to ease pressure on stressed families, who might feel obliged to travel to Dover to witness the return of their loved one with news media watching. Over the next decade, several exceptions were made to the ban on media coverage at Dover, including for the return of Navy personnel killed in the bombing of the USS Cole off Yemen's coast, just weeks before the election that brought the second President Bush into office. Ironically, throughout the ban on media coverage of returning casualties, the Pentagon continued documenting this important part of any war by assigning military and government contract photographers to take pictures of the flag-draped caskets. Those images, among the most poignant, respectful and dignified tributes to troops who died in service of their nation, were carefully maintained by the Defense Department. They were used for training of honor guards and for commemorating the significance of war casualties. Although taken by the government, those images were withheld from public view. From the aftermath of September 11, 2001, through the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, the Pentagon kept taking those pictures even as it expanded its ban on media coverage of returning casualties -- now arguing that such war images would somehow invade the privacy of families of the deceased troops. It was those images that a series of Freedom of Information Act requests pried loose in 2005 after months of legal skirmishing. (Those requests were initiated by Russ Kick, editor of a Web site called ""The Memory Hole."" When the Pentagon refused to respond substantively to my own series of Freedom of Information Act requests, the National Security Archive at George Washington University and I took the government to court with a lawsuit over the images.) Just weeks before a federal judge was expected to rule in the case, the Pentagon pre-empted a precedent-setting order by releasing voluntarily more than 700 images of returning casualties. They remain to this day available to the public on the National Security Archive Web site. At the time Kick and I were seeking to make the Pentagon's pictures public, major U.S. news organizations were busy suiting up to cover the invasion of Iraq; they did not engage their lawyers to ask for access to Dover to witness the return of those who sacrificed their lives in the war and they have declined to do so since then. The Pentagon policy, which had come into being over the embarrassment of a president, evolved after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, into a complete ban preventing the American people from seeing the most important single measure of the cost of war. So desperate, apparently, was the White House desire to block public view of such images that military photographers at Dover were ordered to stop documenting the returns. To my knowledge, since 2005, no further photos have been taken showing those emotional moments when a casualty touches home soil for the last time. The Obama administration's reversal of two decades of policy on the visibility of returning casualties should have two immediate effects: . Public opinion -- consistently supportive of making the war casualty images public -- has reached a new high. Most recently, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Thursday reported that 67 percent of those questioned said they think the government should allow the public to see photos of caskets of U.S. troops at an Air Force base. I have had the privilege of speaking with a number of family members who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan or Iraq. Most think the pictures should be public, but only after families authorize it. This dramatic change in government policy should once again allow all Americans to see the full human cost of war, while paying respect to those who served their nation as well as to their families. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ralph J. Begleiter.","Ralph J. Begleiter: U.S. policy on photographing war dead was result of coincidence .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- In an unprecedented move in Iranian politics, a reformist presidential candidate accused President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of tainting the country's image by questioning the Holocaust and by wielding a reckless leadership style. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who came to power in 2005, is seeking a second term in office. The frontrunners in Iran's presidential race clashed during a fiery debate broadcast to a national television audience on Wednesday evening. The verbal jousting between Ahmadinejad and opponent Mir Hossein Mousavi -- a former prime minister and reformist candidate who poses a threat to the firebrand Iranian president -- lasted an hour and half. Mousavi said Ahmadinejad's dictatorial ways have hurt Iran's image across the globe and could be a prelude to a dictatorship. ""There are two ways of confronting the country's problems,"" Mousavi said. ""One is through a management style based on adventurism, instability, play-acting, exaggerations, wrongdoing, being secretive, self-importance, superficiality and ignoring the law. The second way is based on realism, respect, openness, collective wisdom and avoiding extremism."" He said Ahmadinejad's denials of the Holocaust had repulsed Iran's allies. ""This has greatly damaged us,"" Mousavi said. The Iranian president called the Holocaust, in which six million Jews perished at the hands of the Nazis, ""a big deception."" Ahmadinejad also has lashed out at the United States and Israel, calling at various times for the end of Israel's existence as a Jewish state. In addition to Mousavi, two other challengers -- former parliament speaker Mahdi Karoudi, another reformist, and hard-liner Mohsen Rezaei, secretary of Iran's Expediency Council -- hope to unseat Ahmadinejad in the June 12 election. Neither took part in Wednesday's debate. The outcome of the election will set the tone for Iran's policies on crucial issues, including its nuclear ambitions and the possibility of bilateral talks with Washington. Wednesday night's event was the first of four debates that will pair two of the candidates against each other ahead of next week's presidential elections. Ahmadinejad, known for his attacks against his foes, accused Mousavi of colluding with Iran's former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Ahmadinejad, seeking a second term in office, accused the two Iranian figures of mismanagement, corruption and the masterminding of a plot to force him from power. ""I have tolerated all the personal insults and lies for four years and I forgive those responsible for them,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""But I do not have the authority to turn a blind eye when the people and the people's choice and their interests are insulted."" Ahmadinejad accused Mousavi and the two former leaders of standing against the Iranian nation and conspiring against him. Ahmadinejad said that, in the early days of his presidency, Rafsanjani sent a message to the king of a Persian Gulf state that said: ""Do not worry. This government will fall within six months."" Hours after the debate, Ahmadinejad and Rafsanjani met at a ceremony commemorating the death of Imam Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution that overthew the ruling monarchy in 1979 and established Iran as an Islamic republic. The meeting was cordial, with Rafsanjani holding on to Ahmadinejad's arm throughout their talk, the semi-official Fars news agency said. Rafsanjani, a powerful cleric who heads the Expediency Council and Assembly of Experts, remains an influential figure in Iran. He was president from 1989 to 1997 and then attempted to position himself in the political center in the 2005 elections, when he publicly favored a policy that would relax tensions with the United States. The two nations have had no diplomatic ties since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Rafsanjani lost to the ultra-conservative Ahmadinejad, who was then Tehran's mayor. Ahmadinejad's accusations against the former Iranian presidents mark a change in traditional politics, in that he named them. Normally, charges are made via innuendo. Though the targets are clear, they go unnamed. The change could indicate that he has the backing of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Analysts say that, without at least a nod from Khamenei, Ahmadinejad would not dare implicate members of Iran's powerful inner circle. Outside the TV station, supporters of both candidates stayed well after the debate had ended, chanting slogans and not fully dispersing until 4 a.m., according to the semi-official Fars news agency. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr in Tehran contributed to this story.","In a first for Iran, nation holds debates televised live ahead of presidential elections .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of Pakistani residents have taken up arms and are battling local Taliban militants in the wake of a deadly mosque attack last week. A Pakistani police stands guard at a checkpoint in Peshawar, Pakistan on June 8. It is the first major battle between the residents of northwest Pakistan and Taliban militants near the Afghanistan border. The residents are outraged over a suicide attack on a local mosque during Friday prayers that killed at least 40 people and wounded some 80 others. Starting on Saturday morning, some 400 villagers in the Upper Dir district formed a ""lashkar"" -- or militia -- to fight the Taliban, killing 14 of the militants as of Sunday evening, according to local administrator Atiq Ur Rehman. Four of the villagers have been injured in the battle, Rehman said. The militia have burned a number of houses thought to be sheltering the militants, according to Upper Dir police chief Ijaz Kahn. Both the residents and Taliban fighters are using heavy weapons, including rocket launchers and anti-aircraft weapons, Rehman said. There is a long history of Taliban presence in the area, including foreign fighters in leadership roles, local officials said. Authorities said Taliban fighters were driven out of Shot Ghas and Ghazigay -- two villages where the Taliban have support. The villagers took up arms against the Taliban after Friday's suicide attack at a mosque in Hayagay Sharqi -- a village in Upper Dir located about 35 km (22 miles) from the Afghan border and known for being against the Taliban. Upper Dir is a part of the Swat Valley, where the Pakistani military has waged a month-long operation against Taliban militants, but the district has not been part of the ongoing military offensive. The United Nations has said an estimated 2 million Pakistanis have been displaced by fighting between the Pakistani military and Taliban militants. The militants threatened to continue attacking cities in Pakistan until the military ends its operations against Taliban militants. As a result, Pakistani authorities have increased security in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital city. CNN's Ingrid Formanek and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report .","Upper Dir, part of Swat Valley, is where Pakistan army are fighting Taliban militants .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Despite a bleak economic environment featuring wide-ranging layoffs and rising unemployment, the nation's premier law enforcement agency is touting ""one of the largest hiring blitzes in our 100-year history."" The FBI is about to embark on its biggest hiring spree since immediately after the September 11, 2001. The FBI posted openings for 850 special agents and more than 2,100 professional support personnel. Officials say it's the largest FBI job posting since immediately after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The FBI's unexpectedly large number of job openings results more from attrition and a wave of retirements than from growing government appropriations, Bureau officials told CNN. The FBI routinely advertises openings for individuals with critical skills in computer science and language fluency. But John Raucci, assistant director of the FBI's Human Resources Division, says current needs are much more wide-ranging. ""We're also looking for professionals in a wide variety of fields who have a deep desire to help protect our nation from terrorists, spies and others who wish us harm,"" Raucci said. The lengthy list of openings includes positions in finance and accounting, security, intelligence analysis, training and education, nursing and counseling, physical surveillance, electrical engineering, physical and social sciences, and auto mechanics. Procedures for applying and a full listing of available positions are posted on the Web site fbijobs.gov. ""This is a great time to apply for a great job in the FBI,"" said the bureau's chief spokesman, Richard Kolko. Officials note at least a few jobs are currently available in every one of the FBI's 56 field offices across the nation. The FBI lists openings throughout the year, but seldom has anything close to the current number of available positions.

"(CNN) -- Latin American nations overwhelmingly rejected nearly 50 years of U.S. policy toward Cuba on Wednesday, voting at a meeting of the Organization of American States in Honduras to revoke the communist nation's 1962 suspension from the multinational group. Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales says farewell to Hillary Clinton at Wednesday's OAS meeting. Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales said at the end of the two-day meeting in the city of San Pedro Sula that the OAS had rectified a serious error. The United States led the push to suspend Cuba from the OAS at the height of the Cold War, also breaking diplomatic relations with the island nation in 1961 and establishing an economic embargo the next year. ""This is an important message to the whole world, not just our continent,"" Zelaya said, later adding, ""The Cold War ended today in San Pedro Sula."" The United States sought to obtain concessions from Cuba this year in exchange for readmission to the 35-nation group. In particular, the United States wants greater political and personal freedoms for the island's 11 million citizens. Cuba rejected any preconditions, with former President Fidel Castro saying this week Cuba had no interest in rejoining the OAS. Although the OAS lifted Cuba's suspension, Latin leaders did not automatically welcome the nation back. Instead, the OAS set up a mechanism by which Cuba could rejoin. Much of that dialogue will center on human rights. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was ""pleased"" with the outcome, which came on a voice vote with no opposition. ""The member nations of the OAS showed flexibility and openness today, and as a result we reached a consensus that focuses on the future instead of the past: Cuba can come back into the OAS in the future if the OAS decides that its participation meets the purposes and principles of the organization, including democracy and human rights,"" Clinton said in a statement. She attended the two-day meeting but left before the vote to travel to Egypt, where President Obama was to make a major address to the Muslim world Thursday. Some analysts agreed with Clinton's assessment. ""The OAS emerged from a heated debate with a constructive compromise that revokes an obsolete Cold War resolution suspending Cuba,"" said Robert Pastor, who was a Latin America national security adviser for President Carter in the late 1970s. ""But rather than invite Cuba to join the OAS, which Cuba said it would not do, it invited Cuba to initiate a dialogue on the purposes and principles of the OAS."" Others saw the vote as an outright rebuke for an outdated U.S. policy. ""I wouldn't say it was inevitable, but it was almost so,"" said Wayne Smith, who worked as a top level official at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba from 1958 to 1961 during the Cuban Revolution that brought Castro to power. ""The U.S. was totally isolated on this,"" said Smith, who also was the chief of mission at the U.S. interests section in Havana from 1979-82. ""The United States had some legitimate points on readmitting Cuba,"" Smith said, but went about it wrong. Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs policy institute, saw the vote as a personal defeat for Clinton. ""This will be presented in Latin America as a big defeat for Hillary Clinton because people are not ready to take a swat at Obama yet,"" Birns said. ""It was hers to win, but she managed to lose it."" The United States is being ""hypercautious,"" he said, rather than taking imaginative and bold steps toward normalizing relations. Analysts said many people in Latin America expected more from the newly elected Obama, who ran on a mantra of ""change."" Said Smith: ""The Obama policy has reflected so little change that the other countries are just fed up."" And many Latins gauge the United States -- long considered with suspicion, if not outright hostility -- by its stance toward Cuba. ""The road to rehabilitating relations with Latin America is through Havana,"" Birns said. ""That's something that the Latin Americans are very responsive to."" Heather Berkman, a Latin America analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm, saw the vote as ""a largely symbolic gesture that will have little impact in the short term either on improving democracy and human rights on the island, or on increasing the likelihood that the U.S. will lift the embargo of the island."" And the vote could have a backlash, she said. ""There will be a strong reaction among certain members of U.S. Congress who are passionately opposed to improving U.S.-Cuba relations while the Castros remain in power,"" Berkman said. That reaction was quick to come Wednesday. ""Today we witnessed an example of the Obama administration's absolute diplomatic incompetence and its unrestricted appeasement of the enemies of the United States,"" Cuban-American U.S. Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Florida, and Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Florida, said in a joint statement. ""The OAS is a putrid embarrassment."" Other Cuban-American members of Congress also released statements criticizing the vote. The United States provides about 60 percent of OAS funding, Berkman said, and some members of Congress have threatened to withhold the money if Cuba is allowed back into the organization. Some old Latin America hands agree that the OAS may have hurt itself. ""I never cease to be amazed at how destructive some of these Latin American leaders can be,"" said Otto Reich, who served in high-level Latin American posts for Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. ""They chose to revive something out of the Cold War."" The Latin leaders, Reich said, misread Washington. ""Some of these countries have further isolated themselves from the Obama administration,"" Reich said. ""It will be a long time before they regain the trust of the American government."" Reich, a strong anti-communist, also opposed the vote on ideological grounds. ""The problem is that the conditions that suspended Cuba still exist,"" he said. ""Cuba hasn't changed.""","OAS revokes a 1962 decision suspending Cuba's membership .

"(CNN) -- A U.N. special investigator called for the resignation of top Kenyan officials and sweeping changes in the country's security forces to end reported widespread killings by police across the African nation. The report urged President Mwai Kibaki to publicly acknowledge his commitment to ending the killings. ""The special rapporteur concluded that police in Kenya frequently execute individuals and that a climate of impunity prevails,"" Philip Alston said in a report a recently submitted to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. ""Most troubling is the existence of police death squads operating on the orders of senior police officials and charged with eliminating suspected leaders and members of criminal organizations."" The report calls for the resignation of Kenya's attorney general and the immediate replacement of the police commissioner. It also says Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki should publicly acknowledge his commitment to ending unlawful killings by the police. The Kenyan government expressed its ""deep displeasure"" with the report, questioning the special investigator's ""approach, conduct and method of work."" ""The government expresses grave concern regarding the allegations contained in the report by the special rapporteur,"" said Alfred Mutua, a spokesman for the Kenyan government. ""His questioning of the very basis of the Kenyan state and, in particular, its institutions is totally unacceptable and impinges on Kenya's sovereignty."" Alston also accused government security forces of torturing and killing hundreds of men in a March 2008 crackdown on a militia in the Mt. Elgon district, in western Kenya. And he said there was compelling evidence that what he called police death squads were operating in Nairobi and Central Province with a mandate to ""exterminate"" suspected Mungiki gang members. ""These are not ""rogue"" squads, but police who are acting on the explicit orders of their superiors,"" he said. The Mungiki militia, which is loyal to Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe, began as a religious sect, but over the years has morphed into a gang that runs protection rackets -- particularly in the slums. The U.N. investigator suggested Kibaki acknowledge the alleged police killings and commit to stop them. He also advocated creating an independent civilian police oversight body, and said the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court should investigate violence after the 2007 election. He urged the government to create a witness protection program as well. Alston, who investigates human-rights problems around the world for the United Nations, traveled to Kenya at the government's invitation. He stayed for 10 days in mid-February while 100 interviews were conducted in the U.N. member nation. There is hope for Kenya despite his criticism, Alston said. ""While the existing situation is bad, it is far from intractable,"" the report says. ""If it so chooses, Kenya can significantly reduce the prevalence of unlawful killings.""","Report: Police death squads operate on the orders of senior officials .

"(CNN) -- Sir Edmund Hillary has been laid to rest in New Zealand after thousands paid tribute to a mountaineer whose conquest of Mt Everest in 1953 was one of the 20th century's defining moments. A last farewell to Sir Edmund Hillary. Guests filled Auckland's Holy Trinity Anglican Cathedral and an overflow area next door for a service. Among the guests were politicians, mountaineers and friends. Lady Hillary sat with family and Prime Minister Helen Clark. In the congregation were members of Nepal's Sherpa community and Buddhist monks. In front of them, Hillary's coffin was draped in a New Zealand flag and covered in wreaths.  See photos of the funeral service Â» . As the service began, Sherpas laid Tibetan prayer scarves on the coffin. In Nepal, schools were due to ring bells as the service started. Hillary's son, Peter, told the congregation: ""Adventure was compulsory growing up in the Hillary household. He took us to the most extraordinary places."" His daughter, Sarah spoke of a childhood where Sir Edmund was planning expeditions, and coming home to a family eager to see him again. ""When asked at primary school what my father did, I was unable to find an answer."" Clark said: ""He was a role model for a generation of New Zealanders... We mourn as a nation because we know we are saying goodbye to a friend."" On Monday, New Zealanders filed past Hillary's casket as they paid final respects in Auckland's Holy Trinity Anglican Cathedral. Four soldiers, rifles at rest, stood guard as ordinary New Zealanders said goodbye to a national hero, whose achievements are known around the world. Hillary's widow attended the tribute, which featured Maori song and dance. Clark, called it a celebration of a ""very great"" life. Hillary, who was 88, died at Auckland City Hospital on January 11. On May 29, 1953, Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa guide, became the first men to climb the 29,035 feet to the top of Everest and safely return. Hillary, who served during World War II in the Royal New Zealand Air Force, began climbing while in high school and traveled to the central Himalayas to join a British party exploring the southern face of Everest in 1951. He returned in 1953, when he and Norgay made their ascent -- spending 15-30 minutes at the summit. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II on his return to England, but continued exploring -- reaching the South Pole by tractor in 1958, joining the first group to climb Antarctica's Mount Herschel in 1967 and boating east Himalayan rivers and the Ganges. His Himalayan Trust has helped build schools, hospitals and airstrips in Nepal since 1961. He was also a strong supporter of environmental causes and worked to improve the lives of Nepal's Sherpas.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Bombs in Baghdad and Baquba killed four people, two police officers among them, and wounded seven others Sunday morning, an Interior Ministry official said. A wounded Iraqi woman cries at a Baquba hospital after being caught in a blast Sunday at a police building. One death came about 9 a.m. when a parked car bomb detonated near the Buratha Shiite mosque in northwestern Baghdad. The blast apparently targeted a convoy belonging to an endowment that manages Shiite mosques in the war-ravaged nation. Three people were wounded in the explosion. A roadside bomb attack an hour earlier struck a police patrol in western Baghdad's Mansour district, the Interior Ministry official said. Two police officers were killed and four others were wounded, he said. In another attack targeting authorities, a suicide car bomber slammed into the emergency police headquarters in central Baquba about 9:30 a.m., a Baquba police official said. Twelve people were hurt in the blast, including three police officers. The blast also damaged the police headquarters and three civilian automobiles, the police official said. The suicide bomber was the only person killed in the blast. The U.S. military told CNN it has no evidence of a reported attack by al Qaeda in Iraq militants on an Iraqi village near Baquba on Saturday. A Baquba police official said at least 10 people were killed when the AQI insurgents raided the village of Adwaila -- home to both Sunni and Shiite Iraqis -- who have opposed al Qaeda, making the village a target. ""CF [coalition forces] and IA [Iraqi army] searched the area by air and by ground for several hours and found no evidence of this attack,"" Task Force Iron spokeswoman Maj. Peggy Kageleiry told CNN in an e-mail sent on Sunday. ""An IA team that was called to investigate the alleged incident was attacked by small arms fire and not anywhere on the scale described in the original report from the media."" The police official said al Qaeda in Iraq insurgents launched mortars into the village north of Baquba and then sent in dozens of fighters with small arms to storm the village. The police officials aid at least five homes were burned and destroyed. E-mail to a friend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Director of National Intelligence is replacing the agency's inspector general just days after the public release of a blistering report critical of the DNI's office. DNI head Dennis Blair announced Friday Justice Department official Roslyn Mazer will replace Inspector General Edward McGuire as the DNI's internal watchdog. The inspector general's role is to examine the operations of the office and investigate any allegations of waste, fraud or misconduct. Earlier this week, Maguire testified before Congress about his report on the state of the DNI's office, outlining rampant communication problems, continuing turf battles within the intelligence community and financial mismanagement. All of those problems were supposed to be addressed when the position of DNI was created by Congress in 2004 to look at the intelligence failures associated with the 9/11 terrorism attacks and the claims of Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. The classified inspector general report was completed in November 2008, but was not made public until this week. DNI spokeswoman Wendy Morigi said Maguire's departure has nothing to do with his report. She claimed Blair, who assumed his position two months ago, wanted to bring his own leadership team. ""The director appreciates the efforts and work of the previous inspector general and will continue to build on some of the suggested reforms,"" Morigi said.","Inspector General Edward McGuire is being replaced as DNI's internal watchdog .

"(CNN) -- Stumped on a tough decision? New Web sites are there to help. Hunch, a site open to the public Monday, asks questions and helps people make decisions. Hunch, a site that launches for the public Monday, will consider your quandary by getting to know you, asking you a series of questions and then spitting out three decisions. Another site, Let Simon Decide, makes a similar attempt. Caterina Fake, co-founder of the photo-sharing community Flickr, says she created Hunch not because people need help with emotional decisions but because it's too tough to find smart information online. You often have to replicate someone else's research, which is a waste, she said. Tech bloggers seem to be pleased with the effort. ""For the most part, I was impressed, though it quickly became clear that Hunch isn't capable of magically making up your mind for you,"" wrote Jason Kincaid, a reporter at TechCrunch, a technology blog. He called the site ""very clean and unintimidating."" Fake spoke with CNN about decision making, her nerdy past and the power of collective knowledge. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: Where did you get the idea for Hunch? Fake: It's a user-generated content site similar to Flickr, but the unit is not a photograph but a decision. And so it's sort of a similar thing in that way. We kind of built the system so people can contribute to it. They can ask questions on there and suggest questions. And then you sort of codify it into a decision tree. CNN: So you're answering questions about yourself? Fake: Well, there are two components. So you answer questions about yourself, and there's a little module that says things like, ""Alien abductions: real or fake?"" And what [Hunch] does is, it then puts together a profile of you, a taste profile. And then you can go into the system and ask it any question that's in the system. So it's things like, ""What HD-TV should I buy?"" or ""Where should I go to college?"" or, you know, ""Where should I eat in San Diego on a Saturday night?"" It could be just about anything. Once it kind of gets to know you, you can ask it questions, and then it gives an answer to you that it doesn't give to anyone else. CNN: What are the downsides? Fake: It depends on what the decision is. There is kind of an array of decisions that are too taste-oriented. Like, no matter how well we know you, we're not going to know that your backyard is like 25 feet by 10 feet, versus 10 feet by 10 feet [for a person looking to buy a backyard grill]. You know what I'm saying? There's no system that can get to know that. So what we try to do is narrow it down. So we ask you questions about your aesthetics or your beliefs or your politics or your demographic. CNN: What kind of decision-maker are you? Fake: It's really funny, because I think there's a mistake that's generally made with people asking about Hunch, and it's that it's solving people's emotional problems. And it's not. It's solving people's informational problems. I don't have any problems making any decisions. I've never had any problem making decisions, but when I go to Google and I'm looking for information, say, about trademarks. I have to do all this research, and somebody has already done this research. CNN: So you see Hunch as a kind of search engine, almost? Fake: No, it's not a search engine. The feel of it is nothing like a search engine. It's something new. CNN: How do you think collective knowledge online will change the way people live, or the way we interact with each other? Fake: It's like it's an amazing period in the history of the Internet just in that way. ... We know more in the collective than we do in the individual. It becomes even more amazing when you extend that out to people outside your social network. Like, I don't know anyone that has taken a yoga class in Romania. But I'm sure that if I ended up in Romania, and I wanted to sign up for a yoga class that somebody in the world would know three places to recommend me. The information is out there in a sort of disorganized fashion. ... These systems that are kind of growing up now -- and Hunch hopefully is among them -- are able to take this sort of collective knowledge and make it easy for people to use and easy for people to access. CNN: Is there anything in your background that influences your belief in this collective knowledge idea? Fake: I was a nerdy little girl. I played Dungeons and Dragons, and I had a little TRS-80 computer. It was really early on, I think it was, gosh, like 1994 when I first saw the Web, right? So I went online, and I saw these people uploading pictures of, like, their cats. And I remember there was a video cam of ... the famous coffee pot at the IBM research center that uploaded every 5 minutes to show that the coffee pot was full or empty or whatever. And so the Internet struck me as this incredible thing where anybody -- like anybody -- could publish anything, and then anybody anywhere else in the world could read it. And I never got over that. There was kind of this wonder, this sense of wonder that I had about this incredible culture of generosity on the Web -- of all these people sharing stuff with each other. I've always been so amazed by that. I love that. Like, I love that aspect of the Internet. That's the thing that always seemed like it was magic to me. CNN: What are some cool Web sites that are flying under the radar right now? Fake: Have you heard of Etsy? CNN: Yeah, is that where people buy and sell art? Fake: Yeah, it's great. I think it's gonna be like the next eBay. And I met those guys when they were really small. I've been helping those guys since it was three kids in a dorm room. I love those guys. It's one of my favorite companies. It has that same kind of ethic [as Hunch]: the power of the individual. There are like these housewives in the Midwest who had no idea they could make a living making Christmas ornaments or whatever. It's just kind of an amazing thing that can only happen on the Internet.","CNN talks with Caterina Fake, founder of a Web site that makes decisions .

"(CNN) -- Henry Joseph Madden was a good student and track team member in high school, but he had a secret: He sometimes wore his mother's pantyhose and underwear under his clothes. Dr. Jennifer Madden, a family physician, began her transition to being female at age 48. ""I really wanted to be a girl so bad, and that was one way for me to satisfy those feelings,"" Madden said. ""I always felt like someone was looking over my shoulder."" The desire to be female never went away. At age 48, Madden confessed these feelings to a doctor, and started seeing a gender therapist who suggested Madden was transgendered. Through reconstructive surgeries, electrolysis, laser procedures and voice lessons, Henry Joseph became Jennifer Elizabeth, known as Jenny. She is a practicing family physician in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Watch Jenny's story Â» . Chastity Bono, child of performer Cher and the late entertainer and politician Sonny Bono, announced Thursday the beginning of a transition from female to a male. While still relatively rare -- one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the American population is transgendered -- the idea of changing gender identity has become more widespread in recent years. The term ""LGBT"" (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) is more commonly recognized, and transgendered people have been portrayed in the 1999 film ""Boys Don't Cry"" as well as the 2002 book ""Middlesex"" by Jeffrey Eugenides. Many people who have transitioned, including Madden, say they knew they had been born into the wrong gender from childhood. As early as age 3, Dr. Julie Praus, born male, didn't understand why her father wanted to play catch. As a boy, Praus learned how to fish and hunt, but enjoyed collecting Depression-era glassware vases. Praus, 48, a psychiatrist in Brattleboro, Vermont, started living as a woman in March 2008. ""I get up every morning and say, 'Wow, I can actually look at myself in the mirror,' because I've never been able to do that in my life, because what would stare back at me was not me,"" Praus said. iReport.com: Share your story of gender change . Doctors speculate that there is a biological foundation to gender identity, but no one has determined what in the biological makeup determines that gender. The interactions between personality and culture also contribute to identity, said Chris Kraft, clinical director at the Johns Hopkins Sexual Behaviors Consultation Unit. The process of changing genders . For people who want a gender change on a biological level, the first step is therapy, experts say. Dr. Gary Alter, a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, California, said patients don't come to him until they've been in therapy, a process that can take as much as a year. A therapist then gives a physician approval to start the patient on hormone treatment. At that point, the patient may or may not start living as the chosen sex, Alter said. Females seeking to transition into males may elect to have their breasts removed via surgery. With testosterone, they will grow hair on their face and chest after about two years. Read one man's female-to-male advice to Chaz Bono . A higher percentage of males transitioning to females will go forward with genital surgery than females going to males, Alter said. Surgical methods for creating a penis -- which range from making one out of the clitoris to using the skin from the forearms -- are ""not perfect,"" and many patients are happy with just chest surgery, he said. Genital surgeries for creating female genitalia are better, he said. Alter's method is to make a clitoris out of the head of the penis, and make space for a vagina. Facing the rest of the world . It is rare for people to undergo a gender transition and then want to reverse it, especially when surgery is involved, experts say. Some say changing genders is one of the best things they've done, like Jamison Green, 60, author of ""Becoming a Visible Man,"" who went through chest reconstruction and genital surgery. ""I don't have too hard of a time telling people about it,"" Green said. ""I worried about that a lot in the beginning, before there was any kind of community and support about this condition, but one of the things I learned early on was that living in fear and shame is not very healthy."" Green, who started his transition at age 40, is now happily married to a woman whom he did not know before his change. Praus is also married to a woman, who knew her before her transition. Madden has a boyfriend. ""For the longest time, I really felt like I had a mental illness, and I don't feel that way anymore,"" Madden said. But all three have experienced shock and dismay from others around them. Green said his mother took five years to adjust. One of Praus' sons doesn't speak to her. Madden's marriage to a woman ended in divorce during her transition, and her children have struggled. Yet these three transgendered individuals say they feel better in many ways in their chosen gender roles. ""My patients say I'm a better doctor,"" Praus said. ""Some of it is that I'm not exerting so much energy hiding myself."" Psychologists recommend that people who change genders adopt a ""transgendered identity,"" and not keep their history of transition a secret. But some who ""pass"" as their new genders don't want to risk stigma, and tell only people closest to them, Kraft said. Often, males who transition to females face more problems than females who become males, Kraft said. Transgendered individuals who start as men tend to face more stigma, particularly if they are more noticeably transgendered. Transgendered individuals do face some legal quandaries. Some states require people to show proof of a medical procedure before changing gender on documents such as driver's licenses, while others require that the person has taken hormones, Kraft said. People may also elect to change their birth certificates to reflect chosen gender. Chastity Bono, who now goes by ""Chaz,"" has been a prominent gay-rights activist. ""You could speculate that that could make it more complicated -- when you're a public figure -- to take on something stigmatizing"" such as a gender transition, Kraft said.","Estimate: 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the American population is transgendered .
Doctors speculate that there is a biological foundation to gender identity .
People rarely undergo gender-reassignment surgery and then want to reverse it ."
"Editor's note: Rich Roll, one of Men's Fitness magazine's ""25 Fittest Guys in the World"" in 2009, was the first athlete to compete in the Ultraman World Championships on an entirely plant-based diet. He's sharing insights today as part of Dr. Sanjay Gupta's ""Four Months to Fitness"" effort. Before: At 40 years old, Rich Roll called himself ""fat, unhappy and fed up."" (CNN) -- I can still remember it, vivid as yesterday. It was the eve of my 40th birthday, and I walked upstairs to take a shower. And I was winded. I mean very winded. As I was trying to catch my breath, I took off my shirt, looked in the mirror and tried to convince myself that I was still that fit guy I had always thought I was. Somehow, I had been able to skate by on this delusion for all too many years. But the denial had finally caught up to me. I saw my true reflection, and I couldn't lie to myself anymore. I was in the worst shape of my life. I was fat, unhappy and fed up. It's the typical story. First it's the career. Then comes marriage, followed by kids. Your time is no longer your own, and you resign yourself to ""maturity,"" ""filling out"" or whatever euphemism for middle age that soothes that idea that you are simply overweight, unfit and unhealthy. I'm here to say that it doesn't have to be that way. I don't care how busy you are. I don't care how old you are, how many kids you have or how little time you think you have. The power rests within yourself to enact any change in your life you desire. And I can say this because I have seen it happen in myself and countless others. After that fateful day of clarity, I made a decision to change my life. Not a vague, wishy-washy notion that I should ""get in shape,"" maybe ""eat better"" or possibly ""go on a diet,"" but rather a specific long-term plan to enhance my wellness in a way that would not only stick, but fit within the parameters of my busy life as a full-time lawyer, husband and father of four small children. In my case, it began with a well-researched and supervised seven-day fruit and vegetable juice cleanse (during which time I weaned myself off caffeine), followed by an entirely plant-based nutrition program -- an animal-product-free regimen I have adhered to ever since. The immediate result was a rather surprising and unexpected increase in my energy levels, leading to a very gradual return to exercise, building up slowly over an extended period of time. The results were hardly overnight. But two years later, I had lost well over 30 pounds. And not only did I keep the weight off, I was the most fit I had ever been in my life. At 42 years old, I competed in the Ultraman World Championships, a grueling three-day uber-endurance triathlon circumnavigating the Big Island of Hawaii that involves 6.2 miles of swimming, 260 miles of cycling and culminates with a 52.4-mile double marathon run. I placed 11th overall and was the third-fastest American. To top it off, Men's Fitness magazine recently named me one of the ""25 Fittest Guys in the World."" (Not that I actually believe I deserve such an honor!) Quite an extreme contrast from that day I looked in the mirror. I'm not advocating that everyone should test himself or herself so severely. But my point is that change starts with a decision followed by baby steps along a new, consistent trajectory that, over time, can lead to dramatic results. I'm nothing special. I'm not a professional athlete. I'm just a normal family guy. But if I could experience such a vast transformation in my own life, I know with certainty that everybody has within himself the power to enact his own well-balanced transformation. Change is never easy. And despite what you may see advertised, I'm sorry to say there is no secret diet, mystery pill or overnight miracle that will do it for you. But there is a solution. Here are some helpful tools I employed along the way that can help you get started: . Set a goal: Vague, nonspecific notions of ""getting fit,"" ""going to the gym,"" or ""eating better"" are all fine, but they are not true ""goals"" and all too typically devolve, paving the way for relapse to old habits. Instead, establish something very concrete you would like to achieve on a future date. The more specific, the better. Then create a solid plan with reasonable interim ""steppingstone"" milestones along the way to achieving the larger goal. Chart your progress, as meeting interim milestones will boost your confidence and invest you more deeply in the ultimate goal. Create community and accountability: If you go public with your quest, then you are on the hook. A good support network is a key to success. But beware of the negative dream crushers. Be selective, surrounding yourself with people who encourage your success. Do what you love: When it comes to exercise, it shouldn't be too painful. Ideally, it should be fun. If you absolutely hate running, find something else you enjoy. Otherwise, you set yourself up to fail. And don't be too rigid -- mix it up with a variety of activities you like to keep it interesting and fresh. Don't diet: Instead, get honest about your habits and embark on implementing healthy, lasting changes in your nutrition. I feel quite strongly that a nutrition program built entirely around plant-based foods and completely devoid of animal products is optimal. Conventional wisdom would say that an athlete cannot perform on plants alone. But I am living proof that this is false, and I have ample research to support this position. Personally, I cannot overemphasize the difference this has made in my own life, a secret weapon for enhanced athletic performance and overall long-term wellness. (In the last two years, I have not gotten sick or even suffered a cold.) I realize, of course, that not everyone is ready to go 100 percent vegan, but a program built on a strong foundation of fresh organic vegetables, fruits and grains should be the focus. Don't skip meals, but reduce your portions slightly. Read the labels and educate yourself. Avoid saturated fats, processed foods and soft drinks, all of which are entirely devoid of nutritional value. Eating whole fresh foods high in nutritional content will also stave off those unhealthy urges to binge. One day at a time: Large goals can seem insurmountable. The idea that you can never eat a cupcake or sleep in again is daunting at best. Instead, just focus on what is happening today, even if it's hour to hour, and don't worry about tomorrow. ""Today, I'm not going to eat that cupcake. Maybe I'll eat it tomorrow, just not today."" And if you miss a beat, don't flog yourself; it only leads to discouragement and quitting altogether. The important thing is to make sure you get right back on it the next day -- don't let another day go by. Prioritize: Take an honest look at your average week, identify your inefficient uses of time and eliminate the things that don't serve your goals. No matter how busy you are, if you are truly honest about this inquiry, I guarantee you can make some cuts and carve out some time. Remember: Nothing changes if nothing changes. Be consistent: It's not about how much you do in a given workout or how hard it is. Ten minutes of core exercises four to five times per week is far better than one long run a week. Establishing a consistent rhythm of repetition is key, and another reason that your choice of exercise should be something you truly enjoy. Let's join together to shift the world's perspective on long-term health and wellness. No matter how old, overweight or out of shape you are, you have the power to make a decision, set a goal and create a plan. Positive change is always within your grasp, and today still remains the first day of the rest of your life. Make it count!

"(AOL Autos) -- Ah, that new car smell, that eau de car-logne; it does an ego good while it does a wallet bad. And now it turns out, it can do bad things to your health, too. Air freshners can contain aldehydes, esters and ketones, industry spokesman says. All these years, while we were being offered safety first, last and front, side and rear ways, hardly anyone in the vehicle industry had given much thought to what actually was in that perfume de profit, the new car smell that car buyers sought and bought. As everyone knew, pollution related to vehicles originated from the exhaust pipe, not the shifter knob. It was spewed out the back of the rear, not the back of the rear view mirror. Well, what everyone thought they knew was wrong. It turns out -- take a deep breath -- that most of that new car smell is not some carefully-compounded, luxury, feel-good incense to the Mammon gods. But the new car smell comes from toxic gases. Not only that, but like a two dollar cologne, the effects can linger and linger for years, stinking up not only your shiny new car, but the reputation of the entire vehicle industry itself. AOL Autos: Best new small cars . Who says so? Just about everyone in the vehicle business these days. But the initiator was The Ecology Center (EC), a membership-based, nonprofit environmental organization based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. AOL Autos: 10 most fuel-efficient new cars . In a 2006 industry-awakening report entitled ""Toxic At Any Speed: Chemicals in Cars and the Need for Safe Alternatives"", this independent green organization declared that much of the material in most car interiors that produce that new car smell is made with toxic chemicals known to pose major public health risks. The report went on to say that not only are vehicle drivers and passengers breathing toxic air, but are also in constant physical contact with dangerous chemicals leaching from just about every interior surface of a new vehicle. The report says these chemicals give off gases that not only contaminate the air, but also coat interior surfaces with toxic ""fog,"" generally seen as that new car film common to new car interior windshields and windows. These are the same type of chemicals that are, ""linked to birth defects, impaired learning, liver toxicity, premature births and early puberty in laboratory animals amongst other serious health problems,"" according to EC. Fake is probably as bad as real. The companies that market those ""new car smell"" products that are sold at car washes and auto accessories stores generally will not reveal product contents. One fragrance industry spokesman indicated they can contain artificial leather odor, plus aldehydes, esters and ketones, which are all organic or chemical compounds. AOL Autos: Safest cars under $30,000 . Back to real. We are not speaking of plastic doodads here. There is an average of 250 pounds of plastic in new cars, the largest portion used for interior seat cushions, arm rests, door panels, steering wheels, dashboards, wire insulation and the plethora of aircraft-type knobs and switch controls throughout a car's cockpit. AOL Autos: 10 least expensive new cars . In addition to acettonitrile, decanol, formaldehyde, naphthalene and carbon disulfide used in foams, adhesives and fabrics, the two major problem chemicals in most new vehicles are (a) the PBDEs, which are used as fire retardants throughout the industry and (b) phthalates, which are widely employed to soften PVC plastics. AOL Autos: Best financing deals of the month . Extended research by the Ecology Center covered samples from model years 2000 to 2005 made by 11 manufacturers. Part of the research showed significantly higher levels of PBDEs in those vehicles as compared to those levels in homes and offices that had been measured in previous studies, making in-car pollution a major source of indoor air pollution and health danger. In the resultant table of contamination levels, Hyundai rated lowest and Mercedes highest in PBDEs. Volvo rated lowest and Hyundai highest in phthalates. Not only are these toxic elements dangerous in any situation, but the combination of higher temperatures caused by the surrounding glass of windshields and windows and UV exposure from the sun can cause PBDE flame retardants to become even more dangerous with solar exposure, up to five times higher than in homes and offices. Imagine the gas chamber you're creating by also smoking in the car, Jack. Report coauthor and EC's Clean Car Campaign Director Jeff Gearhart wrote, ""We can no longer rely just on seatbelt and airbags to keep us safe in cars. Our research shows that autos are chemical reactors, releasing toxins before we even turn on the ignition. There are safer alternatives to these chemicals ... "" The Ecology Center called for these actions: . Manufacturers: Should phase out PBDEs and phthalates in auto material parts. Government: Should provide phase-out guidelines and provide technical assistance and research to vehicle manufacturers for development of alternatives. At a most recent count, nine states have passed laws banning two forms of PBDEs with at least six more coming aboard. Vehicle occupants: Should minimize health risks by using solar reflectors, ventilating car interiors with open windows and non-recirculating air conditioning and parking out of direct sunlight whenever possible. In other words, get rid of that new car smell. Although the automotive industry took notice of the report, there was no instant fire drill to rectify the status quo. Reaction to the report was slow-growing, but due to things green busting out all over, just about every vehicle manufacturer began to initiate research and development to reduce or eliminate built-in passenger compartment pollution. Actually, research on toxic chemical reduction and elimination had been underway for some time in the electronic and electrical industries. As far back as 2003, the European Union had passed legislation requiring the phase-out of PBDEs. Companies like Apple, Dell, HP, IBM, Panasonic and Sony have already eliminated PBDEs from their products. Addressing progress or lack of same in its recent Second Annual Report, the Ecology Center graded the country's eight leading car manufacturers on their plastics policies and practices. The report said that Ford and Honda had made the most significant improvements since the original findings and had joined Toyota as the three leaders in using ""safe"" plastics for indoor auto parts by (a) use of bio-based materials, (b) improving interior air quality and (c) reducing the use of PVC. Bio-based materials . Toyota led the group with a 'B' grade by developing an eco-plastic made from sugar cane or corn and building a pilot plant to produce it. DaimlerChrysler came in second through increased use of renewable materials, and Ford came in third for developing a soy-based foam and a bio-fabric for seating. Interior air quality . Ford headed this group with a B for having four vehicles certified to an independent allergy-free standard. Toyota got a C+ in this group for its goal to reduce in-cabin VOC (volatile organic compound) levels in all vehicles globally by 2010, but it's noted that Toyota didn't say to what levels they would be reduced. PVC reduction . Honda was tops with a B for removing PVC from most applications in its products. Also cited were Hyundai, Toyota and DaimlerChrysler for replacing PVC parts in some lines. But not all is mountain fresh air in vehicleland. While these studies show progress, vehicle manufacturers still have miles to go before the interiors of their offerings are safe from ""new car smell."" When grading the manufacturers that account for 94% of total vehicles in sales in the US, it resulted in the highest overall grade of a C+ for Toyota and a C for Ford, while the lowest score in this group overall was a D- for Volkswagen. Much of Ford's good grading came from its Volvo component. Volvo, which had the Ecology Center's lowest emissions of phthalates and a lower incidence of the flame retardant PBDE than in most other cars, actually led the Ecology Center to encourage other car manufacturers to follow Volvo's example. ""Safety is more than crumple zones and air bags,"" said a Volvo spokesman. ""All of our interiors comply with Oeko-tex 100, probably the toughest cabin standard being used today."" Oeko-tex 100 is an international environmental standard for textiles which demands that seat belts, carpets, thread and fabrics contain no harmful substances, that leather upholstery undergoes chromium-free tanning with natural plant substances and even smaller parts, such as handbrake buttons and steering wheel emblems, be tested as possible contact allergy sources. Finally, the greenies also found their share of doubting Thomases, or in this particular case, Hermanns or maybe Hanses. A group of German scientists decided to conduct their own tests of indoor vehicle pollution. They ran tests of volatile organic compounds originating from the interiors of vehicles and concluded that there was no evidence of toxic effects when they exposed human lab cell cultures to cabin pollutants. Although they declared their research showed no evidence of any health harm, the scientists didn't explain why so many people derive such pleasure from inhaling new car smell, which comes from alky benzenes, alkanes, formaldehyde and acetone. Or could it be that inhaling those fumes could lead the mind to such wondrous suggestions? Either way, now that you have the facts about that once-desirable, now-controversial new car smell, you can breathe easier. Well, maybe not.","Ecology Center study shows ""new car smell"" comes from toxic gases .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nearly two decades after the first Gulf war and six years after Saddam Hussein was removed from power, Iraq still is subject to 73 United Nations resolutions. A March 1991 photo shows burning oil wells in Kuwait damaged by Iraq military forces. Now Iraq's foreign minister says his country ""will not regain full sovereignty and independence without getting rid of these resolutions."" Speaking to reporters in Washington, Hoshyar Zebari said Monday that Iraq has paid ""billions"" of dollars under Chapter 7 of the U.N. sanctions placed on Iraq as a result of the 1990 Iraq invasion of Kuwait and subsequent war. The U.N. Security Council is reviewing the sanctions, and Zebari said he had ""intensive discussions"" in New York with members of the Security Council. He said ""I think the outcome is positive."" ""We felt a great deal of good will that, really, time has come for Iraq to get rid of all these restrictions and to regain its international standing and position as a normal country."" The Iraqi foreign minister said bringing Iraq out of Chapter 7 is an ""American commitment also"" since Iraq signed the status of forces agreement with the United States, which governs the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq, based on its understanding that the U.S. would help Iraq to come out of Chapter 7. Foreign Minister Zebari said the sanctions impose a heavy burden on Iraq -- it continues to pay 5 percent of its oil revenues to Kuwait, down from the initial 30 percent. Iraq's security forces, he told reporters, have ""proven they are capable of defending themselves and the country."" In the next six months, however, he said, the country faces some risks. ""What can be seen as problems could become crises unless this administration keeps its focus and support to push the situation forward; otherwise this overall strategy of responsible redeployment could be undermined."" If that happens, Zebari said, it ""will impact what the U.S. is doing in the Middle East, in the Arab peace process, with Iran, even in Afghanistan because Iraq is such a crucial player in the region.""","Iraq's FM says his country won't be fully independent until U.N. sanctions end .

The 82-year-old pope had surgery on his right wrist after he fell Thursday night, spokesman Father Federico Lombardi told CNN on Friday. The pope is ""learning"" to live with his cast, Lombardi told Vatican Radio. The most painful aspect of the incident for Benedict is having to give up writing by hand, which he had intended to do frequently during his annual vacation Italy's Val d'Aosta region, Lombardi told the official Vatican station. ""I know that here, too, in the Ivera region, many families are facing economic hard times due to a lack of work,"" he said, referring to the now-defunct Olivetti typewriter manufacturer in the region. ""Dear friend, do not be discouraged,"" he added, according to Agence-France Presse.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Seventh graders at Ron Clark Academy became an overnight sensation during the presidential election when their YouTube performance of ""You Can Vote However You Like"" catapulted them to online stardom. ""The higher the expectations, the higher the results,"" says Ron Clark, seen here with his students. Now, their creative and scholastic talents have proved the students to be more than just ""one hit wonders."" Academy students showcased their poetry and writings for CNN's documentary ""Black in America 2,"" hosted by Soledad O'Brien. Cultivating student creativity is just one of the goals of academy founder Ron Clark, an enigmatic educator known for his unconventional teaching methods. Under his strict tutelage, students at Ron Clark -- who are predominantly African-American -- are expected to excel in all subjects and maintain a high standard of respect for their peers and teachers. ""I'm teaching an eighth-grade curriculum to fifth-graders,"" says Clark. ""Some people say my expectations of the kids, academically, is too high, but the higher the expectations, the higher the results."" But with high academic expectations come an equally high quotient for fun. It's become one of Clark's trademarks: singing and dancing to popular rap and R&B songs during class to get the kids engaged. ""My first day at Ron Clark Academy, I thought all the teachers were psychopaths,"" says seventh-grader Jai Springs. ""I thought Ron Clark was going crazy. He was up in front of the kids on desks, he was dancing. ... I never saw a teacher get up on a desk and dance. But now I'm used to it, so I get up on the desk and dance too,"" says Jai. Clark, formerly a schoolteacher from South Carolina, founded the academy with money he earned from his book titled The Essential 55, which detail Clark's 55 golden rules for success -- in and out of the classroom. Clark was invited to be a guest on the Oprah Winfrey show after winning Disney Teacher of the Year Award in 2001. Oprah believed so much in the well-mannered Southern school teacher from South Carolina that she encouraged him to write the book. Later she promoted The Essential 55 on her show, prompting it's ascension to New York Times bestseller list. Together with co-founder Kim Bearden, Clark transformed a decaying factory in a rough part of Atlanta, Georgia, into a state-of-the-art educational model for middle schools across the country. Soon after the school opened its doors in 2008, a Christmas package from Winfrey arrived for Clark in the form of a $365,000 grant, or ""a thousand dollars for each day of the year,"" as Oprah referred to it in the letter. Then came the elections, with a tight presidential race between Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and John McCain of Arizona. Inspired by rapper T.I.'s hit song ""Whatever You Like,"" Clark's seventh grade class penned their own lyrics and dance moves. The students' performance carried a message: Cast your ballot because you support a candidate's policies rather than just his skin color. When they perform the song, half the seventh grade class touts the virtues of GOP's McCain while the other half root for Democrat Obama: ""Obama on the left. McCain on the right. We can talk politics all night. And you can vote however you like."" The students ""can talk politics with the best of them,"" says Clark. Video clips of the kids performing have garnered over 15 million hits on YouTube. ""We got lots of media attention. But when the media arrived to the school they realized the song is not the story, it's the kids,"" says Clark. One of Clark's credos is teaching a ""global curriculum"" with a heavy emphasis on current events. Himself an avid world traveler, Clark believes it's essential for his students to travel to other countries to develop an understanding and appreciation of the world in which they live. Through Delta's corporate sponsorship of the school, administrators have been able to send all 100 of their fifth to eighth grade students abroad before they graduate. ""I'm not nearly as shy as I used to be,"" says seventh-grader Chi Chi Kasarachi after her first year at the academy. ""My knowledge of the world has improved, I know more about what's going on in other countries and I'm more curious about things. ... I'm just hungry for knowledge,"" says Chi Chi. In fact, the students at Ron Clark Academy are better versed in current events and politics than many adults. ""I never thought I'd be interested in watching the news,"" says seventh-grader Osei Avril. ""Now I find it interesting because I have learned the stories behind the news,"" he says. Osei -- who pronounces Iranian President Ahmadinajad's name perfectly -- says he's interested in learning about world issues such as the Iranian elections, the Taliban in Pakistan, and the Palestinian- Israeli conflict. ""At the beginning,"" says Clark, ""the kids will say something like 'I've been to East Point [a suburb of South Atlanta]. After a few years they've been to Kenya, Japan, or South Africa, or England. ... They've become very comfortable with understanding the country and understanding themselves."" But it's not just the travel or even the singing and dancing to rap music that make the school so special, say the students. It's the academy teachers' creative ways of instilling education, solid values, and a passion for learning. ""They want you to pass the people at the top,"" says Jai. ""To be at the top nonstop, be at your fullest, to be creative, to think out of the box."" But school isn't all fun and games, she says. Clark is a strict disciplinarian that expects -- and enforces -- model behavior from all of the students. ""I love Mr. Clark with all my heart, he's like a father to me,"" says Chi Chi. ""He might fuss a lot, but I know he's doing it for our own good.""","Ron Clark Academy students' '08 YouTube rap performance got millions of hits .

"SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (CNN) -- Honduras' interim government on Sunday rejected a proposal to reinstate ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya, ending a round of negotiations aimed at resolving the country's political crisis. Jose Manuel Zelaya was ousted from the Honduran presidency on June 28. The proposal had been presented by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who was mediating the talks between the two Honduran sides at his home over the weekend. ""I'm very sorry, but the proposal you presented [is] unacceptable by the government of Honduras that I represent,"" Carlos Lopez, who was representing interim Honduran President Roberto Micheletti at the weekend negotiations, said of the proposal advanced by Arias. Representatives of Zelaya, who was ousted in a June 28 coup, said this marked the end of talks with Honduras' interim government. The weekend's talks were the second attempt by Arias to negotiate a resolution. He vowed Sunday to continue his mediation efforts. ""I want to take 72 hours to continue working, even more arduously this time, to see if we can really reach an agreement between the parties in this conflict,"" Arias said. Arias expressed concern that violence could ignite in Honduras if the sides stop talking, and that a civil war could result. Shortly after announcing the end of the negotiations, Lopez indicated in an interview with CNN en EspaÃ±ol that Micheletti's delegation would be open to further talks in the future. At a news conference later Sunday, the head of the Organization of American States said he had been enthusiastic about the proposal advanced by Arias. ""We regret deeply the attitude of Micheletti,"" said OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza. ""I think [the proposal] was a good one."" The proposal, presented by Arias to both sides on Saturday, would have returned Zelaya to the Honduran presidency. It would also have compelled Zelaya to abandon efforts to modify the country's presidential term limits. In remarks to reporters before starting Sunday's talks, representatives of Zelaya said he accepted the seven-point proposal. Micheletti has said he would not accept Zelaya's return as president, and remarks by Zelaya printed in a Brazilian newspaper contradicted Zelaya's acceptance of the proposal, Micheletti negotiator Arturo Corrales said. In Sunday's editions of the Folha newspaper, Zelaya was quoted in support of continuing with his push for a reform to term limits. ""We cannot betray the people and abandon the process,"" the paper quoted Zelaya as saying. ""Yesterday they said one thing, and today another,"" Micheletti negotiator Corrales said, adding that Zelaya's remarks broke the good faith behind the talks. The newspaper, however, noted that Zelaya was interviewed one day before he agreed to Arias' seven-point proposal. Zelaya was removed from office June 28 in a military-led coup that has drawn international condemnation. Congressional leader Micheletti was sworn in hours later as provisional president. Micheletti and his supporters, including the Honduran supreme court, congress and the military, argue that the action was not a coup, but a constitutional transfer of power. Other steps proposed by Arias included moving up elections scheduled for late November, establishing a national unity government, providing amnesty for all political crimes and setting up an international commission to oversee implementation of the accord. Under Arias' proposal, oversight of the Honduran military would have switched from the executive branch of government to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal one month before the elections. Delegations representing Zelaya and Micheletti also met at Arias' home in Costa Rica last week but did not reach an accord. Zelaya, a leftist who took office in 2006 on a narrow victory, had been at odds with Honduran lawmakers, the country's supreme court and the military over his attempts for a referendum. He sought the referendum, which he planned to hold last month, to see if voters wanted a measure on November's ballot to establish a constitutional assembly to study whether a president could run for re-election. Under the current charter, a president can serve only one four-year term. Congress had forbidden the referendum and the supreme court ruled it illegal. The military declined to participate in its usual role of safeguarding the vote, saying it could not take part in an illegal act. Zelaya vowed to hold the vote anyway, but was toppled before the voting started.","Talks between Honduras' interim government, ousted president end without deal .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- While many now recognize the scientific explanation for a solar eclipse, the phenomenon is still marked with tradition and sometimes suspicion in Hindu-majority India. People test the ""sky watching telescope"" at the Gujarat Council of Science City in India. The ""exceptionally long"" eclipse that will cross half the planet Wednesday will be able to be seen by virtually all of the population of China and India. For beggars in India, the occasion means an extra day of receiving alms and food. The panhandler in Sandeep Jaggi's neighborhood normally visits the block every week on Tuesdays and Saturdays, as well as the days of a new and full moon. And because his patrons mark an eclipse with alms-giving, prayers and bathing, he rarely misses the chance to meet them on this day as well. ""It's a family tradition and I follow it,"" says 34-year-old Jaggi. He will fill the beggar's small steel pail with mustard oil and coins and his disheveled sash with lentils. For others in the country, the eclipse is not a reason to celebrate, but a more ominous phenomenon. Send us your photos of the eclipse . Most pregnant women hope to avoid giving birth during an eclipse. ""None of the expectant mothers under my treatment are willing to have deliveries on Wednesday,"" Shivani Sachdev Gour, a gynecologist at New Delhi's Fortis La Femme hospital, told CNN. In fact, there are critically ill patients who do not want to be in the hospital on the day of the eclipse, she said. Indian astrologers even advise expectant mothers to stay indoors when this celestial event occurs. ""It may not cause any physical harm to the baby, but it may affect the child's overall personality,"" said R.K. Sharma, who describes himself as a ""remedial astrologer."" A solar eclipse, he says, weakens the sun god temporarily because of an encounter with dragon Rahu and leaves some cascading results everywhere. ""Bathing in holy rivers and ponds during this time thus helps protect health and develop positivism and greater will power,"" he explained. About 1.5 million people are expected at one such pond -- the Brahmsarovar, or the pool of Hindu god Brahma -- in northern India on Wednesday. ""They offer prayers to the sun god and take holy dips during an eclipse,"" said Ashok Kumar Bansal, the sub-divisional magistrate of Kurukshetra, an ancient Hindu city. But the century's longest total solar eclipse is not just about the dragon-sun combat, it also means business for some. Travel firms in India have plans in place to cash in on the phenomenon. Cox and Kings India has a planeload of eclipse watchers heading for the eastern state of Bihar, one of the most preferred locations for sighting the event. The plane will hover over Gaya in Bihar and return to New Delhi the same day, company spokesman Thomas C. Thottathil told CNN. Passengers were given two options: to book a ""sunside"" seat facing the eclipse for about $1,640, or reserve an ""earthside"" seat for about $610, Thottathil added. ""And it's a sold out flight now!"" he said.","Solar eclipse marked with tradition and often suspicion in Hindu-majority India .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- A federal judge ordered 10 municipal police officers arrested Saturday in connection with the slayings of 12 off-duty federal agents in southwestern Mexico, the attorney general's office said. The recent spate of violence was sparked by the arrest of high-ranking drug cartel member Arnoldo Rueda Medina. The federal officers' bodies were found Tuesday on a remote highway in Michoacan state, where at least 18 federal agents and two soldiers have been killed since July 11 due to drug-related violence. Video from the scene showed three signs, known as narcomensajes, or narcomessages, left by the killers. They all stated the same thing: ""So that you come for another. We will be waiting for you here."" The officers arrested Saturday are on the police force in the city of Arteaga. Mexican President Felipe Calderon, whose home state is Michoacan, responded to the violence by dispatching 1,000 federal police officers to the area. The infusion, which more than tripled the number of federal police officers patrolling Michoacan, angered Michoacan Gov. Leonel Godoy Rangel. He called it an occupation and said he had not been consulted. Authorities said Wednesday they were searching for the governor's half-brother, who they say is a top-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana drug cartel. The cartel is blamed for most of the recent violence in the state. The governor's brother, Julio Cesar Godoy Toscano, was elected July 5 to the lower house of Congress. The governor has publicly urged his brother to surrender. There were no reports of his apprehension as of late Saturday. The sudden spike in violence followed the arrest July 11 of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, described as a high-ranking member of La Familia. La Familia members attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda shortly after his arrest, authorities said. When that failed, cartel members attacked federal police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities. Under Mexican law, the officers arrested Saturday will be held for 40 days while officials determine whether to formally charge them.","Officers arrested Saturday are on the police force in the city of Arteaga .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Video showing Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl, captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan, is just another example of how captors use the medium for psychological warfare. U.S. Army Spc. Shoshana Johnson, who was held by insurgents in Iraq, prepares to enter a plane to safety. The latest video shows Bergdahl, of Ketchum, Idaho, looking comfortable and eating food. While he expresses concern about not seeing his family and girlfriend again, he does appear to speak calmly and has no visible signs of abuse. ""I have a very, very good family that I love back home in America, and I miss them every day that I'm gone,"" he says in a 28-minute video released by his captors. ""I miss them, and I'm afraid I might never see them again and that I'll never be able to tell them I love them again. I'll never be able to hug them."" But that is in stark contrast to the well-publicized captures of U.S. servicemen and women in conflicts past. Vietnam . Sen. John McCain, whose plane was shot down during a combat mission over Vietnam in 1967, is considered one of the most famous prisoners of war. He was captured by the Communist Viet Cong and spent nearly six years in a prisoner of war camp, where he was often tortured. A grainy black-and-white film released by his captors showed a severely injured McCain talking on camera in the so-called ""Hanoi Hilton."" McCain later refused to be released before other prisoners. He eventually returned to the United States in 1973. ""During the years, we were kept in solitary confinement or two or three to a cell because they didn't want us to see each other. We'd spend all our time tapping on the walls to each other and encouraging each other and organizing, organizing, organizing with our chain of command. The days and hours go by,"" McCain told CNN's John King last year. Iraq . And most recently, in 2003, video from Iraq painted a picture of an unruly and chaotic terror organization holding U.S. soldiers captured in the Iraq military theater. Army Spc. Shoshana Johnson was shown on videotape being interrogated -- with five other soldiers including Pfc. Jessica Lynch, who was badly wounded and was held prisoner at a separate location. Nine of their fellow soldiers were killed when their convoy was ambushed. Johnson appeared frightened, with her eyes darting quickly left and right. ""I was terrified. I didn't know what was going to happen to me,"" Johnson said in a past CNN interview. ""And I was in a lot of pain."" Lynch's videotaped rescue made her a celebrity, and she was used by the Pentagon to put a face on the men and women who were fighting the war against the regime of Saddam Hussein. Johnson and the other POWs spent 22 days as prisoners until Marines rescued them. Chris Voss, a former lead international kidnapping coordinator for the FBI, says that as a lesson from the Johnson video, the Taliban may have learned to try to appear more political than radical. ""They're hoping that ... this gets to other media outlets that will make them appear so that they are a reasonable political force,"" he says. ""There is very much a lack of overthreat in the [Bergdahl] video, and they clearly thought this through ... specifically strategic for these purposes."" Somalia . Army Chief Warrant Officer 3 Michael Durant, a Black Hawk helicopter pilot, was shot down in 1993 during a combat mission in Mogadishu, Somalia. The body of one of his fellow pilots being dragged through the streets was captured on video. After the crash, he was captured by a mob and held for 11 days. Durant suffered several serious injuries, including a broken back and face and leg wounds. He was later released. His bloodied and bruised face was splashed on the covers of several national magazines, including Time and Newsweek, and on TV networks. His story later inspired Mark Bowden's bestseller ""Black Hawk Down"" and a movie by director Ridley Scott. Voss says his image was depicted in a different way than others had been. ""The media picked that up and ran in a way that was very accusatory towards the United States,"" he says. ""There were pictures of Mike Durant in a clearly beaten-up condition, and the captions in the various national magazines were, 'What in the world are we doing?' "" Voss says that from that incident, the United States may have learned to apply the mostly mum stance it's using during the Bergdahl capture. ""The U.S. government gave a knee-jerk reaction to that, which I think they've learned from,"" he says. ""So how this plays out in the media, the Taliban is being very cautious to appear to be reasonable ... because they don't want to make themselves look like they're fanatical. They are trying to be very reasonable.""","Army Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl was captured nearly three weeks ago in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Alicia A.S. Duque knew she had some pounds to lose, but she had no idea how much being overweight affected her until the television cameras started rolling. Alicia Duque performs with her partner on Oxygen's new hit ""Dance Your Ass Off."" ""Going into it, I knew it was a TV show, I knew it was a weight-loss show and I knew it was a dance show, but I didn't think I was going to learn so much about myself through the process,"" said the 23-year-old Duque, a contestant on the new show ""Dance Your Ass Off."" ""I didn't know how many issues and problems I had with my weight until I faced it on the show."" Duque's struggle with weight loss is one of many on television that is resonating with those tuning into programming aimed at and featuring the plus-sized. Style Network's ""Ruby,"" NBC's ""The Biggest Loser,"" Lifetime's ""Drop Dead Diva"" and Fox's forthcoming dating show ""More to Love"" all center on the overweight and are tapping into an audience that can relate to the desire to shed a few pounds. Obesity has risen dramatically in the United States during the past 20 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And this year television has seen an increase in shows featuring participants and stars who look more like the viewing public. Oxygen Channel's ""Dance Your Ass Off"" combines elements of ABC's ""Dancing With The Stars"" and NBC's ""The Biggest Loser."" Contestants learn dance routines for which they are judged before weighing in to determine how much they have lost. Amy Introcaso-Davis, senior vice president of original programming and development at Oxygen, said dance and diet are two areas of interest for younger viewers of the channel, so combining the two made sense. The 12 contestants, from the smallest to the largest, have struck a chord with viewers, she said. ""People find the contestants so relatable,"" she said. ""We cast very purposely across the board in terms of how many pounds people needed to lose -- we had anywhere from people who needed to lose 40 [pounds] to over 150."" The premier of ""Dance"" rated highly for Oxygen, with more than 1 million viewers tuning in. Oxygen also found success earlier with ""Mo'Nique's F.A.T. Chance,"" a plus-size pageant where women of substance strutted their stuff to be crowned ""Miss Fabulous And Thick."" For a nation grappling with obesity, Introcaso-Davis said, there is a hunger for such shows. ""If you have five pounds to lose or you have 150 pounds to lose, it's something you think about all day long,"" she said. ""You take a bite of cheesecake and you think 'Should I be doing this?' "" Esther Rothblum, a professor of women's studies at San Diego State University and co-editor of the forthcoming anthology ""The Fat Studies Reader,"" said she wonders if part of the appeal of plus-sized shows stems from the overweight being held up for public ridicule. The subject of her book is an emerging field that has been defined as ""confronting and critiquing cultural constraints"" against notions of ""fatness"" and ""the fat body."" ""Most people feel too fat in this country and are made to feel very unhappy with their bodies,"" she said. ""So by portraying somebody who weighs so much more than they do, it's almost a way to make the audience feel like 'I could look worse' or 'At least I'm not them.' "" Ruby Gettinger said she supports any show that does not mock the overweight. Her hit show ""Ruby"" started out as a documentary and has transformed Gettinger into a reality star who has lost more than 100 pounds and appeared on ""Oprah."" ""We are really all on this journey together, and I tell [viewers] that all of the time,"" said Gettinger, who at her heaviest weighed 716 pounds. ""There are a lot of shows out there and I think people are trying to find a way to beat it and lose weight."" Gettinger, who is traveling around the country walking in various cities to inspire fans to become more active, said shows featuring the obese can really touch the audience if they are authentic. ""[My show] is the truth, not to say that the others aren't,"" she said. ""When I started out on this journey and met with Style [Network, which airs the show] I said 'I have to keep my truth because this is about my journey and addiction and I want to deal with that because too many people are struggling.' "" Her show portrays her grappling with everything from temptation to embarrassment at having to visit the gynecologist, but Gettinger said it's all worth it if it inspires others. Actress Marissa Jaret Winokur, who starred in the Broadway musical ""Hairspray,"" said she agreed to host ""Dance Your Ass Off"" because she saw the potential for inspiration in viewers witnessing overweight people being active and feeling confident and sexy -- even in skimpy dance outfits. Reality television has become so popular because viewers are attracted to watching real people, and there is a craving for viewers to see folks like themselves, she said. ""It became that so many people on reality shows were only beautiful skinny people, and I think a lot of people got sick of that,"" said Winokur, who has been blogging about her own struggles with weight for People magazine. ""Really, who's home watching TV is the everyday person who is not a TV model. I think there is much more interest in watching people like yourself.""","Shows about and featuring the overweight are flourishing .

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina man is accused of arranging to have his wife raped through personal ads on the Web site Craigslist, police said Wednesday. The 25-year-old man, of Kannapolis, North Carolina, was arrested in connection with the incident that occurred at his home early Sunday, police said in a statement. Police responded to the home at about 2:45 a.m. after receiving a 911 call indicating a male armed with a knife appeared in the couple's bedroom and sexually assaulted the man's wife, authorities said. The man was present at the time of the assault, and two young children were in the home, but were unharmed and unaware of the incident, the police statement said. ""During the investigation, investigators interviewed the victim and her husband,"" the statement said. ""Investigators became suspicious when they noticed there was no sign of forced entry to the home. Investigators also developed information that led them to note specific inconsistencies in the initial statement provided by [the man]."" But on Tuesday, police found that the man ""had responded to at least two personal ads on Craigslist.com in an effort to arrange for someone to come to his home and have sex with his wife using some type of scare tactic."" ""Investigators believe [he] arranged this incident without the knowledge or consent of the victim,"" the police statement said. The woman was taken to a hospital after the assault, where she underwent a forensic examination and was interviewed, police said. She suffered no serious physical injuries and was released shortly afterward. Police did not release the identity of the victim. CNN is not naming the victim's husband in an effort to avoid identifying her. The incident remains under investigation, police said. The man faces charges including first-degree rape, two counts of first-degree sexual offense and one count of attempted first-degree sexual offense, according to the police statement. Kannapolis is about 26 miles northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina.","Police: Man arranged wife's rape through ads on Craigslist.com .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two federal agencies warned consumers Friday not to eat raw Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough. Consumers are advised to throw out all prepackaged, refrigerated Nestle Toll House cookie dough products. The company said it is recalling an estimated 300,000 cases of the dough as a precaution after reports of food-borne illness in 28 states. There are concerns that the premade dough may be contaminated with the bacterium E. coli 0157:H7, which causes abdominal cramping, vomiting and diarrhea, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Young children and the elderly can suffer more serious symptoms. Nestle issued a statement saying, ""While the E. coli strain implicated in this investigation has not been detected in our product, the health and safety of our consumers is paramount, so we are initiating this voluntary recall."" According to Nestle spokeswoman Laurie MacDonald, raw dough was one of the things the sick people reported eating. ""The health and safety of our consumers is our No. 1 priority,"" she said. ""We felt the best thing to do is a voluntary recall."" She said the company was informed by the FDA Wednesday night ""and immediately took action."" ""We really want to remind consumers that raw cookie dough should not be eaten,"" she said. Since March, the CDC says, 66 people have become sick in 28 states after eating raw cookie dough. Twenty-five people were hospitalized. No one has died. The FDA and the CDC say people who have become sick after eating refrigerated Toll House cookie dough should contact their doctors. They advise consumers to throw out all prepackaged, refrigerated Nestle Toll House cookie dough products. Retailers and restaurateurs should not sell or serve any Toll House cookie dough products, the agencies said. The company said the market share for Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough for the most recent 52-week period was 41 percent. The recall does not include already-baked Toll House cookies, varieties of Toll House morsels, chocolate baking bars or cocoa or Dreyer's and Edy's ice cream products with Nestle Toll House cookie dough ingredients.","300,000 cases of Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough being recalled .

"(CNN) -- When Neil Armstrong took one small step onto the moon in 1969, it seemed only a matter of time before the advent of thriving space colonies and summer vacations on distant planets. But after an initial flurry of moon landings, manned lunar expeditions dwindled: the last time an astronaut left his footprints on the moon was in 1972. Plants such as lettuce, peppers and tomatoes will be on the menu at Moon Base One. Then, in January 2004, President Bush announced NASA's intention to return humans to the moon by 2020, and in 2006, NASA announced plans to set up a manned lunar outpost by 2024, with the European and Russian Space Agencies now planning bases of their own. After years in limbo, the dream of living in space is alive once more. Sustaining long-term space habitation presents space agencies with a whole new set of technological and logistical challenges. Currently, the International Space Station supports three astronauts in a low Earth orbit, with food supplied periodically by space shuttle. But, just as home cooking is cheaper than getting takeout, when it comes to more permanent settlements, this kind of supply voyages would be prohibitively expensive: we will need to grow our own food in space. Raymond Wheeler, a plant physiologist at Kennedy Space Center, explained to CNN, ""In the near term it's not needed, for example on the space station and initial short sorties to the moon, but as you go further and stay longer, regenerative systems become much more cost effective."" Wheeler sees this development of space farming as a gradual process in which space outposts become increasingly self-sufficient. ""It would probably be evolutionary,"" he said. ""The first human missions to Mars might set out with everything stowed, but they might set up the beginnings of an in-situ production system -- maybe a plant chamber -- that you could use to grow perishable foods. You wouldn't be providing everything, but in subsequent missions if you returned there you could expand the infrastructure."" Of course, this means growing plants in conditions very different from those on Earth. Yet research has shown that plants are surprisingly adaptable. For example, while plants normally use gravity to direct the growth of their stems and roots, in low gravity conditions they can use light to orient themselves. And research suggests that plants can grow well even at very low atmospheric pressures. That reduces the leakage of oxygen and carbon dioxide from their growth chamber out into space, but crucially, it also reduces the structural requirements of a ""space greenhouse,"" meaning less construction material needs to be shipped into orbit. Nor is the absence of soil a problem. Many supermarket vegetables are already grown hydroponically in nutrient-enriched water, and research indicates this technique could work well in space. Some have even suggested the loose rock regolith on the surface of the moon or Mars as a growing medium, although additional minerals would need to be brought from Earth. So what's on the menu at Moon Base One? Well, initial crops would need to be small in stature and grow well in controlled environments with artificial light. Plants such as peppers and tomatoes are already extensively grown hydroponically, while lettuce, with its short lifecycle, would yield fast returns for pioneering space colonists. But again, Wheeler sees the choice of crops as part of an evolutionary process. He tells CNN, ""The first things you might grow would be perishable foods -- maybe vegetables or fruits -- things that don't keep very well if you're on a journey to Mars. Even though you're not providing a lot of calories, these things could have a strong impact in terms of adding color, flavor and texture to the diet."" ""The other reason for considering freshly consumed foods on early missions is that they don't require any processing,"" he continued. ""If you were to grow grains, like wheat, you'd have to thresh the seed out of the head, then clean it and mill it to make flour. Staple crops like wheat, soy bean, rice and potato -- things that would provide carbohydrates, protein and fat -- they're the final end point."" Crops need a sheltered environment, protected from the extreme temperatures and frightening levels of radiation found on the moon's surface, with water, carbon dioxide and light. Researchers at the University of Arizona's Controlled Environment Agriculture Center (CEAC), in collaboration with Sadler Machine Company (SMC), have come up with one solution: to house plants and astronauts in an inflatable habitat. They are working on a full-scale prototype Mars Inflatable Greenhouse. Space-worthy inflatable structures have been around since the 1960s and are lightweight, compact in transit and easy to assemble on landing. But what's novel about the CEAC design is that it incorporates a bio-regenerative life-support system -- the kind of technology that could one day not only feed an outpost on the moon or Mars, but also provide it with oxygen and recycle its water. Gene Giacomelli, Director of CEAC, told CNN, ""If people get to Mars we want to be able to feed them, but maybe even more importantly revitalize the atmosphere -- allow the plants to consume the carbon dioxide as they do so well here on Earth, and provide oxygen."" In the prototype designed by Phil Sadler (SMC) and evaluated by Giacomelli and graduate student Lane Patterson, plants are grown hydroponically. As water evaporates from their leaves, air moisture is condensed and re-used for irrigation. The inedible bits of plants, the stems and leaves, are fed into a composter that breaks down the biomass, releasing carbon dioxide that can be re-used by growing plants. In a working moon base, waste water from the astronauts' showers and laundry could also go into the composter, where it would be cleaned by microbes and then used in the plants' hydroponic system, before being condensed and re-used by the astronauts once again. The CEAC team intends to test the finished prototype in Antarctica, a harsh and remote environment that provides a realistic analog of conditions on the moon. The team has already provided a food growth chamber for the Amundsen-Scott South-Pole Station and the time Sadler and Patterson have spent there has provided a unique insight into some of the other benefits that bio-regenerative life support might provide for inhabitants of a space base. ""It's not just oxygen, fresh water and food that it provides, but it's also the green, living plants that psychologically become so important to people living and working in a confined, harsh, black and white space at the South Pole or in a moon or Mars base,"" says Giacomelli. Patterson adds, ""Bright lights, high humidity, green plants and the fragrance as well -- these are things that are missing in that environment. Those things shouldn't be underestimated."" The CEAC project offers a tantalizing glimpse of the kind of habitat that may house settlers in the space colonies of the future. And perhaps one day, as you relax in your inflatable villa by the Sea of Tranquility, plants will provide much more than just your dinner. ...................................................................................................................

"(CNN) -- No drawn butter will ever touch Fiona's tail. She's an extremely rare, seven-year-old ""yellow"" lobster. Fiona's colorful hue makes her a one-in-30 million rarity.

The special lobster was caught off the coast of eastern Canada last week by a friend of Nickerson. ""In 57 years in Cape Cod, I have never seen a yellow lobster and I doubt that I will ever see one again,"" he said Thursday. Experts say Fiona's colorful appearance makes her one in 30 million. Fiona's not really yellow, but more of a bright orange, She's not quite the red color your typical lobster looks after it's been cooked.

"(CNN) -- We all know what happens when urban sprawl gets out of control: Commutes back up, smog thickens, and concrete suburbs gobble up green spaces. The oceans are growing crowded, and governments are increasingly trying to plan their use. But what about ""ocean sprawl""? Until recently, no one gave that idea much thought. But the oceans, like the land, have gotten crowded, and now scientists and policy makers are looking for ways to plan ocean development -- with the aim of preventing our public-owned seas from turning into sprawling, watery versions of Houston, Texas, or Atlanta, Georgia. ""The oceans are kind of the last frontier for use and development,"" said Amanda Leland, ocean policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. ""Even in the 1970s we thought that the oceans were limitless resources of fish. We know today now that fisheries are collapsing all around the world."" In an attempt to address this and other crowding problems, governments are for the first time devising comprehensive plans for their marine waters. The Obama administration on June 12 announced a task force devoted to federal ocean planning. By September, the group must recommend a national policy on the subject that's designed to protect ocean ecology, address climate change and promote sustainable ocean economies. A handful of states, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, are charting similar courses. Massachusetts on June 30 published a draft plan for its coastal waters, which is scheduled to be finalized by the end of the year. One of the state's main aims is to make space for two ocean wind farms -- taking up 2 percent of the state's waters -- without angering fishing industries, killing whales or harming ecosystems. Internationally, several European countries, including Denmark, Belgium, the United Kingdom and France, are pioneering the new field, said Fanny Douvere, a co-principal investigator at UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. Ocean advocates say these planning processes are urgently needed and have been a long time in coming. One reason it's taken so long is that people can't see that the oceans are filling up, said Sandra Whitehouse, a marine biologist and senior adviser at the Ocean Conservancy, an environmental group. ""The majority of the ecosystem is under the water,"" Whitehouse said. ""So it's out of sight, out of mind. We're only looking at the surface."" Beneath the water, though, overfishing has caused some fish stocks to collapse. By one report, wild fish could disappear by mid-century. The energy sector threatens to take up large chunks of water. Shipping lanes cross the paths of endangered whales. Fish farms are growing in some countries. Climate change is altering ocean chemistry. And power lines, reefs, lobster traps and sunken ships compete for seafloor space. In Europe's North Sea, expanding industries have tried to claim three times the amount of ocean space than is available, said Douvere, of UNESCO. What happens on land also affects the oceans. A 2003 report by the Pew Oceans Commission says that each year, coastal development destroys 20,000 acres of estuaries and near-coast fish habitat. Furthermore, pavement on land creates ""expressways"" for oil and other pollutants to run into the ocean. ""Every eight months, nearly 11 million gallons of oil run off our streets and driveways into our waters -- the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill,"" the report says. When the renewable energy sector started trying to move into the sea, the situation went from crowded to unmanageable and without a clear plan, said Whitehouse, of the Ocean Conservancy. ""There's a lot of pressure to be able to harness this energy,"" she said, ""but it's very important that this be done in a proactive and comprehensive way, because we also have so many important economic aspects of our oceans."" Since there are new uses but not new space, planning is necessary, said Charles Ehler, another co-principal investigator at the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. He added, ""There's not enough space for everything, and there are going to have to be trade-offs that are made."" Current efforts focus on broad public interest rather than specific conflicts, Ehler said. Until now, the ocean primarily was divvied up in a sort of ""free-for-all"" in which ""whoever gets there first gets the access,"" he said. Leland, of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the patchwork of federal agencies managing the oceans in the United States contributes to the problem. More than 140 federal laws govern the ocean's use; and six federal departments, along with dozens of agencies, are in charge of implementing those laws, according to the Pew Oceans Commission report. Charles M. Wahle, a marine ecologist and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Obama's ocean-planning efforts are a complete shift in thinking. ""We're acknowledging that we want and need to use the ocean in a lot of different ways,"" he said. ""They all have standing, and we need to figure out a way to allocate them fairly and sustainably."" He added, ""Fifty years from now, you should be able to go to a place [in the ocean] and know what will be happening there."" There are skeptics of the shift. Commercial fisheries are hampered by current regulations and could be further harmed if the ocean is divided up among too many groups, said Jim Ruhle, president of Commercial Fishermen of America, an industry group. ""We make our livelihoods from that ocean, and we want to make sure that we have reasonable plans in effect to allow that to take place,"" he said. Some other fishing groups oppose new ocean uses, like offshore wind energy, entirely. Despite this new emphasis on planning, there's still a chance that ocean waters could go the way of haphazard cities. ""The proof will be in the pudding,"" said Wahle, of NOAA. But he said it's exciting that so many groups are on board for a new way of thinking. ""If we do our jobs right, overall, the oceans will be healthier, ecosystems will be more productive, people will derive more services and benefits and value from those ecosystems,"" he said, ""and industry will be able to plan and commit and invest in ways that actually work.""","The oceans are growing crowded, and some scientists worry about ""ocean sprawl""

"TYRE, Lebanon (CNN) -- Diab Diab lost an eye and part of a leg trying to clear unexploded bombs from the fields of southern Lebanon. But now he is going to lose his job, too. Despite the dangers of clearing mines, Diab Diab wants to continue his work. For though there are possibly thousands of unexploded bombs and shells littering the landscape, the money for cleanup operations has disappeared in the global recession. Diab knows the dangers all too well, but said he wants to continue working for British specialist clearance company BACTEC. ""It's hard to lose one's job -- despite the risks and the dangers you run, you get used to it,"" he said. Countries such as the United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates all pledged to help Lebanon clear the landmines, cluster bombs and other unexploded ordnance left by Israeli forces as they withdrew from their conflict with Hezbollah in the summer of 2006. More than $43 million in international donations has been spent so far on clearing the region. Britain and the Netherlands have been the largest single donors, each giving more than $5 million. The United States gave $2 million soon after the conflict and Saudi Arabia's contributions are now at $1.5 million, a report by the United Nations Mine Action Service shows. But with the economic crisis sweeping around the globe, some of the donor cash has dried up, and BACTEC, which had been responsible for a quarter of the clearing work, has to shut down its operations in Lebanon. There are some areas that BACTEC operations manager Johan Hann can mark as ""cleared"" on a map in his office. Elsewhere, the map shows areas that have not been touched and a vast swath of land where no one knows what lies in the ground.  Watch mom cry for her daughter, maimed by a bomb Â» . Cluster bombs leave huge craters but also spread bomblets over a wide area. Not all the bomblets will necessarily detonate on impact, and those that do not explode are left, like ticking time bombs in the ground. The United Nations Mine Action Service says Israel has provided no information as to where bombs were dropped. Nor has Israel contributed to the funding for the U.N.-led mine clearance effort. Land has to be cleared field by field, section by section and yard by yard. A piece of red and white tape fluttering across a piece of land shows how far Hann's team got before they had to stop. Mohammed Cheaito looks to the other side of the tape, to the land that he should be farming but that could be full of hidden danger. ""If they are going to stop now, it means we will stop planting and working, too; we can't get to our land anymore,"" he said. ""Of course, I am upset. They're supposed to finish their work so we can walk freely and cultivate our land in order to make a living."" But the risks of straying onto uncleared land are all too obvious. At least 328 people have been killed or wounded by bombs left in the soil of the region that borders Israel. One of them is Naimah Ghazi, who stepped on a cluster bomb in her garden in 2007 and lost half a leg. She used to provide for her family by farming tobacco, but now she spends most of her day sitting in the very garden that hid the weapon that injured her. Her mother, Khadija, finds it almost unbearable to look at her. ""I cry so much I can barely see with my eyes. I cry when I look at the state my daughter is in,"" the 86-year-old wails. Phone calls asking for jobs are still coming in to BACTEC's offices, Hann said, even as the mine clearers pack up their tents and climb into their trucks for the last time. They leave behind thousands of acres of land around the villages that they haven't been able to check and an untold number of bombs, perhaps still waiting for a victim.","Bomb disposal teams leave Lebanon as funding dries up in economic crisis .

Koko Taylor, a West Tennessee sharecropper's daughter who went to Chicago, Illinois, with ""35 cents and a box of Ritz Crackers"" at 24 and wound up an award-winning blues legend, died Wednesday at her Chicago home at 80. She died of complications from a May 19 surgery for gastrointestinal bleeding, her Web site reported. Just days before the surgery, Taylor won her 29th Blues Music Award, picking up the trophy for Traditional Female Blues Artist Of the Year. She performed her signature song, ""Wang Dang Doodle,"" at the ceremony. Known for her powerful vocals, Taylor was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1997, won the Blues Foundation Lifetime Achievement Ward in 1999 and was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship in 2004. She also won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album in 1985 for her album ""Queen of the Blues."" Taylor was born Cora Walton and picked up the nickname ""Koko"" because of her love of chocolate as a child. She also displayed a love of singing from an early age. She and her future husband, the late Robert ""Pops"" Taylor, traveled to Chicago in 1952, where Pops Taylor worked for a packing company while Koko Taylor cleaned houses. By night, the two roamed Chicago's blues clubs, where Koko Taylor sat in with top bands and was soon a popular guest artist. But it took 10 years for Koko Taylor to record on her own, after Willie Dixon got her signed to Chess Records and produced several singles, including ""Wang Dang Doodle."" Taylor landed a permanent home with Alligator Records when Chess was sold in 1975. Her final performance was the May 7 blues award show, but earlier in the year she performed at the Kennedy Center Honors program honoring actor Morgan Freeman. Throughout her lengthy career, she shared the stage with nearly every blues performer imaginable, from Junior Wells and B.B. King to Taj Mahal and Muddy Waters. She was a strong influence to later performers, including Bonnie Raitt and Janis Joplin. Survivors include Taylor's husband, Hays Harris, daughter Joyce Threatt, son-in-law Lee Threatt, grandchildren Lee Jr. and Wendy, and three great-grandchildren.","Taylor dies at Chicago home of complications from May 19 surgery .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- One man was gored in the abdomen and another suffered facial injuries on the third day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, a hospital doctor told Spanish state television Wednesday. A fighting bull leaps over a fallen runner at the Mercaderes curve during the running of the bulls. A 22-year-old Californian, who was gored, was taken to a hospital and was ""stable and conscious,"" said the doctor, Ignacio Yurss, medical director of Hospital de Navarra. The patient's name was not released. The man who suffered facial injuries comes from Greece and was injured in the nose, Yurss added. The latest injuries bring to 20 the number of runners who have been hurt in the first three days of the running.  Watch the running of the bulls in Pamplona Â» . Two of those were due to bull gorings -- the Californian gored Wednesday and a Spaniard gored Tuesday. The other 18 injuries resulted from falls or collisions, the regional government of Navarra reported. Ten of the injured are Spanish. The other 10 include three Americans and one each from England, Australia, New Zealand, Greece, South Africa, South Korea, and Romania, the Navarra government said. Many of the 20 have already been released from the hospital. The running of the bulls in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s. The running is held for eight consecutive days, July 7 to 14, as six bulls and a pack of tame steers run from the corrals through Pamplona's old town to the bull ring, where the bulls will die later in the day in a bullfight. A total of 13 people have been killed in the runs since 1924, when record-keeping began. The last was a 22-year-old American gored to death in 1995. The runs begin off at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) each day, with a few thousand runners participating daily, although crowds swell at the weekend.","One man gored in the abdomen, another facially injured at Pamplona bull run .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former death row inmate in Tennessee has been cleared of murder, three years after the Supreme Court raised repeated questions about his conviction. After 22 years on death row, Paul House was released on bail and has now been cleared of murder charges. State prosecutors on Tuesday asked a judge to drop all charges against Paul House, who was convicted of murder and sentenced to die in 1986. Special Judge Jon Blackwood accepted the request. House had been scheduled to be retried next month for the 1985 murder of Carolyn Muncey. He had been on death row for 22 years but was released on bail last year. He has multiple sclerosis and must use a wheelchair. The high court ruled in June 2006 that House was entitled to a new hearing. ""Although the issue is closed, we conclude that this is the rare case where -- had the jury heard all the conflicting testimony -- it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror viewing the record as a whole would lack reasonable doubt,"" wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy for the 5-3 majority. House's appeal was championed by the Innocence Project, affiliated with the Cardozo School of Law in New York. ""In the three years since the U.S. Supreme Court stepped into this case and sent it back to the trial court, substantial additional DNA testing and further investigation have shown that he is innocent,"" said Peter Neufeld, the group's co-director. ""Each time a layer of this case was peeled away, it revealed more evidence of Paul House's innocence."" Muncey disappeared from her rural Luttrell, Tennessee, home on July 13, 1985. Her body was found a day later, badly beaten and showing signs of a struggle. She had been raped. House, who was on parole at the time as a sex offender, was questioned by police. He denied any involvement in the crime. He was a friend of Muncey's husband, but claimed he was in his own house several miles away the evening of the murder. But prosecutors found a hole in his alibi, discovering that he had left his home the night of the murder and returned about an hour later with unexplained cuts and bruises. Forensic evidence found Muncey's blood on House's jeans, but questions were later raised whether the samples were contaminated en route to an FBI lab for analysis. Subsequent state-of-the art DNA testing conducted after the conviction showed that semen on the victim belonged to her husband, not House. Blood under her fingernails and cigarette butts discovered near the wooded crime scene also did not match the accused. But prosecutors maintain that other evidence points to his guilt. Muncey's family has also continued to believe that House was involved in the crime. In 2005, House told CNN he did not rape or kill Muncey, and he wondered why he was still on death row. ""I guess that's the million-dollar question,"" he said. While maintaining his innocence, he said that lying to police about his whereabouts that night was a big mistake. Kennedy, in his 2006 high court ruling, offered an extensive summary of the facts of the investigation, especially the DNA evidence, which he said might point to ""a different suspect."" Kennedy said jurors might conclude that Muncey's blood found on House's pants may have inadvertently spilled there during the autopsy or through mishandling by police at the crime scene. District Attorney Paul Phillips wrote in his petition this week that he still believes House could have been convicted again in a new trial, ""but the new evidence (including the forensic examinations) raises a reasonable doubt that he acted alone and the possibility that others were involved in the crime."" But Phillips noted the ""substantial sentence"" House has served as another reason for the charges being dropped now.","New evidence prompts judge to drop murder charges against Paul House .

"If home is where the heart is, a new survey suggests that most people aren't sure exactly where they live. More than half of people cannot pinpoint the exact location of the human heart on a diagram, and nearly 70 percent can't correctly identify the shape of the lungs, according to the survey. This lack of knowledge isn't just embarrassing -- it could lead to a poorer quality of health care, some experts say. In the study, published in the journal BMC Family Practice, a research team surveyed 722 Britons -- 589 hospital outpatients and 133 people in the general population. They gave the volunteers four diagrams of human figures and asked them to choose the one that showed the correct size and location of a specific organ. (For example, the heart diagrams showed various size organs on the far left side of the chest, directly in the center, anchored on the center/left chest, and on the right side of the chest.) Overall, people knew less basic anatomy than the researchers expected -- even those patients being treated for a specific condition involving that organ. Participants generally answered half the questions correctly, including 46.5 percent who knew which drawing represented their heart. In all, 31.4 percent correctly identified the lungs, 38.4 percent the stomach, 41.8 percent the thyroid, and 42.5 percent the kidneys. The intestines and bladder were the most easily identified, with 85.9 percent and 80.7 percent, respectively, answering the question correctly. Health.com: Are you cholesterol smart? Take this quiz . There was little to no improvement compared with a similar study conducted in 1970, says lead author John Weinman, Ph.D., of King's College London. In that study, subjects correctly identified eight major body parts about half of the time. (The researchers used the same body parts from the 1970 study and added three more: the pancreas, gallbladder, and ovaries.) Given the accessibility of the Internet and the prominence of health stories in the news media today, Weinman's team expected that people would now know more about their body. Weinman says he wouldn't be surprised if a study based in the United States produced similar results -- or worse. ""I imagine they would be similar, but there could well be regional variation, depending on which part of the U.S. the participants were from,"" he says. ""Actually, I asked one of my colleagues, who is from the U.S., and she felt that Americans might be worse because, to quote her, 'Very many Americans don't even know where New Jersey is, so how would they know where their pancreas is?'"" Health.com: Eat Smarter in your 30s, 40s, and 50s . That may sound harsh, but time and again, U.S. studies have shown that doctors overestimate how much their patients understand about their conditions and treatment. Adam Kelly, Ph.D., an assistant professor of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston,  Texas, conducted a 2007 study, that showed that doctors overestimate patient literacy and that a lack of patient knowledge leads to poorer care. Kelly believes the problem could be ""even more profound"" in the United States, although a similar study has not been conducted in America. Still, anatomy may not be the best measure of health literacy, says Sandeep Jauhar, M.D., the director of the heart failure program at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, and the author of ""Intern: A Doctor's Initiation."" Health.com: Computer games that boost your memory . ""They would like us to draw the conclusion that because the patients can't identify these organs anatomically that that is an indication of low health-care literacy -- and that may or may not be true,"" he says. ""I work with heart failure patients, and whether they can identify where their heart is is not so important to me as long as they know which medicines to take and when."" Many patients with heart failure, unfortunately, don't know which medicines to take, can't identify their symptoms, and don't follow up with their doctors, Jauhar says. ""So health illiteracy is definitely a big problem,"" he adds. ""I just don't know that this is the best study to show that Americans or Europeans are illiterate when it comes to their health care."" The study suggests that patients with liver disease and diabetes may be the most health-literate: They were the only two groups to do better than the general population when identifying their affected organ. Overall, 75.3 percent of those with liver disease could find the liver (versus 45.9 percent in the general population) and 53.7 percent of diabetics could locate the pancreas (versus 30.8 percent). Health.com: How I survived a heart attack at 43 . ""It is possible that patient-education material for people with diabetes may help to increase their knowledge [of the pancreas], but it is still only at the 50 percent level,"" Weinman says. ""The same explanation may also be true for liver disease, but it may be a chance finding due to the sampling of patients for this study, and it really needs replicating in other larger studies to be certain it is a robust finding and to search for possible reasons for it."" Weinman says there's a mountain of evidence to prove that effective communication from doctors increases patient satisfaction and understanding, leading to better clinical outcomes and improved adherence to treatment. Health.com: I lost my insurance, stopped my diabetes medication, and had a heart attack . Jauhar agrees that health literacy improves not only the quality of health care, but also life expectancy. ""Health literacy is clearly very important, and how well patients are versed in their own health care is probably just as important a factor in determining longevity as genes or socioeconomic status,"" he says.

"(CNN)  -- Four teenage boys in Tampa, Florida, were charged as adults Wednesday on allegations of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy. Lee Louis Myers, 14, from Tampa, Florida, is one of the defendants in the case. Charged with four counts each of sexual battery were Randall John Moye, 14; Raymond A. Price-Murray, 14; Lee Louis Myers, 14; and Diamante J. Roberts, 15. CNN is naming the defendants because they were charged as adults. Hillsborough County prosecutors allege the four boys raped the 13-year-old victim multiple times over two months with a broomstick and hockey stick. At a bond and arraignment hearing, the defendants appeared before Hillsborough County Judge Wayne Timmerman to hear the counts against them read in court. Prosecutor Kimberly Hindman described to the court how two defendants held down the victim while the other two defendants violently sodomized him with the sticks. ""The victim screamed and cried, telling them to stop,"" Hindman said. The prosecutor said the victim's screams could be heard outside the boys' locker room at Walker Middle School, in southern Tampa, where the alleged assaults took place. Multiple people witnessed the attacks, but no one reported the incidents, including the victim, Hindman said. The school began an investigation after a fight that began on the football field and continued until a coach broke it up in the locker room, said the prosecutor. During the fight, the victim said, ""I'm tired of them getting on me,"" Hindman said. When school officials questioned the defendants, all four admitted in a written statement that they had sexually assaulted the victim. The defendants ""all implicated themselves in a sexual-battery incident,"" Hindman said. The victim did not acknowledge the attacks until questioned. School officials contacted authorities, who initially charged the four as minors with sexual assault and false imprisonment. Several students witnessed the incidents over the two months, said the prosecutor, who added that she could not understand why no one reported the attacks. The victim made a statement in court, telling the judge how his father was angry and his mother couldn't stop crying when they heard about the attacks. Defense attorneys told the judge their clients were good students and had never been in trouble before. Attorney Tim Taylor, representing Randall Moye, said his client's family is among the finest in the community. Taylor presented six character witnesses, including his client's mother, Jeanne Myers, who said her son wants to attend college. The prosecutor asked her about her son's written statement about the attacks. Myers said her son described clowning around in the locker room with a hockey stick. She added that he told her about holding down the victim for a few seconds. The victim finished the academic year at home instead of returning to school, authorities said. The judge set bond for each defendant at $15,000, with ankle monitors for all but one, who has left the area. The four boys were taken into custody in court and booked into the adult jail. The judge warned the four to have no contact with one another, the victim or any witnesses in the case. The defendants could spend up to 120 years in prison if convicted on all four counts.","Prosecutors: Victim, 13, raped over 2-month period with broomstick, hockey stick .

"(CNN) -- A close aide to Pakistan's Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud said he is breaking ties with him and confirmed reports that Mehsud was behind the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in December 2007 at a campaign rally. Qari Turkestan Bhitaini, a self-proclaimed right-hand man of Mehsud, said Mehsud was behind the December 27, 2007, assassination of Bhutto, Pakistan's Express TV reported. Bhitaini said he is breaking ties with Mehsud because he blames the Taliban chief for killing scores of innocent Muslims in recent attacks in Lahore. The Pakistani government and CIA officials have said in the past that Mehsud was responsible for Bhutto's death. Bhutto, 54, was heading the opposition to then-President Pervez Musharraf when she was assassinated during a campaign rally in Rawalpindi ahead of parliamentary elections. The Pakistani government, who has struggled to control terrorism, is waging a military offensive against the Taliban in the country's North West Frontier Province.","Report: Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud responsible for Benazir Bhutto's slaying .

"(CNN) -- Man-made climate change threatens to stress water resources, challenge crops and livestock, raise sea levels and adversely affect human health, according to a report released by the Obama administration on Tuesday. Farmers and workers in central California are suffering through the third year of a worsening drought. The nearly 200-page document on global climate change -- released by the White House science adviser and mandated by Congress -- does not include new research, but encompasses several recent studies on the effects of global warming over the last half century. Among the report's key findings are an ""unequivocal and primarily human-induced"" rise in the Earth's temperature of 2 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 50 years, and a projection of more rapidly changing temperatures over the next several decades. ""It's not just a problem for the future,"" said Jane Lubchenco, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""We're beginning to see the impact on our daily lives."" The continuing temperature rise is likely to spur a series of negative consequences for the Earth's energy supply, water, transportation, ecosystems and health, the study said. ""[The report] tells us why remedial action is needed sooner rather than later, as well as showing why that action must include both global emissions reductions to reduce the extent of climate change and local adaptation measures to reduce the damage from the changes that are no longer avoidable,"" said John P. Holdren, the White House science adviser. Among the study's specific predictions: Longer and more intense heat waves; increased heavy downpours likely to cause widespread complications such as flooding and waterborne diseases; reduced summer runoff, creating greater competition for water, especially in the West; rising ocean water temperatures that will threaten coral reefs; an increase in wildfires and insect infestations; and more frequent coastal flooding caused by rising seas. The report is the first in almost a decade to break down impacts of climate change on regions and economic sectors of the United States. For example, warming trends in coming decades are expected to reduce the lobster catch in the waters of the Northeast, increase the intensity of hurricanes in the Southeast and accelerate drought in the Southwest, it said. Authors of the comprehensive report said they hope it can serve as a valuable tool for policymakers and other Americans, such as farmers making crop decisions or local governments passing zoning restrictions in coastal areas. The report comes as Congress debates a White House-backed climate change bill that seeks to reduce the United State's greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 through a so-called ""cap and trade"" program. The bill cleared a key House committee vote in May and could be considered by the entire chamber within the next two weeks, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday. The bill's future remains unclear in the Senate, where leaders are holding off advancing their own version of the legislation until it clears the lower chamber.","Man-made climate change is adversely affecting the U.S., says a federal report .

"(CNN) -- In keeping with President Obama's pledge of an administration that is ""transparent and accountable,"" the White House has launched a site that promises to show taxpayers where their stimulus-package dollars are being spent. Visitors to Recovery.gov are greeted with a video message from President Obama. The site, Recovery.gov, allows visitors to track efforts to jump-start a teetering economy in the midst of a slumping housing market and massive job losses. It breaks down the $787 billion package by category: $288 billion for tax relief, $59 billion for health care, and so on. The site promises that more detailed spending information will be posted once federal agencies decide how they are going to allocate the money.  Learn more about where the money is going Â» . Using graphs, charts and layman's terminology, the online portal is an example of how the tech-savvy Obama administration is taking its message to the American people. While running for president, Obama harnessed the Web's fundraising and social-networking capabilities to energize his grass-roots campaign. And the moment he was sworn in as the 44th president of the United States, administration officials unveiled a sleek interactive version of Whitehouse.gov, the official White House Web site. Recovery.gov, launched within hours of Obama's signing of the stimulus bill Tuesday, continues the theme of offering information in a user-friendly format. Visitors are greeted by a brief video address from Obama. ""The American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan represents a strategic and significant investment in our country's future,"" the president explains. ""The size and scale of this plan demand unprecedented efforts to root out waste, inefficiency and unnecessary spending. Recovery.gov will be the online portal for these efforts."" The site will publish information on how the stimulus funds will be spent in a ""timely, targeted and transparent manner,"" Obama said. Edward Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard University, said transparency has ""been a watch word for good government types for years."" ""There is sense that taxpayers will feel a lot better about this if they actually know where their money is going,"" Glaeser said. ""Better transparency makes evaluation much easier."" Glaeser pointed out that the idea behind Recovery.gov is not entirely new. He noted that the Office of Management and Budget has for years had a site where citizens can learn the available cost-benefit information of several government programs. Clicking on ""Where is Your Money Going"" on the new site brings up a chart displaying key areas where the $787 billion will be distributed, including tax relief, energy, health care and infrastructure and science. Under ""Accountability and Transparency,"" there is a statement that reads, ""This is your money. You have a right to know where it's going and how it's being spent. Learn what steps we're taking to ensure you can track our progress every step of the way."" Like other Obama online portals, the site encourages user interaction. The public is invited to share stories on how the Recovery Act is affecting them. Scrolling over a map of the United States reveals data on the number of jobs created and saved in each state. Those with some time on their hands can also read, in its entirety, the full text of the legislation.","New White House Web site explains economic stimulus spending .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that another stimulus package might be needed to help the ailing economy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met with economists and other Democrats on Tuesday to discuss the stimulus. Pelosi, whose comments followed a meeting with several economists, said the measures already taken by the Obama administration are helping to restore confidence in the shaky financial markets. But ""we have to keep the door open and see how this goes,"" the California Democrat added. House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey of Wisconsin said on Tuesday night he's already instructed his staff to start drafting a second stimulus proposal. Obey said his staff is preparing the outline of a stimulus bill but he cautioned there is no timeline to move on it. One of the economists in the meeting with Pelosi and other Democrats, Mark Zandi with Moody's Economy.com, said more taxpayer money would likely be needed to bolster the economy. Another economist, Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Decision Economics Inc., urged patience. But he questioned President Obama's prediction that the $800 billion stimulus package enacted last month would create or save as many as 3 million to 4 million jobs. ""Initially ... the jobs created may be a little disappointing,"" Sinai said. Sinai said his analysis showed that about 2.5 million jobs would be saved or created over the next two years and he said it is more realistic to project 3 million jobs over a longer period of three years. The most recent prediction from the Congressional Budget Office, released last week, estimates the recovery package will create or save from 1.2 million jobs to 3.6 million jobs.","""We have to keep the door open and see how this goes,"" the House Speaker says .

"(CNN) -- Deep-sea explorers say they have solved ""one of the greatest mysteries in naval history"" with the discovery of what was ""the world's mightiest and most technically advanced warship"" when it sank in 1744. The HMS Victory sank in 1744. The HMS Victory -- the predecessor to a historic British flagship of the same name -- was found ""far from where history says it was lost,"" Odyssey Marine Exploration said in a news release Monday. The find in the English Channel exonerates Adm. Sir John Balchin, one of ""the greatest admirals in English history,"" because it shows that the ship went down in a violent storm, not due to any mistakes he made, Odyssey said. It did not specify the ship's exact location. Maritime lore said the ship went down in the northern part of the Channel Islands, south of England near the coast of France. Stories about treasures -- including gold -- that may have been on the ship have existed ever since its disappearance. This HMS Victory was a predecessor to the historic British ship that took the same name and which served as Admiral Nelson's flagship in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. In court papers seeking exclusive salvage rights, Odyssey says the wreck site ""consists of cannons and other unidentified objects. Odyssey believes that potentially valuable cargo may be located at or near the site."" The papers were filed in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida, where Odyssey is based, seeking exclusive salvage rights. There were nearly 1,000 people aboard -- ""900 sailors, plus a complement of marines and 50 volunteers drawn from the noblest families of England,"" Odyssey said in information about the ship released together with the Discovery Channel, which chronicled the find. Based on reports from the time, there may be as much as four tons of gold on the ship, Odyssey and the Discovery Channel said. ""Additional research indicates that there were large quantities of both silver and gold coins aboard. ... Research suggests that this prize money will also likely be located at the wreck site. ""... However, no coins have been located at the site to date, and no accurate assessment as to their value can be made prior to location, recovery and analysis."" The potential treasure also comes in another form -- bronze weaponry. ""The site's anticipated ordnance collection"" includes ""the single largest collection of bronze cannon in the world"" and ""the largest consignment of bronze guns ever manufactured and preserved today,"" Odyssey said. Two cannons have been recovered -- ""a 12-pounder featuring the royal arms of George II"" and a ""42-pounder bearing the crest of George I,"" it said. ""The huge 42-pounder recovered is the only known example of a gun of this type and size currently in existence on dry land. The only other artifacts recovered to date were two small brick fragments that were brought into U.S. federal court in order to file an admiralty arrest of the site."" Admiralty arrest is a step mandated under international maritime law. The discovery could set up a legal battle with the British government. If it really is the HMS Victory, ""her remains are sovereign immune,"" the British Ministry of Defense (MOD) said in a statement on its blog Monday. ""The wreck remains the property of the Crown. We have not waived our rights to it. This means that no intrusive action may be taken without the express consent of the United Kingdom."" In its statement, Odyssey said it ""has been cooperating closely"" with the ministry, and ""all activities at the site have been conducted in accordance with protocols agreed with MOD and Royal Navy officials."" The ship has deteriorated to the point that recovering it is impossible, Odyssey said. ""A plan is being developed for an archaeological excavation of the site, and artifacts will be recovered in accordance with a scientific project plan, which will be submitted to the UK MOD for review and approval."" The company has proposed that it be paid ""with either ... a percentage of the value of the collection that has been recovered, conserved and presented to the UK government, or a percentage of the coins or other artifacts that the government decides to (sell)."" The ship was found nearly 100 km (62 miles) ""from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked on a reef near the Channel Islands,"" Odyssey's statement said. ""Having discovered it in deep water far from where history says it was lost has served to exonerate Admiral Balchin and his officers from the accusation of having let the ship run aground on the Casquets due to faulty navigation,"" said Greg Stemm, Odyssey's chief executive officer, in the statement. Odyssey said the ""prevailing belief"" about the ship's fate was that it had ""smashed into the Casquets, a group of rocky islets"" north of Guernsey, the second largest of the Channel Islands. But the evidence, Odyssey's statement said, suggests ""the ship sank as the result of a violent storm and suggests that the design and construction of the ship contributed to her loss."" Odyssey released press materials about the ship in cooperation with the Discovery Channel, which chronicled the find and will be showing it in a program this week called Treasure Quest. ""The English Channel is a treacherous place to navigate,"" Discovery Channel President John Ford told CNN Radio. ""The ship was returning from Portugal and got caught up in a storm. And despite being judged unsinkable at the time, sort of like the Titanic was, this very, very large ship went down in a storm and vanished without a trace.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi who was captured on videotape torturing an Afghan grain dealer has reportedly been detained, a senior U.S. State Department official told CNN Saturday. Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan, pictured here, allegedly tortured a business associate on videotape. The official said the government of the United Arab Emirates, which includes Abu Dhabi as one of its seven emirates, told the State Department that Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan is under house arrest pending an investigation, but that the United States has not independently confirmed the development. The videotape emerged last month in a federal civil lawsuit filed in Houston, Texas, by Bassam Nabulsi, a U.S. citizen, against the sheikh. Former business partners, the men had a falling out, in part over the tape. In a statement to CNN, the sheikh's U.S. attorney said Nabulsi is using the videotape to influence the court over a business dispute. The tape of the heinous torture session is delaying the ratification of a civil nuclear deal between the United Arab Emirates and the United States, senior U.S. officials familiar with the case have said. The senior U.S. officials said the administration has held off on the ratification process because it believes sensitivities over the story can hurt its passage. On Saturday, Human Rights Watch called the sheikh's reported detention ""a significant development"" but said the UAE government needs to do more to restore confidence in its judicial system. ""The videotape of this episode shocked the world,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""The report of the arrest was reassuring, but now the government needs to make the details public. Secretive prosecutions will not deter further abuses and torture."" On the tape, Sheikh Issa appears to burn with rage. Apparently believing he was cheated in a business deal, the sheikh was trying to extract a confession from the Afghan grain dealer. With a private security officer assisting, Sheikh Issa is seen stuffing sand in the Afghan's mouth. As the grain dealer pleads and whimpers, he is beaten with a nailed board, burned in the genitals with a cigarette lighter, shocked with a cattle prod and led to believe he would be shot. Salt is literally poured on his wounds. The 45 minutes of torture appears on a nearly three-hour-long videotape shot in late 2004 in the desert outside Abu Dhabi. It was made at the direction of the sheikh himself. The tape has been viewed by CNN.  Watch portions of the tape and Nabulsi tell his story Â» . After international concerns over the tape mounted in late April, Abu Dhabi's government issued a statement saying it deplored the contents of the video and planned an immediate and comprehensive review of it. The sheikh, who holds no official government position, is the half-brother of the UAE's ruler, President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Human Rights Watch sent a April 28 letter to the president imploring him to form ""an independent body"" to probe both the torture and and the ""failure"" of the UAE's Interior Ministry ""to bring those involved to justice."" The group reiterated that call Saturday. As for the grain dealer, UAE officials say he survived the ordeal, and said the sheikh and the grain dealer settled the matter privately by agreeing not to bring formal charges against each other. However, Nabulsi's attorney, Anthony Buzbee, said the grain dealer can't be located and it is not known whether he is alive.","State Department official says member of Abu Dhabi royal family reportedly detained .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- An Italian newspaper and magazine published excerpts of what they said were audio recordings of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi talking with an escort at the center of a corruption probe. Veronica Lario, the wife of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, pictured, filed for divorce in May. The daily La Repubblica and its sister magazine L'Espresso said the recordings posted on their Web sites Monday were of Berlusconi and Patrizia D'Addario. She has said that an Italian businessman hired her and other women to attend parties at Berlusconi's homes. In June, D'Addario told CNN that she had turned the tapes over to a prosecutor in Bari, southern Italy. Through her attorney, she refused to comment on the authenticity of the excerpts released Monday. But in a statement carried by the Italian news agency ANSA, Berlusconi lawyer Niccolo Ghedini said the prime minister is challenging the ""truthfulness and legality"" of the recordings. ""We can only regard the material as worthless, completely false and the result of invention,"" Ghedini said. ""In any case, the act of its publication is an illegal act in itself, which will need to be pursued, and all legal actions will be taken against any body who publishes such material."" Berlusconi, the 72-year-old media mogul-turned-prime minister, has denied the allegations. According to La Repubblica, the conversation between D'Addario and Berlusconi took place in October and November at the prime minister's house in Rome. It also published an excerpt of what it said was a conversation between D'Addario and Gianpaulo Tarantini, the businessman accused of hiring D'Addario and other escorts. Prosecutors in Bari, in southern Italy, are investigating allegations that Tarantini bribed health officials to buy prosthetics and other medical supplies from a company he and his brother own. Tarantini has denied any wrongdoing and says he brought women to the parties to make a ""beautiful impression."" ""I have never paid money to those who accompanied me except for refunding their trip expenses,"" he said in a statement issued last month. ""I exclude that the premier could have been aware of these reimbursements and I want to ask forgiveness for having involuntarily damaged him."" Berlusconi's private life has been in the spotlight since his wife of 19 years, Veronica Lario, filed for divorce in May. The split followed reports that Berlusconi went to the birthday party in Naples of an 18-year-old girl, with whom Berlusconi has denied having an inappropriate relationship. And the Spanish newspaper El Pais has published what it said were photos of racy parties at Berlusconi's villa on the island of Sardinia, including one picture that showed scantily clad women. But despite the swirl of scandal, Berlusconi remains popular, consistently scoring approval ratings well over 50 percent. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","D'Addario refuses to comment on authenticity of excerpts released Thursday .

"(CNN)  -- It is possible more U.S. troops could be added in Afghanistan if the new U.S. commander there needs them, but Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he does not expect a significant increase. U.S. Marines sweep for bombs in  Afghanistan this week. During a visit to troops at Fort Drum, New York, on Thursday, Gates said he is waiting to hear what Gen. Stanley McChrystal recommends after he completes a review of operations in Afghanistan. McChrystal is expected to complete a classified report for Gates by the end of this month, assessing  where the war stands, and what needs to be done. He will tell Gates whether he needs more U.S. troops to fight the escalating conflict, according to a senior U.S. military official. Gates asked McChrystal  to ""state his requirements for resources,"" said the official -- who did not want to be identified because the report is not completed. The review is also expected to recommend that the number of Afghan troops be increased beyond the goal of 134,000, other military sources said. During a speech and question-and-answer session with troops at Fort Drum, Gates acknowledged he would consider a recommendation to boost U.S. troops beyond the level of 68,000 already approved. ""We'll see what Gen. McChrystal recommends,"" he said. ""But I think there will not be a significant increase in troop levels in Afghanistan beyond the 68,000, at least probably through the end of the year. Maybe some increase, but not a lot."" Gates has made clear in the past he is reluctant to approve additional major increases in troop levels, preferring to keep the U.S. at a lower profile in the nation. About 57,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, with the other 11,000 to arrive by the end of this year. Gates has said he wants to see if that level of troops would be sufficient. Gates' press secretary, Geoff Morrell, told CNN the Fort Drum comments ""are not necessarily a foreshadowing of what's to come."" He said Gates ""doesn't want to impose an artificial troop cap on the commander,"" but does want to see if the strategy can be carried out with the approved troop levels.","Defense secretary would consider it if U.S. commander says he needs more .

"(CNN) -- Reclusive author J.D. Salinger has emerged, at least in the pages of court documents, to try to stop a novel that presents Holden Caulfield, the disaffected teen hero of his classic ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" as an old man. J.D. Salinger has stayed out of the public eye for most of the past half century. Lawyers for Salinger filed suit in federal court this week to stop the publication, sale and advertisement of ""60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye,"" a novel written by an author calling himself J.D. California and published by a Swedish company that advertises joke books and a ""sexual dictionary"" on its Web site. ""The Sequel infringes Salinger's copyright rights in both his novel and the character Holden Caulfield, who is the narrator and essence of that novel,"" said the suit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in New York. Published in 1951, ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is an iconic take on teen alienation that is consistently listed among the greatest English-language novels ever written. Salinger, 90, who has famously lived the life of a recluse in New Hampshire for most of the past half-century, last published in 1965. With the exception of a 1949 movie based on one of his early short stories, he has never authorized adaptations of any of his work, even turning down an overture from director Steven Spielberg to make ""Catcher"" into a movie. ""There's no more to Holden Caulfield. Read the book again. It's all there,"" the court filing quotes Salinger as saying in 1980. ""Holden Caulfield is only a frozen moment in time."" The filing refers to the new book's author as ""John Doe,"" saying that the name John David California probably is made up. The first-time novelist's biography on Amazon.com says California is the son of a Swedish mother and American father who was named after the state where he was born. It claims he is a former gravedigger and triathlete who found a copy of Salinger's novel ""in an abandoned cabin in rural Cambodia"" and that it helped him survive ""the most maniacal of tropical fevers and chronic isolation."" The Web site's description of the book is written in the same choppy, first-person stream of consciousness that Salinger employs as Holden wanders the streets of New York. It describes a character, ""Mr. C,"" who flees his nursing home and ""embarks on a curious journey through the streets of New York."" The lawsuit names Swedish publisher Nicotext; its offshoot, Windupbird Publishing Ltd.; and California-based SCB Distributors as defendants. The Web site for Nicotext advertises such books as ""The Macho Man's (Bad) Joke Book"" and ""Give It To Me Baby,"" which it describes as an erotic ""flick book."" Marcia Paul, Salinger's New York-based attorney, declined to speak on the record, citing her client's private nature. E-mail messages to Nicotext were not returned Wednesday. Aaron Silverman, president of SCB Distributors, said the people behind the new book plan to defend it against the lawsuit. ""We believe we have the right to distribute this book and the publishers believe they have the right to publish it,"" he said. Silverman, whose company distributes books by about 150 publishers, called ""60 Years Later"" a work of ""social science fiction,"" saying that California doesn't plagiarize, but sets a well-known character in an alternate place and time -- as literature has done for centuries. ""It's amazing,"" he said of the book. ""If it was something else, or it felt like a knock-off or whatever, I would have told the publisher we wouldn't do it. But it's really just amazing."" Despite his cloistered lifestyle, Salinger nods to the contemporary marketplace in the lawsuit, noting that, as of last week, "" 'The Catcher in the Rye' currently sells more copies on Amazon.com than 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' 'The DaVinci Code,' 'To Kill a Mockingbird' or 'Of Mice and Men.' "" A hearing in the case is expected Monday. Salinger's lawyers will ask a judge to freeze publication of the book until a final ruling is made. The book is already available in Europe and the United Kingdom, and is scheduled to be released in the United States in September. The lawsuit asks that sales be halted and that books already distributed be recalled and destroyed. The argument is reminiscent of the legal tussle over the 2001 novel ""The Wind Done Gone,"" a parody of Margaret Mitchell's ""Gone With the Wind"" told from the perspective of a slave. Mitchell's estate argued that the book, by novelist Alice Randall, infringed upon her copyright. But the 11th District U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in Randall's favor, saying the book was protected as a parody of a well-known work. Salinger's lawyers say ""60 Years Later"" deserves no such protection. ""The sequel is not a parody and it does not comment upon or criticize the original,"" the lawsuit argues. ""It is a rip-off pure and simple.""","Lawsuit seeks halt to ""60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye""

"(CNN) -- The House of Representatives voted Friday to impeach a federal judge convicted of obstruction of justice while in office. Judge Samuel Kent was the first federal judge to be charged with sexual crimes while in office. U.S. District Judge Samuel B. Kent of Texas pleaded guilty in February, admitting he lied to investigators about nonconsensual sexual contact with two employees in his courthouse. As part of a plea agreement, other counts alleging sexual misconduct were dropped. Kent was the first federal judge to be charged with sexual crimes while in office. He has submitted his resignation, but made it effective June 1, 2010, meaning he would be paid for a year while in prison. That drew a heated response among some members of Congress, and a House Judiciary Committee task force unanimously approved four articles of impeachment against Kent on the grounds of sexual assault, obstruction of justice and providing false statements to federal investigators. Before the House vote, Judiciary Committee member Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, said to House members that Kent collecting a salary of about $174,000 while in prison constituted ""an attempt to extort hundreds of thousands of dollars from the American people."" There were no dissenting votes. The decision on whether to convict Kent will be made by the Senate. A conviction would mean he would lose his seat on the federal bench and his pension. Kent, who turns 60 this month, was sentenced in May to 33 months in prison and began serving the sentence Monday. He was ordered to undergo treatment for alcoholism while in prison. An attempt to reach Kent's attorney for comment was unsuccessful Friday afternoon. President George H.W. Bush nominated Kent, who took his seat on the bench of the Southern District of Texas on October 1, 1990. Kent is the 14th federal judge to be impeached by the House. The last impeachment -- on charges of lying to a federal grand jury -- was of Mississippi Judge Walter Nixon in 1989.","Samuel Kent says he lied about nonconsensual sexual contact with 2 employees .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Commuters on the New York-New Jersey Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) rail system will have added security screening Wednesday as part of a month-long pilot program, according to a news release from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Riders of the New York-New Jersey PATH trains will see a new security system in place on Wednesday. The screening system is called the Passive Millimeter Wave. It can detect threats, including explosive devices, hidden under clothing, the Port Authority explained in the news release. The Transportation Security Administration and the Port Authority stress that there is no current threat to the mass transit system, nor do they anticipate delays for commuters from the new technology, which has already been tested at several other transit locations. The Passive Millimeter Wave ""detects threats by analyzing the energy generated by the human body,"" according to TSA spokesperson Lara Uselding. The camera-like device displays an image for operators, and ""an indicator produces a strength bar from green to red that indicates the presence/absence of anomalies that could have security implications, including the possible presence of explosives,"" according to the TSA Web site. The TSA and the Port Authority emphasize that the device is non-invasive and completely safe. The Port Authority's news release explains that all PATH passengers are subject to the pilot security screening, and passengers who do not want take part must leave the station. The TSA has partnered with agencies in various cities in the past to test out the same security screening system, including in 2007 at Washington's Union Station and on New York's Staten Island Ferry. The TSA has also tested the system at several U.S. airports including Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota; Denver, Colorado; and Boston, Massachusetts.","PATH riders to have new security starting Wednesday; part of a month-long program .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A one-of-a-kind bicycle belonging to U.S. cycling legend Lance Armstrong was stolen from a team truck in California just hours after he rode it Saturday on the first day of a nine-day race. Lance Armstrong's bike was stolen after he competed  in the first day of the Amgen Tour of California. Cancer survivor and seven-time Tour de France champion Armstrong is racing in the Amgen Tour of California this week as he attempts another comeback after retiring from the sport in 2005. Armstrong's first comeback came in 1998, two years after he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. Doctors gave him a less than 50 percent chance of survival. Armstrong announced the bike theft on his Twitter account Sunday morning and posted a photograph. ""There is only one like it in the world therefore hard to pawn it off. Reward being offered,"" he wrote. The bicycle that was stolen is not the one Armstrong rides every day during the race. The stolen bike is used only for time trials, a race in which cyclists ride individually at staggered intervals over a set distance and try to get the best time. The thieves took four bicycles from a truck Armstrong's Astana team had parked behind a hotel in Sacramento. The other three bicycles belonged to team members Janez Brajkovic, Steve Morabito and Yaroslav Popovych, Astana said. Armstrong, 37, won the Tour de France, considered the premier bicycle race in the world, a record seven times from 1999-2005. The 750-mile Amgen Tour of California ends Sunday. It is the second major race in which Armstrong has participated since announcing his comeback in September. He raced last month in the Tour Down Under in Australia, finishing 29th. Armstrong said he is aiming for another Tour de France victory this summer and was not expected to contend in the Australian race, which he used to gauge his fitness level after more than three years out of the saddle.","One-of-a-kind bicycle taken from team truck in California .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- If you think being a secret agent is all just one giant adrenaline rush, think again. Cracking the safe at the International Spy Museum . Our mission on the other side of the world: Retrieve a missing nuclear trigger before it falls into enemy hands. We don't know whom to trust in Kandahar. We can't speak the language. We've got to conduct video surveillance on an always-moving target, decrypt a secret audio conversation when we can barely hear through the static, crack a safe and then escape from a heavily guarded compound. Phew. We kept the terrorists from getting the trigger. Everyone heaves a giant sigh of relief. The three middle-schoolers in the group performed admirably. Welcome to Operation Spy at the International Spy Museum (www.spymuseum.org) in Washington, D.C. ""Today intelligence is the first line of defense against ideology-driven terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other threats to our country,"" explains Peter Earnest, executive director of the International Spy Museum, who spent 36 years at the CIA. The idea, he explains, is to put civilians like us in a situation that mirrors a real mission. But I've got a bigger mission ahead this weekend: Can I make a visit to the nation's capital, museums and historic sites at every turn, fun? I've brought along two sixth-graders from Stamford, Connecticut -- my cousin's son, Max Weinberg, and his friend, Miles Singer -- to see if I'm up to the challenge. So far so good. The kids loved Operation Spy and the spy tools in the museum's permanent exhibits -- a Soviet listening device hidden inside the heel of a target's shoe, a lipstick pistol and poison gas gun nearly as much as they loved the gift shop, which offered every spy toy imaginable. New lasers in hand, we adjourn next door to the upscale Zola restaurant (www.zoladc.com), which has a sophisticated ambience and menu to please the grown-ups, as well as a welcoming attitude toward kids ... not to mention terrific fries. (Memo to parents: If you take kids to a restaurant like this and they've outgrown the kids' menu, suggest they share a meal -- assuming they want the same thing.) Over dinner, the boys confess that learning about intelligence gathering was a lot more fun than learning how Congress works, and taking the Amtrak train (www.amtrak.com) was a lot more fun than driving or flying, because they could stay ""plugged in"" the entire trip, playing video games, watching movies and buying pizza and hot dogs. (Kids ride Amtrak for half price.) The Palomar Hotel, a Kimpton Hotel, (www.hotelpalomar-dc.com), just a short walk from DuPont Circle and Rock Creek Park) proved an ideal choice for my ""mission"" too. The theme of this hotel is ""art in motion"" and when we get to our room, the kids find personalized cartoons drawn by a local cartoonist and an iHome to plug in their iPods. ""This makes me feel like a king,"" Miles declares, jumping on the bed. That's exactly what General Manager Brett Orlando, himself the father of young twins, wants to hear. ""Our job is to create an experience for kids as well as parents,"" he explains. There is a treasure chest of toys for younger kids to borrow, a lending library of DVD movies and welcome swag that includes a card for free cookies from room service. (Check the hotel Website for the Link in Luxury package that allows you to book one room at a going rate -- weekend rates start at $229 and a second adjoining room for the kids for $50. Fall and winter weekends are a great time to visit D.C. with bargain hotel rates. Visit www.washington.org). The boys, of course, would have preferred to never leave the hotel but I promise we can skip all the ""boring stuff"""" -- like the Capitol Building, the Supreme Court, all art museums and even the White House. But even without these stops, we had plenty to fill up our weekend. At Jaleo, (www.jaleo.com), they sampled tapas for the first time -- but passed on the octopus and squid and reveled at being treated like grown-ups at the trendy D.C. Coast (www.dccoast.com). They declared ""Shear Madness,"" which has been running in the Kennedy Center's Theater Lab (http://www.kennedy-center.org/) for almost 20 years, a high point -- with campy humor and the opportunity for the audience to help solve the scissor-stabbing murder of a concert pianist who lives above the hairstyling salon. They also liked the view from the top of the Washington Monument, though they were disappointed when they learned they had to take a 70-second elevator ride rather than climb the 800-plus steps. (TIP: Even in the fall, the entire day's tickets had been given out before 10 a.m. Arrive before 9 a.m. at the kiosk at 15th Street and Madison Drive to get one.) The kids also gave a thumbs-up to The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (www.bep.treas.gov) where they watched from an overhead glass window, as money was made and sorted. NOTE: Though (free) tickets aren't required September through February, tours still fill up. Be prepared. You may need to wait. At the National Air and Space Museum (www.nasm.si.edu) where a new exhibit, America by Air, will open next month, the boys were most interested in the gift shop -- until they discovered the Simulator Rides ($8 each) that allowed them to try their skills as a pilot and gunner aboard an F-4 Phantom II Jet Fighter. ""I wish we could do it again and again,"" Max said. I insisted they see the original 1903 Wright Flyer but after a cursory look, they were done. Sure I could have forced them to spend more time at the museum -- maybe I should have -- but that would have just made them cranky. Me too. Instead, we all left happy.

"SACRAMENTO, California (CNN) -- Debbie Brown used to process medical and dental forms for a living before a debilitating illness forced her into early disability retirement and left her in a simple, no-frills wheelchair -- a rented wheelchair that has cost taxpayers about $1,200. CNN found a wheelchair similar to Debbie Brown's taxpayer-funded Medicare wheelchair for a fourth of the price. Brown says the public should be outraged about her wheelchair. Why? She says she could buy a comparable wheelchair on the Internet for $440 if she had the money. It sounded hard to believe that her rented, $1,200 taxpayer-funded wheelchair could be bought for $440, so CNN decided to check -- and instead found an even better deal. CNN went to the same company that charges Medicare for Brown's chair, Apria Healthcare, and bought it for $349 -- about a fourth of what taxpayers' have paid for Brown's rented wheelchair. That's why this slightly built woman, who lives modestly with her husband in Sacramento, California, believes her story and her wheelchair underscore the bigger problem of reforming health care in America. ""Now you multiply that by how many people have a manual wheelchair, especially the baby boomers, it multiplies and multiplies and that money could be spent, even a hundred dollars out of that ... could give someone else the options that they need,"" Brown said. Reforming health care is at the top of the agenda in Washington. Everyone seems to agree this nation's health care costs and care availability are out of whack. Fixing it is another problem altogether. The Clintons failed. President Bush tried and got push-back as well. Now President Obama says he will do it because America can't put it off any longer. But he, too, is finding the way forward is not an easy path. Terms like ""affordability,"" ""single payer,"" ""universal coverage,"" and an entire lexicon have become part of the health care buzz lingo. It is a complex issue with so many facets, so many lobbyists and so many special interests that one proposal seems to result in a competing proposal or proposals, or competing parties with concerns of their own. To illustrate how difficult it will be to overhaul America's health care, CNN decided to focus on one item in the nation's health care bill: a basic wheelchair. The wheelchair, in its own small way, CNN discovered, gives a glimpse of the contentious and complex debate swirling around health care reform. CNN interviewed Brown and her husband, Dennis Brown, at a community center in Sacramento. It is a place the couple visits frequently; it is free, offers programs, books, entertainment and features a park to stroll in. Debbie Brown sent an e-mail to CNN months ago, outraged over the continuing Medicare payments for a wheelchair that after four years of use is not in the best shape. It squeaks and is hard to navigate. Her ride in it is made more difficult because her husband, retired from the armed services, is also on disability and has trouble getting the wheelchair in and out of the car. On days he is not well, he sometimes has trouble pushing her. She showed CNN her bills and documented the fact that Medicare is still paying for the wheelchair after all these years. Medicare, with Brown's permission, confirmed the payments. Brown referred us to the Internet sites where comparable chairs -- and better ones than hers -- are listed for a fraction of the cost Medicare pays over time. The Browns have a limited income and say they cannot afford to buy one. That's when CNN decided to check Brown's story by buying one directly from Apria, based in Lake Forest, California. CNN paid cash for the chair after calling one of Apria's offices in an Atlanta, Georgia, suburb. Apria representatives told the CNN buyer that the chair Brown had is no longer made but offered the model that is being rented and sold as the replacement model for the one Brown still uses. When CNN asked Apria why it rented wheelchairs to the government for $1,200, but sold it to us for $349, the company said it was an ""honest, unfortunate mistake."" Lisa M. Getson, Apria executive vice president for government relations, said in a letter that CNN ""should have been charged $949, in accordance with Apria's retail price...."" ""Since there's no comparable sale option in the Medicare system for such a wheelchair, our employee was confused by the sale request and charged the incorrect amount,"" Getson said. But the amount CNN paid is comparable to many other companies' prices on the Web. A quick check found two firms selling the Invacare Tracer SX5 for $289.00 and $249.00, including delivery. The manufacturer's suggested retail price is nearly $300 less than the corrected Apria price. Apria Healthcare said its costs are higher because of the stringent paperwork required by the government and because it provides 24-hour on-call service. Apria also points out that the cost of the wheelchair over the past four years has been less than 78 cents per day, a bargain because it allows the patient to remain at home. Wheelchairs are classified as durable medical equipment, along with such items as oxygen tanks and home infusion therapies. Apria is the nation's leading provider of home health care products and services, according to its Web site. The nation's $1 billion annual durable medical cost is only a fraction of Medicare's $444 billion budget last year, but one government officials believe it is time to rein in. That's where this story of the rented wheelchair gets caught between all the interests involved. Congress sets the rates Medicare pays and Congress determined that wheelchairs should be billed on a monthly rate for 13 months -- the renter has to pay 20 percent of the costs. After 13 months, a user can opt to own it  -- if the user knows about the rule. Brown, who worked in claims processing for years, said no one ever told her the wheelchair that barely works for her now is hers if she wants it. Instead, now that her rental term has ended, she gets billed by Apria every six months for service. Medicare pays $63 and she pays $16. Jonathan Blum, one of Obama's picks to reform the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said it is simply wrong that a wheelchair an individual can buy for $349 has cost the government $1,200. He said the government has a plan to fix it: competitive bidding. ""The good news is we have new authority right now to use competitive bidding to give the program much more flexibility,"" Blum said. But that's where the rubber -- or in this case, a wheelchair -- meets the road. Medicare has tried for years to get a bidding project off the ground. Last year, a bidding project was stopped after two weeks. The industry is flat-out against the government's proposed bidding project, contending it isn't competitive bidding at all. Opposing a bidding project is a well-funded lobbying industry, small- and durable-equipment businesses and special-interest groups who worry their ill clients won't be served if a bidding process as proposed by Medicare is put in place. So CNN loaded its wheelchair onto a Delta 757 to Washington and rolled it through the halls of Congress to find out why any representative -- not to mention 84 of them (the number who signed an April letter asking that competitive bidding be put on hold once again) would object to a plan that Medicare maintains will save taxpayer money. From Republican and Democrat alike, the answer was nearly identical as they sat for interviews next to CNN's $349 wheelchair. ""Well, you know what? I am a big believer in competitive bidding,"" said Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democrat from Ohio, where Invacare, one of the biggest manufacturers of durable equipment, is based. ""So at the outset I absolutely concur. But this program as it has unfolded, as it's been developed it really is a competitive bidding process that isn't competitive bidding."" Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, agreed. ""My hope is that as we look at health care reform that some of those that are working off of theory, if you will, and the federal system will slow down and we look at where the lessons learned should be and we will think long and hard before they move aboard a single-payer or mandated to restrict choice and restrict options for individuals,"" said Blackburn. The American Association for Homecare, which represents many in the durable-equipment industry, said the bidding program is anti-competitive. In a statement, the association said the bidding program would ""sacrifice care for seniors and people with disabilities"" as it ""reduces patient access to and choice for medical equipment."" The association said competitive bidding will ""increase Medicare costs because it will lead to longer, more expensive hospital stays."" But John Rother, the head of policy and strategy for the retiree advocacy group AARP, said what's really happening is business trying to protect profits -- in this case profits four times the cost of Brown's wheelchair rental.

"(CNN) -- New IBO light-welterweight world champion, Manny Pacquiao, is planning a career in politics, the 30-year-old told CNN on his return to his native Phillipines. Philippine boxing champ Manny Pacquiao sits with Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources Lito Atienza (L) and former governor Chavit Singson (R) in Manila. Though ""Pacman"" will concentrate on boxing until next year, the man dubbed the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world suggested he could retire the following year to run for congress. ""I want to be a Congressman so I can help the people,"" Pacquiao told CNN's Andrew Stevens. But when asked if becoming the Filipino president was his ultimate aim he added: ""I wouldn't think about that because my ambition is only to run for congress. Pacquiao previously ran in the 2007 congressional elections for President Arroyo's party but was beaten by the Nationalist People's Coalition candidate Darlene Antonino-Custodio, who received 139,061 votes to Pacquiao's 75,908, Britain's Daily Telegraph said. Pacquiao is a national hero in the Phillipines but has seen his popularity grow around the world since his comprehensive victory over British fighter Ricky Hatton in Las Vegas. ""I'm happy to be back (in Manila) because there's a lot of people supporting me here. I expected it in the Phillipines but I had many supporting me in America too."" The man dubbed the ""National Fist"" will be a busy man over the next few months as he plans to make his second film and record a TV programme. This is a long way from his humble origins growing up in General Santos City, southern Philippines, a reality that Pacquiao says he struggles to believe sometimes. ""I never dreamed I would reach the levels of success I have reached, he said. ""But I have faith in God and discipline in myself to make the sacrifices (needed) and to train hard."" In 14 years as a professional, Pacquiao has won world titles in four weight divisions -- from 7st 8lb to 9st 9lb, at flyweight, super bantamweight, super featherweight and lightweight. In his last contest, in December, in what many felt would be a step too far, he dismantled America's most popular boxer, Oscar De La Hoya, at the 10st 7lb limit, in eight one-sided rounds. Pacquiao is currently rated by The Ring, the sport's most respected trade magazine, as the best boxer in the world. His career earnings stand at an estimated Â£30 million, with major paydays coming relatively late in his career. However he remains modest despite the success. ""It's a big honour to me and my family to be looked up to by so many people. ""My inspiration comes from my family -- the people who are always there behind me supporting me and love me.""","Manny Pacquiao plans career in politics .

"(CNN) -- Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch expects News Corporation-owned newspaper Web sites to start charging users for access within a year in a move which analysts say could radically shake-up the culture of freely available content. Murdoch said the existing Internet business model was ""malfunctioning."" Speaking on a conference call as News Corporation announced a 47 percent slide in quarterly profits to $755 million, Murdoch said the current free access business model favored by most content providers was flawed. ""We are now in the midst of an epochal debate over the value of content and it is clear to many newspapers that the current model is malfunctioning,"" the News Corp. Chairman and CEO said. ""We have been at the forefront of that debate and you can confidently presume that we are leading the way in finding a model that maximizes revenues in return for our shareholders... The current days of the Internet will soon be over."" Murdoch said the experience of the News Corp.-owned Wall Street Journal had proved that charging for content could be made to work. Would you pay to use news Web sites? Sound Off below . He said 360,000 people had downloaded an iPhone WSJ application in three weeks. Users would soon be made to pay ""handsomely"" for accessing WSJ content, he added. Murdoch said he envisaged other News Corp. titles introducing charges within 12 months. Murdoch's international newspaper empire includes the New York Post, the News International stable of UK titles including the Sun and the Times, and a cluster of Australian papers including the Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun. His comments come with the U.S. newspaper industry in a state of crisis amid plunging advertising revenues and falling circulations with several historic titles already going out of business. Joshua Benton, Director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University, said Murdoch was not the only executive looking to generate new income streams from online content. ""News executives are starting to recognize that online advertising revenues are not enough on their own,"" Benton told CNN. But he said the challenge for media organizations was finding a balance between advertising and subscription revenues and figuring out how to charge for content without alienating existing users -- which could lead to Web sites offering tiered levels of free and paid-for material. ""I suspect within any readership there is a small slice -- maybe three percent -- that is willing to pay. News organizations are going to have to find a way of getting money from that slice without driving away everybody else,"" Benton said. ""I don't think you can afford to put a lock and chain on the front page. Benton said the U.S. newspaper industry was in a ""horrible state"" which was likely to get worse. ""We're starting to see holes where newspapers were. The question is, will new Web sites fill the holes, will traditional names come in -- or will they just not get filled?"" Earlier this week, the 137-year-old Boston Globe said it would be forced to shut down unless it reached an agreement with unions over a $10 million program of cost-cutting measures.  Watch media chief discuss charging for online content Â» . The paper's owners, The New York Times Co., postponed plans to close the paper after reaching a deal with six of seven employees' unions but said the Globe was expected to lose $85 million in 2009 if it did not make major cuts. The developments followed the demise of print editions of The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado; The Seattle Post-Intelligencer; and The Christian Science Monitor. The Rocky Mountain News shut down completely; both the Seattle paper and the Christian Science Monitor remain in online editions. At least 120 newspapers in the U.S. have shut down since January 2008, according to Paper Cuts, a Web site tracking the newspaper industry. More than 21,000 jobs at 67 newspapers have vaporized in that time, according to the site. Despite the general mood of gloom over the state of the economy, Murdoch said he believed the worst of the financial crisis had passed. ""I'm not an economist and we all know economists were created to make weather forecasters look good,"" he said. ""But it is increasingly clear the worst is over.""","Rupert Murdoch says News Corp.

"(CNN)  -- Cycling legend Lance Armstrong -- a survivor of testicular cancer -- and girlfriend Anna Hansen are expecting a baby, CNN learned on Tuesday through his charitable organization. Cyclist Lance Armstrong has announced he will come out of retirement and race once again in the Tour de France. The baby is due in June. Armstrong was diagnosed in 1996 with testicular cancer that had spread to his brain, lungs and abdomen. He underwent treatment for the disease and was able to return to cycling, eventually winning seven consecutive Tour de France's. The harsh chemotherapy left him unable to have children, although he and then-wife Kristin Richards had three children using sperm the cyclist had donated before the treatment. Armstrong and Hansen, however, are expecting without the use of any artificial fertilization process. ""This is a hopeful thing for testicular cancer survivors,"" CNN medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. ""It means his body healed from the chemotherapy and surgery."" Armstrong retired from cycling after his seventh Tour de France win in 2005, and focused his energy on the Lance Armstrong Foundation (livestrong.org), which supports people affected by cancer. Armstrong founded the organization in 1997. The 37-year-old Texan announced in September that he was launching a comeback with the goal of winning the Tour de France in 2009. ""After talking with my children, my family and my closest friends, I have decided to return to professional cycling in order to raise awareness of the global cancer burden,"" he wrote on LiveStrong's Web site. He is training for several races leading up to the Tour de France, including Australia's Tour Down Under and the Giro d'Italia.","Seven-times Tour de France winner Armstrong is a survivor of testicular cancer .

"(CNN)  -- An international peace conference in Johannesburg has been cancelled after South Africa refused the Dalai Lama a visa to attend the event. Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Monday he would boycott the conference. Announcing the postponement at a news conference Tuesday, Irvin Khosa, chairman of the South African football league, did not offer an explanation. A presidential spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said little. ""South Africa has made this decision,"" he said. ""We stand by the decision."" The peace conference had been scheduled to start Friday. Officials said they would like to have a conference in the future, but they did not offer a specific date. The conference had been organized by South African soccer officials, led by Khosa, and was billed as an opportunity to showcase South Africa's role as a human-rights champion ahead of the 2010 World Cup -- the global soccer championship the nation will host next year. The presidential spokesman had said earlier that the Dalai Lama -- Tibet's spiritual leader and a Nobel Laureate -- did not receive a visa because it was not in South Africa's interest for him to attend. Masebe said South Africa thinks that, if the Dalai Lama attended the conference, the focus would shift away from the World Cup. ""We cannot allow focus to shift to China and Tibet,"" he said. He added that South Africa has gained much from its trading relationship with China. Khosa made the announcement at a news conference also attended by Chief Mandla Mandela, grandson of former South African President Nelson Mandela. Mandla Mandela said it was a sad day for the country's democracy and the African continent that the South African government had denied the Dalai Lama a visa. South Africa should not succumb to international pressure, Mandela said. A representative of the Dalai Lama said he was not surprised by the visa refusal. The Tibetan government in exile thinks that China has pressured many countries to refuse a visit by the Dalai Lama, according to Chhime Chhoekyapa, an aide in Dharamsala, India. The Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. The peace conference was to bring together Nobel laureates and top soccer officials. Archbishop Desmond Tutu; former President F.W. De Klerk; laureates Nelson Mandela and Martti Ahtisaar; Seff Blatter, president of soccer's international governing body; and actress Charlize Theron were among those invited. The event had the blessing of the Nobel Committee. A presidential spokesman had said earlier that the Dalai Lama -- Tibet's spiritual leader and a Nobel Laureate -- did not receive a visa because it was not in South Africa's interest for him to attend.","South Africa refused the Dalai Lama a visa to attend the event .

"(CNN) -- Five years from now, there's an excellent chance you won't have the same health insurance you have (or don't have) right now. That's because members of Congress are gearing up to reform the U.S. health care system, and unlike in 1993 when then-first lady Hillary Clinton tried her hand at changing the medical system, this time  the important players -- doctors, insurance companies, pharmaceutical manufacturers -- seem to be on board. You heard a lot about health care reform this week, and you'll be hearing even more in the months to come. It's an incredibly confusing, complex issue, so in this week's Empowered Patient, we break it down for you with 10 frequently asked questions about health care reform. Overhauling health care  is key to U.S. economic stability, President Obama tells doctors Monday. 1. Why is health care reform such a hot issue right now? Fewer and fewer Americans have health insurance, and therefore cannot afford good medical care. Nearly 46 million Americans have no insurance, and 25 million more are underinsured. One major reason for this crisis is that many employers have stopped offering insurance to employees because of the high cost. In the United States, total health care spending was $2.4 trillion in 2007 -- or $7,900 per person -- according to an analysis published in the journal Health Affairs. The United States spends 52 percent more per person than the next most costly nation, Norway, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. There's little debate that health care reform is necessary -- President Obama, Republican and Democratic members of Congress, the American Medical Association and America's Health Insurance Plans, which represents the insurance industry, all have agreed the system needs to be changed, although they disagree on how to do it. 2. So let's start with Obama. What are his plans for revamping the system? A central point of the president's plan is to create a government-sponsored health insurance program that would be an option for all Americans, similar to how Medicare is now an option for Americans over age 65. He has also said he'd ""like to see"" prohibitions against insurers discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, and incentives for people to use preventive services and wellness plans. Obama outlined this plan last week at a town hall meeting in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and on his Web site. 3. How does the president plan to pay for this? Obama said he's already identified ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" worth of savings in the federal budget that could help finance health care reform, such as rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid. He's also proposed reducing tax deductions for high-income Americans. 4. What do the Republicans think of Obama's plan? In particular, they don't like the idea of having a government-sponsored health insurance program for all Americans. They fear employers would opt for the government-run insurance over private insurance because the government option would most likely be less expensive, but Republicans say it would also be lower quality. For information, see House Minority Leader John Boehner's Web site. 5. Since they don't like Obama's ideas, how would Republicans like to reform health care? Republicans think Obama's plan is costly and will make health insurance more expensive, not less. In a plan outlined this week, House Republicans proposed individual tax breaks for buying health insurance and ""pools"" of states and small business to get lower-cost health care plans. They also proposed increasing incentives for people to build health savings accounts, allowing dependent children to stay on parents' policies until age 25 and encouraging employers to reward employees for improved health. 6. I'm happy with the insurance I receive from my employer. What would health care reform mean for me? If you receive high-quality health insurance from your employer, Obama said, his plan won't change that, and you can still keep your insurance and your doctors. Republicans, however, said that if Obama gets his way, there's a good chance your employer will stop buying the private insurance you have now and instead opt for the less-expensive government plan. 7. I have a pre-existing condition and can't get health insurance. Will health care reform help me? You have a terrible problem and you're in good company. Millions of people who don't get insurance through their employer try to get insurance on their own and are turned down because they have a pre-existing condition. Obama said at the Green Bay town hall meeting that under his reforms, no insurance plan ""would be able to deny coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions,"" but he didn't explain how he would force insurance companies to insure people with pre-existing health problems. Similarly, Boehner wrote on his blog that ""quality health coverage must exist for every American, regardless of pre-existing health conditions,"" but did not explain how he would pay to insure people with pre-existing conditions. 8. How do doctors feel about health care reform? The American Medical Association said while it believes in health care reform, ""the AMA does not believe that creating a public health insurance option ... is the best way to expand health insurance coverage."" The AMA has told members of Congress that doctors fear a new government-sponsored health insurance program would reimburse them at Medicare rates. ""Medicare reimbursement rates have not kept pace with the cost of practice,"" AMA President Dr. Nancy Nielsen told CNN earlier this week. ""Our Medicare rates are back at 2001 rates, and the reality is, that's not where our rent is, that's not where the electricity is. The system for paying doctors is a broken system, and everybody acknowledges it."" Other doctors' groups, however, support the idea. The American Academy of Family Physicians, the National Physicians Alliance and other groups put out a statement of support this week for Obama's plan. ""Having the choice of a public health insurance plan will help make health care more affordable for patients, foster greater competition in the insurance market and guarantee that quality, affordable coverage will be there for our patients no matter what happens,"" they wrote in a joint statement.. 9. Obama has mentioned high health care costs in McAllen, Texas, several times. What's up with that? According to research conducted at the Dartmouth Institute, the average per person health costs for McAllen are sky-high compared with costs in other cities. In McAllen, the average Medicare beneficiary spends $15,758 per year, while the average Medicare patient in LaCrosse, Wisconsin, spends $6,412 per year. Another comparison: The cost in Miami, Florida, is $18,170, compared with $7,478 in Portland, Oregon. Dartmouth researchers believe doctors in high-priced cities tend to refer to specialists more and are more likely to put patients in the hospital rather than handling their problems on an outpatient basis. 10. How do health care costs in the U.S. compare with costs in other countries? In the United States, every person spends on average $6,714 for health care. That's significantly higher than in the United Kingdom, where $2,760 per person is spent; or in France, where the cost is $3,449 per person; or in Canada, where medical costs are $3,678 per person, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. While some would argue that medical care is better in the United States than in these other countries, others would say the opposite is true. For example, the United States ranks 50th in life expectancy, and 180th infant mortality (meaning 179 countries have higher infant mortality rates such as Angola and Turkey and 43 countries have lower infant mortality rates such as France and Sweden) according to the CIA World Factbook.

"(CNN) -- A man accused of killing eight people in a shooting spree at a North Carolina nursing home is the husband of a woman who worked there, police said Monday. Robert Stewart faces eight counts of first-degree murder in the nursing home shootings. The two may have been separated, said Carthage, North Carolina, Police Chief Chris McKenzie. He did not say if the wife was in the building at the time. The alleged gunman, Robert Stewart, was carrying several weapons, authorities said. Seven patients and a nurse were killed, and three people were wounded, including a visitor and a police officer. All the wounded are expected to survive, McKenzie said. Officer Justin Garner was shot in the leg, McKenzie said. ""As I understand, there were three pellets in his shin, leg and foot,"" he said. Garner entered the Pinelake Health and Rehab Center alone with no backup and brought the shooting spree to an end with a single shot, hitting Stewart in the ""chest, upper torso area,"" McKenzie said. ""If that's not heroism, I don't know what is,"" he said. Garner is ""in very good spirits, resting at home,"" he added. McKenzie said he did not know the latest on Stewart's condition. The alleged gunman's motive remained a mystery. Stewart has not made a public statement nor has an attorney on his behalf. His wife has not issued a statement either. Meanwhile, his ex-wife, Sue Griffin, told CNN affiliate WTVD-TV in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, ""He did have some violent tendencies from time to time."" She added that when she heard the news of Sunday's shooting, ""I couldn't believe it -- then I stopped, thought about it and thought, 'It is possible. It's possible.' "" At a news conference Monday, McKenzie described the shooting spree as ""unimaginable"" and ""horrific."" ""Everything that you can possibly imagine that is bad in the world,"" he said. ""This doesn't happen, but it did."" He described the small town as ""strong, faith-based -- and that faith will get this community through this."" The tragedy draws attention to what McKenzie called the toughest part of training police officers. Officers are told not to wait for backup when there are many lives on the line, he said. ""That's the hardest thing -- to try to convince them you can't wait, you have to go."" If Garner had waited for backup, ""there would have been a lot more people [killed],"" McKenzie said. The slain patients ranged in age from 78 to 98, Moore County District Attorney Maureen Krueger said. A witness told CNN affiliate WRAL-TV in Raleigh-Durham that Stewart was armed with a rifle, a shotgun and other weapons. Jerry Avant Sr. told WRAL that his son, Jerry Avant, a 39-year-old registered nurse, was the employee who was killed in the shooting. He said a doctor told him that his son had been shot more than two dozen times. The elder Avant said the doctor told him his son ""undoubtedly saved a lot of lives.""  Watch dad praise his son's bravery Â» . Stewart faces eight counts of first-degree murder  and one count of felony assault on a police officer, and other charges are pending, Krueger said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In 1994, universal health care was a key policy plan for then-President Bill Clinton. It eventually failed. In 1993, President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary  Clinton listen to a man's story about health care problems. Now, 15 years later, another Democratic president is taking on the challenge, but facing an uphill battle from not only from Republicans, but from members of his own party. Will failing to reform health care have the same consequences for Obama's administration as it did for Clinton's? Like Obama, Clinton came into office with reforming the nation's health care system as one of his top priorities. Then-first lady Hillary Clinton, who headed the administration's task force on reforming the system, delivered a 1,000-page plan that was dubbed ""Hillary Care,"" which required Americans and permanent resident aliens to enroll in a health plan. Other provisions included Americans below a certain income level paying nothing for care. Republicans decried the plan as overcomplicated and used it to tag the administration as big government-loving, tax-and-spend liberals. The plan's failure emboldened Republicans and led to huge Democratic losses in the 1994 midterm elections, allowing the GOP to take control of Congress and stymie other Clinton initiatives. Now, 15 years later, Obama potentially faces a similar fate. Obama seeks the overhaul to ensure that health insurance is available to the 46 million Americans currently without coverage while preventing costs to both the government and individuals from continuing to climb.  Watch more on the health care debate Â» . The president had set a deadline for passage of a bill before the August congressional recess, but in an interview Monday with PBS's Jim Lehrer, the president said that if Congress tells him it's ""going to spill over by a few days or a week,"" that's fine. iReport.com: Weigh in on the health care debate . A senior White House official adds that while there is a ""long way to go"" in coming up with legislation, there is a true effort being made to devise a bipartisan plan.  See how the plans compare Â» . ""[The Senate] is working in a bipartisan way and despite all of the cacophony of attacks you've heard from some Republicans, I think you've got to give some credit to the Republicans on the finance committee who are making right now a good faith effort, despite pressure, probably from their own party, to work with Democrats to try to come up with something that people can get behind,"" said White House Communications Director Anita Dunn on Wednesday. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, says in order for health care reform to get passed, it will take a well-coordinated bipartisan effort. ""I think the president is right. He really does want a bipartisan effort. And that's what it's going to take for it to be for the American people. But the approach to it is kind of like a doctor practicing bad medicine where you fix only symptoms and don't treat the disease. ... the disease is only going to get worse."" But the battle over health care reform is weighed down by complex problems, competing interests, a $1 trillion price tag, conservative Democrats in sticker shock and Republicans sensing an opportunity to regain some of the power they lost in the 2006 congressional elections. Conservative Bill Kristol wrote in his blog that there is an opportunity to inflict political damage to the president and that opponents shouldn't compromise: . ""My advice, for what it's worth: Resist the temptation,"" Kristol wrote. ""This is no time to pull punches. Go for the kill."" The White House has so far resisted another idea for raising revenue -- creating a tax on the medical benefits provided by employers. Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus said he likes the idea, but Obama said it could be too disruptive to a system in which 180 million Americans have health coverage provided by their employers. But while Obama has remained mostly popular in national polls so far, support for his health care plan has begun to wane. A CNN Poll of Polls released Wednesday indicates that less than half the country approves of how he's handling the issue. Forty-seven percent in the poll approve of how the president is dealing with health care reform, with 44 percent disapproving. The poll averaged the three most recent national surveys that asked about Obama's performance on health care: USA Today/Gallup (July 17-19); ABC/Washington Post (July 15-18) and CBS News (July 9-12). Meanwhile, Coburn -- a fierce opponent of the current plans being worked up in Congress -- says that Congress needs to slow down. ""Getting this right is better than meeting a political deadline ... I want him to back off the timeline,"" he said. ""Let's start over ... let's fix it all and do it in a way that the American people won't charge it to their grandkids."" CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, who has worked under several administrations, including Clinton's, says there's is concern that Obama may be trying to ram health care legislation through Congress as he did with the economic stimulus plan. ""And they [Americans] don't have a lot of confidence in the past effort in the stimulus plan to put together something comprehensive and -- 'here we go again' ... something that looks like it's being thrown together to many people in the public. So they're not confident that they want it. And Coburn's argument -- along with nearly all congressional Republicans' -- could pose a risk to Obama's political capital with Americans. Gergen agrees. ""I think he's got two other problems: One is that he doesn't have a firm plan to sell. ... Second thing is, from his point of view, there are many in the public that'd like to hear from him and also like to see just how he's negotiating the plan,"" he said. ""What they look for is a leadership that says, 'Here's where we're going to go,' not a leadership that says, 'I'm urging Congress to make more progress' "" Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, who Obama had tapped to be Health and Human Services director and the point person on health care reform before tax problems derailed his nomination, said getting health care reform passed now will be a major factor in defining Obama's presidency. ""Because he's made it such an issue, and because he has invested so much personal time and effort, this will, more than stimulus and more than anything he has done so far, be a measure of his clout and of his success early on,"" Daschle was quoted in the New York Times. ""And because it is early on, it will define his subsequent years.""

"(CNN) -- An Arkansas man suspected in a shooting that killed one soldier and wounded another at a Little Rock military recruiting center was angry over the treatment of Muslims, authorities said Tuesday. Pvt. William Long, 23, of Conway, Arkansas, was killed in Monday's attack. Abdulhakim Bledsoe, 23, of Little Rock, also told police he recently watched a video ""pertaining to subversive activities which spurred him to commit this act,"" according to court documents. Bledsoe pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Tuesday and was ordered held without bail. He faces one count of capital murder and 16 counts of engaging in a terrorist act, said Little Rock Police Chief Stuart Thomas. The terrorist counts stem from the shots fired at an occupied building.  Watch scenes from Tuesday in court Â» . Before the not guilty plea, authorities said Bledsoe waived his Miranda rights after the shooting Monday and gave a video statement indicating that ""political and religious"" motives were involved. He ""stated that he was a practicing Muslim ... that he was mad at the U.S. military because of what they had done to Muslims in the past,"" homicide detective Tommy Hudson said in a police report. Bledsoe told police ""he fired several rounds at the soldiers with the intent of killing them,"" according to Hudson's report. The suspect is a Muslim convert who has also gone by the names Carlos Bledsoe and Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad. He changed his name from the latter April 23, citing religious reasons, court records show. A leader of the Muslim community in Little Rock said he did not know Bledsoe. The suspect had been under investigation after visiting Yemen, a federal law enforcement official said. The official declined to provide further information. Police believe the shooter acted alone ""with the specific purpose of targeting military personnel,"" Thomas said. Kent Krause, Bledsoe's public defender, said a formal hearing would be held for his client, but no date has been set. Residents left flowers and miniature American flags outside the recruiting center after the shooting. A lone candle burned on the sidewalk next to bouquets of white and red roses. A note that said ""Thank you for your service"" was attached to the flowers. The shooting Monday killed Pvt. William Long, 23, of Conway, Arkansas, and wounded Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula, 18, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, who were outside the military recruiting center. Bledsoe told police he was driving around and saw Long and Ezeagwula smoking outside the building, according to Hudson's report. He said he pulled into the parking lot and shot the two soldiers and added that ""he would have killed more soldiers if they had been on the parking lot,"" according to the report. Ezeagwula was in stable condition Tuesday, the police chief said. The soldiers were part of a recruiting program called ""hometown recruiting assistance,"" said Lt. Col. Thomas F. Artis, commander of the Oklahoma recruiting battalion that oversees the Little Rock Army-Navy recruiting center. Under the program, soldiers tell their stories to potential recruits. It's a volunteer position taken while soldiers are visiting or based back in their home region, Artis said. ""I'm relieved there's a suspect in custody,"" said Capt. Matthew Feehan, commander of the recruiting center. He said several people were in the building at the time of the shooting, but nobody else was injured. Bledsoe was arrested after officers on Interstate 630 pulled over his car, which matched witnesses' description of a black Ford sport utility vehicle seen leaving the scene of the shooting. Police recovered three guns from the suspect's vehicle -- an SKS semi-automatic rifle, a .22-caliber rifle and a .380-caliber automatic pistol, Thomas said. The victims were shot with an SKS rifle, according to the police report. Police also seized from Bledsoe's vehicle and apartment several rounds of ammunition, two homemade silencers, handwritten notes in Arabic, CDs with handwritten Arabic labels, a computer and cell phones, according to court documents. Melvin Bledsoe of Memphis, Tennessee, was listed on the police report as Bledsoe's father. He declined to comment, referring questions to Little Rock police.","Police say ""political and religious motives"" were indicated .

"WASHAKIE COUNTY, Wyoming (CNN) -- Federal agents have apprehended accused child molester Edward Eugene Harper, who was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list, an FBI official said Thursday. Edward Eugene Harper is believed to have lived a nomadic lifestyle since fleeing Mississippi. Harper, 63, is accused of molesting two girls, ages 3 and 8, in his neighborhood in Hernando, Mississippi, more than a decade ago, the FBI said. The FBI said it received a telephone tip in June at the Denver office regarding Harper, and brought a SWAT team and a hostage negotiation team to apprehend him in rural Wyoming on Thursday. He surrendered without incident, the FBI said, and later admitted his identity to agents. Harper was living in a 1979 truck with a camper top in the southern portion of Washakie County's Big Horn Mountains, the FBI said. He is believed to have lived a nomadic lifestyle, moving from place to place and earning a living by doing odd jobs and herding sheep, the FBI said in a statement. He was indicted in April 1994 with conspiracy to commit sexual battery, fondling a child and sexual battery. He failed to appear for a scheduled court hearing and a state warrant was issued for his arrest in October 1994. He was later charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, a federal offense. The FBI added him to its 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list last year. Before living in Mississippi, Harper had been a ranch hand, working with cattle and sheep in Montana and Wyoming, the FBI said in its release on Harper last year. He has also worked as a truck driver, the agency said. According to the FBI, Harper subscribed to ""sovereign citizen"" ideology and claimed to be a member of the Montana Freemen, a group that rejected the authority of the U.S. government. The group became famous for an 81-day standoff with federal agents in Montana in 1996. But after the arrest and conviction of many of its members, the group essentially disintegrated, according to Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center. ""As far as I know,"" they don't exist, he said. ""Most of them went to prison and there was nothing left.""","Edward Eugene Harper accused of molesting two girls ages 3 and 8 a decade ago .

"(CNN) -- A Dallas Cowboys scouting assistant suffered a broken back and has been permanently paralyzed after the collapse of the team's practice canopy during a heavy thunderstorm, the Cowboys announced Sunday. An aerial view of the scene shows the Dallas Cowboys logo amid the ruins of the indoor practice facility. Rich Behm, 33, was one of three Cowboys staffers seriously hurt when the storm struck their practice facility Saturday afternoon. Behm's spinal cord was severed by a fractured vertebrae, paralyzing him from the waist down, the team said in a written statement. ""To the Behm family, we extend our love, comfort and the full support of every person and resource within the organization,"" Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. ""Rich is a courageous member of our family and someone for whom we care deeply. We ask for all friends and fans of the Dallas Cowboys to join us in embracing him and his family with their thoughts and prayers at this very difficult time,"" Jones said. A total of 12 people were hurt when a severe thunderstorm knocked down the air-supported, metal frame structure that covered the team's practice field. About 70 people, including more than two dozen of the team's rookies, were in the facility when it was blown down. Cowboys special teams coach Joe DeCamillis had a fractured cervical vertebra, while assistant trainer Greg Gaither had two broken bones in his leg, the team said.

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN)  -- A crowd in southern Lebanon threw rocks at U.N. peacekeepers over the weekend, wounding 14 of them in an effort to prevent the investigation of an explosion in the area, the United Nations said. U.N. peacekeepers were investigating reports of an explosion in a Hezbollah stronghold. The troops with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) were lightly wounded, and some vehicles were damaged including a UNIFIL ambulance, officials said. The explosion took place Tuesday in Khirbet Salim, in what Lebanese authorities said was an uninhabited house. Ammunition stored there caused the blast due to the high temperature and humidity, Lebanese officials said. The region is a stronghold for Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group and political party that fought a war with Israel in 2006. Hezbollah has carried out attacks against civilians, and the United States and Israel list the group as a terrorist organization. Hezbollah officials had no comment Monday. UNIFIL called last week's explosion ""a serious violation of Security Council resolution 1701,"" which was aimed at ending the 2006 conflict, ""notably the provision that there should be no presence of unauthorized assets or weapons in the area of operation between the Litani River and the Blue Line."" Israel said the blast indicated that Hezbollah continued to store weapons near the Israeli border. Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev argued that the Lebanese Army had assisted Hezbollah in preventing U.N. personnel from investigating the scene. UNIFIL, in a statement Monday, said it was conducting a joint investigation with the Lebanese military. When troops Saturday night arrived ""at a location 1 km from the site in order to verify elements related to the explosion, approximately 100 persons gathered and attempted to hamper the activity. ""The amassed population threw stones and confronted the UNIFIL personnel on the ground. As the gathering grew both UNIFIL and LAF deployed additional personnel on the ground in order to contain the situation and prevent any further escalation. ""As UNIFIL troops were leaving the area, one patrol, surrounded by a group of persons, fired warning shots in the air to clear its exit path."" During the incident, the 14 peacekeepers were injured and the vehicles were damaged, the UNIFIL statement said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When man first walked on the moon 40 years ago, it was not only a ""giant leap for mankind"" but also a boon for everyday items. A NASA-inspired tracking system is helping monitor endangered whale sharks. Sports shoes, for example, took a huge leap forward in the late 1980s when AVIA Group International, then a subsidiary of Reebok, turned to space technology to make them more flexible and durable. Freeze-dried food, artificial limbs, cordless vacuum cleaners and edible toothpaste were also developed using research that can be linked to NASA's forays into space. They are listed in detail in ""Spinoff,"" a NASA magazine first compiled in 1976 as a definitive guide to the commercialized products whose development can be tied to space technology. ""We are fairly liberal with our application of the term spinoff,"" said editor Daniel Lockney. ""The product has to contain a component that was developed for NASA, some aspect of it or it could just be NASA's know-how that helped the commercialization of the product,"" he said. More than 1,660 articles on space-related products have been published since the magazine's first edition.  Watch some of the spin-offs developed from space technology Â» . What you won't find on the list is the bright orange powered drink, Tang, or Teflon, or Velcro -- all products that have over time been erroneously linked to NASA's space mission. ""Tang was developed by General Foods before NASA was even made a federal agency, but it was popularized during astronaut tasting experiments,"" Lockney said. ""Velcro was invented by a Swiss engineer in the 1940s,"" he said, adding ""Teflon was created by Dupont. It has many applications within NASA but is not a NASA technology."" Infant formula makes the grade due to an ingredient discovered during NASA research into algae as a source of food supplements. ""Different experiments led to the discovery of a nutrient substance that has previously only been found in breast milk. [This is] believed to be important in the development in the eyes and the brain."" It's now in 95 percent of infant formula sold in the U.S. and in 65 countries around the world, Lockney said. It may have been 40 years since NASA put the first man on the moon, but the number of products that use space technology doesn't seem to be diminishing. ""Spinoff"" publishes articles on 40 to 50 new space-related products every year but receives many more submissions for inclusion. The next edition due out in October will feature a new tracking system for endangered animals, including polar bears and whale sharks, which was derived from an algorithm developed for tracking star patterns. ""Tracing theses animals is something that previously a small core group of scientists would go out and do. We're now able to have ordinary citizens upload their pictures of these animals that have been spotted through Flickr and Facebook. Logging times and dates will significantly increase the level of monitoring of these endangered species,"" Lockney said.

"(CNN) -- English football star Steven Gerrard has admitted punching a man in a bar, but the Liverpool captain insisted in his court testimony that it was in self-defense. England international Steven Gerrard is in court defending his actions after a bar brawl late last year. The 29-year-old is facing a charge of affray after an incident in the early hours of December 29, when he attacked businessman Marcus McGee following a dispute about the music that was being played. If found guilty, Gerrard faces a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a fine of $7,200. Gerrard, who denies the charge, told a judge on Thursday that he was sorry about his actions in Southport's Lounge Inn, but at the time he thought McGee was going to attack him. They had been involved in an argument after Gerrard tried to change the music on the bar's sound system, but McGee would not let him, the UK Press Association reported. ""I thought he was going to hit me,"" Gerrard said. ""He was on his way forward to me and his behavior had changed from when I was having a discussion with him. I didn't know why."" Gerrard said he was unaware that his friend John Doran had already punched McGee when he himself started to hit the 34-year-old. ""I am certainly mistaken in thinking he was coming towards me to throw punches at me,"" the midfielder said. ""Now I know, obviously, he had been struck, reacted and thought the strike was by me and he came into me and that's when I reacted. I am sorry about the whole incident. ""I grabbed the back of his jumper as he moved forward to me. When I had hold of Marcus, I remember swinging my right hand two or three times. ""I was trying to stop still and I felt I had arms all over me. I could see a melee around Marcus McGee. When I was getting pulled away I realized people were patting me, some of whom were my friends. ""I wanted to help control the situation. I was worried the fight I had with Marcus was going to get worse because people were going past me in that direction."" Gerrard said that his friends had earlier told him to ""forget"" the argument, but he felt he needed to confront McGee. ""I couldn't understand why the guy had such a problem with me, why he was so aggressive,"" he said. ""I was also concerned that if I did leave it I would not have been able to enjoy my night, he may have come over to me. ""I wanted to see why he had such a problem with it, why a total stranger had such a problem with me putting my favorite songs on. I asked why I couldn't have an input in the music and tried to explain that I had permission from the manageress."" ""I asked Marcus what was the problem with the music machine and why he treated me like that. Very quickly he came off the bar stool and was in my face right by me."" Gerrard had been celebrating after scoring two goals as Liverpool thrashed Newcastle 5-1 to remain top of the Premier League, and admitted that he had been drinking alcohol. ""I certainly knew I had had a drink. I was certainly in control of how I felt in my surroundings,"" he said. The father of two said he had not been in trouble with the police since the age of 19, when he was banned from driving for nine months for drink-driving.","English football star Steven Gerrard has admitted punching a man in a bar .

"(CNN) -- Texas authorities released court documents Thursday detailing the items seized from the medical office and storage unit of Dr. Conrad Murray, the cardiologist who was with Michael Jackson when he fell ill and died on June 25. Dr. Conrad Murray's office was searched Wednesday for ""evidence of the offense of manslaughter."" Detectives searched both sites in Houston on Wednesday for ""evidence of the offense of manslaughter,"" according to court documents. Murray's attorney confirmed the search Wednesday. Among the items removed from Murray's office were a computer; 27 tablets of Phentermine, a prescription-strength appetite suppressant; 1 tablet of clonazepam, an anti-anxiety medication; and some Rolodex cards. From Murray's storage unit, authorities removed two computer hard drives; an ""important contact list""; a suspension notice from Houston's Doctors Hospital; notices from the Internal Revenue Service; and a list of medical and hospital documents. Jackson's former nurse, Cherilyn Lee, was also approached on Wednesday by investigators who wanted copies of medical files she had on the singer, Lee told CNN's Nancy Grace. Lee said she handed over the files to officials with the coroner's office. Ed Chernoff, a Houston lawyer hired by Murray soon after Jackson's death, confirmed that Los Angeles Police detectives and federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents used a search warrant to enter Murray's office in northeast Houston on Wednesday morning. ""The search warrant authorized law enforcement to search for and seize items, including documents, they believed constituted evidence of the offense of manslaughter,"" Chernoff said in a written statement Wednesday. Chernoff said members of Murray's legal team were at the medical office during the search, which he said ""was conducted by members of the DEA, two robbery-homicide detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department and Houston Police officers."" ""Law enforcement concluded their search around 12:30 p.m. and left with a forensic image of a business computer hard drive and 21 documents. None of the documents taken had previously been requested by law enforcement or the L.A. coroner's office,"" Chernoff said. Tammy Kidd, a spokeswoman at Chernoff's office, said the search ""was absolutely a surprise to us, because we've had open lines of communication this whole time."" ""Based on Dr. Murray's minute-by-minute and item-by-item description of Michael Jackson's last days, he should not be a target of criminal charges,"" Chernoff said Tuesday. ""Dr. Murray was the last doctor standing when Michael Jackson died and it seems all the fury is directed toward him."" Los Angeles investigators have interviewed Murray twice, Chernoff said. A third interview has not been scheduled, he said. Police impounded his car, which had been parked at Jackson's Holmby Hills home, the night after Jackson's death. It was released to Murray several days later. ""Dr. Murray is frustrated by negative and often erroneous media reports. He has to walk around 24-7 with a bodyguard,"" Chernoff said. ""He can't operate his practice. He can't go to work because he is harassed no matter where he goes."" At least two investigations are under way into Jackson's death. The Los Angeles County coroner is waiting for toxicology results to determine a cause of death, while the city Police Department, with assistance from the Drug Enforcement Administration, is looking at the possibility of criminal charges. A coroner's office spokesman said the autopsy findings could be released in the next week or more. Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton told CNN he would wait for the coroner to determine the exact cause of Jackson's death. ""And based on those, we will have an idea of what it is we are dealing (with): Are we dealing with a homicide, or are we dealing with an accidental overdose?"" he said. CNN's Alan Duke, Ted Rowlands and Randi Kaye contributed to this report.","Texas office and storage unit of Dr. Conrad Murray searched .

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A 23-year-old medical student pleaded not guilty Monday to an indictment alleging first-degree murder charge in a killing tied to Craigslist. Philip Markoff is charged with killing a woman and robbing another in Boston hotels in April. Philip Markoff is accused in the the fatal shooting of one woman and the robbery another in Boston hotels earlier this year. A Massachusetts grand jury late last week indicted him on seven counts, including first-degree murder. Markoff is charged with the April 14 fatal shooting and attempted robbery of Julissa Brisman, 25, and the armed robbery of a 29-year-old Las Vegas woman on April 10. Investigators have linked both crimes to ads on the popular Web site Craigslist. He is also charged with ""the armed and forcible confinement"" of the two women, as well as two counts of unlawful firearm possession, the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office said.  Watch Markoff in court Â» . The grand jury returned the indictment late Thursday, and it moves the case from Boston Municipal Court to Suffolk Superior Court, where Markoff entered his not guilty plea on Monday. He previously had pleaded not guilty in the city court and is being held without bail. Markoff's attorney, John Salzberg, had no comment on the new indictment. Prosecutors said Brisman, a model from New York who advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, was shot three times at close range and suffered blunt head trauma at the Marriott Copley Place hotel. The Las Vegas woman was robbed of $800 in cash and $250 in American Express gift cards at the Westin Copley Place hotel, police reports said. Markoff, a second-year medical student at Boston University's School of Medicine, also has been charged in a nonfatal hotel assault in Rhode Island. He has been charged with assault with the intent to rob, assault with a dangerous weapon, possession of a handgun and use of a firearm while committing a crime of violence, stemming from an April 16 robbery attempt at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island.","NEW: Suspect pleads not guilty to slaying of woman, robbery of another .

"(CNN) -- An Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper was suspended Wednesday for five days without pay following a highly publicized scuffle with a paramedic in Okfuskee County in May, according to the Highway Patrol. This is an image from a video that captured an Oklahoma trooper's scuffle with a paramedic in May. The incident, which was caught on dash-camera and cell-phone video, showed Trooper Daniel Martin pulling over a Creek Nation ambulance for a traffic-stop violation. During the incident, Martin is heard repeatedly using profanity and twice getting into a scuffle with one of the paramedics. Both paramedics and family members of the patient in the ambulance informed Martin several times by there was a patient inside, but he did not allow the paramedics to continue to the hospital while the video continued. In a news conference Wednesday, Oklahoma Highway Patrol Captain Chris West said Martin ""failed to recognize that it would have been more reasonable and appropriate to immediately allow the ambulance to continue to the hospital once he understood there was a patient onboard the ambulance.""  Watch the confrontation Â» . West also said Martin had ""probable cause to make the traffic stop and justification to arrest the paramedic for obstructing a police officer"" but that the incident ""resulted in conduct unbecoming an officer."" Martin's attorney, Gary James of Oklahoma City, did not immediately return a phone call from CNN. In a disciplinary letter sent to Martin, Oklahoma Public Safety Department Commissioner Kevin Ward, concluded that the ""disregard for the welfare of the patient [justified] severe discipline."" Martin will also be required to take an anger assessment, West said. The trooper had no previous discipline action in his record, according to West. On Tuesday, the paramedic involved in the scuffle, Maurice White, filed a lawsuit against Martin in federal court claiming his civil rights were violated. CNN's Mayra Cuevas-Nazario contributed to this report.","May incident was caught on dash-camera and cell-phone video .

"(CNN) -- Finnish prosecutors will file genocide charges against a Rwandan man in the killings of 15 people during Rwanda's ethnic cleansing bloodbath in 1994, authorities said Monday. The case is the first genocide trial in Finland's history. Accused of complicity in the killings, the unidentified man would face life imprisonment if convicted. ""It is obvious, according to the pre-trial investigation, that the man has committed a crime of genocide in the municipality of Nyakizu in April and May 1994 with intent to destroy the Rwandan Tutsis partly or totally,"" Finland's prosecutor-general said in a statement. The man, a 58-year-old Hutu, has denied the charges. Stoked by the assassination of then-Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, extremist militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis across Rwanda, beginning in April 1994. Within 100 days, an estimated 800,000 people were killed. The genocide ended when Tutsi-led militias backing Rwandan President Paul Kagame ousted the Hutu government supporting the massacre. The Rwandan man was living in Porvoo, about 50 km (31 miles) east of the Finnish capital of Helsinki, when he was arrested. Prosecutors said they interviewed nearly 100 witnesses abroad before proceeding with charges against the man.","The case is the first genocide trial in Finland's history .

"(CNN) -- Last August, then-Republican presidential nominee John McCain introduced to the nation his surprise pick for vice president, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has a strong base of supporters, as well as a steady supply of vocal critics. At the time, little was known about the fresh-faced, first-term governor, but within days, Palin's face was on newspapers, magazines and tabloids. Since then, Palin has become a polarizing figure in the Republican Party. Her passionate supporters are countered with equally fervent critics. And even though it's been nearly a year since she ventured onto the national stage and more than eight months since the Republican ticket lost the election, as Palin prepares to leave office, the public's interest in her has yet to wane. Palin explains why she's stepping down . ""She's kind of a shooting star that caught fire and kept burning,"" said Lorenzo Benet, an assistant editor for People magazine and author of ""Trailblazer: An Intimate Biography of Sarah Palin."" ""When she walks into a room, she definitely commands attention and she gets more than most. She's definitely a star,"" said Benet, who was the only national journalist to have spent much time with Palin in the weeks before she was announced as McCain's running mate. Palin, a mother of five, ""caught the imagination"" of the public because there is no one else like her, Benet said. ""Particularly for conservative America, there hasn't been a rallying figure of this type,"" he noted. In the days leading up to Palin's debut speech at the Republican National Convention last September, Palin revealed that her 17-year-old daughter Bristol was pregnant. The announcement followed Internet rumors that Sarah Palin's 4-month-old baby was actually Bristol's. The instant fascination with Palin and her family was just a glimpse of what was to come. The public wanted to know everything it could about the Alaska governor, whose resume also included beauty queen, high school basketball star, TV sportcaster and mayor of the small Alaska town of Wasilla. Amid all the rumors and negative press, Palin showed herself to be a fierce attack dog and came out throwing punches in her speech at the RNC. The self-described ""hockey mom"" tore into then-candidate Barack Obama as two-faced, inexperienced and intoxicated by the sound of his own voice. Even her critics recognized the spirit she brought to the GOP. Palin continued to throw flames on the campaign trail, energizing her supporters and outraging her adversaries. ""She yelled fire in a crowded theater. She really did, in some of her speeches --'palling around' with terrorists and some of the other slurs she was hurling in the way of Obama and the Democrats,"" said Larry Persily, a former Palin staffer and Alaskan journalist. ""That turned off an equally big chunk of the American public that found it distasteful, destructive, divisive, mean and ignorant. Whereas others said, 'Way to go girl. You stick it to them,"" he said. But Palin hasn't always been such a divisive figure. Before entering the national scene, Palin, who knocked out incumbent Republican Frank Murkowski in the gubernatorial primary, was touted as one of the most popular governors in the country, with approval ratings nearing 90 percent. She was seen as a champion of ethics, determined to root out corruption and challenge the status quo. For those in Alaska, Palin's Reaganesque appeal was nothing new. She secured her role as a local hero back in 1982 when she led Wasilla High School's basketball team to a state championship. And in a small community like Wasilla, that was a big deal. Alaskans liked her ""combativeness and feistiness,"" Benet said, and resurrected her nickname of ""Barracuda"" during her successful 1996 campaign to be Wasilla's mayor. But when Palin's ""Barracuda"" side hit the national stage, it was met with mixed reactions. Evangelia Souris, the president of Optimum International Center for Image Management, says Palin's potential is the driving force behind the public's love-hate relationship with her. ""That's what people are drawn to, and that's what actually threatens others. She definitely has the power to shake up a lot of old-school institutions."" said Souris, who has advised politicians. Furthermore, Souris said, ""I just don't think people were ready for somebody so attractive and so fashionable and so hip to actually be campaigning. She falls out of the norm,"" Souris added. But despite grumblings from some that they're sick of hearing about her, stories about her continue to get a lot of attention. Benet said People magazine follows two politicians: ""One is Obama, and one is Sarah Palin -- and then there's everybody else."" From being dogged by ethics complaints, to her public fight with Levi Johnston (the father of her grandson and ex-fiance of her daughter), to her recent announcement that she's resigning this week as governor, Palin has maintained a steady presence in the public eye since stepping off the campaign trail. Michael Carey, a columnist with the Anchorage Daily News, says Palin stirs excitement -- and hostility -- because ""people want to see her even if they don't like her."" He likens the public's interest with her to ""drinking on the sly."" People say, ""I don't want to do this, I know I shouldn't, but I do it anyway,"" he said. Some people love Palin, Persily said, because they can relate to her. ""I think much of America said, 'Oh gee look at her, she's just like us. Kind of dumb on some things, kind of smart on others. Imperfect. And not at all embarrassed to show all of her imperfections.'"" But others saw her imperfections as inadequacies. ""She's simplistic. Some people love the simplistic approach to problems. Others shake their heads and say, 'My God, you don't get it.'"" Persily added. Opponents have been quick to question Palin's intellectual chops, pointing to her spotty college career. Palin attended five colleges, graduating from the University of Idaho with a communications degree in 1987. A series of botched national interviews didn't do much to disprove their point. But even Palin's critics admire her ability to connect with the people, Benet said. ""I don't think I've ever really met anyone like that, except maybe Bill Clinton, that will have that interpersonal eye contact with you and will remember your name and your kids' names, and make small talk with you and be really sincere about it,"" he said. Benet predicted that while Palin might take a short break to recoup once she hands off power on Sunday, ""she'll be back in the public eye."" ""I do see her turning this to her advantage,"" he said, noting that she's made a similar move before. In 2004, Palin stepped down as chair of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission after less than a year on the job, amid controversy over ethics allegations against another committee member. She turned that move around and used it as a launchpad to run for governor, because she went after the corruption going on in Alaska at the time. ""For me, I think she's just catching her breath. She's just too young to retire,"" he added. ""She did say 10 years ago she wanted to be president some day. She hasn't backed off from that."" In Carey's opinion, Palin's career as an elected official is over, but he doesn't expect Palin to be leaving the headlines anytime soon. ""She's gone from being our governor or a public figure in Alaska to being a national celebrity,"" he said. ""It's clear that her days of governor -- there are just a few of them left, but she's really only at the beginning of her career as a celebrity.""","Alaska Gov.

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- A man at a Fort Lewis army post on Wednesday fatally shot a woman before turning the gun on himself, military authorities said. The shootings on Wednesday occurred outside the main post exchange at Fort Lewis in Washington state. The man, who was hospitalized earlier in the day, was pronounced dead late Wednesday, Fort Lewis spokesman Joe Kubistek said. The man shot the woman and then shot himself in the head, said Maj. Mike Garcia. He said the shootings occurred outside the main post exchange, as retail stores at military installations are called. Garcia said the 59-year-old shooter was a retired soldier. The woman he shot, Garcia said, was a civilian who worked as a vendor in the store. Neither was identified. Kathy Johnson had taken her elderly mother to shop at the store when shots rang out. ""I heard five to six shots and hit the floor,"" Johnson said, ""I was hiding under a clothing rack and people were yelling that we were being taken hostage."" Eventually, Johnson said, customers were told over the store intercom that it was safe to leave the store. Outside military police had surrounded the store and were posted on nearby rooftops, she said, . It was not immediately clear what the relationship between the man and woman was, Garcia said. He said since the shooting took place on a federal installation, the FBI would lead the investigation into the shootings.

It's a testament to my generosity of spirit I waded through these interweb love sewers in order to impart some sort of wisdom. Here's the wisdom: dating sites are terrible. Possibly, if I was in prison, an Alaskan crab fisherman or a morbidly obese shut-in so humongous I had to wash myself with a ShamWow stapled to a broom handle, I could see the value in such sites. But I'm not isolated, nor confined to a forklift. I don't need a middleman brokering a get together between the potential woman of my dreams and my own abilities to self-sabotage and humiliate myself. I can do this without an intermediary. The Frisky: Have to go online to get a date? This might or might not be a totally uninformed opinion. The extent of my research began and ended with me signing up for OK Cupid, and failing to finish my profile. I couldn't even bring myself to pick a pseudonym, which just seemed like the first of many lies required to meet anyone. Do I call myself OptimusGandalf and admit from the get-go that I'm an alpha nerd? Do I overshare a little too much and pick EdgarAllanEeyore? Or do I just admit to being a snarky, pretentious creep and go for HumbertHumbert? The Frisky: Online dating dos and don'ts . I tried to fill out the profile, but instead, it just filled me with a quiet rage. The self-summary section was baffling. It pushed me into an existential identity crisis. Who am I? Or more importantly, who am I when it comes to who I want someone else to think I am, so they will contact me, go out with me, and eventually kiss me? Am I a sensitive guy, or a romantic, or sarcastic? Maybe I'm all three. I love long walks, going to see live indie bands, and whatever. I made sure to pepper everything with winking non-sequiturs and casual attempts at pop profundity. Then there was the section where I define myself by the books, movies, and music I listen to. My music list was a near impenetrable list of overly eclectic bands that reflect my excellent taste, punctuated by ""and Genesis."" My movies were all '80s flicks, foreign films, and David Lynch. By the time I got to books, and wrote ""Pynchon,"" I was in a full-fledged state of self-loathing. The Frisky: Five online dating types to avoid . Let me get this straight: I'm going to spend a ton of time crafting a persona that is a borderline dishonest amplification of the personality traits I think other people will find attractive so I can find someone who's done the same thing, and we can both go out and discover that we're equally compatible idiots fakers. It's like a masquerade party in the Twilight Zone: I take off my Brad Pitt mask just so I can reveal Sloth from ""The Goonies."" The Frisky: Downside of online dating . There are, no doubt, many of you who have met the love of your life via online dating sites. Good for you. Congratulations on basically winning the lottery. I firmly believe I have a better chance of getting a girlfriend dressed like Zeus, stopping women on the street, and bellowing, ""Rut with me, mortal beauty, and feel thine mighty, fleshy thunder!"" Not that I want a girlfriend. I just broke up with six the other day. I can deal with the risks of love. The threat of heartbreak is what makes finding that one person who sparks your fuse so precious. But I have to be honest, the online dating thing freaked me out. It touched a nerve, and I'm flummoxed as to why. The only conclusion I could come up with was that, maybe, we deserved them. Perhaps online dating sites accurately reflect a generation of singles so entitled to instant happiness and acceptance, we flock to digital artifices that both feed and coddle our egos. Virtual environments where we can indiscriminately reject dishonest projections of identity, while simultaneously being insulated from the very rejection we dole out. A play land of false romantic promises and deferred risk. A huge solipsistic waste of time.

"(CNN) -- NFL quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, accused of sexually assaulting a woman last summer, said Thursday that he is innocent. Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger says there is no merit to the accusation. ""Saturday was the first that I learned of her accusations,"" the Pittsburgh Steeler said, calling the accusation reckless, false and an attack on his family. The woman filed a civil complaint against Roethlisberger last week. ""I would never, ever force myself on a woman,"" he said. The complaint, filed Friday in the 2nd Judicial District Court in Washoe County, Nevada, alleges that Roethlisberger sexually assaulted the woman -- an executive casino host at Harrah's Lake Tahoe -- while he was staying at the resort for a celebrity golf tournament in July 2008. Teresa Duffy of the Douglas County, Nevada, Sheriff's Department, said the department does not intend to open an investigation unless the alleged victim comes forward and tells authorities she wants them to. Roethlisberger said that he would not discuss the ""civil case in the media,"" but that he would fight to protect his family and his reputation. Roethlisberger and eight Harrah's employees are named in the suit, which seeks at least $390,000, plus unspecified punitive damages, from the defendants. Harrah's itself is not named as a defendant. The woman said that the employees contributed to her emotional distress and that some defamed her and tried to cover up the incident. According to the complaint, on July 11, 2008, the woman was working on the 17th floor -- the same floor as Roethlisberger's room -- when Roethlisberger told her that his television and sound system were not working. He asked her to try to fix it, the complaint said. When she entered his room and deemed that the television was working, she tried to leave, but Roethlisberger blocked her way, the complaint states. He then, against her will, kissed her, groped her and sexually assaulted her, the complaint states. The woman says that in the months following the incident, she incurred emotional distress that resulted in hospitalizations that included treatment for anxiety and depression, the complaint said. Calvin Dunlap, the woman's attorney, said earlier this week that his client did not pursue criminal charges after the alleged assault because she felt discouraged when the resort's chief of security did not investigate the matter. According to the complaint, the chief told her she was ""overreacting."" Dunlap said the chief has ""close ties to law enforcement."" Of the eight employees, all but two are still employed by Harrah's, according to a spokeswoman for Harrah's Entertainment. Marybel Batjer of Harrah's declined to comment on the suit, other than to say that the alleged victim still works at Harrah's Lake Tahoe as an executive casino host. Another Harrah's Entertainment spokesman, Gary Thompson, said the company was ""confident that a much different story will emerge and that the Harrah's employees will be dismissed from the lawsuit."" Roethlisberger's attorney, David Cornwell, released a statement saying the charges were false. ""The timing of a lawsuit and the absence of a criminal complaint and a criminal investigation are the most compelling evidence of the absence of any criminal conduct,"" he said. CNN's Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.","""I would never, ever force myself on a woman,"" Ben Roethlisberger says .

"(CNN) -- Humiliation and comedy have always been natural bedfellows, but the one doesn't guarantee the other, as poor Katherine Heigl discovers in this crude, sub-par stab at a modern screwball comedy. Katherine Heigl plays the sophisticated female boss of Gerard Butler in ""The Ugly Truth."" The ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Knocked Up"" star plays Abby, a supposedly intelligent producer on a local Sacramento TV news show. We're repeatedly assured that she's good at her job, though there's little or no evidence for that in what we see, and apparently the ratings are in the toilet. That's why her boss drafts controversial cable clown Mike (Gerard Butler), whose bargain basement show ""The Ugly Truth"" gives viewers the real dope on the opposite sex. Mike's straight talk isn't exactly edifying -- or original. It boils down to this: men are only interested in one thing, and it's not your IQ score. His advice to women: swallow your pride -- and anything else that might come up. Abby is understandably skeptical, both professionally and personally, but the sweeps prove her wrong. Mike may be outrageous, but Sacramento loves him for it. A smarter comedy might make mischief from these base ingredients, the sophisticated female boss and her rude, reactionary star employee. But this movie, which is credited to three female screenwriters, bends over backward to accommodate Mike's tired old sexist world view and fails to be funny in the process. Abby really is a neurotic control freak, living alone with her cat and a checklist about what constitutes the perfect guy. And when a close approximation of the type moves in right next door (Eric Winton as a handsome young doctor), she only lands him by putting herself in Mike's hands: accentuating her cleavage, losing the ponytail and trading in dinner and an art show for a hot dog and a baseball game. Directed by Robert Luketic (""Monster in Law""), ""The Ugly Truth"" barely attempts to disguise its own lifts and tucks. The most craven of these gambits involves Abby going into multiple orgasm at a business dinner, a variation on Meg Ryan's famous scene in ""When Harry Met Sally,"" except that in Ryan's case, she was in full control, demonstrating her mastery of the fake-out. Abby, though, is sent into inadvertent paroxysms when the remote control of the vibrating panties she's wearing -- don't ask -- falls into the hands of a curious kid.  Watch the stars describe the scene Â» . In other scenes, Heigl is caught hanging upside down from a tree in her nightgown, hiding in her office closet and furiously rubbing a stain out of the doctor's crotch in front of a stadium of ball fans. Presumably this is what picking up Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock's cast-offs entails these days. Katharine Hepburn would weep. But what about Mike? Surely he has lessons to learn and comic indignities to endure? Not so much. In contrast to Abby's makeover, he's allowed to be comfortable in his own rather corpulent skin. Gerard Butler evidently hasn't worked out since Sparta; heck, he hasn't even bothered to shave. You won't be surprised that the avowed bachelor boy falls in love with dear Abby. Of course he's a nice guy underneath. We know that from the way he looks out for his fatherless nephew. So what if he's a sexist pig? He's a sexy sexist pig, and obviously father material. What more could any woman want? ""The Ugly Truth"" is rated R and runs 97 minutes.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- When shots rang out at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum last week, security officers Harry Weeks and Jason McCuiston were stunned. Harry Weeks, left, and Jason McCuiston fired on James von Brunn at the Holocaust Memorial Museum. ""I would say it was surreal, both of us couldn't believe what was happening,"" Weeks told CNN in his first national televised interview since the June 10 shooting. ""I know myself I just, I heard 'pop, pop' and it was surreal."" McCuiston added: ""It wasn't normal. You knew something was wrong and you knew it was very bad."" What went terribly wrong is that white supremacist James von Brunn allegedly walked into the museum and started firing his rifle, shooting security officer Stephen Johns in the chest. Despite their initial shock, Weeks and McCuiston kept their composure enough to draw their weapons and start shooting at von Brunn, 88. Weeks had fired his gun in the line of duty 25 years earlier as a Washington, D.C., police officer. But he said nothing compared to this bloody confrontation. ""This was terrible,"" Weeks said softly. ""This was worse. ... We lost Officer Johns."" Johns died shortly after the shooting, leaving behind a family that includes a teenage son who told CNN affiliate WUSA-TV the day after the tragedy that his dad was ""my hero."" Watching a video clip of those comments, McCuiston started crying. ""First thing I thought about, I have an 11-year-old,"" the officer said before breaking down.  Watch the officers tell their story Â» . Just moments before their joint interview with CNN on Thursday, McCuiston and Weeks attended a grief counseling session together, and both men say they are still struggling with their emotions. The security officers said they believe von Brunn will survive his wounds and eventually face trial. So they would not discuss details of the shootout out of a fear of jeopardizing the criminal investigation, but they were willing to discuss their memories of Johns so that the public knows more about him. McCuiston said the 6-foot-6-inch, 300-pound Johns was a ""gentle giant"" who was always friendly to colleagues and museum visitors. ""Just an awesome guy,"" he recalled. ""Grin from ear to ear. You'd never know that man probably ever had a bad day in his life."" Weeks said he wanted the world to see ""what a man of hate did to this family, and the grief he caused. Let's all remember Officer Johns, and his family, because he took the ultimate -- he did his job and he was where he was supposed to be -- and the family suffered. That could have been anyone."" McCuiston and Weeks, however, deflected suggestions that they may be heroes as well because if they had not stopped von Brunn, there's no telling how many of the more than 2,000 people visiting the museum at the time could have been injured or killed. ""A lot of people are going to be saying what they have been saying, 'You are a hero, you're this, you're that,' "" McCuiston said. ""It's like we tell everybody, 'We chose this job, it's a job. It's the same as a firefighter who would walk into a building, that is his job, he chose to do it.' "" Johns' funeral on Friday has been moved to a larger church in the Washington area to accommodate all of the people who want to attend, and the museum will be closed most of the day so that his colleagues can attend. ""Everyone knows when you lose someone, death is one of the worst things, even though it is reality,"" McCuiston said. ""Time will hopefully heal all, and hopefully there will be a little bit of closure with us and the family and we can all just move forward but never forget what a wonderful man he was.""","Security officers Harry Weeks and Jason McCuiston recall shooting, fellow officer .

"(CNN) -- After meeting a number black couples in crisis, Nisa Muhammad and Dr. Rozario Slack were inspired to create Basic Training for Couples. Nisa Muhammad, who founded National Black Marriage Day, co-created the Basic Training for Couples program. The eight-week program educates dating, engaged or married couples about the value of commitment, responsibility to the black community, psychological differences between the sexes, sexual intimacy and conflict resolution.  Slack created the male-friendly portion while Muhammad, who founded National Black Marriage Day and the Wedded Bliss Foundation, created the female-friendly portion. In the program, couples also learn about the history of the African-American marriage and many for the first time plot their own family tree to trace marriage and divorces.  The following is rundown of the eight-week course:  Class No. 1: Why marriage? This class teaches the benefits of marriage for men, women, children and the community. It gives the history of marriage in the black community from slavery when marriage was illegal to today's trends. Icebreaker: Q & A: How couples met? Homework: . 1. Choose songs to reflect their love for each other . 2. Marriage family tree . Class No. 2: From I to we; the sweetness of surrender . This class helps couples transition from ""I thinking"" to ""we thinking."" It helps them understand the value of making their marriage a priority in their lives. Class No. 3: Communication; getting your message understood . This class helps couples take responsibility for their communication and teaches skills to improve their communication techniques. Main lessons: . â¢ Respecting differences between men and women . â¢ Learning to talk to each other and not at each other . â¢ Format: Teaching session with dialogue. â¢ Activity: The talking stick, during conversation only the individual holding the stick can speak. Class No. 4: Conflict management . This class helps couples understand that conflict needs to be managed, or it will manage you. It helps to normalize some conflict that couples experience with the understanding that some conflict cannot be resolved and can only be managed. Lessons: . â¢ This class targets biases. When there's a difference of opinions, generally the stronger spouse wants his or her way. â¢ How to bring closure to old issues instead of combining them into new issues/conflict. â¢ Agree to disagree and not degrade your spouse for having a difference of opinion. Activity: Break up into gender groups to discuss current conflicts. The group works out ways to solve the issue . Class No. 5: Let's make love . When the sex is good in a marriage, it's only about 20 percent of what's going on. When it's bad, it's a significant problem. This class helps to solve some of those problems. The approach was from a physiological and biological perspective of the differences between the male's and female's body. Discussion included chemical bonding effect in women and men. Class No. 6: From yours and mine to ours . Many couples in the black community bring children from other relationships to their marriage. This class helps to blend the family into one cohesive unit. It also talks about preventing in-laws from becoming outlaws. Class No. 7: Keeping the FIRE burning . FIRE is an acronym for Faithful, Intimacy, Responsibility and Excitement. This class helps couples maintain the FIRE in their relationship. Class No. 8: From this day forward . This class helps couples understand the value of commitment in their marriage and never to make divorce an option. They create their own place for success.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Police and soldiers killed at least 133 people during two days of riots between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria last year, Human Rights Watch alleged Monday. Anti-riot policemen patrol the streets in Jos, Nigeria, following riots between Christians and Muslims. Most of the victims of violence by security forces were young Muslim men, often unarmed, the group charged in testimony before a state commission examining the riots and in a separate report. More than 700 people died in the violence last November, the group said, citing local religious authorities on both sides of the divide. A 26-year-old mechanic described seeing anti-riot police known as MOPOLs hunting down people near where he worked. ""I saw them enter one house just across the street from us,"" the unnamed witness said. ""We heard shots and later we saw five bodies there. Anyone they found hiding in the garage, they shot them. They combed the garage hunting for people. This went on for about 10 minutes or so. Then they returned to their truck and left."" Another witness described police units going from house to house, summarily executing unarmed men and boys. A third said he saw an unarmed shopkeeper plead for his life. Police ordered him to lie down on the ground, the witness said. ""He kept saying, 'Please God, allow me to live.'... One of them said, 'Today you go die,' and then he shot him in the side. Then the same MOPOL shot him again. As he was going to shoot him a third time, the other MOPOL said ... 'Leave it, he's already dead.'"" The shopkeeper managed to drag himself to a neighbor's house, where the neighbor tried to stop the bleeding from wounds to the back and abdomen. Police then returned and shot tear gas into the neighbor's house, he testified. The shopkeeper ""died a short time later,"" the neighbor said. In the report, released Monday, Human Rights Watch says it ""documented 133 of these killings but believes that the actual number of arbitrary killings by security forces may be substantially higher than these figures."" James Manook, a spokesman for Plateau State where the violence occurred, said the Human Rights Watch claims are ""one of the issues that the commission has under inquiry, and given that - I do not want to comment while it's under investigation."" However, he added, "" I assure you that we remain respectful of the rule of law."" The clashes followed a dispute over an election that pitted a Christian candidate against a Muslim one in late November 2008. Police and soldiers responded to the riots with deadly force, on the same day the governor of the state issued a ""shoot-on-sight"" order, Human Rights Watch said. The group based its allegations on 151 interviews in the city of Jos in Nigeria's Plateau State, it says in the report. It withheld the names of many of the people it interviewed over the course of 18 days in December 2008 and February 2009. The report includes photographs of burned-out mosques, Christian boarding schools, and homes and businesses. The rights group said the state commission examining the riots should investigate and call for the prosecution of security forces involved. ""At least 130 men were killed by members of the very institutions charged with protecting them,"" said Corinne Dufka, senior West Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""These investigative bodies owe it to the victims and their families to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into these extremely serious allegations."" Eric Guttschuss, a Human Rights Watch researcher, testified before the commission Monday. There is a history of religious violence in central Nigeria, where majority-Muslim north Africa meets largely Christian sub-Saharan Africa. Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 people were killed in riots in 2001. Local religious leaders in Jos have been trying to bridge the differences, including setting up a soccer league with teams on which Christians and Muslims play side-by-side. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","Nigerian police, soldiers accused of killing 133 during riots in November 2008 .

"(AOL Autos) -- With car companies going in into bankruptcy and shedding famous names left and right, it's important to remember that today's automotive titans started out as tiny startups, not unlike Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. General Motors was almost called International Motors Co. Names like Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota and Porsche call to mind the huge corporate successes of the past and the great automotive families that survive today. But behind every brand name, there is a flesh-and-blood inventor, entrepreneur or industrialist. Most of the time, they gave their name to the companies. And that fame was often about all they ended up with. David Buick, who invented the overhead valve engine, founded the Buick Motor Car Co. in 1903. William C. Durant, the industrialist who would eventually found GM, took over the company in 1904, when it ran into financial trouble. Buick stayed on as a director, but left in 1908, never making much money from the enterprise. He reportedly died in 1929, unable to afford one of his cars. Durant kept the name for one of his company divisions and for the car, even though he worried that people might pronounce it ""Boo-ick,"" according to one author. Strangely enough, the man who practically created General Motors single-handedly never really liked the idea of a 'Durant' car. In another example, Robert Hupp invented the Hupmobile,'a two-seat runabout, in 1908. But he sold his stock in his Hupp Motor Car Company in 1911. He turned around and founded the Hupp Corp. that same year. Investors in his first firm took him to court to make him drop the ""Hupp"" from his new company's name and they won. His own automotive glory quickly faded, although the Hupmobile survived until the 1940s. Swiss-born Louis Chevrolet's experience was similar. Durant brought him into a new car-building venture in 1911, hoping to trade on his fame as an absolutely fearless race car driver. Chevrolet left the company in 1913, apparently unable to make the adjustment from racing to building production vehicles. But its name stuck to the new Chevrolet vehicles; Durant reportedly liked its musical lilt. It could also work the other way around. In 1925, Walter P. Chrysler got the naming rights to the Maxwell Motor Co. after he and another industrialist steadily bought up shares in the firm over a two-year period. Things turned out a little differently for Henry Ford. He suffered the ignominy of being booted from an early auto company that bore his own name. But his revenge was sweet. The Henry Ford Company, which traded freely on Ford's early fame as an inventor, fired him in 1902 ""because he was spending all his time developing a race car, not a passenger car,"" according to the Encyclopedia of American Business and Biography. AOL Autos: Ford's 'Wonder Woman' engineers most important new car . After Ford was gone, the company was renamed Cadillac, after Antoine Laumet de la Mothe Cadillac, the French nobleman who founded Detroit in 1703; his heraldry became the model's badge and the company became a part of General Motors in 1909. After his firing, Ford quickly found investors to help him found his own firm, the Ford Motor Co., in 1903. He introduced the company's first new vehicle, the Model and followed it up with other low-cost vehicles, including his greatest achievement, the Model T, in 1908. Its price tag started at $850 and fell steadily as Ford introduced more production innovations. The young firm became phenomenally successful. AOL Autos: 10 classic American rides . In the 1920s, he got the chance to buy the five-year-old Lincoln Motor Co. out of bankruptcy. It was then owned by one of the very people, Henry Leland, who fired him in 1902. Then he used the former aircraft company to launch his own line of luxury cars bearing the Lincoln name. For its part, General Motors almost didn't get the name it bears today. Durant actually incorporated his company under the name ""International Motors Co."", in New Jersey in 1908. But his attorney advised him that it would be easier to raise capital under a new name. ""We might use 'United Motors Company' were it not for the fact that there is already a United Motor Car Company in that state,"" the attorney wrote. ""We suggest the name General Motors Company, as we have ascertained it can be used."" A newly coined French word, auto-mobile, inspired many vehicle names of the early years. Inventor Ransom E. Olds filed a patent for an ""auto-mobile"" during the mid-1890s. Names like Bugmobile, Locomobile, Hupmobile, and of course, the Oldsmobile, could not have come along without it. The origins of some names can be tricky to trace. The first use of Jeep, for instance. is shrouded in mist. Jim Allen, the author of a book called ""Jeep,"" concludes that it's based on early World War II slang for ""a new, unproven recruit or a new unproven vehicle."" It wasn't until 1950 that Toledo-based Willys-Overland, Inc., one of the producers of the early four-wheel-drive vehicle, trademarked the term. Many of the names were not originally associated with the auto industry. The Toyota name came from the Toyoda loom works in Kariya, Japan; When it turned to car production, the Toyoda family changed the 'd' to a 't' to make it simpler and more elegant in Japanese script. AOL Autos: Top 10 best car names . There's little doubt about other brand names. Pontiac was an offshoot of the Pontiac Buggy Co., a horseless carriage manufacturer named after a renowned Indian chief. Mechanic Soichiro Honda started producing motorized bicycles after the devastation of World War II and eventually graduated to cars. AOL Autos: Pontiacs we'll never forget . Volkswagen, a response to Adolf Hitler's call for a car for the common folk, means 'people's car' in German, evidently beating out the prototype's name, 'Strength through Joy,' for the honors. In 1917, the Rapp Engine Works became known as the Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH, or Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) as the four-year-old airplane engine firm diversified into motorcycle engines, with a stylized white propeller against a blue sky as its logo, according to some authorities. The first BMW cars were produced 11 years later. The legendary Jaguar name is considered one of the best sports car names of all time. It beat out a long list of lackluster animal names compiled by a British ad agency in 1935. In 1939, Ford struck gold with Mercury, the fleet-footed messenger of the gods. It tapped into Greek and Roman mythology for the name, just as it did for the similarly styled Lincoln Zephyr, the god of the wind, three years earlier. Some other storied automotive brands are based on acronyms. Fiat stands for Fabbrica Italiani Automobili Torino, or Italian Automotive Works Turin. Similarly, Saab stands for Svenska Aeroplanaktiebolaget, or Swedish Aeroplane Ltd., hearkening back to the automaker's origins as an aircraft company. Ford might have done better with an acronym in 1958. The Edsel was conceived as a new, distinct Ford Motor Co. brand, with its own models, badge and division. The mission was to take on GM's Oldsmobile. After considering thousands of suggestions, Ford named the new brand after Edsel Ford, Henry Ford's only child. He had been a major styling influence within the company and was its president at his fathers death in 1943. The name Edsel was an immediate letdown. Ford stock fell 10 points on the day it was announced. One disenchanted executive predicted that the name alone would cost the new vehicle 200,000 units in sales. AOL Autos: Best and worst automotive designs of all time . Its name wasn't the sole reason for its failure. It didn't help that the country was in recession or that the new car seemed based on Ford and Mercury models. But all that didn't stop Edsel from entering the vocabulary as an idea or project fated to failure.","David Buick invented the overhead valve engine, founded Buick Motor Car Co.

"(CNN)  -- A top executive for the company which built the flight data recorder aboard Air France Flight 447 says he hopes his firm's 100 percent recovery record from air accidents will be maintained despite concerns the device may be lost at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. A Brazilian diver floats on wreckage of Flight 447 spotted Wednesday. Although some debris has been retrieved, air crash investigators remain in the dark about what caused the airliner to plunge into the sea off the coast of Brazil with 228 people onboard earlier this month. The wreckage is believed to be about 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) deep, amid underwater mountains and mixed in with tons of sea trash. A French nuclear submarine and other vessels are searching for the flight data recorder by attempting to trace its locator beacon, which sends acoustic pulses, or ""pings,"" to searchers. The U.S. Navy has contributed two high-tech acoustic devices -- known as towed pinger locators -- which have been attached to French tug boats and can search to a maximum depth of 20,000 feet. Honeywell Aerospace's Paolo Carmassi -- the firm's president for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India -- told CNN that retrieving the flight data could help solve the mystery of the plane's fate and said his company had never lost a black box involved in an accident. ""We believe that our technology is well-positioned to, in this case, contribute to solve the big question around this particular accident,"" Carmassi said. ""We have a 100 percent recovery rate of all the black boxes that we have installed that unfortunately may have been involved in accidents, so we hope that we will be able to maintain our record and be able to shed some light on what happened.""  Watch what clues investigators are looking at Â» . But Carmassi acknowledged it was hard to estimate how much battery life the locator beacon had left. ""There is a certain duration which depends on the particular environmental conditions, whether it's underwater or on land, whether it's at 10 meters or 4,000 meters. So, it's very difficult to pinpoint exactly the duration,"" he said. Yann Cochennec, an aviation expert with Air et Cosmos magazine, told CNN that a recorder had been retrieved from the seabed in 2004 after an Egyptian charter flight crashed into the Red Sea shortly after leaving Sharm el-Sheikh. But he said the depth of the Atlantic, strong currents and bad weather would make retrieving the recorder from the Air France wreckage far more difficult. The flight data recorder -- sometimes called a ""black box"" -- is actually an orange, metal cylinder weighing about 13 pounds. Inside is a stack of memory chips designed to survive high temperatures, strong impact and tons of pressure. The devices record virtually every detail about how an aircraft is working, including cabin pressure, speed and altitude, remaining fuel and whether that fuel is flowing properly. They have played a crucial part in air crash investigations since they were first fitted to commercial aircraft in the 1940s.","Maker of flight data recorder aboard AF447 has ""100 percent"" recovery rate .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Researchers in the United States are buoyed by the results of a study which has determined that a giant grass could help the country to meet its steep biofuel targets. Stephen Long amid Miscanthus stalks found to outperform other biofuel sources. After successful long-term trials in Europe, a three-year field study of Miscanthus x giganteus by the University of Illinois has revealed that it outperforms traditional biofuel sources, producing more than twice the ethanol per acre than corn or switchgrass, using a quarter of the space. Crop sciences professor and study leader Dr. Stephen Long told CNN that while there probably isn't one magic bullet to fix our climate woes, Miscanthus -- also known as elephant grass -- promises to be one of five or six options that could help the U.S. to reach its target of replacing 30 percent of gasoline use with biofuels by 2030. ""I think it's important in the biofuels debate that we don't throw the baby out with the bath water. The idea we use the sun's energy to grow plants and then make fuels from those plants is essentially a good one,"" Dr. Long said. ""It's been tainted by the fact that the easy way to do it is to just use food crops, but society needs to realize there are big opportunities beyond food crops and beyond the use of crop land."" Miscanthus, for instance, is able to grow on land too marginal for crop production, so it doesn't have to compete with land for food crops. It also doesn't require major input or fertilization after planting and once established will yield for around 15 years. Yet even with the success of these trials in the U.S. and the earlier European ones, it could be years before the full potential of Miscanthus is realized. This is due in part to the fact that it's much more complex to make cellulosic ethanol -- ethanol made from non-food plants -- than it is to turn simple food starches found in corn or wheat into ethanol. In the United Kingdom, Miscanthus is recognized by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as an energy crop and it's currently being used to co-fire the Drax power station in England's Yorkshire. Even still, Dr. Geraint Evans from the UK's National Non-Food Crops Centre said rather than plants like Miscanthus, wheat grain will be used to meet the UK target of replacing five percent of fuel with renewable sources by 2010. ""Miscanthus has the potential to be more efficient, producing between 4,000 and 7,000 liters of fuel per hectare, whereas ethanol made from wheat grain makes about 1900 liters per hectare."" ""Wheat grain-derived ethanol is what we can do today with the technology we have available today. The technology to use Miscanthus is not yet commercially available,"" Dr. Evans told CNN. In addition to the technical hitch, Dr. Evans said a further downside is that even though Miscanthus is a low maintenance crop, it can be costly to plant compared to wheat or rapeseed canola and the first yield wouldn't occur for at least three years. In an effort to overcome some of the challenges, Dr. Long now intends to turn his attention to experimenting with the wild Miscanthus used in the U.S. trial. And if the sort of improvements made to corn in the last 50 years are any indication, Miscanthus could be well be used to fuel the future in a matter of years. Is Miscanthus the next big thing in biofuels? Sound off below.","A U.S. study has revealed a giant grass outperforms other biofuel sources .

"(WIRED) -- Got a few grand to spare for a $3,000 phone? Yeah, we didn't think so. Nobody does -- and that's a problem for the makers of luxury phones, such as Motorola, Bang & Olufson, LG and Vertu. Vertu makes phones starting at $6,000 and going up in price. After years of chasing the ultra-wealthy with exclusive devices that carry designer logos and promise craftsmanship from materials such as sapphire and stainless steel, luxury phone makers are now pulling back. ""The culture has shifted away from conspicuous consumption, so if you are going to have a super expensive product this may not be the time for it,"" says Avi Greengart, research director for consumer devices at Current Analysis. Motorola has already gotten the memo. Earlier this week, the company reportedly canceled the Ivory E18, a device tentatively priced around $3,000. The phone had met with lack of interest from telecom carriers. Motorola declined to comment. If that sounds like an obvious outcome, perhaps it shouldn't. In the last few years, luxury phones had turned into an attractive new business, as designer houses rushed to get a foothold in the tech sector. Prada collaborated with LG to launch two LG Prada phones in Europe and Asia. Last September, Samsung launched the M75500 Night Effect phone, which carried the Emporio Armani insignia. A month later, Motorola offered a $2,000 phone, called the Aura, which was fashioned out of stainless steel and sported a 62-carat sapphire crystal lens. And then there's Vertu, a company that makes true luxury phones, the cheapest of which costs about $6,000. The recession put a spoke in those plans. And it's not just the 401Ks of middle-class Americans that have been in peril. In Russia, many newly-minted billionaires saw their fortunes slip away with falling oil prices. By the first quarter this year, the U.S. economy had shrunk 5.5 percent. Even 50 Cent has complained about losing more than a few Benjamins on the stock market. And just like that, the crystal dominoes started to fall. Last October, Bang & Olufsen, whose phones retailed in Europe for more than $1,500, shuttered its cellphone business as it decided to trim its costs and get out of non-profitable ventures. Motorola is the latest to pull back its luxury line. Luxury phones have never been a big phenomenon in North America, says Greengart. Their manufacturers have had better luck in emerging markets. But now even in those countries, where once 8 percent GDP growth seemed conservative, wealthy consumers are feeling the pinch. ""Super expensive, bling bling phones are big in markets where conspicuous consumption is a way to tell your countrymen you have arrived,"" says Greengart. ""But now, it's a very different economy for everyone."" Many of the troubles that the uber-expensive phones face are because they are created by companies whose main expertise is in targeting a mass market, says Frank Nuovo, former chief of design for Nokia and current head of Vertu. ""I didn't start this business to soak the phones in diamonds and jewels,"" says Nuovo. ""The concept is same as a fine watch or a fabulous car. To be a true luxury product, you have to look at making something that doesn't have an 18-month shelf life."" True luxury, as Nuovo defines it, doesn't apply to a mere $2,000 phone: A Vertu device, soaked in platinum, can run up to $70,000. The company's one-off phones, designed in collaboration with luxury jewels house Boucheron, cost even more. Nuovo may have inadvertently hit on the real problem with luxury phones: Phones are still a very feature-driven products. They are products where the rapid advances in technology can rend older models obsolete very quickly. ""Phones aren't like a handbag where the fundamental utility remains the same and the design changes all the time,"" says Greengart. But Nuovo isn't convinced. ""Take watches and cars,"" he says. ""They all run the same but everyone has a unique way of delivering them stylistically. We can do the same with phones."" Despite the bumps on the road now, Nuovo says the luxury phones will bounce back and find an audience. ""It is no different than a fine watch or a car,"" he says. ""If you take people who value something that is made extraordinarily well there will always be a group interested in it."" Vertu is determined to prove that. It will launch its latest handset the Carbon Fibre Ascent Ti in August. The phone is made of high-gloss carbon fiber and has a sandblasted titanium surface. The price tag? $9,800.

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- A 100-inch, high definition screen projects an intense college basketball game. Massage therapists rub the nervous tensions of men and women away. Scissors skillfully cut men's hair. Two chandeliers adorn the main room, complimented by brick walls and a glass bar that doubles as a retail counter. Sean Heywood, right, and Kumi Walker own MR., a barbershop and wine bar in San Francisco, California. This is not your typical barbershop. And that has always been the vision of owners Kumi Walker and Sean Heywood. ""We are literally trying to create a new version of the country club golf experience. But we're replacing golf with haircuts, and we're putting it in urban environments,"" says Heywood. MR. (for mister) is their first business venture. It's an upscale barbershop, wine bar and lounge in the financial district of San Francisco where memberships cost $65 to $250 a month. In addition to the basic services, those who become members benefit from exclusive services like golf putting clinics and human resource workshops. ""We're trying to thrive, not just survive,"" Heywood said. MR. takes the cultural aspect of the black barbershop experience and modernizes it, making it a place where businesspeople of all races can network. ""We looked at our social lives, and we had black friends, Asian friends, Latino friends, white friends. We would do a lot of things socially together, but when it came to getting our hair cut, we would all split up,"" Walker says.  Watch Walker talk about the difficulty of starting and running a business Â» . The two entrepreneurs are bridging a cultural divide, and also giving back to the community. They offer free lifetime memberships to MR. to those in good standing with a re-entry program called Back on Track. Among other things, Back on Track offers first-time, low-level criminal offenders GED preparation, tutoring, money-management instruction and job training and placement. And that's where MR. steps in. The membership provides them with one free haircut, trim, and shoeshine monthly. ""We'll take care of their grooming so that they don't have to. And they're ready for all the different jobs that they pursue going forward,"" Walker says. Giving back is paramount for the entrepreneurs. And the story of one black business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, inspires them. It was known as Black Wall Street, and it was destroyed in a race riot and fire 88 years ago. ""All of the businesses that we wanted to create, we wanted to encompass the culture of, if that community still existed today, what it would look like,"" says Walker, who says he read about the riot six years ago. Imagine a credit union, a barbershop, a library, and men in freshly pressed suits with top hats sauntering on sidewalks. The melodic sounds of jazz flow into the streets from several nightclubs. A thriving community of black-owned businesses serve their clientele across a 42-block area. That was the community that existed in the segregated neighborhood of Greenwood from 1830 to 1921. But on the evening of May 31, 1921, white mobs entered Greenwood with torches and guns. Black residents gathered to protect a young man accused of assaulting a white woman. When the smoke from fires cleared on June 1, more than 1,000 homes, businesses and other institutions were burned or destroyed, according to the report of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921. ""People came and said, 'Run, they are shooting people,' "" says Wess Young, who was 4 then. ""We evacuated. They were destroying everything."" The death toll has been debated for years, because many victims were dumped in mass graves. An American Red Cross estimate puts the total at 300, much higher than the 36 reported by local officials. The riot devastated the social underpinnings of the Greenwood community and leveled a black economic force. Greenwood was rebuilt, but it never recovered. ""It was a really tragic end to thriving businesses. I think we'd be a lot further ahead had that area been able to continue to thrive,"" says Walker. Wess Young and his family rebuilt their lives in Tulsa. When asked what he thought America would be like if the Tulsa race riot had not happened, he answers without hesitation, ""We would have had a black president before now. ... He has done a good job, but we [blacks are] still in a box."" His advice to people is to let go of the past once they've learned from it. ""Hate will destroy your whole universe -- got to learn how to forgive, but never forget,"" Young says. Walker says these stories of black struggle and survival motivate him. ""I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors,"" he says. ""I just want to be as successful as possible so I can turn around and be mentors and sponsors to other people who come after me.""","Entrepreneur read about famed Black Wall Street that was destroyed in 1921 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British airlines have put into effect measures to stop people with swine flu boarding flights in a bid to prevent the virus from spreading further. Medical screening for the swine flu virus has been introduced at many airports. British Airways said there had been a ""very small number of cases"" where people who had checked in with symptoms of H1N1 had been advised not to travel after having medical checks. Virgin Atlantic also said victims would not be allowed to board one of its planes without a fit-to-fly certificate from their doctor or a hospital, though there had been no cases yet. The World Health Organization declared the virus a global pandemic June 11. More than 120 countries have reported cases of human infection. About 98,000 cases have been documented worldwide, with 440 deaths, according to the WHO.  Watch as airlines ban sufferers Â» . With 29 deaths and a huge rise in the number of cases, Britain has the worst swine flu figures in Europe. Eight British schoolchildren remained in hospital in China on Monday after contracting swine flu on a trip to the country, the Foreign Office said. The teenagers were diagnosed with the H1N1 virus in Beijing. More than 50 of their classmates and teachers are also quarantined in a hotel.  Watch as students are quarantined Â» . Medical screening for the swine flu virus has been introduced at many airports around the world for passengers arriving on international flights but there are concerns that many people may not be aware they are infected. Those who do have symptoms have been advised by Britain's health authorities to delay their journeys until the signs have cleared up. ""We have a medical team within the airline as well as a contingency planning group which has met for the past few years to look at the issue of a flu pandemic,"" A British Airways spokeswoman said. ""We have a wide range of contingency plans in place which we can use depending on how the situation may evolve. ""If we have concerns about a customer or the customer is concerned, then we have a 24-hour medical service we can call to give advice to staff. ""They will speak to the customer and an assessment will be made about their fitness to fly. ""There have been a number of cases where we have advised customers not to fly on the basis of their diagnosis or symptoms of H1N1.""  Watch as a CNN reporter is quarantined Â» . BA told CNN Monday though that it was ""business as usual"" and all flights were operating normally. Virgin Atlantic spokesman Paul Charles said: ""If there are signs of something being wrong, be it excessive sneezing or coughing, not looking well, high temperature, then the airport staff can call in a medical team for extra advice. ""If the medical team believe there are reasons not to fly, the passenger will be asked to produce a fit to fly certificate from their doctor or a hospital, and they will be put at our cost on to the next available flight."" Swine flu has spread so rapidly and extensively around the globe that the World Health Organization is changing tactics against the H1N1 virus, including stopping a tally of cases and focusing on unusual patterns. ""At this point, further spread of the pandemic, within affected countries and to new countries, is considered inevitable,"" the WHO said. The counting of all cases is no longer essential because it is exhausting countries' resources, the organization said. ""In some countries, this strategy is absorbing most national laboratory and response capacity, leaving little capacity for the monitoring and investigation of severe cases, and other exceptional events."" Monitoring is still required, the organization urged, but should focus on exceptional patterns. ""Because the numbers of cases have increased in so many countries, it is very hard to keep up,"" Keiji Fukuda, WHO assistant director-general, said earlier this month. Laboratories have been inundated with testing requests and the virus is showing up in most lab tests in countries with major outbreaks, he said. The organization said it will not issue global tables showing confirmed cases for countries that have reported cases, according to the release. However, it will still report on nations that have not had cases so that its presence can be confirmed. ""WHO will continue to request that these countries report the first confirmed cases and, as far as feasible, provide weekly aggregated case numbers and descriptive epidemiology of the early cases."" Meanwhile, governments should should be on the lookout for unusual patterns, the organization said. While most patients have reported mild symptoms, a rise in severe symptoms or respiratory ailments that require hospitalization should be cause for concern, it said. Governments should also pay attention to unusual patterns linked to fatal cases, the WHO said. Any changes in prevailing patterns should be flagged, including a rise in school and job absenteeism, and an increase in visits to the emergency room. An overwhelmed health system may mean there is a rise in severe cases, the organization said.","British airlines stop people with swine flu boarding flights .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- In the midst of the ongoing culture wars, can it be a good idea to put out a comedy about two Stone Age men who wander into the Bible? In ""Year One,"" Jack Black stars as an inquisitive Stone Age man, with Michael Cera as his sidekick. Harold Ramis thinks so. ""Year One,"" which he directed, concerns two men -- played by Jack Black and Michael Cera -- who leave their home and, in their travels, meet biblical characters such as Cain, Abel, Abraham and Isaac. Among the locales: ancient Sodom, which ""didn't seem worse than Las Vegas to me,"" Ramis told CNN. ""Year One"" comes out Friday. Ramis, whose writing and directing credits include ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Analyze This,"" said it was time for a new biblical epic -- of sorts. ""No one had done this film for our generation,"" he told CNN. It's like, you know, when 'Animal House' [which Ramis co-wrote] came out, there were college films. Every generation had college films, but our generation didn't have one yet, and I don't know that our generation - this young, new generation of kids has a, you know, a sandal epic yet, and this is the one. This is for them."" Ramis rounded up a cast of comedians familiar to any watcher of Judd Apatow-produced movies -- no surprise, since Apatow is a producer of ""Year One."" Christopher Mintz-Plasse (""Superbad""), Horatio Sanz (""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Step Brothers"") and Bill Hader (""Tropic Thunder"") all have parts. ""A lot of them were new to me,"" said Ramis. ""[But] Jack knew them, Michael knew them, they were connected -- all connected through Judd Apatow, through 'Saturday Night Live' ... the comedy world is a club."" Black joked that everyone's a member of a secret society, requiring retinal scans, that meets ""inside the O of the Hollywood sign -- the first O,"" he noted.. ""All the projects are laid out on a table,"" he said. ""And we talk generally about how we're gonna take over the planet, take over the comedy and keep a vise grip on it."" Black said he revels in the chance to find the humor in the Bible. ""That was the fun of this thing,"" he said. ""It's like, we are going to have some fun with the Bible; you don't see it very often. It hasn't really been done since Monty Python days. 'Life of Brian.' "" However, the film could get more than it asked for. Films poking fun at the Bible -- or, indeed, treating the Bible with anything less than reverence -- have been the subject of protests and criticism. ""Life of Brian,"" the Python troupe's 1979 comedy about an assumed messiah that parodied the story of Jesus, was protested by clergy in the U.S. and banned outright in Ireland. French protesters threw Molotov cocktails into a Paris theater showing ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" Martin Scorsese's 1988 film version of Nikos Kazantzakis' novel. More recently, Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ,"" though a huge financial success, was criticized by some observers for alleged anti-Semitism, as well as its violence. Ramis, who observed that a number of biblical films focus on the New Testament, said he deliberately chose to make the Old Testament his subject. ""I told people that I wanted to do for the Old Testament what Monty Python did for the Gospels,"" he said. ""Which is just to kind of take a funny look and project a contemporary sensibility back to these treasured myths of Western civilization. ""It wasn't so much to attack any particular religion,"" he added. ""I figure all religions are good. They all make sense on paper; it's just the exploitation of religion that's been a problem, by ... people using religion to justify war, or to justify government or, you know, 'God made me do it.' "" Ramis said one of his intentions with ""Year One,"" which he co-wrote with ""Office"" writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, was to focus on people, not God. Paraphrasing the liberal clergyman and activist William Sloane Coffin, he said, God's not the event itself, but ""God's in our reaction to the event."" ""I wanted to do a film that kind of addressed these fundamental beliefs and urged people to take personal responsibility, no matter what they believe God is or isn't,"" Ramis said. ""It's still up to us in the final analysis."" Which is not to say that the film skimps on its comedy -- and with Ramis, Black, Cera, Hank Azaria, David Cross and producer Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" ""Superbad"") around, there's no shortage of jokes. ""It's really just a good, dumb, broad comedy,"" Ramis told Entertainment Weekly. Improvisation often played a role, said Cera and Black. ""We weren't locked to anything,"" Cera said. ""It was a very honest set. If something wasn't working then we would address it."" ""We got a lot of different options [from observers], and they were able to play with different options in the editing room. I thought it was a cool way to do it,"" said Black. ""I've never done a movie like that -- and now I wanna do that on all my movies."" iReport.com: Seen ""Year One""? Share your review . The handful of early reviews have been positive, and Ramis is pleased with the result. He's particularly happy the film was received warmly in the Sodom shooting location -- Sibley, located in northwest Louisiana, in the heart of the Bible Belt. ""It's funny, because Southern people living in the heart of the Bible belt, there's a Baptist church every 150 feet in that area, and here we are in Sodom, in the city of Sodom,"" he said. ""And they just got into it, they enjoyed it so much.""","""Year One"" stars Jack Black and Michael Cera as Stone Age men in Bible .

"(CNN)  -- Oguchi Onyewu, who made his AC Milan debut in a 2-1 friendly defeat to Mexico's Club America, is the first player from the United States to be signed by the Serie A giants and is a rising talent in world football. Oguchi Onyewu has cut a commanding figure at the center of defense for the U.S. national team. The ""Rossoneri"" have put their faith in a 27-year-old defender, who has become a lynchpin of his national team in recent times -- but how did the stopper climb the ladder of success? The imposing Onweyu, who stands 1.93 meters tall and tips the scales at 95 kilograms, was born in Washington D.C., one of a family of five to Nigerian-born parents. While at high school in Maryland, he showed immediate promise and was selected for a soccer academy run by International Management Group (IMG). After graduation, Onyewu spent two years in collegiate soccer at Clemson University before taking his chance in Europe. CNN's Patrick Snell interviews Onyewu. Â» . He was originally at Metz in France before being loaned out to La Louviere in the Belgium league and finally to Standard Liege where he has spent the majority of his professional career. Because of his strong performances with Standard, Onyewu was constantly linked with a number of leading European clubs, but finally had his chance when sent out on loan to Newcastle United in the English Premier League. Joining for the back end of the 2006-07 season, he formed an uncertain partnership with Titus Bramble in the center of defense, which, combined with the arrival of new manager Sam Allardyce, was to cost him his place. Newcastle decided not to make his loan move permanent and Onyewu returned to Standard to help them win successive Belgian league titles. He was involved in a controversial incident at the end of the current season during the championship playoff against Anderlecht. Onyewu claimed Anderlecht defender Jelle Van Damme called him a ""dirty ape"" and persisted despite being reported to the referee. The Times of London reported on June 2 that Onyewu had taken legal action in a Brussels court over the alleged slur, hoping it will help eradicate such incidents in the future. His lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont said Onyewu felt compelled to take it further. ""He was convinced it was his duty to lodge the complaint,"" Dupont said. ""It is not a question whether Van Damme is racist. The issue is that these slurs are still used on the pitch, and are being used because they know it hurts."" Onyewu made his debut for the U.S. national team in 2004 and played all three games for the side before their exit from the 2006 World Cup. But it was his performances in the recent Confederations Cup in South Africa which showed his qualities to the full. After the U.S. beat Egypt 3-0 to reach the semifinals, Onyewu was outstanding again in the shock 2-0 defeat of world number one-rated Spain to reach the final. The U.S. went on to lose the final 3-2 to Brazil, but Onyewu had again sparked renewed interest, including Milan, who had tracked him since 2004. He signed a three-year deal earlier this month with the seven-time European champions, who are in a rebuilding process after the retirement of club legend Paulo Maldini and departure of Kaka to Real Madrid. Onyewu is the second U.S. international to play in Serie A.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Carrie Prejean's lawyer gave Miss California USA executive director Keith Lewis what he said was a final warning to retract statements made about the former beauty queen or face a defamation lawsuit. The lawyer for former Miss California USA Carrie Prejean, says the ousted beauty queen's good name is ""tarnished."" Prejean, stripped of the Miss California USA title last week, ""suffered severe emotional distress"" and her reputation was harmed by Lewis, Charles LiMandri said in a letter sent Thursday to Lewis' lawyer. LiMandri's letter also accused Lewis, whom he referred to as a ""gay activist,"" of setting Prejean up to be fired because of her statements opposing same-sex marriage. When Prejean, 22, was dethroned, Lewis said it was for ""contract violations,"" including missed public appearances. He told CNN's Larry King last week that it wasn't one thing Prejean did, but ""many, many, many things."" ""She came to us and said I'm not interested in your input; I'll make my own decision what I'm going to do,"" Lewis said. ""You know, when you have a contract, when you're working for someone, you have a responsibility to follow through on what that requirement is."" Lewis told King it was clear ""she was not interested in upholding the title or the responsibilities."" ""Carrie Prejean's good name has been tarnished by your client's false and defamatory accusations,"" the letter from her lawyer to Lewis' said. ""Please view this letter as a last opportunity for Mr. Lewis to retract the defamatory statements made against my client and to seek to restore her good name,"" LiMandri said. ""If he does not comply, I will have no alternative but to recommend that Ms. Prejean proceed to do so through litigation."" In response to the letter, Lewis issued a statement that said: ""Mr. LiMandri obviously has never watched 'The Apprentice' if he believes that Mr. Trump could be so easily fooled. Facts are facts, and we stand by them."" LiMandri denied any contract violations, saying it was a ""complete and utter pretext"" for her firing. The list Lewis gave to reporters of Prejean's missed appearances was ""an outright fraud,"" he said. Prejean ""did not refuse reasonable appearance requests"" that could ""be expected to promote and further the intended purposes of Miss California USA,"" he said. The beauty queen expected to be asked to attend ""Rotary conventions and avocado festivals,"" not events Lewis suggested, LiMandri said. ""She did not think it was appropriate for her to accept Mr. Lewis' invitation to attend a gay documentary in Hollywood promoting same-sex marriage,"" he said. ""It was not my client's job, as Miss California, simply to help your client promote his personal or business interests as a Hollywood agent and producer, or gay activist."" He accused Lewis of trying to make commissions off Prejean's appearances. ""Your client was trying to wrongfully profit off of my client's participation as Miss California, in violation of her contract, by taking 20 percent of any appearance fee she would earn, such as at the Las Vegas jewelers convention she attended at his request,"" LiMandri's letter said. LiMandri cited a statement he said Lewis made during a May 15 conference call that ""clearly shows that your client was trying to 'set-up' our client for termination"" by relaying an offer to appear semi-nude in Playboy. Three people who worked for a public relations agency representing Prejean at the time heard it, he said. ""All three of those people distinctly remember Keith Lewis talking about sending Ms. Prejean an offer to do a Playboy photo shoot 'so when they take her title away, she doesn't sue me,' "" he said. LiMandri said Lewis -- and former co-executive director Shanna Moakler -- were ""bound and determined to get her fired, and they have now finally gotten their way."" Miss USA pageant owner Donald Trump announced last month that Prejean could keep her title despite a controversy over topless photos, missed appearances and her statements against same-sex marriage. Trump reversed himself last week. ""I told Carrie she needed to get back to work and honor her contract with the Miss California USA organization, and I gave her the opportunity to do so,"" Trump said. ""Unfortunately, it just doesn't look like it is going to happen, and I offered Keith my full support in making this decision.""","NEW: Pagaent director responds, ""Facts are facts, and we stand by them""

These bacteria-infested attractions have topped an unusual list compiled by editors at TripAdvisor.com, a travel advice Web site. This summer, editors at the site named the five ""germiest"" tourist spots in the world. Despite the H1N1 scare that went global this spring, tourists haven't stopped spitting out their gum and sticking it onto a wall already saturated with millions of gooey pieces, editors say. Nor do germ fears stop travelers from journeying to the pigeon-infested St. Mark's Square in Venice, Italy, where the birds often bestow droppings. ""These places are great attractions regardless of the fact that they are 'germy',"" said Brooke Ferencsik, a travel expert at TripAdvisor. ""Venice is lovely, and it's a great spot, but with all the pigeons, I'd bring an umbrella just in case the birds drop some gifts from above."" Though it is unlikely to get sick from visiting one of these places, health experts say germs are always a gamble. The more people who touch and visit a spot, the more germs there are in the mix, they say. Their traveling advice? Travelers should load up on hand sanitizers and wash their hands often on their trips. Blarney Stone in Blarney, Ireland . Where the Blarney Stone came from and how it got to Ireland is a matter of debate. One old tale goes: Once upon a time, the king of Ireland saved a woman drowning in Blarney Lake. The woman told the king that if he kissed the stone, he would receive the gift of eloquence. Thus, the tradition of kissing the Blarney stone was born.  Watch where you can find germ hotspots Â» . Last year, about 400,000 people kissed the stone, says a spokesman for Blarney Castle & Gardens. To do so, the person must be hung upside down to kiss the rock. Some people prefer watching to smooching. Chuck Gerba, a professor of microbiology at the University of Arizona, visited the Blarney Stone in Ireland last year and refused to kiss the same spot where millions of tourists had put their lips. ""My wife did it,"" he added. ""And I wiped her lips before I kissed her."" Market Theater Gum Wall in Seattle, Washington . There is a distinct fruity aroma that welcomes visitors when they pass the giant wall of gum housing millions of chewed pieces in Seattle. The gum -- pink, blue, yellow and green -- is piled several inches thick, spanning an area 15 feet high and 50 feet wide.  Watch the wall of gum Â» . The Gum Wall, also dubbed the Wall of Gum, is one of the strangest attractions in Pike Place Market, where visitors can go to watch fish throwers and see the original Starbucks. ""People will do artwork with the gum,"" said Jay Hitt, the marketing director of the Market Theater. ""They write words on the wall, stick posters and business cards."" The gum-sticking tradition began by accident in 1993 when patrons, mostly college students waiting in line for a show, would stick gum to the wall. Theater company workers say they scraped the gum routinely, but eventually gave up. Slowly the gum amassed. Today, there aren't any rules at the Gum Wall. Visitors from all over the world snap photos next to it and leave as many pieces of their own gum as they want. St. Mark's Square in Venice, Italy . In the heart of Venice, Italy, lies St. Mark's Square, also known as Piazza San Marco, where both tourists and pigeons flock. Each year, more than 2 million visitors venture to St. Mark's Square to see the Doge's Palace and St. Mark's Basilica. Thousands of the dirty birds crowd the square sometimes leaving their droppings or attacking visitors. Some fearless visitors who aren't worried about germs snap pictures with the birds. But health experts warn that birds are notorious for carrying dangerous germs and viruses. If you want to see the famous pigeons, go soon. In 2007, city officials have worked hard to remove the pigeons from the square. They have banned people from feeding them and have even started trapping the birds in nets, significantly reducing the pigeon population. Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California . What do George Clooney, Clint Eastwood and Marilyn Monroe have in common? All three of them are celebrated stars with their hand prints molded into the concrete of the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theatre for millions of people to touch. The sidewalk is littered with 246 celebrity hand and footprints that draw in 4.5 million visitors a year, many of whom put their own hands and feet on them. The site began as an accident in 1927 when Norma Talmadge, a famous actress in the 1920s, stepped into wet cement. Creator and owner of the theater, Sid Grauman, decided to make the hand and footprints a tradition. ""The stars are selected based on the longevity of their career,"" said Levi Tinker, a tour guide at the Grauman Theatre. ""Stars who will be around 10 to 20 years from now are picked so people know who they are."" For germ-conscious travelers, Tinker says the concrete is mopped daily and pressure washed once a week. Oscar Wilde's Tomb in Paris, France . It's an unusual site in the PÃ¨re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Author and playwright Oscar Wilde's body rests in a tomb speckled with lipstick marks from visitors from all over the world showing their literary appreciation. Wilde, who died in 1900 from cerebral meningitis, continues to be a celebrated literary figure today famous for his tabooed sexuality at the time and his novels such as ""The Picture of Dorian Gray."" The kisses display a rainbow of colors -- so much so that travel experts say Oscar Wilde's name on the tomb can be hard to discern sometimes. One TripAdvisor traveler wrote after visiting the grave, ""The tombstone of Oscar Wilde is ... well, wild, excuse the pun.""","More than 400,000 visitors kissed the Blarney Stone in Ireland in 2008 .

"(CNN)  -- England international footballer Steven Gerrard was found not guilty of affray by a court in his home city on Friday. England international Steven Gerrard was cleared by a court in Liverpool of affray. The jury at Liverpool Crown Court took a little over an hour to clear Gerrard of charges relating to a fracas in a nightclub bar in the north-western of England city on December 29 of last year. They accepted the Liverpool captain's version that he acted in self defense in punching businessman Marcus McGhee. The 29-year-old was the only one of the seven defendants in the case to be cleared after an incident which was described by judge Henry Globe as an ""explosion of violence."" Gerrard spoke of his relief outside the court. ""Can I just say how pleased I am with today's verdict,"" he said. ""I'm glad to put this case behind me and I am really looking forward to the season ahead and concentrating on my football now. ""I would just like to say a big thank you to my legal team and to my friends and family and everyone at Liverpool football club for supporting me."" His comments were met with a round of applause from a large group of fans of the Premier League club who had gathered outside the court, before he was ushered away. Gerrard was celebrating in the Lounge Inn in Southport, a suburb of Liverpool, after scoring twice his team's 5-1 win at Newcastle which took them to the top of the Premier League. Video footage, which was available to the court, showed the moment around 2.am in the morning when trouble flared. Gerrard apparently wanted to change the music on the CD player and the 34-year-old McGee said the football star had acted aggressively in trying to grab the device. In the fracas which followed, Gerrard admitted throwing three punches but said only one connected. He claimed, and his version was accepted by the jury, that he believed he was about to be attacked himself. ""You did not start the violence, it was started by the violent elbowing of Marcus McGee in the face by one of your friends, John Doran,"" Globe said. ""The victim's consequential actions of reeling backwards and then forwards and your actions in response to that movement forward has to be seen against that background,"" he added. Five other men have already pleaded guilty to affray and another admitted a lesser charge of threatening behavior. They will be sentenced at a later date.","England football star Steven Gerrard cleared of affray charge by Liverpool court .

"(CNN) -- A California man convicted of the 2006 arson murders of five U.S. Forest Service firefighters was sentenced to death Friday. Raymond Lee Oyler was sentenced Friday to die for the arson murders of five firefighters. Raymond Lee Oyler, 38, of Beaumont was convicted in March of five counts of first-degree murder. The convictions included two special circumstances: that the murders were committed during an arson and that multiple murders were committed. Oyler also was convicted of 11 counts of arson and 10 counts of use of an incendiary device in those arsons. The imposition of the death penalty by a judge was a formality. A jury earlier recommended capital punishment for Oyler.  Watch as Oyler's sentence is read Â» . Firefighters Mark Loutzenhiser, 44; Jess McLean, 27; Jason McKay, 27; and Daniel Hoover-Najera, 20, died October 26, 2006, during the Esperanza fire outside Los Angeles. Fueled by Santa Ana winds, the wildfire enveloped their engine. The fifth firefighter, Pablo Cerda, 23, died October 31, 2006, at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, where he had been taken after suffering burns over 90 percent of his body. Days before being charged in Esperanza fire, Oyler had been arrested and charged with two counts of arson in a June 2006 fire in the Banning Pass area. The 41,173-acre Esperanza fire destroyed 34 homes and 20 outbuildings, mainly in the Twin Pines and Poppet Flats areas, which had been under mandatory evacuations. The firefighters died trying to protect a partially built house in Twin Pines, a rural mountain community.

"(CNN) -- World champion Lewis Hamilton has been disqualified from last weekend's Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne after presenting ""misleading"" evidence to stewards. Hamilton has been disqualified from the Australian GP after presenting ""misleading"" evidence to stewards. The McLaren driver and Toyota's Jarno Trulli were called to an FIA hearing in Malaysia -- the site of this weekend's grand prix -- on Thursday to discuss an incident during Sunday's race. Trulli finished third at Melbourne's Albert Park, only to later be handed a 25-second penalty by race stewards which relegated him to 12th position and saw Hamilton lifted into third. However, following Thursday's hearing, Trulli has been reinstated in third position. McLaren had complained that veteran Italian Trulli had illegally passed Hamilton under yellow flags following an accident late on involving Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel and Robert Kubica in his BMW Sauber -- who were running second and third at the time. Trulli had decided not to appeal the original decision but the FIA, the sport's governing body, said it had received new information and pressed ahead with a second hearing. ""The stewards, having considered the new elements presented to them from the 2009 Australian Grand Prix, consider that Lewis Hamilton, and the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team, acted in a manner prejudicial to the conduct of the event by providing evidence deliberately misleading to the stewards at the hearing on Sunday 29th March 2009,"" the FIA said in a statement. It said Hamilton and McLaren had violated its rules and retrospectively disqualified him from the race. Meanwhile, Trulli believes justice has been served after Thursday's decision. ""I am happy because I wanted some justice and I got it,"" he told PA Sport. ""I am happy for myself and the team and I have to thank the FIA because it does not happen very often they reconsider something. ""It must have been really hard for them, but they had common sense to really try and understand what was going on. I have always been honest and it has paid off.""","World champion Lewis Hamilton has been disqualified from the Australian GP .

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Samuel Fahrer and Sidney Lipson shake hands and smile. It's the first time the men have seen each other in 64 years. They were U.S. soldiers back on a forced death march in Nazi Germany in April 1945. Sidney Lispson, left, and Samuel Fahrer meet for the first time in 64 years. They were in a Nazi slave labor camp. ""How you doing?"" Fahrer says. It's a subdued moment for the two men. There are no tears, no pats on the back. The men have endured years of contained emotions from what happened six decades ago when they were prisoners of war and held as slaves inside Germany. They have come to a hotel in Orlando to be honored by the Army this weekend for the first time.  Watch slave camp survivors reunite Â» . Fahrer and Lipson were among 350 soldiers held at the slave labor camp called Berga an der Elster, a largely forgotten legacy of the war and a subcamp of Buchenwald where soldiers were beaten, starved and forced to work in tunnels to hide German equipment. More than 100 soldiers died at the camp and on the death march. Buchenwald was one of the largest and first concentration camps on German soil.  See photos inside Berga Â» . The Berga soldiers are being honored thanks in part to CNN.com users, who demanded the Army recognize the men, all in their 80s, after a series of reports late last year. The Army then conducted a months-long review of Berga at the urgings of Rep. Joe Baca, D-California, and Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Alabama. ""These soldiers endured extreme hardships of forced labor, beatings, poor living conditions, and ultimately a forced march of over 250 kilometers [about 155 miles] prior to liberation by advancing U.S. Armed Forces,"" Army Secretary Peter Geren said at the conclusion of the review. ""The survivors of Berga certainly deserve both our thanks and recognition for their service and sacrifice."" Geren is sending Maj. Gen. Vincent Boles to honor the survivors on Saturday. Six of the 22 Berga survivors will be at the event; most of those still living could not make it because of declining health. Those here look forward to what the general has to say. They want desperately to know why the U.S. government commuted the death sentences of the two Berga commanders, Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz. Both were tried for war crimes and initially sentenced to die by hanging until their commutations in 1948. ""I'm very happy the Army is sending a general to see us,"" Fahrer says. ""But they should've sent the general to see us a long time ago when some of the fellas were still alive. We're only 20 fellas left."" Fahrer was one of the primary survivors after the war who fought to get the government to carry out the death sentences for Metz and Merz. In a letter to survivors in January 1949, he wrote, ""Things are beginning to break our way. A little enthusiasm, a little more cooperation, a little more action, will accomplish a great, great deal now."" Now, 60 years later, he may finally get some answers. ""Let's see what the general has to say when he gets here,"" Fahrer says. His comrade, Morton Brooks, says, ""I never wanted revenge, but I did think retribution would be proper. And I think they should've suffered a little bit longer for what they did. ... They wouldn't kick a dog, but they did that to us.""  Watch Morton Brooks describe the Germans' ""work to death"" program Â» . The two men finally hugged. ""I'm glad to see you,"" Fahrer says. Some of the Berga soldiers were killed in cold blood, such as Morton Goldstein, shot through the head and then machine-gunned. His bullet-riddled body was placed in front of the barracks for all to see. Bernard Vogel and Izzy Cohen were forced to stand without food and water for days, pushed to their deaths. Cohen was a 32-year-old father of two young children. When he left for war, he kissed his family goodbye at a train station in California. He looked at his wife, Florence, and said, ""Whatever happens happens."" It was the last words he ever spoke to her. Vogel's last words at Berga were: ""I want to die! I want to die!""  Hear Martin Vogel finally learn about his brother's final minutes Â» . ""They killed us slowly,"" Fahrer says. ""They didn't feed us, they didn't give us anything, they didn't do anything."" The memories are so terrible, so horrific that Sid Lipson doesn't remember much of anything about his captivity. ""I don't remember a damn thing from the march,"" he says. Brooks says, ""I think it's best."" Brooks weighed 75 pounds when he was finally freed; Fahrer weighed 90. ""The United States government did not acknowledge the fact that we were put in this slave labor camp,"" Fahrer says, shaking his head. ""We went through all these things and nobody wants to give us any help. And finally, now ..."" Brooks went on to become a psychologist. He says his time in captivity was a ""$1 million experience that I wouldn't want to repeat for $2 million."" His message to the world about the whole ordeal: . ""We have to learn to talk to one another and live together. It's not necessary to go kill people for no reason."" One of the survivors who won't be at this weekend's ceremony is Tony Acevedo, the U.S. medic who kept a diary inside Berga cataloguing the deaths and atrocities. It was Acevedo who CNN profiled in November, prompting a series of events culminating with the Pentagon deciding to honor the soldiers.  See Acevedo's diary Â» . Acevedo's wife, Loline, is too ill. He doesn't want to leave her side. ""The love of my life,"" he says.","Samuel Fahrer, Sidney Lipson reunite six decades after surviving Nazi camp .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Tyler Perry is known today as the first African-American to own a major film and TV studio. He's a pioneer whose own life story is a rags-to-riches tale that reads like a screenplay. Tyler Perry is the first African-American to own a major film and TV studio. Now a writer, actor, director and producer -- Perry's success grew out of a troubled home in a poor neighborhood in New Orleans, Louisiana. Strong on faith, Perry named his first play ""I Know I've Been Changed,"" after an old Negro spiritual. It was a gospel musical about two adult survivors of child abuse. In 1991, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he worked as a bill collector and eventually scraped together enough money to rent a small theatre and stage the play. With only 30 people in the audience, the play was a flop. For the next several years, he struggled and was often broke and sometimes lived in his car. But Perry refused to give up. He finally got a second chance in 1998, when a promoter booked the show in the Tabernacle, a former church turned concert hall in downtown Atlanta. It was a sold out hit and the little boy from inner-city New Orleans was well on his way. Perry then took his plays on the road and traveled the so-called ""chitlin' circuit"" to theaters in Memphis, Tennessee, Detroit, Michigan, and Baltimore, Maryland -- where black entertainers historically performed for predominantly black audiences. He began making a name for himself with African-Americans. In 2004, he started looking for backers for his first movie project ""Diary of Mad Black Woman,"" a story about a devoted wife in a bad marriage. He said he faced a wall of ignorance when he pitched white executives in Hollywood. One told him the project was doomed to fail at the box office because the core audience for Perry's stage plays -- black churchgoers -- wouldn't go to the movies. Another said the dialogue for his characters was unrealistic.   Though he was largely unknown to white audiences, Perry refused to play by Hollywood's rules and demanded creative control of his projects.  Tour of Tyler Perry's back lot Â» . He was resigned to bankrolling the project himself and selling it as a DVD when he got a call from the independent studio Lionsgate. They struck a deal and he made ""Diary"" for about $5 million. The movie earned 10 times that at the box office. Since then, Perry's movies have grossed nearly $400 million and he's developed a loyal following. He now demands not only creative control but also ownership of the finished product. Still, it's just the beginning, he said. ""I don't necessarily feel like I've arrived."" Even so, Perry has a prolific output of stories, including his movies ""Why Did I Get Married,"" ""Meet the Browns,"" ""The Family that Preys,"" and ""Madea's Family Reunion."" He signed a $200 million deal with TBS (owned by Time Warner, the same company that owns CNN) for 100 episodes of ""House of Payne,"" one of television's most popular shows among black adults. The sitcom is now in syndication, making even more money for Perry. Perry said ownership of the finished product is key to building wealth, a principle he hopes other African-Americans will embrace. How are entertainment heavyweights changing black stereotypes?  ""If you want to think about longevity,"" he said, ""if you want to think about your family and generations down the line, then you have to own it."" And own it he does. Tyler Perry Studios, on 30 acres in Atlanta, is his black Hollywood. But he is quick to acknowledge his debt to the legendary black actors from an earlier generation by naming two of his soundstages after Sidney Poitier and Cicely Tyson. He has also helped introduce them to a new generation by casting Tyson, 76, an Oscar-nominated actress, in two of his films.  Tyson opens up about life, career Â» . A study by the NAACP found that African-Americans are ""underrepresented in almost every aspect of the television and film industry,"" but Perry is able to hire on both sides of the camera. On his production crews, black employees are getting unprecedented career opportunities, and black actors are portraying characters beyond the predictable drug dealers and thugs. ""What makes me feel great is to be able to pull up to this place and to be able to have 300 people working and running around, trying to get things done,"" he said. ""That makes me feel great."" His greatest accomplishment, he said, has nothing to do with business. ""It's more personal than that for me,"" he said. ""My biggest success is getting over the things that have tried to destroy and take me out of this life. Those are my biggest successes. It has nothing to do with work."" The NAACP has honored Perry with its Image Award, but there are some who believe his characters don't portray African-Americans positively. ""He's made a lot of money, but the quality of work is sorely lacking,"" said Todd Boyd, a University of Southern California film professor and culture/media critic. Some of Perry's characters rely heavily on exaggerated personalities and slapstick comedy. Boyd is particularly critical of Perry's recurring character, Madea, an over-the-top grandmother who smokes marijuana and brandishes loaded guns she keeps in her purse. Perry himself plays the tough, buxom matriarch, who runs at full throttle fueled by country wisdom and ghetto strength. ""It seems a bit ironic that at the moment of the first African-American president, the most popular African-American figure in the media is a man in drag engaging some of the most stereotypical images of African-Americans ever created,"" Boyd said. Perry said his critics are missing the point. ""They miss the messages of empowerment,"" he said. ""Sure, the silliness of 'Madea,' the silliness of 'Brown,' it's broad, it's over the top. Great. Fine. I get it. But how can you miss the message of forgiveness? How can you miss the messages of empowerment? ""I would love to share with them the letters that I've gotten from people. 'This helped me get through a tough time.' 'I was gonna commit suicide.' 'My husband and I weren't speaking until we saw ""Why Did I Get Married?"" It saved our marriage.' "" For Perry, his work will always be about writing from his experiences, old and new. ""Whatever I'm experiencing in life is what I'll write about,"" he said. ""I'm telling you, just to think this little boy from Louisiana can do it, anybody can do it.""","Tyler Perry is the first African-American to own a major film and TV studio .

"(CNN)  -- World champions South Africa held off a second-half rally from New Zealand to win their Tri-Nations opener 28-19 in Bloemfontein on Saturday. Morne Steyn goes on a run for the Springboks in their Tri Nations win. The All Blacks were trailing 17-3 early in the second half and got within four points before the Springboks sealed victory when Jaque Fourie went over eight minutes from time. All Blacks took the lead through Stephen Donald's early penalty, but South Africa hit back with 17 points without answer. Frans Steyn and Ruan Pienaar kicked penalties before the latter went over for the first try. Pienaar missed the conversion and carrying a slight injury passed the kicking duties back to Steyn who made a penalty to put them 14-3 up. Morne Steyn took over the kicking in the second half and he was successful with his first attempt to make it 17-3. The All Blacks then burst into action as Conrad Smith ran through for a superb try which was converted by Donald who then landed a penalty. Steyne and Donald shared penalties before Piri Weepu's wayward pass was recovered by the Springboks and Fourie went over to punish the error. The conversion was missed to complete a day of wayward kicking by the home side, but after a penalty by Donald, Steyn made no mistake the next time, with his kick three minutes from time finally ending the All Black challenge. South Africa go into the Tri-Nations off the back of a thrilling 2-1 series victory over the British and Irish Lions.","South Africa beat New Zealand 28-19 in Tri-Nations opener in Bloemfontein .

"(CNN)  -- North Korea says it will attack the Japanese military and ""major targets,"" if Japan shoots down a rocket Pyongyang plans to launch in the coming days, North Korea's state-run news service, KCNA, reported Thursday. Japan recently deployed its missile defense system in anticipation of North Korea's planned rocket launch. ""If Japan recklessly 'intercepts' [North Korea's] satellite for peaceful purposes, the [Korean People's Army] will mercilessly deal deadly blows not only at the already deployed intercepting means but at major targets,"" KCNA reported. Japan recently mobilized its missile defense system in response to the planned North Korean launch, Japanese officials said. The move, noteworthy for a country with a pacifist constitution, is aimed at shooting down any debris from the launch that might fall into Japanese territory. U.S. Navy ships capable of shooting down ballistic missiles have also been moved to the Sea of Japan, a Navy spokesman said. The threat of retaliation comes as North Korea has begun fueling its long-range rocket, according to a senior U.S. military official familiar with the latest U.S. intelligence on the matter. The fueling signals that the country could be in the final stages of what North Korea has said will be the launch of a satellite into space as early as this weekend, the senior U.S. military official said Wednesday. Other U.S. military officials said the top portion of the rocket was put on very recently, but satellite imagery shows a shroud over the stage preventing a direct view of what the stage looks like. The officials said the satellite payload appears to have a ""bulbous"" cover, which could indicate there is a satellite loaded on it. Such a cover protects a satellite from damage in flight. While the sources did not know for sure what the payload is, they did say there is no reason to doubt it is a satellite as indicated by North Korea. Pyongyang has said it will conduct the launch sometime between April 4 and April 8. It's a launch that may violate a 2006 United Nations Security Council resolution. Resolution 1718 ""[d]emands"" that North Korea ""not conduct any further nuclear test or launch of a ballistic missile."" ""It raises questions about their compliance with the Security Council Resolution 1718,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last week. ""And if they persist and go forward, we will take it up in appropriate channels."" Pentagon officials worry less about the payload and more about the launch itself, saying any kind of launch will give the North Koreans valuable information about improving their ballistic missile program. ""I don't know anyone at a senior level in the American government who does not believe this technology is intended as a mask for the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Sunday.

"(CNN) -- Summer offers lots of things to do outdoors, which is good for the many television viewers who complain about the quality of programming then. Showtime's ""Nurse Jackie"" is one of the cable series providing a lift for summertime television viewing. It's not that there aren't things to watch. On network television, there are plenty of repeats, reality shows and final episodes of series that have been canceled. But summertime viewing on network television can be a wasteland, especially for bloggers and critics whose gig it is to write and report on TV, said Kath Skerry, founder and editor of the Give Me My Remote blog. ""It's borderline depressing,"" Skerry said. ""Between the onslaught of reality television and what I call filler TV -- shows that the networks may have under contract but they just feel the need to get out regardless of the quality -- it almost feels like [the networks] have given up."" Variety, for many the bible of the entertainment industry,  reported on the first four weeks of summer. It said viewership of ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox was down 9 percent, according to Nielsen. Even more distressing for advertisers, viewership was down 15 percent in the 18-49 demographic and 18 percent in the coveted 18-34 demographic. Skerry isn't surprised. The most quality she said she felt she has gotten out of network television this summer has been ABC burning off the final episodes of the canceled series ""Pushing Daisies,"" ""Eli Stone"" and ""Dirty Sexy Money."" Otherwise, Skerry said, the great shows are happening on the cable networks. Joe Bua blogs at IAmATVJunkie.com and counts among some of his favorite summer shows HBO's ""True Blood,"" ""Torchwood Children of Earth"" on BBC America and Showtime's ""Nurse Jackie."" ""Nurse Jackie"" and other shows such as ""Mad Men"" are luring viewers who want original quality programs. Fans are even showing up in big numbers for cable reality shows such as ""Jon & Kate Plus 8"" (currently on a break), and the ""Real Housewives"" franchise. Bill Gorman, editor of the TV rating and analysis site TvByTheNumbers.com, said the shift to cable has been a long time coming. ""It's the continuation of a trend that's been going on since the early '80s,"" Gorman told AfterElton.com. ""Viewers continue making the 30-year shift from watching broadcast to watching cable."" Jonathan Storm, a TV critic for The Philadelphia Inquirer, said the apparent ceding of summer to cable by broadcast networks is rooted in tradition and the history of how television started. ""The car manufacturers came out with their new models in September, and the TV people said, 'We will give you new shows to advertise your cars on,' "" Storm. ""That was part of it and that started in the 1950s."" Storm said there is also a type of ""circadian rhythm"" to television in that viewers are more inclined to tune in when the days are shorter and colder. Broadcast networks once were able to afford 39 episodes a year, he said. Now economics often dictate a 22-episode season. Storm said networks now trot out cheaper-to-produce reality shows -- something CBS hit the jackpot with several years ago after the runaway success of the summer-debuted ""Survivor."" ""The networks just couldn't afford to make shows all summer long,"" said Storm, who will soon join his colleagues for one of their summer highlights -- The Television Critics Association's summer tour in Pasadena, California. ""Now they've found the answer,"" Storm said. ""They make all of these ridiculous Japanese game shows -- crash yourself into the red balls, 'Wipeout' show -- and several shows that come on and vanish before most TV critics and the general public even know they are there."" Ronnie Karam, senior editor at TVgasm.com, said he has been doing what a lot of viewers do during summertime -- checking out television shows on DVD that he hadn't watched during the fall season. ""I think that putting television shows on DVD has changed the way a lot of people are watching,"" he said. ""During the summer, you feel like you are really scraping the bottom of the barrel."" Karam said it's a chance to check out critically acclaimed shows that viewers either didn't have the time for or the inclination to watch. Broadcast networks really haven't figured out what their strategy should be for summer programming, said Jace Lacob, the writer/editor of Televisionary. ""Years ago, you had Fox launching scripted shows early in the summer and you had shows like 'The O.C.',"" Lacob said. ""You used to have 'American Idol' during the summer as well, which was huge for Fox. But [networks] really haven't gotten a grasp on their summer programming, so they are offering really random shows that nobody is really particularly interested in."" Lacob said some of the offerings have been a mixed bag, such as ""The Listener,"" which didn't exactly catch fire, and ""I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here,"" which he believes wasn't as popular with viewers as NBC had hoped. Blogger Kath Skerry said that even the publicity push around some of the shows such as ""The Listener"" and ""The Philanthropist,"" which broadcast networks have premiered during the summer, has not at all rivaled the fall season. ""The promotion around them, I feel like the lack of enthusiasm with how the networks have communicated with bloggers feels very different,"" she said. ""Whether it's true or not, from my standpoint it feels like the networks are not very enthusiastic about the shows.""","Summer seen as wasteland on broadcast TV for some critics and bloggers .

"KUALA LAMPUR, Malaysia (CNN) -- Malaysia will swear in a new prime minister Friday -- one tasked with reuniting a multi-racial nation and shoring up an economy in dire straits. Outgoing Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, facing, hugs his successor, Najib Razak last week. Until now, Najib Razak had served as the Southeast Asian country's deputy prime minister. He succeeds Abdullah Badawi who turned in his resignation after five years as leader. Both are part of Malaysia's ruling party, the National Front Coalition, which has ruled the country since it gained independence from Britain in 1957. But last year, a loose coalition of opposition parties won 82 of 222 parliamentary seats in elections. It was only the second time in the country's history that the ruling party failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. The election upset led to calls for Abdullah to step down. Various challenges await Najib: . In recent months, the country has seen riots with the country's ethnic Chinese and Indian communities who accuse the government of passing laws that favor the Malay majority. Najib has said he will do more to address their concerns. The country, like other nations around the world, has been severely affected by the global economic downturn. Critics are demanding Malaysia diversify its technology-heavy economy. Last month, Najib unveiled a multi-billion dollar stimulus plan for new spending, according to published reports. Najib also brings with him a whiff of controversy. Two former bodyguards are facing charges in connection the murder of a Mongolian model. He has denied all links to the killing.","Najib Razak to become new prime minister for Malaysia on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Skywatchers are gathering from parking lots in western India to music festivals on remote Japanese islands to witness what NASA describes as an ""exceptionally long"" total solar eclipse that will cross half the planet on Wednesday. People try out ""solar view goggles"" ahead of the eclipse on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India. ""This eclipse has the potential to be observed by more people than any eclipse in all of history,"" said MIT astronomer Richard Binzel, who will be in Shanghai leading an expedition of observers and a group of eclipse chasers.   ""Essentially, every inhabitant of all of India and China will be able to see at least part of the sun covered throughout the day,"" he said. The path of the total eclipse will stretch across the heart of Asia -- from India's Bay of Cambay, over the Himalayas and across China and the southern islands of Japan. The eclipse is expected to reach its peak over India at around 12:40 a.m. GMT Wednesday (8:40 p.m. ET Tuesday). Though the duration of greatest eclipse will occur over the Pacific Ocean at six minutes, 39 seconds, people in some areas of China and Japan will experience up to more than six minutes of darkness, according to predictions by Fred Espenak of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and J. Anderson of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.  Watch as eclipse-watchers head to China Â» . The 15,150-kilometer (9,415-mile) journey of the moon's shadow across the Earth will last nearly three-and-a-half hours and be ""one of the longest eclipses, if not the longest eclipse, in this century,"" Binzel said. Forecasters predict stormy weather for Wednesday morning in Shanghai, but this prognosis has not deterred astronomers and tourists from flooding the city. Send us your photos of the eclipse . Professor Zhao Junliang of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory said the weather could be unpredictable but staying away from such an historic event would be a mistake. ""In 1987, I chased a total solar eclipse in (the western region of) Xinjiang. At the time, the sun was entirely blocked by stormy clouds. Two minutes before the eclipse began, the clouds suddenly cleared,"" Zhao said. ""You just never know, so you have to go."" Read blog on how eclipse-chasers are gambling on weather . Rick Gille and his wife flew in from Atlanta, Georgia, to catch the eclipse in Shanghai. They were heading to what is known as the ""centerline"" -- where the eclipse will last nearly six minutes. They are armed with high resolution digital cameras and telescopes. ""You'll know us when you see us,"" said Gille, who travels the world chasing solar eclipses. ""We're all wearing beige t-shirts which read 'Eclipse 2009.'"" Total eclipses happen about once a year or a little less often somewhere on the Earth's surface and are visible in a narrow band, Benzil said. ""This band starts at sunrise in India and ends at sunset over the Pacific, just east of Hawaii about four hours later. The shadow path of the moon is sweeping across the surface of the Earth at about 3,000 kilometers per hour,"" he said. ""The partial eclipse is also visible throughout Thailand and Vietnam, as far south at the top tip of Australia and as far north as Siberia."" In some cultures, legends and folklore surrounds eclipses. In India, an eclipse is considered inauspicious. Women forbid pregnant daughters-in-law from going outside out of the belief that their children could be born with marks. Some temples won't offer any prayers on the day of an eclipse -- such as the one next to the planetarium in Mumbai, which said it won't even light a stick of incense. In Chinese tradition, there is a story about a heavenly dog eating the sun. As the story goes, people would make noise to scare off the dog and rescue the sun, said Bill Yeung, president of the Hong Kong Astronomical Society. ""In ancient China, we shared the same impression with our Indian friends that a solar eclipse was not a good thing,"" he told CNN. Some of the more unusual ways to see Wednesday's eclipse include a cruise ship that will travel along the centerline off Japan and from aboard a 737-700 chartered plane in India. ""The aircraft will be intercepting the middle of the eclipse shadow at 0626 IST (Indian Standard Time) at a height of 41,000 feet,"" travel company Cox and Kings India Ltd, which is organizing the flight in association with Space technology and education Ltd, said in a statement. ""Eclipse chasers sitting along the Sun Side seats of the aircraft will be able to photograph the eclipse; while the chasers sitting along the Earth Side seats will be able to photograph the Lunar Shadow moving over the Earth cloud top,"" the company said. More conventional viewing parties in Shanghai have been planned along the beach, in a park and in skyscrapers. A music festival has been organized in Japan's Amami island, with more than 6,000 people expected, and Japanese television has shown rows of tents set up on Akusekijima island. The witnesses of the eclipse will range ""from the farmer who only knows legends of eclipses and may not know this is happening at all to the world's experts who have come specifically to the Shanghai region to make the most detailed scientific analysis possible,"" added Binzel, the MIT astronomer. For James and Kathy Scheffler of Kokomo, Indiana, solar eclipses are not to be missed. They have seen six eclipses, including in Aruba, the Black Sea, Madagascar and the Egyptian-Libyan border, and are now making their way to Shanghai. ""When it happens, there is this dissonance that is set up between what your body knows is supposed to be light and what your eyes are seeing -- it's suddenly gotten dark. It's a very, very strange feeling that some people have likened to a religious experience, and you get kind of addicted to that,"" said James Scheffler, a cardiologist. ""It's a very interesting emotional experience as well as the beauty of the event."" Kathy Scheffler added: ""It's an experience that, first of all very few people in the world will see it, and second of all, it's a once in a lifetime -- ever -- experience that you can't ever duplicate because they are all so different."" CNN's John Vause, Nishi Kumar, Yoko Wakatsuki, Stephanie Akiko Haschke and Mallika Kapur contributed to this report.","NASA says it will be ""exceptionally long"" total solar eclipse; will cross half the planet .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- U.S. President-elect Barack Obama announced key members of his energy team on Monday, naming physicist Steven Chu as secretary of energy, and former EPA administrator Carol Browner to a new post in the White House to coordinate energy and climate policy. Carol Browner was one of four key environmental nominees named by Obama. Obama also named Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, to serve as his Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Nancy Sutley, the Los Angeles deputy mayor for energy and environment, to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Sutley, a prominent supporter of Sen. Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, is the first high-ranking gay appointee to the Obama administration. ""In the 21st century, we know that the future of our economy and national security is inextricably linked with one challenge: energy,"" Obama said at a news conference to introduce his energy team. ""We've seen Washington launch policy after policy, yet our dependence on foreign oil has only grown, even as the world's resources are disappearing,"" he said. ""This time has to be different. This time we cannot fail, nor can we be lulled into complacency simply because the price at the pump has for now gone down from $4 a gallon."" Obama called Chu ""uniquely suited to be our next secretary of energy"" for his work on new and cleaner forms of energy. Chu, who runs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, won the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics and is highly respected in energy circles. Browner, who was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration, was named to be the nation's first ""climate czar,"" working inside the White House on policy issues. ""Carol understands that our efforts to create jobs, achieve energy security, and combat climate change demand integration among different agencies, cooperation between federal, state, and local governments and partnership with the private sector,"" Obama said. He said that Jackson, as commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, helped make that state a leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing new sources of energy. ""Lisa also shares my commitment to restoring the EPA's robust role in protecting our air, our water, and abundant natural resources so that our environment is cleaner and our communities are safer,"" Obama said. Sutley has been ""at the cutting edge"" of environmental work on the municipal and regional level, Obama said. She will be ""a key player in helping to make our government more efficient in coordinating our efforts to protect our environment at home and around the globe,"" he added. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa praised the appointment of his deputy mayor to a national post. ""With Nancy on my team, we have made tremendous progress -- from quadrupling our renewable energy portfolio to exceeding the targets set out by the Kyoto Protocol four years ahead of schedule,"" he said in a written statement. Energy is one aspect of the president-elect's goal to create 2.5 million jobs by 2011. The plan aims to put Americans to work updating the country's infrastructure, making public buildings more energy-efficient and implementing environmentally friendly technologies, including alternative energy sources. During his campaign, Obama said he would invest $150 billion over 10 years in clean energy. He proposed increasing fuel economy standards and requiring that 10 percent of electricity in the United States comes from renewable sources by 2012.","Nobel-prize physicist Steven Chu named secretary of energy in Obama's cabinet .

"(CNN) -- He has been at the center of Asia's biggest sex scandal, but now actor Edison Chen has broken his silence on the public episode that has ended careers and caused him to face at least one reported death threat. Internet sex photos of Edison Chen and starlets caused a huge media storm and fall from grace for many. Talking exclusively to CNN on his return to Hong Kong, where he had been forging a career in the movies, Chen reveals his side of the scandal that broke in early last year when hundreds of sexually explicit photos of Chen with other celebrities turned up on the Internet. ""There's been a lot of talk through the past year and a half about this or that and a lot of rumors, a lot of hearsay, and I feel, you know, I've kept quiet just to kind of respect everyone and respect the law,"" Chen told CNN. A Hong Kong computer technician was sentenced to more than eight-and-a-half months in jail for dishonestly obtaining access to the intimate photos when Chen sent his computer in for repairs. But it is still unclear exactly how the images made their way to the web. Watch the full exclusive TV interview with Edison Chen online Â» . The photographs caused shock in Hong Kong and across Asia, with around 1,300 salacious images fueling front page news for tabloids for weeks. There was also a huge public backlash against the 28-year-old who has been one of the rising young stars of Asia cinema. After the scandal broke, Chen, who admitted taking the photos, announced his retirement from Hong Kong's entertainment business and fled to his native Canada. Added to the media attention, Chen says he faced death threats. A bullet was sent to a TV station in Hong Kong earlier this year warning the entertainer to stay out of the limelight. While Chen issued his own apology for any hurt or embarrassment caused soon after the photos surfaced, he maintains he suffered as well. ""I believed I was a victim. I believed that I was hurt by this a lot. I believed that...I knew that I had nothing to do with the spreading of these photos,"" he told CNN in the exclusive interview. ""I can't say I didn't do anything wrong. I've admitted that I was wrong, and I wouldn't say sorry if I wasn't wrong. But I also believe that at the same time that I wasn't the perpetrator, and I had suffered a lot from this as well."" Chen has suffered a spectacular fall from grace and some of the starlets in the photos have endured public disgrace in this culturally conservative region. For some, careers have been left in ruins. Chen says he has not spoken to any of the women identified in the photos since the scandal broke. ""Initially it was because I couldn't find them. Secondly, it was because I didn't really know how to approach and really what to say to be honest with you,"" Chen told CNN. Cecilia Cheung was one of the actresses identified in the photos and in a recent interview, she had strong criticism for Chen. ""I wasn't allowed to talk to her in the initial because of the police request and they were investigating me...I had so much things on my mind,"" said Chen. ""I'm not trying to say that that justifies any wrongdoing that she thinks I've done to her. But I hope that she can understand, and I hope that she can forgive me either today or one day, and she'll understand that I had my difficulties, and I really, really never wished this to happen upon anyone, and I still respect her.""

"MATURA, Trinidad (CNN) -- With its white sand and clear, blue water, Trinidad's Matura Beach looks like a postcard. It's a far cry from its recent past, when leatherback sea turtle carcasses littered the ground and kept tourists away. Suzan Lakhan Baptiste's efforts have turned a beach from a leatherback turtle graveyard to a nesting colony. ""Twenty years ago, this was a graveyard,"" Suzan Lakhan Baptiste said of the six-mile stretch of beach near her home. ""The stench was horrendous. You could smell it for miles,"" she said. Saddened and frustrated, Baptiste launched a crusade to help end the slaughter of the gentle giants. Today, she and her group are succeeding: What was once a turtle graveyard is now a maternity ward -- one of the largest leatherback nesting colonies in the world. It hasn't been an easy fight for Baptiste or the turtles. For 100 million years, the creatures have traveled the world's oceans, outliving the dinosaurs. Over the last 30 years, they have become critically endangered worldwide because of fishing, pollution and hunting. For centuries, they've been hunted throughout the Caribbean for their meat and fins, and also for their eggs, which some people prize as aphrodisiacs. ""Turtles are in serious trouble,"" Baptiste said. Every year, female leatherbacks make their way onto the beach, laying their eggs deep in the sand. It is a long, complicated ritual during which the enormous, slow-moving animals are easy prey for poachers. ""Leatherbacks [are] very vulnerable,"" Baptiste said. ""They cannot pull their head and flippers back into the shell. They have no sense of defense to actually protect themselves."" By the 1980s, nearly one in three turtles that nested on Matura Beach were killed. When the government asked for volunteers to help protect the endangered creatures, Baptiste and several others answered the call. In 1990, they started Nature Seekers, one of Trinidad's first environmental groups. 'Crazy Turtle Woman' For years, Baptiste and her group patrolled the beaches every night of turtle nesting season. She often walked alone until sunrise. Locals mocked her efforts, calling her the ""Turtle Police"" or ""Crazy Turtle Woman,"" yet her dedication to the unpaid work was fierce; when it conflicted with her day job, she quit and found a new job. Leatherbacks were a vital source of income for some members of her village, and the poachers who prowled the beaches with machetes could be threatening. When Baptiste's then-husband was injured during a patrol, she became more determined to stand her ground. ""I was very vigilant,"" she said, adding that at times, she even got into physical fights. But Baptiste persisted, and a prestigious award from the United Nations Environment Program helped validate her efforts. She and her group also worked hard to convince the villagers that using the turtles for eco-tourism could create a more sustainable income. ""I wanted to show that a turtle is [worth] so much more to us alive than dead,"" Baptiste said. Gradually, her message of conservation turned the tide of public opinion, and after nearly two decades under Baptiste's leadership, Nature Seekers has largely won its battle. Today, the leatherbacks' survival rate on Matura Beach is virtually 100 percent. ""Here, turtle slaughter is a thing of the past,"" Baptiste proclaimed. Even ""Papa George,"" a village elder who used to hunt leatherbacks with his father, can attest to the cultural shift. ""Suzan brought around the change,"" he said. ""They don't kill the turtles anymore ... because of the visitors."" Nearly 10,000 tourists a year, most of whom are Trinidadian, now visit Matura Beach, and many locals make a living by providing them with accommodations, food and souvenirs. Since the beach is a prohibited area during the nesting season, Nature Seekers' members act as guides, explaining the turtles' ancient rituals to visitors. In addition, Baptiste and her colleagues gather data on the enormous creatures, tagging and weighing as many leatherbacks as they can.  Watch Baptiste and her group weigh a leatherback turtle at night Â» . During peak season, they might see between 250 or 300 turtles a night. More than 5,000 leatherbacks nest in the area each year. The group's work is often cited as one of the most successful eco-tourism efforts in the Caribbean. Still, turtle slaughter persists throughout the region, and Baptiste is working to help other groups learn from her success, most recently on the island of Dominica. She finds joy in sharing her hard-earned knowledge. ""The passion that I feel, it burns me up,"" she said. ""I have seen the fruits of our labor, and it can happen in every community.""  Watch how Baptiste helped end the slaughter of turtles in her community Â» . Her efforts -- and those of many others around the region -- are making a difference. While leatherbacks are still critically endangered worldwide, the Caribbean population has begun to rebound. ""When I got started, a lot of people thought I was crazy,"" Baptiste said, and she admits that she sometimes wondered if they were right. Reflecting on what she and her team have accomplished, she now believes it was worth it. ""I love being crazy, you know?"" she said, laughing. ""Crazy with a passion, crazy with a dream -- totally environmentally crazy."" Want to get involved?

"(OPRAH.com) -- If there's anything Oprah Winfrey knows for sure, it's what the love of a dog can do for your life. ""There is nothing in the world like puppy love,"" Oprah says. Inmates at the Fishkill Correctional Facility work with the dogs to prepare them to help wounded troops. Still, dogs are more than just companions. They can be the eyes for those who can't see, lead those who can't walk and calm people suffering from conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder. Where do these service dogs get their start? For some, it all begins behind prison walls... At the Fishkill Correctional Facility in upstate New York, more than 1,600 men convicted of abuse, robbery and murder are serving their time. ""I've been incarcerated for robbery in the first degree,"" an inmate named Michael says. ""I really had no regards for other people. It was always me, me, me, me."" Now, a groundbreaking program called Puppies Behind Bars is transforming these offenders. Inmates are given 8-week-old puppies and taught to train them to become service dogs for the disabled, including wounded soldiers. The puppies and prisoners are together 24 hours a day. The puppies sleep in crates in the inmates' cells. In return, the puppies give the prisoners something many of them have never experienced before -- unconditional love. ""I'm going to make my family and those around me proud of me again. Joining this program, it helped me to give myself a sense of pride again. To know that by nurturing and raising these dogs to their fullest potential, that I could give back."" Oprah.com: Amazing animal friendships you have to see . Animal lover and five-time Academy Award nominee Glenn Close first learned about Puppies Behind Bars when she volunteered to help inmates at the women's prison in her town. She was so moved by the impact of the program that she called ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" herself to share this story. ""We know the bond that can be created between humans and animals. And there is common knowledge that it's a healing quality,"" she says. ""The bond that's created between inmates -- who never knew love, never knew responsibility, have only been told that they're worthless -- and the bond that they then train their dogs to establish with these wounded returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan is changing their lives."" Oprah.com: 10 inspiring pets . Roberto is an inmate whose life has been changed by the program. Convicted of second-degree murder, Roberto has been in prison since he was 17. ""I am now 33 years old. I wish I could turn back the hands of time for the hurt and pain that I've caused so many people, especially my victim's family,"" he says. Roberto was chosen for Puppies Behind Bars and immediately bonded with his yellow lab, Frankie. ""From the moment I got her, it was amazing,"" he says. ""There was some beautiful moments in here that I shared with my puppy."" Eventually, Frankie had to move on -- and Roberto had to say goodbye. ""The first night I was without Frankie, I have to say it was a long night,"" he says. ""It was hard for me to realize that the next morning I was going to wake up and not actually feed her that morning."" Since leaving Roberto, Frankie has become a lifeline for Sgt. Allen Hill, who suffers from traumatic brain injury and severe combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder after he was hit by a roadside bomb in Iraq. Frankie helps Sgt. Hill overcome his paralyzing, violent flashbacks by kissing his face. After a few months together, Sgt. Hill and Frankie return to Fishkill to meet Roberto. When Frankie sees Roberto, she takes off running. ""She looks beautiful,"" Roberto says. Sgt. Hill thanks Roberto for all that he's done. ""Frankie has been there for me. She's been my rock when I've needed her to help me out with a flashback or a nightmare. I can do things that for a year and a half I couldn't do,"" Sgt. Hill says. Roberto is moved. ""This is an overwhelming feeling, and to see you is breathtaking,"" he says. ""And to see what Frankie had done in your life."" Oprah.com: Animals that are working hard every day . Now paroled, Roberto is expected to be released from prison this summer, but what he learned from Puppies Behind Bars will stay with him forever. ""Being able to be involved in the puppy program has taught me to be a responsible person,"" he says. ""It has taught me patience."" Sgt. Hill, his wife, Gina, say Frankie has changed their lives. ""The biggest difference that Frankie has made in my life was, one, she allowed me the opportunity to go back to church,"" he says. ""And, two, she's helping me gain my independence back so I'm not so reliant on Gina and other family members."" Gina says she's starting to see her husband's playful, energetic side come through once again. ""We're starting to see that side of him again that we haven't seen in the year and a half he's been home from Iraq,"" she says. ""Frankie has brought my sons their daddy home. She has lit the light back in him that had been so dark."" Perhaps the greatest legacy of Puppies Behind Bars is the lesson of love each inmate learns.

"MINGORA, Pakistan (CNN) -- Gen. Nadeem Ahmad swirls the helicopter over Pakistan's ground zero. Below is the Swat Valley of North West Frontier Province. A Pakistani soldier patrols a ruined street in Mingora. From the air, the valley in the foothills of the Hindu Kush looks undisturbed. Green fields amid clusters of drab houses. A closer look at Swat reveals how well the Pakistani Army fared in its military campaign to wipe out the militants. The cost of success: massive destruction that is sure to hamper the lives of already suffering residents just starting to trickle back to the homes they fled. A few months ago, ferocious battles between Pakistan's Army and Taliban fighters erupted here -- in Swat, Buner and Lower Dir districts. War's remnants serve as a constant reminder. A destroyed bridge. Pockmarked houses. Hotels that look like they've been abandoned for years. Nadeem maneuvers the chopper to circle Mingora, the largest city in the Swat Valley. From the hilltop Army sentry posts that come into view, soldiers survey the ground below, hard won from Taliban fighters. The militants, Nadeem says, have fled to nearby mountains. On the ground, he shows off a cache of weapons seized in the fighting. The soldiers are keen to boast their victory. Mingora remains on high alert. A curfew has been lifted for morning hours, although soldiers keep close watch on those who venture out. The city's pain is plainly evident on its scarred, deserted streets. Many shops are shuttered or destroyed.  Watch Stan Grant tour the shattered streets of Mingora Â» . The United Nations estimates that 375,000 Swat Valley residents fled their homes during the fighting. In all, 2.5 million Pakistanis were displaced in what was said to be one of the largest human migrations in recent history. About 260,000 people have been living in 21 refugee camps in neighboring Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Peshawar and Charssada districts, but the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees say the ""vast majority"" of internally displaced Pakistanis have been staying with host families, rented houses or in schools. The government plans to return people first from the camps and then focus on those living elsewhere. But this week, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) warned that as many as 1 million people could remain displaced until December because of the widespread destruction in their home towns, such as Mingora. Relief agencies have reported dire humanitarian conditions in Mingora: hospitals without electricity that are inundated with patients, an erratic supply of water and natural gas. One resident, who identified himself only as Abdullah, told CNN that returning people are facing shortages in food, water and basic supplies for survival. Some displaced families also expressed concerns about schooling for their children, reported the Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN), the U.N. news agency focusing on humanitarian issues. Louis-Georges Arsenault, emergency office director for UNICEF, said 1 million children were at risk of not starting school by September, mainly due to the Taliban's widespread destruction of schools and that 4,000 existing schools continue to shelter displaced people. Businessman Muhammad Khan, 40, who recently returned to Mingora, voiced the despair of returning residents. He told IRIN that ""everything is in ruins."" ""Everything is in ruins,"" IRIN quoted Khan as saying. ""It will take months for life to return to normality."" But that normality will no longer include the Taliban, Pakistani soldiers say. The fight was hard, but it was victorious, they say. They point to an area in the city where they say the Taliban displayed the bodies of their victims, some beheaded. It became known as ""Slaughter Square."" Slaughter Square's name may be outdated for the time being, but residents like Abdullah say it will be a long time before life in Mingora returns to what it once was. ""I don't like army. I don't like Taliban,"" Abdullah says, standing among the ruins of what used to be a thriving market. ""I only want peace.""","Pakistani forces in Swat Valley claim victory in fight against Taliban militants .

"(CNN) -- An unusual exhibition is confusing and amusing tourists and locals in central Copenhagen this month. Strange signs from around the world can be seen in Copenhagen, Denmark. ""Signspotting"" is a collection of more than 100 signs found by travelers around the world and recreated by travel writer Doug Lansky. ""I wanted it to look as if we'd stolen the sign or someone with a professional camera had taken a really good picture of it,"" he told CNN.  See pictures from Signspotting in Copenhagen. Â» . Lansky started his collection almost 17 years ago, encouraged by friends who found his photos of strange signs more compelling than his treasured holiday snaps. As a travel columnist for the Chicago Tribune, he set about collecting photos of as many bizarre signs as he could. Interest in the project became so big that he eventually used them to replace the column itself. Signspotting Weekly was taken up by six papers, and before he knew it people began to send him pictures of signs they'd seen, eventually enough to fill a floor-to-ceiling cabinet. The photos filled two volumes of Signspotting books for Lonely Planet. Lansky chose the best for the first exhibition in Stockholm last year. ""I felt bad I hadn't seen them. I knew I wasn't going to go around the world to track it down so I thought I'd do it this way,"" he said. Creating the exhibition took hours of painstaking work to digitally enlarge the photos so they looked like the real thing. ""When most of these people sent these signs in they were on a postcard-sized photo and the actual sign was about the size of a postage stamp. To blow them up to this size was tricky,"" he said. The photos were then mounted onto real signs on metal poles standing in concrete bases. The free exhibition opened in Copenhagen, Denmark last week and will move to Arhus, Denmark on July 1st. Lansky is currently building a second exhibition for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August.","Doug Lansky has been collecting photos of amusing signs for 17 years .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama will invoke God when he takes the oath of office January 20, despite a lawsuit filed by atheist and non-religious groups, according to an attorney for Chief Justice John Roberts, who will administer the oath. President-elect Barack Obama has asked to invoke the phrase ""so help me God"" at the end of his oath. The groups have sued in federal court to block any mention of God during the inaugural ceremonies. Roberts was among those named in the suit. However, Obama wishes to conclude the oath with the phrase ""so help me God,"" Jeffrey Minear, an attorney and administrative assistant for Roberts, told a federal court in documents Friday. The Constitution mandates the exact language to be used in the 35-word oath of office: ""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" Some chief executives have embellished the oath with ""so help me God."" It is not constitutionally required, unlike in other federal oaths. Historians have been at odds over whether George Washington established precedent by invoking the phrase on his own at the first inaugural in 1789. The Library of Congress Web site says he did. Most presidents have used the phrase. iReport.com: Your photos from the inauguration . Inaugural officials and presidents or presidents-elect usually coordinate behind the scenes on whether the judge or government official administering the phrase will invoke it. Michael Newdow, supported by several groups including the American Humanist Association, claims in his lawsuit that ""so help me God"" violates the constitutional ban on government ""endorsement"" of religion. He asked a federal judge to intervene and block references of God or religion in the formal ceremonies. The lawsuit also opposes the traditional invocation and benediction to be delivered by pastors invited by Obama. ""There can be no purpose for placing 'so help me God' in an oath or sponsoring prayers to God, other than promoting the particular point of view that God exists,"" according to the lawsuit. The federal government revealed in its response that Obama wants to use the phrase. The declaration was apparently aimed at blunting Newdow's concession that Obama could add the phrase on his own but that Roberts or any government official should not force or prompt him to say it. Among those named in the lawsuit besides the 53-year-old chief justice are the Presidential Inauguration Committee; the Joint Congressional Committee on Inauguration Ceremonies and its chairwoman, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California); and the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee and its commander, Maj. Gen. Richard Rowe Jr. Newdow said December 31 that he did not name Obama in his suit because in addition to participating as a government official in the ceremony, Obama possesses rights as an individual that allow him to express religious beliefs. ""If he chooses to ask for God's help, I'm not going to challenge him,"" Newdow said. ""I think it's unwise."" A decision from the federal judge is expected in the next few days. The high court ruled against Newdow in 2004 after he tried to block the Pledge of Allegiance from being recited at his daughter's Sacramento, California-area public school because it contains the phrase ""under God."" He argued the case himself before the justices, making an impassioned plea that the teacher-led pledge forces religion on impressionable youngsters and carries the stamp of government approval.","Court documents say President-elect Barack Obama asked to invoke God .

"(CNN) -- For Morris Murenzi, a visit to his native Rwanda always includes attending a gacaca court -- a local tribunal of villagers set up to try suspects in a 1994 genocide that killed 800,000. The gacaca courts, as seen here in 2003, are inspired by old village tribunals used to settle disputes. At the proceedings, he sits with his countrymen. Some tearfully confront their attackers and testify against them, their scars from the genocide still visible. Others -- like him -- quietly listen, their emotional scars invisible. They wait and hope for answers about how their relatives died as a nine-member panel questions suspects. ""Some of the witnesses who ask questions are disfigured, others are disabled,"" said the Dallas, Texas, resident whose last gacaca trial was in Kigali two years ago. ""The attackers have no place to hide. They are forced to address what they have done to the victims."" Murenzi is one of thousands of people who attend gacaca courts all across Rwanda on any given day. Hearings are held in open fields in neighborhoods where the attacks occurred. There are no lawyers and no judges in robes. A panel of local villagers with no legal experience conducts the proceedings. ""For me, gacacas help me find closure and healing,"" Murenzi said. ""I am able to see up close how remorseful the attackers are. ... You never see that in real court."" Gacaca courts were introduced in the central African nation after the April 1994 genocide, which raged for 100 days. The victims were mostly from the Tutsi ethnic minority, who were targeted by Hutus over a rivalry that dates to colonial days. Some moderates from the Hutu majority who support Tutsis were also killed. Murenzi, a Tutsi from the capital, Kigali, lost most of his extended family in the genocide. During the attacks, he was in neighboring Uganda with his parents, where he attended school at the time, the 37-year-old said. ""My mom's sisters, brothers, my uncles, they were all killed and buried in mass graves,"" he said. The gacacas were originally formed to resolve minor disputes among villagers but were reinvented to hand out justice to the perpetrators of the genocide and help fast-track reconciliation efforts in the broken nation. ""You had about 130,000 people in jail. And there were many more outside,"" Rwandan President Paul Kagame said recently on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" The nation's justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal set up to try genocide suspects were overwhelmed, and handling all the cases in those courts would have taken hundreds of years, according to the president.  Watch Kagame justify gacacas Â» . ""If you went technically to try each one of them, as the law may suggest, then you would lose out on rebuilding a nation, on bringing people back together,"" he said. ""That's why we had to say, let's categorize responsibilities."" The leaders and masterminds of the genocide are tried in ordinary courts, and civilians who contributed to attacks or loss of life directly or indirectly go to gacacas, Kagame said. The tribunals are lacking and fraught with problems, critics say. ""We've had serious concerns about the gacaca process and whether it meets international fair trial standards,"" said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director for Human Rights Watch, which has offices in Rwanda. Some witnesses have been targeted for revenge after testifying, and due process falls short, Gagnon said, adding that the organization has suggested changes to the system to ensure basic human rights are met, but they have not been enforced. ""It is time for the process to end. And there needs to be a frank announcement on whether it has led to reconciliation,"" she said. Paul Rusesabagina, whose effort to save hundreds of Tutsis was featured in the 2004 movie ""Hotel Rwanda,"" calls gacacas ""the worst idea ever."" ""Gacaca traditionally means justice on the grass. Elders sitting on the grass, handing justice to someone who stole a neighbor's goat,"" Rusesabagina said. ""Judges are people who never went to school ... who do not know anything about law."" Today, this justice is dealing with people who have committed a genocide, which is a much bigger issue, he said. There have been calls to abolish the tribunals, which have tried about 1.5 million cases since they started in 2001, according to the Integrated Regional Information Networks, a U.N. agency. The government in June postponed plans to close gacacas. Some analysts say the system has its advantages, by reducing congestion in prisons and allowing survivors to hear first-hand what happened to their loved ones. Murenzi said he does not have all the answers about his relatives' deaths, and he plans to attend more gacacas -- including during a trip to Rwanda at the end of the year. Despite the lack of information, he said, watching suspects struggle to come to terms with the attacks has brought an unusual form of comfort. ""They will never know peace. They have to live with the fact that they killed their neighbors for the rest of their lives,"" Murenzi said. ""While the survivors can move on, they (attackers) probably never will.""","Hearings held in open fields in neighborhoods where the attacks occurred.

"(WIRED) -- The wind blowing through the streets of Manhattan couldn't power the city, but wind machines placed thousands of feet above the city theoretically could. A prototype of a high-altitude wind turbine made by Magenn Power. The first rigorous, worldwide study of high-altitude wind power estimates that there is enough wind energy at altitudes of about 1,600 to 40,000 feet to meet global electricity demand a hundred times over. The very best ground-based wind sites have a wind-power density of less than 1 kilowatt per square meter of area swept. Up near the jet stream above New York, the wind power density can reach 16 kilowatts per square meter. The air up there is a vast potential reservoir of energy, if its intermittency can be overcome. Even better, the best high-altitude wind-power resources match up with highly populated areas including North America's Eastern Seaboard and China's coastline. ""The resource is really, really phenomenal,"" said Christine Archer of Cal State University-Chico, who co-authored a paper on the work published in the open-access journal Energies.""There is a lot of energy up there, but it's not as steady as we thought. It's not going to be the silver bullet that will solve all of our energy problems, but it will have a role."" For centuries, we've been using high-density fossil fuels, but peaking oil supplies and climate concerns have given new life to green technologies. Unfortunately, renewable energy is generally diffuse, meaning you need to cover a lot of area to get the energy you want. So engineers look for renewable resources that are as dense as possible. On that score, high-altitude wind looks very promising. Wind's power -- energy which can be used to do work like spinning magnets to generate electricity -- varies with the cube of its speed. So, a small increase in wind speed can lead to a big increase in the amount of mechanical energy you can harvest. High-altitude wind blows fast, is spread nicely across the globe, and is easier to predict than terrestrial wind. These properties have led inventors and scientists to cast their hopes upward, where strong winds have long been known to blow, as Etzler's dreamy quote shows. During the energy shocks of the 1970s, when new energy ideas of all kinds were bursting forth, engineers and schemers patented several designs for harnessing wind thousands of feet in the air. The two main design frameworks they came up with are still with us today. The first is essentially a power plant in the sky, generating electricity aloft and sending it down to Earth via a conductive tether. The second is more like a kite, transmitting mechanical energy to the ground, where generators turn it into electricity. Theoretically, both approaches could work, but nothing approaching a rigorous evaluation of the technologies has been conducted. The Department of Energy had a very small high-altitude wind program, which produced some of the first good data about the qualities of the wind up there, but it got axed as energy prices dropped in the 1980s and Reagan-era DOE officials directed funds elsewhere. The program hasn't been restarted, despite growing attention to renewables, but that's not because it's considered a bad idea. Rather, it is seen as just a little too far out on the horizon. ""We're very much aimed these days at things that we can fairly quickly commercialize, like in the next 10 years or so,"" said National Renewable Energy Laboratory spokesperson George Douglas. Startups like KiteGen, Sky Windpower, Magenn, and Makani (Google's secretive fundee) have come into the space over the last several years, and they seem to be working on much shorter timelines. ""We are not that far from working prototypes,"" Archer said, though she noted that the companies are all incredibly secretive about the data from their testing. Magenn CFO Barry Monette said he expects ""first revenue"" next year when they sell ""two to four"" working prototypes of their blimpy machine, which will operate at much lower altitudes. ""We do think that we're going to be first [to market], unless something happens,"" Monette said. In the long term, trying to power entire cities with machines like this would be difficult, largely because even in the best locations, the wind will fail at least 5 percent of the time. ""This means that you either need backup power, massive amounts of energy storage, or a continental- or even global-scale electricity grid to assure power availability,"" said co-author Ken Caldeira, an ecologist at Stanford University. ""So, while high-altitude wind may ultimately prove to be a major energy source, it requires substantial infrastructure."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"(CNN) -- The family of a Somali-American man who died in Somalia have said they want to know who is responsible for recruiting him to join an al Qaeda-linked Islamist insurgency. Militia soldiers hold weapons as they train to prepare an attack in Mogadishu earlier this month. Jamal Bana is the third Somali-American from the city of Minneapolis to head to Somalia and die there. He is one of more than a dozen missing Somali-American men whose families believe have gone back to fight. ""Someone must have put something in his mind,"" Omar Jamal of Minneapolis' Somali Justice Advocacy Center said at a Sunday news conference with Bana's family. ""He must have been somewhat disillusioned and indoctrinated because he didn't have any clue about Somalia at all. So someone somewhere must be responsible for his disappearance.""  Watch as Bana's family seeks answers Â» . The same day as the family's news conference, Somalia's president -- a former member of the Islamist movement himself -- issued a plea to Somali-Americans not to join the fight in his country. ""I call on the Somali-American community not to send their youth to Somalia to fight alongside al-Shabaab,"" President Sheik Sharif Ahmed said on Sunday. ""I am saying to those young men from abroad: 'Your families fled your home to America because of insecurity. You should not return here to ferment violence against your people.'"" Al-Shabaab, a group that is on the U.S. government's terror watch list, remains entrenched in the northeast and sections of the south of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. It has ties to al Qaeda and has recruited foreign fighters to join its battle to overthrow the Somali government. The U.S. government announced last month that it is providing weapons to Ahmed's government as it tries to quell the insurgency. Fighting has uprooted more than 200,000 people in Mogadishu since early May, according to the United Nations. Many of the missing Somali-Americans are believed to have left for Somalia when Ethiopian forces were still on the ground. The presence of these foreign forces was an outrage to most Somalis, and became a rallying cry of al-Shabaab. But the Ethiopians have now withdrawn. Bana, who was one of those who heeded the call to return to fight, was only 1 when his parents left Somalia and eventually brought him to the United States. The oldest of seven children, Bana was a top student at Washburn High School in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was studying engineering at two area colleges before he went missing in November. On Saturday, his family learned of his fate: a photo of his body appeared on a Web site, a casualty of the ongoing conflict in Somalia. Jamal spoke for the family with one arm around Bana's distraught mother, who quietly wept, covering her face with her headscarf. The father was too upset to attend the news conference, Jamal said. The family is asking the United States government to help them bring his body back home. In October, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, a Somali-American believed to have been radicalized by al-Shabaab, traveled from Minneapolis to Somalia and blew up himself and 29 others. The incident -- the first-ever suicide bombing by a naturalized U.S. citizen -- raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community and sparked an investigation by the FBI. Burhan Hassan, a 17-year-old Somali-American high school student in Minneapolis, went missing eight months ago around the same time as Bana. Last month, his family learned that he was killed in Somalia. Neither family has any idea why the young males left the United States -- where they came as young boys -- or who is responsible for their deaths. Bana's family believes he was being held against his will. ""Only one time he placed a phone call (in mid-November), he didn't say much,"" Omar Jamal said. ""He spoke as if he was being held hostage. He couldn't be speak freely. They asked him to cut the conversation short. ""The mother was asking him, 'Where are you? Why did you (leave)?' He said, 'I cannot talk to you, I just called to tell you I'm here. I cannot tell you anything. I'll call you some other time. I'm sorry I cannot talk to you.'"" E.K. Wilson, an FBI special agent and spokesman for the Minneapolis field office, could not confirm the exact number of missing Somali-American men or confirm the recent deaths, citing the agency's ongoing investigation. But he said the number of missing men believed to be in Somalia is ""in the 10s."" He said the possible recruitment of these men to fight alongside an al Qaeda-linked group is ""a significant concern."" ""Counterterrorism is our number one priority in the FBI and in this particular field division, and our efforts since 9/11 have been geared in that direction and with the goal of preventing future terrorist attacks,"" he told CNN in a recent interview. ""So it is a significant concern and one that we're giving our highest priority."" Since Shirwa Ahmed's death in October, Wilson said the FBI has further expanded its outreach program to the Somali-American community around the United States. So far, there is no indication that al-Shabaab is recruiting young men from Somali-American communities outside Minneapolis. Asha Ali and her husband Ali Yusuf Omar help resettle Somali refugees in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. They spoke to CNN on Sunday shortly after news surfaced of Jamal Bana's death, and said they are baffled by what is going on in Minneapolis. ""Of course I'm scared,"" Asha Ali said. ""If that happened in Minneapolis, it could happen anywhere."" Asha Ali works for Refugee Family Services and Ali Yusuf works for Georgia Somali Community, Inc. They have five children, a 14-year-old daughter and four sons ages 10, 12, 20 and 22. ""I have seen mothers talking,"" Asha said, referring to what's going on in Minneapolis. ""I open my eyes now more. I watch my kids more closely."" The couple came to the United States in their 20s in 1982, and all five of their children were born in America. She said there have been no reports of any missing Somali-Americans among the tight-knit community which are centered in the towns of Stone Mountain and Clarkston, near Atlanta. Asha and Ali Yusuf attend various mosques, or masjids, in the Atlanta area -- which are the centers of the Somali-American community -- and say they all preach tolerance and demand that young people stay out of trouble. Asha said she cannot figure out what led the young men in Minneapolis to want to return to Somalia. ""What is this 'al-Shabaab'? What does this word mean?"" she said. Their fight against fellow Somalis, she said, does not make sense to many members of the expatriate community. Either way, Somali-Americans want to know why these young men and boys are going to the country that their parents struggled so hard to leave behind to provide a better life for their children. ""It's a question mark who's behind it,"" Asha Ali said. ""I'd love more than you to find out.""

"(CNN) -- A girl who was shown on a videotape being sexually assaulted in Las Vegas has been found and is safe, officials in Nye County, Nevada, said Friday. Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, is being sought as a suspect, police say. ""We have found the child, Madison. She's safe. The detectives say she is in good condition,"" Nye County Sheriff Tony De Meo said. The girl, now 7, was shown in a sex video made four years ago, Detective David Boruchowitz said at a news conference Friday night. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture. CNN and other news organizations did so until the child was found, when De Meo asked them to stop showing the picture. ""The mother has cooperated with us,"" De Meo said. ""We believe that the mother was not aware of anything that went on with this young girl,"" he said. ""It was very sad for her to find this out."" A former Las Vegas animal trainer, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, has been identified as a suspect and is being sought in the case, De Meo said. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas.  Watch what's known about Stiles Â» . Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said. Someone close to Stiles has told investigators that Stiles is a ""survivalist type"" and always carries a weapon, Nye County District Attorney Bob Beckett said. De Meo addressed Stiles directly: ""Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency,"" he said. ""Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm, but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency.""   The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said. Police, who had called Stiles a person of interest, began calling him a suspect late Friday. There appeared to be physical similarities between Stiles and the man in the videotape, De Meo said. ""Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through. Whoever this person is is a predator that, as far as I'm concerned, belongs in custody and, if successfully prosecuted, in jail for as long as the law allows,""  De Meo said earlier.  Detectives said the child showed little emotion during the rapes, indicating she may have been brutalized before. Nevadan Darren Tuck recently gave police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert, De Meo said. Police said the tape was in his possession at least since May before he handed it over to authorities. He is being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support, but police -- who want to question him further -- have been unable to locate him. Tuck, who also allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible 10-years-to-life sentence for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography, De Meo said. Harry Kuehn, Tuck's attorney, said this week on CNN's ""Nancy Grace"" that Tuck was ""racked by indecision"" about what to do with the tape once he realized what it was. Asked why, Kuehn said, ""He's explained that to us, and at this point, we're not going to share that, because it goes to the defense of the matter."" ""You have to consider what kind of concerns my client had; He's previously dealt with the sheriff's office in Nye County; it was previously unsatisfactory,"" the attorney said.

"(CNN) -- For Brad Cohen, the barking and squealing noises he could not control began in the fifth grade. Fifty kids came to Camp Twitch and Shout's first session. Director Brad Cohen says he hopes to double that figure. ""I remember eating lunch at school all by myself and the mean kids would parade around me and mock my noises. My teacher made me get up in front of the class and apologize to everybody for the noises I was making,"" Cohen recalls. More than 20 years later, Cohen is a camp director, celebrating the first year of Camp Twitch and Shout, a place for youngsters, who like Cohen, have Tourette syndrome. ""Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder which causes people to make noises and tics that they can't control,"" Cohen says. Fifty campers, between the ages of 7 and 18, came from all over the country to spend a week in Winder, Georgia, about 45 miles east of Atlanta. They have plenty to do, from swimming and fishing to music and arts and crafts. Most have been teased or harassed in school, and the camp is a place just to have fun. ""It's very nice to be able to let it all out and just not have to worry and not have people stare at you and think that you're weird and think -- what's wrong with that person?"" says 16-year-old camper and black belt Tinsley Birchfield of Atlanta.  Watch more from Camp Twist and Shout Â» . For other campers, such as Jacob McGee of Savannah, Georgia, just being outdoors is magical. ""My favorite part was when we climbed the tree. That was pretty awesome. I went as high as I could go. It was really fun,"" says the 11-year-old. According to experts, Twitch and Shout is one of only five weeklong camps in the country for children with Tourette syndrome. Atlanta-based child neurologist Howard Schub says such camps help children better cope with their condition. Some campers have never met another kid with Tourette syndrome. ""A child goes to camp, they see that they're not the worst. ... There are others that are functioning pretty well with worse tics than they,"" Schub says. Cohen adds, ""They see that wow, 'There are other kids that are like me.' They laugh, they tell the same jokes, they have the same interests. And what we hope is that their self-esteem goes up."" Twitch and Shout campers display motor tics common to most kids with Tourette syndrome such as eye blinking, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, head jerking, and -- in a few rare cases -- cursing. Camp activities are filled with the sounds of typical vocal tics: sniffing, throat clearing, hooting, barking, hissing and squealing. But campers such as teenager Kevin Kardon of Athens, Georgia, say they've just gotten used to it. ""It's just kind of like you're listening to music, and you hear something in the background and you don't really hear it,"" Kevin says. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, three out of every 1,000 school-age children are believed to have Tourette syndrome. The cause is unknown, but genetics appear to play a role. Most children develop the condition between 7 and 10, and if their tics are mild to moderate, they usually require no medicine to control them. Symptoms usually peak during the late teens or early 20s. ""Many children, as they get older, the tics become either much less prominent or certainly reduced to a single or just a few tics that are not as disabling,"" Schub says. That was certainly the case with Cohen. Barking is still his dominant tic, but when he was the age of his campers, he wrestled to control several others, including eye blinking, teeth chomping and arm twitching. In middle school, when his tics were at the height of their intensity, the principal approached him and asked if he'd like to educate the student body about his condition. Cohen says this move changed his life. ""They gave me a standing ovation, and it was on that day that I realized the power of education. I wanted to be that teacher that I never had. And that was my dream. I wanted to be the teacher that focused on kids' strengths, not weaknesses,"" he says. And that's what he's been trying to do in the classroom for more than 13 years. At 35, Cohen is an elementary school teacher, the author of a book on Tourette syndrome and now a camp director. He says he hopes his campers find strength in knowing they are not alone and will carry this new confidence home with them to face the challenges of the upcoming school year. ""When they have tough times and they think they can't find success, it's our goal that they will think back to their experience at Camp Twitch and Shout and say, 'You know what? I can do it; I can be successful because I did it at camp,' "" Cohen says. Next summer, Cohen says he plans to recruit twice as many campers and hopes the experience will be as worthwhile for them as it was this year for 15-year-old Chris Wall of Athens. ""This camp was awesome because it had people just like me,"" says Chris, beaming.","Camp Twitch and Shout is a weeklong camp for kids with Tourette syndrome .

"(CNN) -- Ventures lead guitarist Bob Bogle, whose fretwork on such instrumental hits such as ""Walk -- Don't Run"" and ""Hawaii Five-O"" influenced countless bands, died Sunday in Vancouver, Washington. Bob Bogle (second from left) co-founded the Ventures, the highly influential instrumental band. He was 75. The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to Don Wilson, who co-founded the Ventures with Bogle in the 1950s. ""He had a special sound that nobody could ever re-create. He was totally unique as a guitar player,"" Wilson told CNNRadio. Wilson and Bogle learned how to play guitar while working as construction workers in the 1950s in their native Tacoma, Washington. The pair formed the Ventures in 1958. ""We had a lot of time on our hands after work, so we'd get together and play,"" Wilson recalled. ""A year and a half later, we had a number two hit called 'Walk -- Don't Run.' "" The group first heard the song on a Chet Atkins record. Several other hits followed, including ""Perfidia,"" ""Walk Don't Run '64"" and ""Diamond Head."" The group took the theme of the TV show ""Hawaii Five-O"" into the Top Ten in 1969 and later supplied background music for the series. But the band, which played almost solely instrumentals, was perhaps more influential for its albums. Thirty-eight of the band's long-players hit Billboard's Top 200 chart, including albums that covered country songs, dance tunes and Christmas melodies. One of the band's albums was titled ""Play Guitar with the Ventures,"" and countless did. ""I can't think of a better contribution for instrumental music on his style than 'Walk -- Don't Run,' "" Wilson said. ""A lot of good would-be guitar players and garage bands would go out and buy guitars just to learn that song."" The Ventures were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. At the induction ceremony, Creedence Clearwater Revival's John Fogerty praised the group: ""It's enough to say, the Ventures are the most popular instrumental band of all time,"" he said. Bogle fought his illness with dignity, Wilson said. ""His doctors gave him 10 years to live, and he lived 12. The last two years were really tough. At least he lived to know the Ventures had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."" Bogle is survived by his wife, Yumi.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama should reach out to Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi as tensions in Iran over the disputed presidential elections continue to heighten, a former Bush administration official told CNN Sunday. Paul Wolfowitz was the deputy defense secretary in the Bush administration. ""I would certainly find out if he (Moussavi) wants a conversation,"" former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""If he doesn't, I certainly wouldn't push it. But I would make it clear that the phone is an open line."" Obama on Saturday issued a written statement on the bloodshed across the streets of Tehran as demonstrators protest the election outcome, saying, ""The Iranian government must understand that the world is watching. We mourn each and every innocent life that is lost. ""We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people. The universal rights to assembly and free speech must be respected, and the United States stands with all who seek to exercise those rights."" However, Obama has been criticized by some lawmakers and analysts who say he should vocalize a stronger stance on the clashes.  Watch the latest videos being leaked out of Iran Â» . ""I understand the concern about meddling in a way that seems to label the opposition as American tools, but the opposition made it very clear they want support from the world,"" said Wolfowitz, a staunch supporter of the U.S.-led war in Iraq and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen added that, ""It would be useful for the president to show more forceful leadership internationally on this issue."" He noted the graphic images emerging from Iran, including the fatal shooting of a young female protester identified as Neda, saying the violence calls for ""some kind of humanity from the West."" Gergen and Wolfowitz said the United States should rally with other Western nations and even countries in the region -- including Afghanistan and Turkey, which have recognized incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the winner of the June 12 election -- to support the Iranian people. Ahmadinejad's victory was declared by Iran's election authority, the Guardian Council, spurring massive protests last week, with many demonstrators proclaiming their support for Moussavi.

"LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- It's hot and sweaty in a rat-infested room in Lahore's historic red light district, a neighborhood of narrow alleyways lined with brothels. A dancer does the ""mujra,"" a traditional dance banned by a judge for being ""vulgar,"" in Lahore, Pakistan. A barefoot, long-haired woman is gyrating and twirling on the carpet, to the beat of a four-man band whose drummer sweats profusely as he pounds out a furious rhythm. The dancer, who only gives her first name, Beenish, is performing a kind of Pakistani belly-dance called the mujra. Her harmonium player, a skinny bald man who squints through coke-bottle glasses, has been performing like this for the past 50 years. But he says the art form is dying out. ""That spark, the way it was in the past, is no more,"" said Ghulam Sarwar. Last fall, a judge in Lahore's high court declared the mujra dance ""vulgar"" and banned it from being performed on stage. Some here say the government is cracking down on easy, ""immoral"" targets in an attempt to appease religious hard-liners like the Taliban. Islamist militants are believed to be responsible for a recent wave of bomb attacks in Lahore, targeting cinemas, theaters and cafes where young men and women fraternize together. ""It is a gesture of good will to pacify the mullahs and the Taliban,"" said Samia Amjad, a lawmaker in the provincial assembly. Though she is a member of an opposition political party, she said she supported the crackdown on vulgarity. ""I see it as an essential part of Islam."" Dancers aren't the only targets of the court censors. In late March, the Lahore high court banned two female singers from recording new albums after ruling that they sang sexually explicit lyrics. ""If the current circumstances persist in Pakistan,"" said Noora Lal, one of the banned singers, ""then singing will die out in this country."" Pakistan is a deeply conservative Muslim nation, where the punishment for blasphemy is the death sentence. But there is one person in Lahore who openly mocks the conservative establishment: painter and restaurant owner Iqbal Hussain. Though he said he has received multiple death threats from Islamist fundamentalists, Hussain continues to be Pakistan's most vocal defender of prostitutes. All of the models portrayed in his paintings are sex workers. ""I portray them on canvas, portray them as human beings,"" Hussain said, ""They feel pain. They want their children to be educated."" Hussain knows the industry intimately. He was born to a family of sex workers. His mother, a former prostitute, passed away last month at the age of 98. The small, soft-spoken painter has turned the house he grew up in, an old four-story building with ornate wooden balconies, into a popular restaurant for tourists and wealthy Pakistanis. On one side of the house there is a brothel, on the other side, the 17th century Badshahi Mosque, one of the largest mosques in the world. In his subversive paintings, which Hussain said sell for more than $10,000 each, he highlights the overlap between Lahore's sex industry and its religious community. In one canvas, hundreds of worshippers are depicted prostrating themselves around the mosque, while in the foreground, two women apply lipstick and makeup on a balcony. Hussain explained that the prostitutes in the painting were preparing to receive new customers as soon as the prayers in the mosque were over.  Watch the dance being called ""immoral"" in Pakistan Â» . The painter claimed that on religious festivals, the brothels and dance halls in his neighborhood overflow with customers. ""They come from the northern areas with their turbans,"" Iqbal said, laughing. ""All coming to this area. They're not going to the mosque ... but to the brothels!"" Nevertheless, the rising tide of the Taliban in northwestern Pakistan has some residents of Lahore's red light district worried. ""May Allah keep us safe from them,"" said Beenish, the mujra dancer. ""We are poor, humble people. They should not target this place."" Photography by CNN's Farhad Shadravan.","In Lahore's red light district, Iqbal Hussain mocks Pakistan's religious establishment .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Prejudice is a funny thing. I was prepared not to like BMW's M6. Not that I thought it would be a bad car -- BMW, as a rule, isn't prone to making duff automobiles -- it's just I wasn't entirely sure what it was supposed to be. An executive coupe with a 5-liter V10 engine and 500 bhp? With a price tag that could buy you a Porsche 911 or most of an Aston Martin V8 Vantage? What fresh nonsense was this? But prejudice is there to be challenged. The aggressive front air intakes, 19"" alloy wheels and carbon fiber roof mean that this isn't any ordinary 6-Series . Taking delivery of the M6 at my home in Brighton, southern England, I felt the car looked ever so slightly out of place. After all I live in an electoral ward which elected three Green representatives to the City council and is predicted to deliver the first Green Party member to the national government at the next general election. Muscular sports cars aren't common sights on my street (someone once parked a Porsche Cayenne Turbo here but he got a dirty look for it). An acquaintance, Kevin, strolled past. ""Hello,"" I said, ""it's not mine"". Second-guessing his likely prejudices I added, ""It's rather ostentatious, I know."" ""I don't know,"" replied Kevin, ""I think it's quite understated, quite elegant."" One prejudice quashed. My wife and I then filled the surprisingly roomy trunk with our luggage and various gifts (the weekend being the occasion of my father-in-law's 70th birthday) and prepared for our journey to the Staffordshire moorlands in central England. You can spend a lot of time preparing for a journey in an M6. You can choose a location for the sat-nav to direct you to and whether the directions are displayed as a map or as a perspective diagram. You can choose to listen to CD, radio or an external audio source and then modify the acoustic properties with a graphic equalizer and various surround sound settings. You can program the ""M"" button on the steering wheel so that the various suspension, gearing and power settings can be switched between sedate motorway driving and utter lunacy. You can adjust the seat's height and rake; inflate, deflate and position the lumbar support so the small of your back is just so and adjust the seat wings to hold you as tight as a doting grandmother, should you wish. The car is started with a start/stop button. This is best done with the window open because the M6 is front-engined and the general cabin ambience is too refined to be invaded with the brutish noises of the 5-liter V10. Even so, the hood's sound insulation means that you never get the eviscerating snarl that juvenile men -- such as myself -- expect from a supercar. The automatic gearbox can be put in a fully-automatic mode, or gears can be selected by nudging the sequential gear lever, or flipping the paddle-shifts behind the steering wheel. The car is surprisingly civilized at low speeds. It doesn't feel like you're taming a monster. If anything there's a slight lag between pushing the throttle and the forwards crawl. Navigational and speedometer readings are projected onto the windscreen by the head-up display, creating the impression of a floating screen a few feet in front of the car. This omnipresent reminder of speed is good news for my (unblemished) driving licence as it is horribly easily to drive way too fast in the M6. It is so stable that 30 mph feels like a walking pace and I wouldn't want to incriminate myself by stating the speed I found myself doing on the public highway while thinking I was driving at just about the speed limit. Naturally the head-up display can also be customized and, in ""M"" mode displays speed and a graphic display of rev ranges, in favor of navigational instructions. Put simply the M6 is perfect on the highways, which would make up the majority of my journey (much of it, coincidentally, on a highway called the ""M6""). You are under no compulsion to drive like a hooligan. With the power button off (meaning you have only 400 not 500 horses at your disposal), and at its least-sporty setting, the M6 drives like a perfectly ordinary BMW -- composed, sturdy but able to accelerate out of trouble when necessary. On country roads it handles diligently, holding corners reassuringly but without the physical sensation you get driving smaller, lower sports cars. I'm assured that you can drive the M6 like a hooligan if you wish, taking advantage of the M-Diff system -- a torque-sensing differential that can provide between zero and 100 per cent of the drive forces to either driven wheel -- and the MDynamic mode which allows the car to perform on the edge for as long as possible before kicking in the dynamic stability control to keep the car in line. Sadly time, conditions, and my wife's insistence that we arrived in one piece, prevented me from testing these attributes. The point of the M6, then, is that it's both a refined, four-seater grand tourer and a sports car. It has, as the car wash attendant in a supermarket parking lot in Cheadle suggested ""too much electronics"" but those electronics are necessary for performing the car's dual roles. The car's not without niggles: the indicator stalk is too short (and would it hurt to put an indicator display on the head-up?). It's very thirsty (officially 19 mpg, but we managed rather less) and the 70-liter tank is insufficient for long journeys. The lag between gear changes at low speed is rather annoying. And the compromise between sports car thrills and autobahn civility means that it doesn't sound, or look, like a schoolboy's fantasy. But perhaps that's the point. Far from being ostentatious, the M6 is the devil dressed as middle-management: it does bad things very respectably. E-mail to a friend .","500 bhp V10-engined variant of the BMW 6-Series .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama signed an executive order granting some benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees Wednesday, calling it ""a historic step"" but promising more action to come. President Obama has been criticized by gay rights activists for not doing more since taking office. ""We've got more work to do to ensure that government treats all its citizens equally, to fight injustice and intolerance in all its forms and to bring about that more perfect union,"" Obama said. The signing followed sharp criticism of the president over a Justice Department motion filed last week in support of the Defense of Marriage Act -- which effectively bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex unions. Obama said he still wants to repeal the act. ""I believe it's discriminatory. I think it interferes with state's rights, and we will work with Congress to overturn it,"" he said. The memorandum he signed Wednesday means same-sex partners of civil service employees can be added to the long-term care program, employees can use their sick leave to take care of domestic partners and children and same-sex partners of Foreign Service employees will be included in medical evacuations and housing allocations, according to the White House. But it does not grant full health-care coverage, which would require an act of Congress, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said. As details of the impending memorandum began to filter out Wednesday, the reaction of some gay rights activists was not enthusiastic. ""I have to say, as a federal employee, I'm really disappointed,"" Lisa Polyak, 48, of Baltimore, Maryland, said of Obama's expected memorandum. Polyak, who has worked for the federal government for more than two decades, is with the Army Medical Department. She was among the two dozen authors of the Dallas Principles, a set of eight statements that seek to guide the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community toward ""full civil equality,"" according to the document's preamble.  Watch CNN's Paul Steinhauser discuss Obama's intent on benefits to same-sex partners Â» . ""The benefits that the president might be announcing are already available,"" said Polyak, who has a partner and two children. ""This isn't new. This isn't different."" She said federal employees are able to take sick leave for ""anyone that was the close approximation of family"" and said the long-term-care option has been available for people under the same category. Polyak said not having health insurance from the federal government for her partner of 27 years costs her family $4,000 to $5,000 a year, not including co-pays or deductibles. Asked in a conference call with reporters whether these benefits were already available to same-sex partners of federal employees, Berry said such benefits are ""subject to the whim of a supervisor."" ""If you have an enlightened supervisor, yes, that is a possibility (that they have been available),"" he said. ""What the president is doing today is making this no longer optional. He is making it mandatory. And he's making it clear that this is now the policy of the federal government."" Polyak disagreed, saying, ""The idea that this was a fly-by-night [is] ... not true. I used it routinely."" She added, ""It was guidance that everyone took advantage of and continues to take advantage at this moment."" Gay and lesbian advocates have also faulted the Obama administration for not moving to repeal the military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy that bars officials from asking about a service member's sexual orientation but also bars the service member from revealing it, and allows the dismissal of a service member if a same-sax orientation is discovered. ""There's so little we can say until we know what it is,"" said Carisa Cunningham, a spokeswoman for Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, a legal advocacy group that is challenging Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act in federal court in Massachusetts. Section 3 prevents the federal government from giving Social Security and other protections to same-sex married couples. ""Laws have to change ... and in particular, the Defense of Marriage Act needs to change, so whatever the few benefits that the president as an employer can grant, there won't be a lot of them,"" Cunningham said. President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law in 1996. Obama rankled gay advocates in January when he selected mega-church pastor Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration. Warren, in an interview with Beliefnet, likened homosexuality to bestiality and incest. He also supported California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in that state. During the Warren controversy, Obama -- who frequently spoke out in favor of gay and lesbian rights during the campaign but has said he opposes same-sex marriage -- declared himself ""a fierce advocate for gay and lesbian Americans.""","NEW: Executive order doesn't grant full health coverage, White House says .

"Editor's note: CNN executive producer Suzanne Simons is the author of ""Master of War: Blackwater's Erik Prince and the Global Business of War."" Private contractor Xe flies military personnel in Afghanistan and helps train Afghan border police. The company formerly known as Blackwater, now called Xe much to its chagrin, has been at the center of the contractor debate for years. From the time four of its men were ambushed and murdered in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004, to a shooting involving a team of its men in a Baghdad neighborhood in which at least 14 Iraqi civilians were killed in 2007, the company has drawn unwanted headlines. Blackwater owner Erik Prince downsized the company earlier this year when business failed to keep pace with investment. He changed the company's name after the Iraqi government banned it from doing business there. But those who thought contractors were going away under President Obama's administration couldn't be more wrong. According to the Department of Defense, there are some 68,000 contractors in Afghanistan today and more than 132,000 in Iraq. But those numbers aren't an accurate reflection of the total number of contractors because they don't include those working for other government agencies such as the Department of State. Many of those tens of thousands are third-country nationals, meaning they were hired from a third country to go to Iraq. Many earn between $400 and $700 a month; while Americans, particularly those performing dangerous security duties, can earn as much in a day. Despite being kicked out of Iraq, Xe still does a healthy business in Afghanistan, flying military personnel from one location to another and helping train Afghan border police charged with making the country's massive, porous borders more secure. It's one of the many jobs that the U.S. military just isn't staffed to tackle on its own. In fact, the U.S. military today is beefed up by a force of nearly a quarter million private contractors. There are even cases where contractors oversee the contractors. And that's the problem. The U.S. has come to rely on them so heavily, in such a short period of time, that the government has come under fire for not managing them adequately. Even among the eight-member team that makes up the Wartime Contracting Commission, a congressionally mandated effort to review the contracting process in Iraq and Afghanistan, the question of whether the United States needs the contractors isn't even an issue. The issue, rather, is how well the government is managing this massive support force called up in the immediate aftermath of the war in Iraq. In its interim report released this month, the Commission found that ""neither the military nor the federal civilian acquisition workforces have expanded to keep pace with recent years' enormous growth in the number and value of contingency contracts."" The report also said, ""the government still lacks clear standards and policy on inherently governmental functions. The decision has immediate salience given the decisions to use contractors in armed-security and life-support tasks for military units."" One of the biggest nightmares for legislators is that the force that has grown into such a critical modern-day military support structure was for a long time operating in a legal gray zone with no clear avenue of justice should something unsavory occur. That has led to some tough work for both prosecutors and the FBI, as they take on the task of investigating allegations of wrongdoing by contractors overseas. Doug Brooks, head of the IPOA, an industry-friendly voluntary organization made up of 62 companies, spends much of his time doing outreach and making sure member companies measure up to the internal standards. ""We have the power to kick people out of the association,"" Brooks said, but that's about where it ends. They can't prosecute anyone.  But to say that there has been no progress on the legal front wouldn't be fair. Legislation has been passed that essentially holds contractors accountable for their actions under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, but with everything in this business, there was a hang-up with that, too.  The legislation was written to cover contractors working in support of the Department of Defense, but there are even more contractors working in support of the State Department and other U.S. agencies. The Special Inspector General for Iraq, Stuart W. Bowen Jr. produced a report in February titled Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience. He then testified before Congress that ""the United States government was unprepared and ill-equipped to mount a major contingency relief and reconstruction program in Iraq in 2003. For the last six years we have been on a steep learning curve."" He also told members of Congress that the United States relies too heavily on the hired help, testifying that ""outsourcing management to contractors should be limited because it complicates lines of authority in contingency reconstruction operations."" Something that retired Lt. Gen. Richard Sanchez would undoubtedly agree with.   Sanchez, who led the U.S. military operation in the early days of the Iraq war, has launched an information campaign aimed at bringing more accountability to the debate. He's even called for a truth commission to investigate policies regarding the interrogation of detainees.   Guess what. Contractors were involved in that scandal, too. As for Blackwater, scandal, or the suspicion of it, played a significant role in its downturn. Plagued by lawsuits and federal investigations, the company now called Xe is a shell of what Blackwater was five years ago. Most of Prince's top executives are gone, budgets have been dramatically curtailed and the company has largely returned to its roots, as a training facility for law enforcement and special forces.   Is Blackwater's fate a sign that things are sour in the industry? Hardly. As IPOA's Brooks puts it, they're here to stay, its about time we made it work. ""I think the other conclusion that companies have come to is that we're going to be working with the private sector. Nobody wants soldiers to go back to flipping eggs, guarding gates, that kind of thing.""","Blackwater, now Xe, has garnered unwanted attention over the past few years .
Though kicked out of Iraq, Xe does a great deal of business in Afghanistan .
Bottom line: U.S. relies heavily on private military contractors .
The issue is how well U.S. government manages this support force ."
"Editor's note: Ilya Shapiro is a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research foundation, and editor-in-chief of the Cato Supreme Court Review. Before joining Cato, he was special assistant/adviser to the Multi-National Force-Iraq and practiced law at Patton Boggs LLP and Cleary Gottlieb LLP. Earlier, Shapiro clerked for Judge E. Grady Jolly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Ilya Shapiro says the Sotomayor appointment is a case of identity politics rather than a choice on the merits. (CNN) -- In picking Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama has confirmed that identity politics matter to him more than merit. While Judge Sotomayor exemplifies the American Dream, she would not have even been on the short list if she were not Hispanic. She is not one of the leading lights of the federal judiciary, and far less qualified for a seat on the Supreme Court than Judges Diane Wood and Merrick Garland or Solicitor General Elena Kagan. To be sure, Sotomayor has a compelling story: a daughter of working-class Puerto Ricans raised in Bronx public housing projects, diagnosed with diabetes at 8, losing her father at 9, accolades at Princeton and Yale Law, ending up on the federal bench. Still, in over 10 years on the Second Circuit, she has not issued any important decisions or made a name for herself as a legal scholar or particularly respected jurist. In picking a case to highlight during his introduction of the nominee, President Obama had to go back to her days as a trial judge and a technical ruling that ended the 1994-95 baseball strike. Moreover, Sotomayor has a mixed reputation among lawyers who have practiced before her, some questioning her abilities as a judicial craftsman, others her erratic temperament, according to a piece by Jeffrey Rosen in The New Republic, which itself has come in for criticism. Such anecdotal criticism is to be taken with a grain of salt -- while Justice Antonin Scalia's bench-side manner is more vinegar than honey, even his detractors recognize his brilliance -- but it does need to be investigated. So, too, do certain statements she made in presentations at Berkeley and Duke, respectively, the former arguing that a Latina necessarily sees the law differently than a white man, the latter suggesting that, at least to some degree, judges make rather than interpret law. Again, this does not mean that Sotomayor is unqualified to be a judge -- or less qualified to be a Supreme Court justice than, say, Harriet Miers. It also does not detract from the history she would make as the first Hispanic Supreme Court nominee -- if you don't count Benjamin Cardozo, a descendant of Portuguese Jews. But a Supreme Court nomination is not a lifetime achievement award, and should not be treated as an opportunity to practice affirmative action. Ironically, it is race-based employment practices of another kind that will likely get this nomination in hottest water. Sotomayor was on a panel that summarily affirmed the dismissal of claims brought by firefighters, including one Hispanic, whose promotions were denied because they would be based on a (race-neutral) exam whose results didn't yield the ""right"" racial mix. Curiously, the Ricci v. DeStefano appellate panel issued a cursory ""unpublished"" opinion that failed to grapple with the complex legal issues presented in the case. Sotomayor's colleague JosÃ© Cabranes, a liberal Democrat, excoriated the panel, without expressing a view on the merits of the case. Cabranes' dissent from the Second Circuit's decision not to rehear the case caught the Supreme Court's attention and, based on the oral argument, the court will probably reverse Sotomayor's panel when it rules on the case next month. iReport.com: Sotomayor 'the new face of America' We are thus likely to have the unusual scenario of a Supreme Court decision having a direct personal effect on a nominee's confirmation process, which will not only force Sotomayor onto the defensive but cost the president significant political capital. It will also show that Obama's calls for ""empathy,"" echoed by Sotomayor's citing her personal experiences as a Latina, ring hollow. If Frank Ricci, a dyslexic fireman who sacrificed significant time and money and was denied promotion solely for his skin color, is not an empathetic figure, I'm not sure who is. And that is the larger point: A jurisprudence of empathy is the antithesis of the rule of law. As then-Judge John Roberts said at his confirmation hearing: ""If the Constitution says that the little guy should win, then the little guy's going to win in the court before me. But if the Constitution says that the big guy should win, well then the big guy's going to win, because my obligation is to the Constitution."" In any event, Senate Republicans will now have to decide what posture to take: combative or deferential, political or analytical. With the president still at the height of his popularity and solid Democratic control of the Senate (even without Arlen Specter and Al Franken), the GOP is unlikely to sustain a filibuster or even, unless outrage over the Ricci case grows, vote Sotomayor down. iReport.com: Sotomayor pick a 'gimmick' What they should do instead is force a full public debate about constitutional interpretation, probing Sotomayor's judicial philosophy and refusing to accept nonresponsive answers that mouth platitudes or avoid taking firm legal positions. Now is the time to show the American people the stark differences between the two parties on one of the few issues on which the stated Republican view continues to command strong and steady support. If the party is serious about constitutionalism and the rule of law, it should use this opportunity for education, not grandstanding. And if Democrats insist on playing identity politics, I suggest a two-word response: Miguel Estrada, the Honduran immigrant with his own rags-to-riches story whose nomination to the D.C. Circuit Democrats successfully filibustered, effectively preventing George W. Bush from naming the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice.

"(CNN)  -- Judges in Texas and Florida have dropped military contractor KBR from lawsuits brought by the family of a soldier who was electrocuted in Iraq, the company announced Tuesday. Sgt. Christopher Everett was electrocuted in 2005 at an American base outside Ramadi, in western Iraq. Sgt. Christopher Everett died while using a power washer at an American base outside Ramadi, in western Iraq. His was one of nine electrocution deaths in Iraq blamed on ""improper grounding or faulty equipment,"" according to a Pentagon inspector-general's report released Monday. KBR was one of the contractors Everett's family has sued in connection with his death. But federal courts in Louisiana and Texas have thrown out the family's claims against the Houston, Texas-based company, KBR announced Tuesday. ""The dismissal orders affirm that despite repeated criticism and statements made by several public officials on Capitol Hill and related media reports, KBR had no involvement in the factors that led to the tragic death of Sergeant Everett,"" Andrew D. Farley, the company's senior vice president and general counsel, said in a written statement. KBR's work in Iraq and Afghanistan has come under extensive criticism from members of Congress. The company has defended its performance and argued that it was not to blame for any fatalities. Monday's report from the Pentagon's inspector-general criticized the company in the death of another soldier, Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth, who was electrocuted in his shower in his Baghdad quarters. The report found that ""multiple systems and organizations failed,"" leaving Maseth ""exposed to unacceptable risk."" It concluded that a water pump installed by KBR was not grounded, leading to Maseth's electrocution when it short-circuited, and the company did not report improperly grounded equipment during routine maintenance. But it also found that Maseth's commanders failed to ensure renovations to the palace had been properly done and the Army did not set electrical standards for jobs or contractors. Maseth's family also has sued KBR. The company has had no comment on the inspector-general's findings, but company spokeswoman Heather Browne says it was not responsible for Maseth's death. The building where Maseth was quartered was one of Saddam Hussein's former palaces, and Browne said the building ""had not been grounded or bonded by the contractors who built the structure."" In addition, she said, KBR had warned the military about the hazard nine months before Maseth's January 2008 death. ""Prior to that incident, the military never directed KBR to repair, upgrade or improve the grounding system in the building in which Maseth resided, nor was KBR directed to perform any preventative maintenance at this facility,"" she said in a statement issued to CNN. But Maseth's mother said she was ""pleased"" by the finding that KBR installed the water pump blamed for her son's death. ""The results are revealing and contrary to what KBR and its president have continuously stated over the past year,"" Cheryl Harris told CNN.","Sgt.

"Editor's note: Michael Eric Dyson is a professor of sociology at Georgetown University and the author of 16 books, including the New York Times bestseller, ""April 4, 1968: Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Death and How it Changed America"". Michael Eric Dyson says the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. shows that the U.S. is not ""a post-racial paradise."" (CNN) -- Last Thursday, President Obama, in his fiery speech before the NAACP Convention, admitted that ""an African-American child is roughly five times as likely as a white child to see the inside of a prison."" But he surely couldn't have imagined that only a couple of hours before his oration, one of America's most prominent scholars -- and a distinguished professor at Obama's alma mater, Harvard University -- would breathe cruel and ironic life into that sad statistic. Henry Louis ""Skip"" Gates Jr. is simply the most powerful and influential black scholar in our nation's history. He received a doctorate at Cambridge University long before the culture wars became au courant; he was among the first group of figures to receive a MacArthur ""Genius Award"" Fellowship; he wrote the finest work of literary criticism in a generation with ""Signifying Monkey""; he was named by Time magazine as one of the ""25 Most Influential Americans""; he has a boatload of honorary degrees; and he has been a ubiquitous media presence and thoughtful interpreter of race and culture for a quarter-century. But none of that made a bit of difference when Gates returned from a research trip to China to find the front door to his Harvard-owned house jammed and enlisted the assistance of his driver to muscle the door loose. By the time Gates was on the phone with his leasing company, a white policeman had arrived, summoned by a neighbor who spotted two black men looking as if they were unlawfully breaking into the house. Their stories diverge from here; the policeman says he asked Gates to step outside, Gates refused, the officer entered the home and requested Gates' ID, which he didn't initially produce, and finally had Gates arrested when he followed the officer outside, as Gates was ""exhibiting loud and tumultuous behavior."" Gates allegedly shouted, ""Is this how you treat a black man in America?"" and ""You don't know who you're messing with."" Gates says he showed the officer his ID, demanded that the officer identify himself, which he didn't, and then the professor followed the officer outside to get the policeman's name and badge number when he was arrested by the gaggle of police who had gathered. Several features of the story scream the presence of lingering bias and racism. A black man in a tony neighborhood simply seems out of place, even to his neighbors. Had Gates been a white professor trying to get inside his home, and called on his driver to help him jar his door open, he probably wouldn't have as readily aroused the suspicion of neighbors. And when police arrived to check out the premises, they probably wouldn't have been nearly as ready to believe the worst about the occupant of a home who clearly wasn't engaged in a criminal act. Whatever one believes about what happened, Gates clearly wasn't the beneficiary of the benefit of the doubt, a reasonable expectation since he posed no visible threat. It is also striking that Gates seems to be the victim of a police mentality that chafes at a challenge of its implicit authority. While that may be true for folk of all races, it seems especially galling to cops to be questioned by a person of color. How dare black folk believe that, regardless of their station or privilege, they have permission to speak back -- or speak black -- to state-enforced authority, one that, not a decade ago, routinely ravaged black communities in blatant displays of wanton aggression. It is for good reason that police brutality is a constant concern for black folk; the stakes are often high and harmful. The link between black vulnerability and racial profiling -- of setting in one's collective imagination an image of black men as bad people who are liable to commit mayhem at any moment, and who must therefore always be suspected of wrong and subject to arbitrary forms of control and surveillance -- is evident in the pileup of black bodies, from Amadou Diallo to Sean Bell, that testify to the force of police to impose lethal limits on black survival. Gates rubbed up against the unspoken code that enforces black silence and often violently compels black compliance. In the end, Gates' unjust treatment speaks volumes about the cynical assertion that we now live in a post-racial paradise. Gates' crime appears to be a new one in the litany of crimes that black folk commit by virtue of their very existence -- in this case, HWB, or housing while black. If a famous and affluent black man in his own home can be accosted, arrested and humiliated, then all black folk can reasonably expect the same treatment. To Gates' credit, he realizes that racial profiling happens regularly to poor black folk, and he has pledged to do something about it. But another famous black figure associated with Harvard must renew his pledge to get rid of racial profiling and spare the nation the illusion that his success represents a post-racial America. While it's not likely he'll be unjustly arrested in his House, he's got to make sure that the same privilege extends to millions of other black folk who don't live on Pennsylvania Avenue. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Eric Dyson.","Michael Eric Dyson: Gates is an eminent intellectual and Harvard professor .

"(CNN) -- A group claiming to be the Indonesian arm of the al Qaeda terrorist network is purportedly taking responsibility for a pair of deadly bombs that exploded within minutes of each other at two luxury hotels in Jakarta. The JW Marriott in Jakarta, Indonesia, which was bombed July 17, is guarded Wednesday. The July 17 blasts at Jakarta's JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels killed nine people, including at least two presumed suicide bombers, and wounded more than 50. On Wednesday, Noordin M. Top -- the suspected leader of a small splinter group of the militant Jemaah Islamiyah, which has ties to al Qaeda -- purportedly issued statements claiming responsibility for the attacks on behalf of ""al Qaeda in Indonesia."" Top purportedly signed the statements posted on radical Islamist Web sites as the head of al Qaeda in Indonesia. CNN could not independently authenticate the statements. One of the statements says the Ritz-Carlton attack was carried out by ""one of our mujahedeen warriors against the American lackeys and stooges visiting the hotel."" ""God has given us a blessing for us to find a way to attack the biggest hotel that America owns in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta -- the Ritz-Carlton, where security was very tight making it very difficult to initiate the attack that we did,"" the statement says. The statement mentions members of Britain's Manchester United soccer team, which had been scheduled to check into the Ritz-Carlton on July 19 but canceled its trip after the bombing. ""Those players are Christians and therefore do not deserve Muslims' money and respect,"" the statement says. The other statement addressed the Marriott attack. It claims that the target in that bombing was Americans with ties to the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industries, known as Kadin. Police say a third bomb had been planted in an 18th floor room of the Marriott two days before the other two bombs exploded. The unexploded bomb -- which was timed to detonate on the upper floor before the first blast tore through the Marriott's lobby area at 7:47 a.m. -- was found and defused, police said.","Group claiming to be ""al Qaeda in Indonesia"" purportedly claims responsibility .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Mandy Moore stepped onto the small stage at Amoeba Records in Hollywood with a quick wave. Mandy Moore, now 25, is following her bliss with her new album, ""Amanda Leigh."" ""Hi, shoppers,"" she giggled somewhat self-consciously. The audience of several hundred, stuffed between the music racks at the landmark store, giggled back. ""This is so weird to be playing here. I live in the neighborhood, and this is where I get my CDs and my DVDs!"" she said. Then she launched into selections from her sixth studio album, ""Amanda Leigh."" Somewhere out of sight was her new husband, Ryan Adams -- the alt-country hero she married in March, after a one-month engagement. It's been 10 years since Moore burst onto the pop scene as a lanky, blonde 15-year-old singing and dancing her way through a sweetly suggestive tune called ""Candy.""  Her musical fare now is more eclectic and stripped down -- even featuring vintage instruments such as the clavinet and melodica.  Watch Moore talk candidly about her new direction Â» . Unlike such early contemporaries as Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson, Moore has gone for cred over commercial success in both her music and movie careers, and it suits her well. There's an authenticity there, as well as a genuine warmth and charm. Moore spoke about her artistic growth, a musical funk, and working with her new husband. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: A friend of mine made an interesting analogy, saying these last two albums of yours (including 2007's folk-leaning ""Wild Hope"") are to your music career what ""Saved!"" was to your movie career, in terms of establishing yourself critically. Mandy Moore: I take that as a compliment. I mean, I sort of feel lucky to have the opportunity to do film stuff and music at the same time, because I love doing both. But ... if you make a move one way with one side of your career, you sort of have to balance it out on the other side. I feel like with the last two records, I have been in control creatively. They are probably more like some of the cooler indie movies that I have been lucky enough to get to do. CNN: You could have continued in the mainstream pop world, like some of the singers you came up with. Moore: I sort of started around the same time as a lot of my contemporaries, like the Britney Spearses and the Christina Aguileras of the world, and they are amazing and everybody is still around and doing their thing. I just never truly felt comfortable with the music that I was singing -- even back then. I mean, I was happy to have the opportunity, but I was still scratching my head, ""Well, there has got to be something else, there has got to be something more."" ... It's just about doing what you are truly passionate about and fighting for that. I could have stayed on the same path that I started on, and who knows what would have happened if I would have found success with that -- or none at all -- but I knew I would not have been happy if I had made that decision. And I'm doing what I love now, and I think that's more important than anything. CNN: The new album is called ""Amanda Leigh,"" which is your real name. So is this kind of a reintroduction to people about who you really are -- a grown-up Mandy Moore? Moore: To be quite honest, even though the record is called ""Amanda Leigh,"" and that is my given name, there wasn't a tremendous amount of thought behind the idea of ""This is the real me. Forget the Mandy Moore stuff. That's kid stuff."" No, it was kind of a simple, almost frivolous decision. My friend Mike Viola [of the Candy Butchers], who I wrote the whole record with, called me Amanda Leigh when we were in the studio all the time. Like ""Amanda Leigh, come on, we've got to get to work!"" And I don't know, it just sort of became synonymous with making the record to me. I had never really owned my name. It was just synonymous with my parents being mad at me. So I was like, ""All right, I'm 25, I'm a woman, I'm an adult. I think I can probably take ownership with that name now and be OK with it."" But I'm still happy to be Mandy at the end of the day. CNN: Well, you can actually change your name even further. You can go by Amanda Adams [her married name] these days. Moore: I'm going to really throw people off and completely change my name. That will be the next record. You know, just to throw a real wrench into the situation. CNN: I'm probably blowing it for you when you check into hotels under names that nobody would expect you to use. Moore: (Glancing over at her husband) Should I give my name? I'll have to change it, but it's time for a new one. I was Cornish Gamehen for a while, which was bizarre. But for the last couple years, I have been Meryl Inch -- however, there is too much of a debacle going on there these days to continue that. So I have to come up with something creative. CNN: What's it like to not be on a major label these days? There must be some freedom attached to it, but then you don't have the big bucks behind you, as well as the whole machinery. Moore: I don't think you need the whole machine, the whole middleman behind you nowadays, like in terms of a big record label giving you a push. ... I think it has allowed me the creative freedom to truly make the kind of music that I want to by being on an indie label. ... I'm much happier with this road. CNN: Was there a period of depression you went through that had you reworking things in your head, and trying to find out who you were? Moore: I think the writing process for the last record, for ""Wild Hope,"" I found myself in a bit of a funk. I don't know if I would necessarily classify it as a depression, but I was definitely in a very deeply, darkly place for me, and I had never really been there before. And there was a lot of investigation and questions bouncing around in my head that I found I could answer by kind of investing myself in music and writing. CNN: I would love to be a fly on the wall in your house, just to see the music that you and Ryan come up with. Moore: There is a lot of music in the house, whether someone is playing it, or there's a record on or something. I've been introduced to a lot of metal in my relationship, which is pretty cool, because my guy is a big metal fan, and it isn't something I would necessarily investigate on my own -- but I do like it. It's just nice to have that truly built-in support system that someone is unbelievably understanding of what you do. CNN: Like a lot of people, I was shocked when I read you and Ryan had gotten married. Moore: Yeah, we sort of snuck it by a lot of people. Pretty handy. That's how we roll. Life is good, and I'm a really lucky girl, and I'm very happy. It's a very exciting time to be 25 years old and truly fulfilled in so many aspects.","Mandy Moore's new album is ""Amanda Leigh,"" her given name .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British airlines have put into effect measures to stop people with swine flu boarding flights in a bid to prevent the virus from spreading further. Medical screening for the swine flu virus has been introduced at many airports. British Airways said there had been a ""very small number of cases"" where people who had checked in with symptoms of H1N1 had been advised not to travel after having medical checks. Virgin Atlantic also said victims would not be allowed to board one of its planes without a fit-to-fly certificate from their doctor or a hospital, though there had been no cases yet. The World Health Organization declared the virus a global pandemic June 11. More than 120 countries have reported cases of human infection. About 98,000 cases have been documented worldwide, with 440 deaths, according to the WHO.  Watch as airlines ban sufferers Â» . With 29 deaths and a huge rise in the number of cases, Britain has the worst swine flu figures in Europe. Eight British schoolchildren remained in hospital in China on Monday after contracting swine flu on a trip to the country, the Foreign Office said. The teenagers were diagnosed with the H1N1 virus in Beijing. More than 50 of their classmates and teachers are also quarantined in a hotel.  Watch as students are quarantined Â» . Medical screening for the swine flu virus has been introduced at many airports around the world for passengers arriving on international flights but there are concerns that many people may not be aware they are infected. Those who do have symptoms have been advised by Britain's health authorities to delay their journeys until the signs have cleared up. ""We have a medical team within the airline as well as a contingency planning group which has met for the past few years to look at the issue of a flu pandemic,"" A British Airways spokeswoman said. ""We have a wide range of contingency plans in place which we can use depending on how the situation may evolve. ""If we have concerns about a customer or the customer is concerned, then we have a 24-hour medical service we can call to give advice to staff. ""They will speak to the customer and an assessment will be made about their fitness to fly. ""There have been a number of cases where we have advised customers not to fly on the basis of their diagnosis or symptoms of H1N1.""  Watch as a CNN reporter is quarantined Â» . BA told CNN Monday though that it was ""business as usual"" and all flights were operating normally. Virgin Atlantic spokesman Paul Charles said: ""If there are signs of something being wrong, be it excessive sneezing or coughing, not looking well, high temperature, then the airport staff can call in a medical team for extra advice. ""If the medical team believe there are reasons not to fly, the passenger will be asked to produce a fit to fly certificate from their doctor or a hospital, and they will be put at our cost on to the next available flight."" Swine flu has spread so rapidly and extensively around the globe that the World Health Organization is changing tactics against the H1N1 virus, including stopping a tally of cases and focusing on unusual patterns. ""At this point, further spread of the pandemic, within affected countries and to new countries, is considered inevitable,"" the WHO said. The counting of all cases is no longer essential because it is exhausting countries' resources, the organization said. ""In some countries, this strategy is absorbing most national laboratory and response capacity, leaving little capacity for the monitoring and investigation of severe cases, and other exceptional events."" Monitoring is still required, the organization urged, but should focus on exceptional patterns. ""Because the numbers of cases have increased in so many countries, it is very hard to keep up,"" Keiji Fukuda, WHO assistant director-general, said earlier this month. Laboratories have been inundated with testing requests and the virus is showing up in most lab tests in countries with major outbreaks, he said. The organization said it will not issue global tables showing confirmed cases for countries that have reported cases, according to the release. However, it will still report on nations that have not had cases so that its presence can be confirmed. ""WHO will continue to request that these countries report the first confirmed cases and, as far as feasible, provide weekly aggregated case numbers and descriptive epidemiology of the early cases."" Meanwhile, governments should should be on the lookout for unusual patterns, the organization said. While most patients have reported mild symptoms, a rise in severe symptoms or respiratory ailments that require hospitalization should be cause for concern, it said. Governments should also pay attention to unusual patterns linked to fatal cases, the WHO said. Any changes in prevailing patterns should be flagged, including a rise in school and job absenteeism, and an increase in visits to the emergency room. An overwhelmed health system may mean there is a rise in severe cases, the organization said.","British airlines stop people with swine flu boarding flights .

"(CNN) -- A pair of Georgia men faced more than a half-hour of skeptical questions from reporters Friday as they defended their claim that they stumbled upon the body of Bigfoot while hiking in a remote North Georgia forest. The thawed body of a creature reputed to be Bigfoot reportedly weighs more than 500 pounds. Introduced by a publicist and beside a man who promoted what turned out to be a fake Bigfoot discovery in 1995, Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer repeatedly said that their claim is not a hoax and that scientific analysis will prove it. ""We were not looking for Bigfoot. ... We wouldn't know what we were doing if we did,"" said Whitton, a police officer on leave after being shot in the hand while making an arrest. ""I didn't believe in Bigfoot at the time. ... But you've got to come to terms with it and realize you've got something special. And that's what it was."" The men say they were hiking in early June when they discovered the body of a 7-foot-7, 500-pound half-ape, half-human creature near a stream. They also claim to have spotted about three similar living creatures -- and showed reporters video stills of what they say is one of those creatures shadowing them through the woods.  Watch report of scientist skeptical of Bigfoot claim Â» . The announcement, which the men first made on the Internet radio show ""Squatch Detective"" several weeks ago, has been greeted with healthy skepticism, even among some Bigfoot enthusiasts. Scientists, including the head of North Georgia College and State University's biology department, have said it's unlikely a tribe of 7-foot-tall creatures would have avoided discovery in a region popular among hikers, hunters and vacationers. Several Web sites have popped up questioning the claim and comparing a photo that the men say is the creature's body inside a freezer to a widely available Bigfoot costume. On Friday, Whitton acknowledged creating a pair of videos posted on the Internet video site YouTube, one in which his brother poses as a scientist and another in which Whitton briefly seems to admit that the body is a fake. ""It seems that the stalkers have busted us in a hoax,"" he says in the video. But then adds, ""we still have a corpse. We just wanted to give you something to do for the weekend."" At Friday's news conference, Whitton first said that no video existed in which he calls the discovery a hoax. But after speaking to Tom Biscardi, the self-described ""Real Bigfoot Hunter"" who has been searching for the creature of legend since 1971, he said the video was made ""to have a little fun with it"" and was originally intended to throw off the ""psychos"" who had stalked him and his family since the men first made their claim. iReport.com: Have you seen 'Bigfoot'? The two also promoted a Web site registered to Whitton on June 16 and said they plan to write a book about their experience. Friday's news conference was held in Palo Alto, California, near the home of Biscardi. About 100 reporters and onlookers attended the event, in a hotel banquet room, including a man who shouted questions while wearing a gorilla suit. Dyer and Whitton said they were carrying a video camera during their hike to film wildlife. They said they handed the body over to Biscardi, who is keeping it at an undisclosed location until a team of scientists can examine it. One of the two photographs the men gave to reporters Friday showed what appears to be the creature's mouth, an effort to disprove allegations that what's in the photo is a costume. ""I want to get to the bottom of it,"" Biscardi said. ""I'll tell you what I've seen and what I've touched and what I've felt, what I've prodded was not a mask sewed onto a bear hide, OK?"" Biscardi acknowledged that he promoted a fake Bigfoot discovery in 1995, saying the woman who claimed to have the body convinced his staff members before he visited her and discovered that she was mentally ill. Alleged Bigfoot sightings have surfaced from time to time for years, dating to at least the 1800s. The most famous was the so-called Patterson film from 1967, which is purported to show a tall, furry, apelike creature walking along, at one point looking over its shoulder at the videographer. Most scientists who have studied the film say there's no way to authenticate it, and many say the creature appears to be a man in a costume. CNN's Doug Gross and Chuck Afflerback contributed to this report.","North Georgia men say they stumbled upon body while hiking in forest .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes, the effects of fame can ripple like a stone dropped in a pond. A YouTube video shows a Minnesota wedding party dancing down the aisle. Take the case of Minnesota residents Kevin Heinz and Jill Peterson. The couple had a fun idea for their wedding party to do a nontraditional procession to a catchy tune, ""Forever"" by Chris Brown. The joyous video of the group busting their loosely choreographed moves down the aisle went viral after the newlyweds posted it on YouTube. Soon they were being deluged by the media and flown to New York to appear on national television. Since then, millions have watched the funky wedding march and helped transform Heinz and Peterson into instant celebrities. Amy Carlson Gustafson, a pop culture reporter for the St. Paul Pioneer Press, reported on the story that she said has not only stirred up the hometown folks, but also showed a different side of Minnesota. ""I think people are loving it,"" she said. ""It's really fun and it's especially fun in Minnesota where a lot of people think we are a bunch of uptight Scandinavians who sit around and say 'You betcha.' This video helps to debunk that a little bit."" That sense of fun and whimsy has enchanted many and led to Heinz and Peterson being sought for interviews by everyone from their local publications to the major networks.  Watch guests at the wedding discuss the experience Â» . But they have apparently also learned quickly about the downside of fame. The New York Post reported the pair was caught in the crossfire of the battle of the morning shows. According to the newspaper, ABC flew Heinz and Peterson to the Big Apple after booking them to appear on ""Good Morning America."" Things soured, the paper's Page Six column reported, after ABC learned the couple had also taped a segment for the rival ""Today"" show, which aired before the couple's appearance on ""Good Morning America."" Adding fuel to the fire was a planned live re-creation of the dance by the wedding party scheduled for Saturday morning on ""Today."" When it appeared that Heinz and Peterson weren't adhering to the age-old ""dance with who brung ya"" rule, their ABC-sponsored hotel and flight home were canceled, the paper said. ""We've been kicked out of our room,"" Heinz told the Post after the incident. ""New York is cutthroat. That's what we've learned."" ""Today"" reportedly stepped in and secured a new room and flight for Heinz and Peterson. Reporter Gustafson said she spoke with mother-of-the-bride Marge Peterson, who said her daughter and new son-in-law were done talking to the media. ""They are not used to this type of publicity,"" Gustafson said. Shane Mercado can relate. The 27-year-old from New York posted a video last year of himself mimicking step-for-step Beyonce's dance moves from her ""Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)"" music video. Mercado said he did it at the suggestion of a friend and before he knew it, he was a YouTube sensation. ""Once I did it I thought 'What did I just do?' "" he recalled. ""The response was overwhelming."" Soon, Mercado was a minor celebrity being asked for autographs and dancing his routine on the ""Bonnie Hunt Show."" ""Extra"" even arranged for him to surprise Beyonce on the red carpet during the premier of her film ""Cadillac Records"" Not only did the superstar singer know who he was, Mercado said, but so did other celebs. ""The actress Gabrielle Union knew who I was,"" Mercado said. ""That just blew me away.' Mercado said he doesn't consider himself famous and finds the notoriety humbling. The loss of anonymity is challenging, he said. Suddenly, the number of people ""in your business"" dramatically increases. He said he can imagine how Heinz and Peterson are feeling: overwhelmed. ""That was their [wedding] and it was probably very private to them,"" Mercado said. ""It can be a bit much to handle and if they were not ready to handle it, then it's not a good thing."" Being sucked into a vortex of whirlwind publicity can be a heady experience, said Atlanta, Georgia-based photographer Ross Oscar Knight. Two years ago, Knight photographed an elaborately staged engagement planned by Robert Gray Jr. to surprise his girlfriend, Keisha Williams. Gray rented 10 rooms at the Ritz-Carlton, Buckhead, and filled them with rose petals, candles, and music. As Gray led Williams to each room, friends and family were waiting with well wishes and prayers, all leading up to his proposal. A slide show of Knight's pictures of the moving event scored millions of hits and crashed several sites linking to it, the photographer said. ""I immediately started getting calls from all over the world,"" Knight said. ""We got an extra phone line because so many calls were coming in."" Not only were people touched, but many also wanted to have their engagements documented, Knight said, so there are sure to be dancing-down-the-aisle videos to come. Knight said Gray and Williams, whose fairy-tale engagement attracted the attention of national publications like Essence Magazine, have married but decided to do so quietly after shutting down a Web site they had started to keep fans updated. ""They did a private ceremony because they didn't want any of that released to the media,"" Knight said. ""I think they got to see stardom and what can happen when there is so much of a focus put on you."" Someone else who has also been thrust into the spotlight, albeit again, is singer Chris Brown, whose song the Heinz-Peterson wedding party danced to. Despite increased demand on iTunes for the single ""Forever"" and speculation by media outlets like Gawker.com that the wedding video could help rehabilitate Brown's image, US Weekly staff editor Lindsay Powers said she doesn't believe all will be forgiven. Brown, who has publicly apologized for assaulting his girlfriend, the singer Rihanna, has a long way to go before the tide of public opinion can be swayed, Powers said. ""I think that Chris Brown has had considerable career damage over these past couple of months,"" she said. ""I think that people are going to say that's a catchy song, they'll go to iTunes and download it to their iPods, but I don't think that because people like the song they are going to like Chris Brown.""","Minnesota couple instant stars after YouTube wedding video goes viral .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama often talks about all of the forces lining up against his health care plan. But there's one critic who has remained relatively mum in the debate. Dr. David Scheiner was President Obama's personal physician for 22 years. David Scheiner, a Chicago, Illinois-based doctor, has taken a hard look at the president's prescription for health care reform and sees bad medicine. ""This isn't that kind of health care program that I think is going to work,"" he said. So what makes Scheiner so special? He was Obama's personal physician for 22 years, and voted for the former Illinois senator in the 2008 presidential election. Scheiner thinks the president's plan doesn't go far enough. In his mind, the worst part of the proposal is that ""private insurers continue to be a part of the health scheme.""  Watch Scheiner talk about his objections Â» . ""Everybody keeps saying we don't want the government involved in health care,"" Scheiner said in an interview. ""But the government is involved in Medicare, and it works."" Scheiner would rather see the nation adopt a single-payer system like the ones in Canada and Europe. The financing system relies on one ""payer"" -- which could be a government-run agency -- to fund all health care costs billed by doctors, hospitals and other health professionals. The benefits, advocates say, is that pricey administrative costs are cut, resulting in large savings to patients. It's something that an up-and-coming coming state Sen. Obama talked about  six years ago. ""I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care plan. ... But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately, because first we've got to take back the White House, and we've got take back the Senate, and we've got to take back the House,"" Obama said in 2003. But that position evolved during the campaign. ""If I were designing a system from scratch, then I'd probably set up a single-payer system. But the problem is we're not starting from scratch,"" Obama said in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in August 2008. Now, the president favors giving Americans the option of joining a government-run plan that would compete with private insurers.  Watch more on the health care debate Â» . ""Nobody is talking about some government takeover of health care. I'm tired of hearing that,"" Obama said in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Thursday. But Scheiner says that nobody has seen the details of that option, making it a hard sell for the president. ""We don't even fully know what the public option is going to be. If the public option is too good, patients who are sick will flock to it, and I'm not sure it will be able to support itself."" Scheiner almost had a chance to confront the president with his concerns. He was invited to a recent televised town hall meeting with Obama, but he says he was dropped from the program. ""I just hope that the Congress, the American public and the president will hear some of my words,"" he said. ""We've got to do something better."" Scheiner finally had a chance to have his say Thursday. He and other doctors who support a single-payer system gathered in Washington to meet with lawmakers and rally supporters. He may not be the president's doctor anymore, but Scheiner says he's trying to save the patient before it's too late. CNN's Ed Hornick and Brittany Cummings contributed to this report.","Dr. David Scheiner says president's health care plan doesn't go far enough .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- An eco-friendly French boat is hoping to successfully cross the perilous Arctic sea passage that links the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific. The old tug-boat, Le Manguier, has been converted into an eco-friendly vessel with three sails and solar panels. ""Le Manguier"" is attempting to navigate the icy, unpredictable Northern Sea Route, a 6,000 mile passage that skims the northern coast of Siberia. It is a trip that only a handful of leisure boats in history have successfully completed. Not only that, the modified tug boat is also attempting to do it ecologically. The boat's crew is relying partly on wind-power to complete the route, parts of which are only free of ice for two short months during the Arctic summer. Three sails have been added to the tug boat, which normally runs on gas-guzzling motors. ""'Le Manguier' was the opposite of the ecological vessel,"" Philippe Hercher, captain and part-owner of the boat told CNN. ""What we wanted to do was create a symbol and show that even this type of boat can diversify its energy sources -- even in the most extreme conditions."" Conditions on the route are treacherous: Vessels that enter its waters at the wrong time can get trapped in thick ice for months in temperatures that go as low as -50C. Ironically for the eco-expedition, it is receding ice levels, thought to be caused by global warming, that has crossing the passage a possibility once again in the last few years. The voyage, which is projected to take about six months, started in the South of France in April and, if they make it through the route successfully, will end in Japan. The crew's other ecological concessions include relying on solar panels for electricity and warm water, using only long-lasting LED light bulbs and eating only organic products during their journey. On-board are seven adults and two children, including a painter, two writers, a scientist and a historian. Currently, the team's primary concern is not the fear of being trapped in ice and being forced to ""hibernate"" in Siberia's frigid temperatures, but getting the required paperwork in time before the approaching colder months, which cause ice to harden in the passage. ""Le Manguier"" is in Tromso, Norway waiting for the green light from the Russian government, which rarely allows non-Russian vessels to enter the passage. Russian reluctance may stem from the time of the Russian revolution in 1917, after which the Soviet Union was isolated from the West. The Northern Sea Route, which is the shortest passage between the West and the Far East, was also the only water the Russians could navigate without possible foreign interference. Luckily, the crew have help from veteran sailors in their race against the clock: Scientist Eric Brossier and sailor and France Pinczon Du Del who successfully sailed the Northern Sea Route during the first ever circumnavigation of the glacial Arctic Ocean in 2002. In the meantime, ""Le Mangier"" is gaining increasing popularity with every port-of-call. The group is publicizing the cause; inviting school children, academics and other tug boat sailors for workshops and tours of the boat. ""The most difficult challenge seems to be convincing hardened tug boat captains to partially switch to wind power,"" said Judith Puzzuoli, who is in charge of communication and press for ""Le Manguier."" ""But change doesn't happen in a day."" Like Puzzuoli, each member of the team is responsible for delivering the message in a different way. Two books, written in the style of travel journals are in the works and a documentary is currently being filmed. Even the children have an important role -- reminding the adults why their mission is important. ""I get the feeling that the two girls are really discovering life on this boat. They are learning to live simply, but beautifully.""","An eco-friendly French boat is attempting to cross the Northern Sea Route .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Security forces in Iran on Thursday confronted thousands of protesting Iranians across the city, first at a cemetery and later at a prayer venue and near a government building, witnesses and news reports said. Mourners gather around the grave of Neda Agh-Soltan in Beheshte Zahra Cemetery. Clashes erupted at the cemetery as two of Iran's main opposition leaders tried to join the several thousand people at a memorial for the slain woman who became the symbol of Iran's post-election violence, witnesses said. The gathering was banned, but participants ignored the government strictures. However, security forces barred opposition leaders Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi from the gravesite of Neda Agha-Soltan, the 26-year-old woman shot in election protests on June 20, witnesses and news reports said. More than 3,000 people were gathered at Agha-Soltan's grave, a witness said. Mourners arrived on the religiously significant 40th day after the fatal shooting in Tehran. For Iranians, a predominantly Shiite Muslim population, the 40th day after a death marks the last official day of mourning. At the cemetery, security forces used tear gas to clear the area of demonstrators and mourners. A witness said riot police and Basij militia were at the scene, but the confrontations with people in the crowd involved the militia.  Watch a report on the memorial clashes Â» . The witness spotted instances of the baton-wielding militia charging the gathering, and said as many as nine beatings were seen. Other people  appeared to have been beaten as they ran from police, the witness said. One of the mourners had a bloody head and one woman said she was struck on the back of the neck. One security force member sustained some sort of injury to the head and was bloodied. It is unclear exactly how that person was injured. A confrontation between women protesters and police also was seen. The women shouted, ""Don't beat up our young people. You, our Muslim brothers. It is a shame to beat up our young people."" The crowd chanted ""Ya Hossein, Mir Hossein,"" the first a reference to the revered Shiite imam and the second a reference to Moussavi. Then there were more chants of ""Allah wa Akbar,"" or God is great. iReport.com: Share your photos, video, stories . Despite reports of arrests, none were seen on the mourning day. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said using force to ""break up a group of people who were trying to exercise an important ritual in Islam, the mourning after 40 days,"" was ""particularly disturbing."" ""We stand by the Iranian people who are exercising their universal right to self-expression and demonstrating peacefully,"" Kelly said. Iran's state-run news agency, IRNA, reported that the mourners ""disrupted the order"" in the city and damaged public and private property and that security forces were merely trying to control the ""illegal activity"" of the group. IRNA also reported that Tehran residents in the area were angry with the constant protests and wanted a stronger response from the security forces. Another witness told CNN that police directing traffic at the cemetery were helpful and friendly, in stark contrast to the riot police and Revolutionary Guard members who were at the gravesites. From the cemetery, the mourners arrived at the Mossalla, a building under construction that is expected to be the main venue of Tehran's Friday prayers, witnesses said. A couple thousand people demonstrated and police worked to disperse the crowd -- which also was defying a ban on such a gathering. ""The police tried to discourage drivers from driving the main highway that would lead to central Tehran, but very few listened,"" one witness said. ""Soldiers standing along the streets flashed the peace sign back at the honking cars with large smiles on their faces. It was obvious the soldiers and police forces were with the people."" Thousands also marched and chanted along a prominent thoroughfare called Vali Asr Street, chanting slogans such as ""Death to the dictator"" amid the honking of car horns, a witness said. Amateur video posted Thursday on several Web sites and submitted to CNN's iReport showed a security officer swinging a baton at a demonstrator. CNN cannot confirm the circumstances of the images. Protesters gathered near the Interior Ministry building and trash cans were set ablaze, another witness said. Police on motorcycles attempted to break up the gathering, and one security officer was seen wielding a gun. Moussavi was the chief challenger of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June presidential elections, which the government said Ahmadinejad won in a landslide but many Iranians think was rigged. Moussavi had said on his Web site that he and fellow reform candidate Karrubi would commemorate Agha-Soltan's death with her mother at the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery. At the cemetery, a witness said a car identical to a vehicle belonging to Moussavi drove through the area. It was not clear if Moussavi was in the vehicle, but people were sitting atop and around the car as if to protect it. The car left the scene. In the days after the June vote, thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest the results. The government cracked down. Hundreds were detained in prison, among them 50 ""political figures"" accused of playing key roles in the street demonstrations that turned violent, Iranian media reported Wednesday. Among those still reportedly detained is Shahpour Kazemi, Moussavi's brother-in-law, according to Moussavi's wife. Others include Behzad Nabavi, a Moussavi ally, and Mostafa Tajzadeh, who served under Iranian President Mohammad Khatami -- a Moussavi supporter -- the Iranian Labor News Agency reported Tuesday.","Security forces confront protesters across Tehran .

"(CNN) -- Lucia Whalen strolled down a sidewalk near Harvard University, enjoying a lunchtime ritual she'd repeated many times in her 15 years working in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But on this day, July 16, her outing would become something else altogether -- the first steps in a national drama. President Obama has invited police Sgt. James Crowley and Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates for beer. An older woman approached Whalen, worried that she'd just witnessed two men breaking into a home. That's when Whalen, a first-generation Portuguese-American, called 911 from her cell phone -- alerting police to 17 Ware St. -- the home, as it turns out, of renowned Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. Whalen's call -- now clearly the well-intentioned act of a passerby -- ignited a firestorm over race and police relations, a national debate that went all the way to the White House. It was a call she says she never expected to be ""analyzed by an entire nation."" Gates was arrested by Cambridge police Sgt. James Crowley for disorderly conduct, a charge that was later dropped. Exactly what happened inside Gates' home may never be known, but it seems clear that the key players in this saga brought their own personal history with race to the moment. That was true of Gates and Crowley, as well as the nation's first African-American president. All three will meet for a beer today at the White House to help chill the furor over Gates' arrest and, in Obama's words, try to turn the events of the past two weeks into a ""teachable moment."" ""White woman"" targeted . It's a bit ironic, said Whalen's attorney Wendy Murphy, that the three people who ""reacted badly"" will sit down together while the ""one person who did not overreact"" will be at work Thursday. ""Maybe it's a guy thing,"" Murphy said, adding of Whalen: ""She doesn't like beer anyway.""  Watch Whalen describe ""painful"" criticism Â» . Gates' arrest sparked heated rhetoric on TV, radio and the Internet. Initially, it seemed to break down along racial lines: African-Americans saw it as racial profiling by a white officer. Whites asked why the acclaimed scholar on black history didn't just show his ID to Crowley at the outset. Wasn't the officer just doing his job? Even Whalen, the Good Samaritan, got smeared in the initial response. The police report identifying her as a ""white woman"" resulted in a torrent of accusations that she racially profiled Gates and his driver when she first called 911. But a review of the call showed she never identified the suspects as ""black"" -- and even told a police dispatcher she wasn't sure it was a break-in. ""The criticism at first was so painful for me. ... I was frankly afraid to say anything,"" Whalen said Wednesday, fighting back tears. ""People called me racist and said I caused all the turmoil that followed, and some even said threatening things that made me fear for my safety."" Whalen is sensitive to the issue of racial profiling, because of her own olive-skinned complexion, her attorney said. Two men; two views . Inside 17 Ware St., Gates and Crowley exchanged words as the officer sought to determine whether Gates belonged in the home. Each blamed the other for a situation that escalated; each felt the other brought prejudices to the moment. Both had personal experience with racial profiling. iReport: Racial profiling, from both sides . Long before his acclaim as a scholar of black history, Gates had faced the prejudice of a white man. Gates was just 14, and had suffered a hairline fracture in his hip. ""The white doctor who examined Gates shortly afterward questioned the boy about his injury as well as his career plans. When the young Gates replied that he wanted to be a doctor and then correctly answered many questions about science, the doctor made his diagnosis,"" according to a biography of Gates posted on Gale, an online research tool. ""He told Gates to stand and walk, and the young boy fell to the floor in intense pain. The doctor then turned to Gates's mother and explained that her son's problem was psychosomatic -- a black boy from Appalachia who wanted to be a doctor in the mid-1960s was an overachiever."" Gates, now 58, walks with a cane as a result. ""The most subtle and pernicious form of racism against blacks [is] doubt about our intellectual capacities,"" he once said. The typically soft-spoken Harvard professor is revered worldwide for being at the fore of African-American issues. His award-winning PBS documentaries have made him one of the most powerful forces of academia, admired by colleagues of all races. At the time of his arrest, Gates had just returned from China, where he had filmed the ancestral cemetery of Grammy-winning cellist Yo-Yo Ma as part of an upcoming series on immigration in America. Gates told CNN's Soledad O'Brien that his arrest was a wake-up call. ""What it made me realize was how vulnerable all black men are -- how vulnerable all people of color are and all poor people to capricious forces like a rogue policeman,"" he said. ""It was the fault of a policeman who couldn't stand a black man standing up for his rights right in his face.""  Watch Gates describe arrest Â» . But those who know Crowley, including African-American colleagues, say not so fast. For years, Crowley taught a racial profiling class at a Massachusetts police academy -- hand-picked by an African-American police commissioner. He also tried to save the life of Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis in 1993 when the black athlete died during an off-season practice. ""I wasn't working on Reggie Lewis the basketball star. I wasn't working on a black man. I was working on another human being,"" he told the Boston Herald. Two black officers on the Cambridge force have stood solidly by their comrade. Sgt. Leon Lashley was outside Gates' house when the professor was arrested. He has no problems with the way Crowley handled the situation. ""It happened to be a white officer on a black man, and the common call a lot of times is to call it a racist situation,"" said Lashley. ""This situation right here was not a racial-motivated situation. ... There's nothing rogue about him. He was doing his job."" Lashley acknowledged that if he, as a black officer, had entered the home first, it likely would've been a different outcome. Kelly King, another African-American Cambridge officer, said she has known Crowley for more than a decade and that he's ""a good police officer, a good man with character.""  Watch black cops stand by Crowley Â» . ""I think Professor Gates has done a very good job of throwing up a very effective smokescreen, calling race into this. It had nothing to do with it,"" she told CNN's Don Lemon with Crowley at her side. She said people who have turned against Crowley need to ""keep their minds open and realize that we would not support someone that we felt wronged someone else. ... We would not support anyone in blue doing the wrong thing."" When she finished speaking, she and Crowley embraced. ""You've got to be touched by that,"" CNN's Lemon said. The officer at the center of the controversy nodded his head, fighting off tears. Obama steps in . A third player ratcheted up the controversy and he, too, brought history to the moment. President Obama entered the fray when he said police ""acted stupidly."" His comments outraged many in law enforcement, and he soon did a mea culpa, saying he could've ""calibrated"" his words differently.  Watch Obama say he helped ratchet up debate Â» . Obama is a friend of Gates. A graduate of Harvard Law School, the president also once studied under Charles Ogletree, the law professor who represents Gates. As state senator in Illinois, Obama pushed for a racial profiling bill in 2003. According to the Chicago Tribune, the bill created a means for police to track the race of drivers stopped for traffic infractions over a period of years. In his 2006 book ""The Audacity of Hope,"" Obama said his status insulated him from the ""bumps and bruises"" of the typical black man in America. But, he said, ""I can recite the usual litany of petty slights that during my 45 years have been directed my way: security guards tailing me as I shop in department stores, white couples who toss me their car keys as I stand outside a restaurant waiting for the valet, police cars pulling me over for no apparent reason."" ""I know what it's like to have people tell me I can't do something because of my color, and I know the bitter swill of swallowed-back anger."" As the three men sit down together at the White House, there are many lessons to be drawn from this most teachable moment. Not the least of which might be that race is still a major factor in perceptions, and misperceptions. As for Whalen, she says she would still make that 911 call if she had it to do over again. ""I would hope people would learn not to judge others,"" she said. She added, ""I was just trying to get lunch.""","Harvard professor, Cambridge cop, Obama to sit down for beer at White House .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ten members of an international smuggling ring have been arrested and charged with paying more than $500,000 in bribes to smuggle millions of dollars in fake designer goods from China to the United States, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Authorities say a sting targeted a smuggling ring pushing counterfeit goods through a New Jersey port. The defendants were expected to appear Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas. The counterfeit goods included designer jeans, Nike shoes, Burberry and Chanel handbags, and Polo and Baby Phat clothing, according to a news release from the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. The estimated value of the genuine versions of the goods would be more than $200 million, prompting U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia to describe the case as ""one of the largest counterfeit smuggling cases ever brought in United States history."" The suspects arrested Wednesday are accused of smuggling or attempting to smuggle scores of 40-foot-long shipping containers through the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal in Elizabeth, New Jersey, since June 2006. The Chinese-made knockoffs were placed in containers with false bills of lading, which are the shipping documents used to determine a cargo's point of origin and destination. ""One bill of lading claimed a container held 'noodles,' when in fact it contained counterfeit Nike sneakers,"" the news release said. After the bogus goods cleared inspection at the New Jersey port, they were transported to New York-area warehouses, where they awaited distribution to retail customers. According to the news release, the bribes were paid directly to an undercover agent whose ""near-daily"" conversations with the suspects were secretly recorded or monitored. The undercover agent posed as a ""corrupt longshoreman's union official, stationed at Port Newark, who had the ability to clear imported cargo through the United States customs and border security measures without detection or seizure,"" the news release said. The 10 suspects are charged with conspiring to smuggle goods into the U.S., smuggling goods into the U.S. and trafficking in counterfeit goods, the news release states. If convicted, they face up to 35 years in prison, at least $2.5 million in fines and an obligation to pay restitution to the manufacturers of the genuine versions of the goods. Among those arrested in the sting were Robin Huff, 46, of New York, a federally licensed customs broker who is accused of using a Customs and Border Patrol database to help push goods through the port. Also arrested were Chi On Wong, 36, and Man Wai Cheng, 34, both of New York, who operated a Brooklyn-based trucking company, KT Express Inc. Authorities allege Wong and Cheng charged smugglers a premium to transport goods around the New York area. On Wednesday, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents raided a house in Brooklyn used as KT Express' base of operations and three other locations. Federal agents seized $80,000 in cash and two KT Express trucks allegedly used in the operation, the news release said.

"(CNN) -- Actor and producer Anil Kapoor has long been a Bollywood luminary, but after his award-winning performance in global hit ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" he is set to become an international star. Bollywood superstar Anil Kapoor. Kapoor says that ""Slumdog,"" a love story about a boy from a Mumbai slum who wins a fortune on quiz show ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?,"" resembles his own life story. ""I also started from scratch, went from rags to riches,"" he told CNN. Anil is part of the Kapoor family that is a veritable Bollywood dynasty. His father Surinder and elder brother Boney are film producers, his daughter Sonam, sister-in-law Sridevi and his younger brother Sanjay are actors, while son-in-law Sandeep Marwah is a movie magnate and Anil's son Harshvardhan is currently learning to direct movies in Los Angeles. But things weren't always so glamorous. Anil Kapoor was born on Christmas Eve 1959 and grew up in a tenement in the Mumbai suburb of Chembur, with eight people living together in a single room. His father Surinder had yet to make his name in the film industry, but young Anil clearly had movies in his blood. ""In my childhood I was surrounded by films, actors, film makers, directors and film talk. I would bunk school to watch movies,"" he said. He was cast in his first movie aged just seven. Although the film was never released, the experience was enough to convince Kapoor that his future lay in the movies. After finishing school he went to St Xavier's College, where he acted in plays and won the Best Actor trophy at an inter-collegiate competition, before being expelled for non-attendance. Kapoor responded by enrolling in acting classes and taking singing and dance lessons. He made his Bollywood debut in 1979's ""Hamare Tumhare,"" before moving on to Telugu-language movie ""Vamsa Vriksham"" in 1980, and landing his first Bollywood starring role in 1983's ""Woh 7 Din."" Watch Anil Kapoor take CNN on a tour of Mumbai. Â» . Kapoor first met future wife Sunita Bhambhani in 1979, when she was a successful model and he was still a struggling actor. He decided that he would propose marriage as soon as he got his big break and 1984's ""Mashaal"" was the opportunity he'd been waiting for. Kapoor's performance won him Best Supporting Actor at India's prestigious FilmFare awards and he married Sunita in May of that year. Kapoor cemented his status a Bollywood idol after starring in the hugely successful ""Mr India,"" which promptly became his nickname among a growing legion of fans. He has gone on to become one of the biggest names in Indian cinema, picking up a total of five FilmFare awards and a National Film Institute Best Actor award for his role in 2000's ""Pukar."" Following in his father's footsteps, Kapoor made his debut as a producer in 2002, with the comedy ""Badhaai Ho Badhaai,"" and he went on to produce ""Gandhi, My Father,"" which portrayed the fractious relationship between Mohandas Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal. For years now, in his home town of Mumbai Kapoor has been mobbed by fans wherever he goes, instantly recognizable by his trademark mustache, which he has proudly sported in all but three of his hundred-plus movies. But like most Bollywood stars, he received little acclaim outside India. That changed abruptly and unexpectedly with the release of low-budget British movie ""Slumdog Millionaire."" The film has become an international sensation, winning four Golden Globe awards and receiving an astonishing 10 Oscar nominations. See Anil Kapoor's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" success in photos. Â» . Kapoor's role as the creepy quiz show host earned him a share in the Screen Actors Guild award for Best Cast. In typically modest fashion, Kapoor dedicated the award to the film's child actors. ""They deserve this award"" he said during his acceptance speech. ""It's the children who've done it, not us."" Kapoor remains proud of his roots, visiting his childhood neighborhood every year, and he is grounded enough to be aware of the social problems in Mumbai. He is a goodwill ambassador for Plan India, an organization that helps street children, and he donated his entire ""Slumdog"" fee to the cause. As he prepares to travel to Britain for the Bafta awards and to Los Angeles for the Oscars, Mr India remains characteristically self-effacing. ""I feel so humble and grateful. I never expected the film to be so huge and successful,"" he said. Whether he's accepting awards in Hollywood or making movies for Bollywood, Kapoor seems sure to keep his feet on the ground.","Bollywood star Anil Kapoor played the quiz show host in ""Slumdog Millionaire""

"(CNN) -- Italian champions Inter Milan have unveiled new signing Samuel Eto'o, with the Cameroon striker immediately being forced to deny suggestions from the Italian media that he has ever had a problem with new coach Jose Mourinho. Samuel Eto'o parades his new Inter Milan jersey after completing his move from Barcelona. Eto'o, who completed his switch from Barcelona on Monda, denied he has issues with Portuguese coach Mourinho and insists he never insulted his team's style of play after a Champions League match between Barca and Chelsea. ""I never said those words that were attributed to me,"" he told a press conference. ""There is also a tape which proves it and, in any case, that was after an intense game. Top 20 summer transfer targets . ""Now I am happy to be here, for me it is a great honor to play for a coach like Jose. It has been years that I have been trying to play under Mourinho and I have never managed it."" Mourinho also laughed off suggestions the pair do not see eye to eye, insisting they have very similar personalities. ""I have met Samuel six times in three years, and I never cared to know if he really said something not very nice about me,"" said the Nerazzurri coach. ""Why? Because he is like me: after losing an important match he doesn't go home happy. The year after this game I wanted to take him to Chelsea, but I wasn't allowed to. I am very happy to have him with us and I'm not talking only as Jose Mourinho but on behalf of the whole squad. Eto'o has signed a five-year contract with Inter as part of a swap deal that saw Zlatan Ibrahimovic move the other way. Inter will also receive 45 million euros ($64m) but the 28-year-old, who only had a season left on his contract with Barca, has shrugged off suggestions this proves Ibrahimovic is the more highly rated of the two. ""Ibra is a great player but I am Samuel Eto'o and my past and my victories talk for me,"" said Eto'o. ""I don't like parallels being drawn. ""I believe the victories I have earned until now can contribute to giving my name the right value."" Eto'o scored 125 goals in 144 games for Barcelona, firing them to a string of titles, including three leagues, two Champions Leagues and a Copa del Rey success, in his five seasons with the club. Eto'o has spent his entire career in Spain since leaving Cameroon in 1997, playing for Real Madrid, Leganes, Espanyol, Mallorca and Barcelona. However, he expects he will adapt easily to the Serie A style. ""It's true I have always played in Spain but I have great experience of international matches,"" continued Eto'o. ""Here in Serie A there are big players because great players are in teams where they know they will be able to win things. I am here because it is a very competitive league. ""It's true Ibra and Kaka have left Italy, but there are lots of great players in Italy and I am convinced I have made the best choice.""","Inter Milan unveil Samuel Eto'o after he completes his transfer from Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Fans of Usher Raymond IV view him as a singing, dancing and acting superstar. Superstar performer Usher Raymond IV at the closing ceremony for Usher's Camp New Look. But to a special group of young people, he is a mentor and a friend. ""He leads by example,"" said Arnold ""Supa"" LaFrance, a ""Mogul in Training"" at Usher's Camp New Look. ""Usher's all about peace and love and giving back to the community, and it's genuine. He does it when the cameras are on and when the cameras are off."" Now in its fifth year, the camp is a passion for the Grammy Award-winning artist, who each year gives more than a hundred teens from underserved communities across the country the opportunity to learn about the entertainment and sports industries. Thomas Springer, a 17-year-old Atlanta, Georgia, resident, has participated in the camp for four years and said he wants to use his talent in filmmaking and what he has learned at Camp New Look to help his community. ""Before I came to camp, I didn't think I had a voice in my community and that I could do anything based on my age,"" Springer said. ""The camp let me know that no matter what your age, no matter what you do, you can make an impact on your community."" Usher came to fame as a teen and has sold millions of records, including the hit singles ""Yeah"" and ""Confessions II."" His success has allowed him to become part owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team and to launch his own line of fragrances for men and women. The camp, the singer said, teaches participants the business aspects of the entertainment and sports industries and imparts the importance of being service-oriented. A selection committee selects campers that are nominated by partner organizations in various cities across the country. Now the father of two young boys, Usher said he is also enriched by the camp's experience. ""It makes me a better man. It makes me a better individual,"" he said. ""There's a difference between hard work and heart work, and this would represent heart work.""  Watch Usher talk about his camp Â» . As a youngster, Usher participated in the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and he said it helped shape his ideas about mentoring. ""I think that the Boys & Girls Club is a very positive environment for kids,"" he said. ""It's another place that allows you to be a product of your experience. I encountered a lot of people who became mentors for me there."" At this year's closing ceremony for Usher's Camp New Look, held at the Alliance Theater at Woodruff Arts Center in Atlanta, the energy level was high as campers and their family members walked a red carpet alongside some of Usher's celebrity friends, including NBA star Alonzo Mourning and San Francisco 49er Allen Rossum. The free, residential camp held for two weeks every summer in Atlanta is an outgrowth of Usher's New Look Foundation, which he established to empower at-risk youth by giving them the skills necessary to enter careers in the sports and entertainment industries and working with them to provide employment opportunities. Mourning said Usher is one who understands that ""to whom much is given, much is required."" ""The service that Usher is providing for these kids with these educational opportunities and expanding their lives to a whole new level, it's important that we all rally around these particular causes and support these initiatives,"" Mourning said. Gabrielle Brou, 16, a first-year camper from Ocean Springs, Mississippi, who aspires to be an actress, said there were countless opportunities at camp to network with successful people who are living the lives she hopes to achieve. ""Once I found out that there were ways I could better myself in acting, learn the business and also give back ... I decided that this camp would be really great for me,"" she said. ""I would love to do it again next year."" Having a day set aside for the campers and their families to revel in all that they have achieved and their future possibilities left Usher with a huge smile on his face. ""It's really good to see them be able to live out their dreams,"" he said.","Usher's Camp New Look helps kids from underserved communities .

"(CNN) -- Anne and Michael Harris were an ""extraordinary"" couple with a zest for life, their niece said. Anne and Michael Harris' niece says the couple ""loved life, loved everyone."" ""We truly hope that they are remembered for the way they lived their lives and not this tragic end,"" Charlstie Laytin said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ""We're all just devastated and going to miss them both so much."" The Harrises were two of three Americans on board Air France Flight 447 when it crashed Monday. The plane was carrying 228 passengers and crew from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France, when it crashed four hours into the journey. Investigators have not determined the cause of the accident. An official list with the victims' names was not available Wednesday afternoon. The Harrises lived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Anne Harris' sister, Mary Miley, said. Michael Harris, 60, was a geologist in Rio de Janeiro. He worked for Devon Energy, a U.S.-based independent natural gas and oil producer, a company spokesman said. The couple were traveling to Paris for a training seminar and vacation, Miley said. The two ""loved everyone, they loved life,"" Laytin said. ""Definitely glass-half-full kind of people,"" she added, recalling her uncle as a ""ham,"" who could always offer a laugh on a bad day. She remembered a moment a few summers ago when her family was in Vermont, and had just seen a classical performance of Mozart. They were ""just sitting around and having a glass of wine, and laughing and talking about family and life and what was going on in our lives ... [the Harrises] could never get enough information about what all their nieces and nephews and family members were doing,"" she said. ""It's really the last time I can remember us all sitting around as a family and I'm so glad that I have that memory."" She said her family was hopeful the investigation would soon determine what had gone wrong. ""I think the initial shock of it all has really started to wear off, and the reality that they're gone is starting to set in,"" she said. ""The grief and the grieving process is beginning and we're just really focused on helping each other heal."" The majority of the people on the flight came from Brazil, France and Germany. The remaining victims were from 29 other countries. Ten were employees of French electrical equipment supplier CGED, according to Agence France-Presse. Nine of those employees had won the trip to Rio from CGED because of their strong work performance, AFP said. ""There was a competition for the best sales reps ... and nine of them won and went to Brazil for four days,"" Laurent Bouveresse, CGED chief executive, told AFP. The nine were allowed to take a friend or partner, and an executive also went along, Bouveresse said, according to the news agency. CNN tried repeatedly to reach representatives of CGED.

"RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (CNN) -- The office of Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas has a bank of six flat-screen televisions covering most of one wall, showing all the main international English-language news channels, and several local ones besides. Major General Athar Abbas addresses a news conference in Rawalpindi on April 28, 2009. This is one of the rooms where Pakistan's media war is being fought, and Abbas, the Pakistan army's main spokesman, is a key part of the battle. I kid with him that CNN isn't among the channels on his screens, and he seems slightly hurt, insisting it is. He's right and I'm wrong -- CNN was on a commercial break. In fact, I rather get the impression Abbas, who has become the face of the army's operation against Taliban militants in the Swat Valley, watches our coverage closely. One of his subordinates complains about one of our reports -- not the accuracy, but something in the general tone. Perhaps CNN has been just a little too questioning of the army's daily press releases, which claim hundreds of enemy fighters killed, and tightly controlled media trips. Whatever Abbas thinks of CNN, he is more than willing to explain how the Pakistan army sees the broad picture as it fights in the Swat Valley. The current conflict there is intricately linked to the situation in Afghanistan, in his view. He sees Swat as a political problem, which can only be partially solved by military intervention. He claims many of the Taliban's arms are coming across the border from Afghanistan. I ask if that includes NATO weapons, as suggested in recent reports, and he agrees. He says Washington is too focused on the safety of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. The United States should ""stop worrying about the nukes and start worrying about the weapons lost in Afghanistan,"" he says. A U.S. government report last month warned that the Pentagon did not have ""complete records"" for about one-third of the 242,000 weapons the United States had provided to the Afghan army, or for a further 135,000 weapons other countries sent. The Afghan army ""cannot fully safeguard and account for weapons,"" the Government Accountability Office found. I ask how well armed the Taliban are, and he says they are ""very well equipped from the border area."" He also conspiratorially suggests they also are getting weapons and support from ""foreign intelligence agencies."" When I ask what that means, he smiles and says he can't elaborate -- declining to repeat the speculation in the press here that India, Pakistan's traditional rival, may be somehow involved in stirring up trouble on Pakistan's northwestern border. India denies that. But the very suggestion plays to a military strategist's nightmare scenario -- the Pakistan army bogged down in the northwest, unable to focus on the disputed province of Kashmir, a key element of its conflict with India. The military wants to get done in Swat as soon as possible, but the general acknowledges its troops will be there for some time. He estimates that 10 to 15 percent of the Taliban there are foreign fighters: ""Well-trained Arabs, Afghans, with a sprinkling of central Asians and North Africans."" He also says there are Yemenis, Saudis and Uzbeks fighting, as Pakistan has become the destination du jour of the international jihadist, with Arabs in commanding positions and the other foreign fighters bringing in expertise. He thinks that perhaps Mingora, the main town at the gateway to the Swat Valley, may be secured in 48 hours, but it may be much, much longer before the area is totally pacified. ""First you have to disarm the Taliban and then re-establish the writ of government,"" he says. He admits that Swat and neighboring Bajur Districts ""were lost to the state"" and that now ""we are paying in blood for areas we had already occupied."" Now, he says, the army is set for a long fight. ""We are prepared for that -- we are mentally prepared."" But they are also prepared for the conflict to be taken to other parts of Pakistan. A building belonging to the country's powerful intelligence agency, the ISI, was bombed in Lahore this week. The Taliban claimed they carried out the attack and Abbas says the security services expect more attacks. Just hours after I left him, his fears were confirmed, as details came in of more bombings in Peshawar. And then there is also the risk of the Taliban using the mass exodus of civilians from the Swat Valley as cover to penetrate other towns and cities. Already almost 3 million people have flooded out of what was once a tranquil tourist destination, and the military fears that among the mass movement of humanity there will be those plotting to strike at the heart of Pakistan's cities. ""It's a very big issue -- a serious concern,"" Abbas says. He describes the conflict in Swat as ""an existential threat"" -- a fight for the very existence of Pakistan in its current form. And he seems acutely aware that the portrayal of that conflict to the West will be critical.","Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas says Taliban's arms coming across border from Afghanistan .

"(AOL Autos) -- There is no easy cure for teenage traffic deaths and injuries, but Susan Kessler believes she has at least come up with a way to help limit the carnage: When a new driver gets behind the wheel, just slap a temporary warning sign on the car. The Caution and Courtesy Driver Alliance volunteers hand out the magnets during 2008 publicity campaign. Kessler has developed signs for teens with learner permits and first-year licenses. They are attached magnetically to the car's sheet metal and display the words ""Caution Newly Licensed."" It's not hard to imagine the signs being a nightmare to teens obsessed with what their peers think. But, Kessler, a Kennesaw, Georgia, mother of six, says the real horror is out on the highway: thousands of young people are killed and injured in traffics every year. More than 15,000 of people have ordered the signs since Kessler and a group of other moms introduced them four years ago. Parents can mount one on the trunk when a teenager takes off in the family car and remove it when he or she returns home. Once other drivers see it, they presumably exercise extra caution and create a ""protective bubble"" around the new driver, or so the thinking runs. AOL Autos: Rules for safe driving . Kessler would even like to see states require the use of the signs for new drivers, as some European countries do, and she has found some support for this in the Georgia legislature. Her goal is straightforward: limit teenagers' capacity to do damage to themselves and others. Drivers 16 to 19 years old are four times as likely as older drivers to end up in a collision, all other things being equal, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). All U.S. states have adopted tougher licensing systems since the mid-1990s, generally requiring more supervised hours of driving and imposing more restrictions on new licensees. But they have all stopped short of setting the minimum driving age at 18, as most European countries do. The latest research has confirmed that putting restrictions on young drivers does pay off in lower accident, injury and fatality rates. One IIHS study over 10 years found that states with strong licensing laws had 30 percent fewer fatalities among 15 to 17 year olds than states with weak laws (those lacking restrictions on cell phone use, for example, or having only minimal restrictions on nighttime driving during the first year of driving). AOL Autos: Most common car related injuries . Armed with a decade of data, activists like Kessler now see a chance to save more lives with further reform. ""My first fear for each of my sons is, 'Please don't let anybody hit them,'"" she said. ""My second fear is that they might hit anyone else."" ""Do you have any idea what it is like to be the parent of a 16-year-old who has killed someone?"" she asked. ""Parents have called me and said it's like living in a black hole."" Her campaign started four years ago when she started to worry about her son Donnie, even though his turn at driver training was still a few years down the road. The fact that nearby Atlanta ranked as one of the most congested cities in the country naturally fed her fears. She and a group of friends began to think about ways to give young drivers an edge. They didn't want to force teenagers to wait until they were 21 to drive. But they did want to help them stay safe while they were learning. AOL Autos: Teen driving tips . The moms came up the idea for magnetic signs, only later discovering that a similar approach is a requirement for new drivers in parts of Europe, Kessler said. Once, when she proposed the idea to a Georgia state official, he asked her if there was anyone who didn't like it. She laughed and said, ""Yes, my son. But we can work on him."" But she is happy the other people can readily identify new drivers and give them plenty of room. ""And whenever you are being watched, your behavior tends to be a little better."" Since they can easily spot teenagers right out of driver's education, police can enforce restrictions on the number of passengers allowed in their cars, she said. Many states restrict the number of occupants for six months or a year in the second phase of their graduated license programs. ""When you are learning how to drive, you need all your concentration and you can't be cool for all your friends,"" Kessler said. Skeptics argue that teenage drivers will pull the signs off as soon as they are out of their parents' sight. But Kessler has an answer for the skeptics: If parents ever found out a son or daughter did that, it should be the last time they ever drove the family car. One early success for the ""newly licensed"" signs was a pilot program in Cobb County, Georgia, in 2007; Kessler and her friends distributed more than 3,000 magnets. She now sells them nationally at cost, for $7.99, through a Web site, newlylicensed.com, and is looking for a national retail outlet to handle them. She has also been a guest on television programs to promote the magnets. Kessler also advocates longer periods of supervised driving for new drivers, contending they should be at least 400 hours. Accidents only start to decline after drivers get that amount of driving experience under their belts, she said. AOL Autos: Teen drivers need better training . Many experts agree the quickest way to save lives would be to raise the driving age from 16 to 17 or higher. ""But it's a tough sell,"" said Russ Rader, a spokesman for Arlington, Virginia-based IIHS. The states could withhold a provisional license until 17. But so far, only New Jersey does that, offering new drivers a full license at 18. ""But New Jersey has had a very positive experience with it,"" Rader said. There are other options, too. More states could impose tougher restrictions: less nighttime driving, a ban on cell phones (if they haven't already prohibited them), and fewer passengers allowed in the car. Right now, states are all over the map on these issues. For example, Illinois has a cell phone restriction for the first year, while Montana and Idaho do not. Montana only allows one passenger unrelated to the driver the first six months of the provisional period but allows three for the second. During the entire probationary year, New Jersey allows only one person who isn't part of the driver's household in the car. AOL Autos: Risky teen driving habits . North Carolina enforces a fairly tough nighttime restriction, 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., while Florida prohibits driving between 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. The rule is more lenient in Texas: Driving is permitted anytime except midnight to 5 a.m. Other countries aren't squeamish about placing nationalized limitations on young drivers. For example, the United Kingdom requires drivers to be at least 17. The age is 18 in most other European countries. A movement is underway in Australia to more than quadruple the period of supervised driving to 120 hours. New Swiss drivers have to post a warning sign on the vehicles they drive, as do young drivers in New Zealand. Some countries requiring the warnings have even put teeth into their signage laws: Drivers who collide with a car displaying the new-driver signs face heavy fines or even jail time, Kessler said. That's an indication that the signs are important tools to reduce accidents. ""We aren't going to save every kid,"" Kessler said. ""We are rational about this. But if we save at least some of them, it's worth it.""","Research finds putting restrictions on young drivers lowers accident rates .

"(AOL Autos) -- There are two good ways to buy your new car or truck at a reasonable low price and avoid all of the negotiating games and hassles: . 1. Buy through the Internet . Buying your new or used car or truck through the Internet is the easiest and most hassle-free way to make the purchase. All you have to do is choose the vehicle brand and model you wish to purchase as well as provide some basic contact information such as your name and e-mail address. In return, you'll receive - via e-mail - low bottom-line selling prices from dealerships in your area for the exact vehicle you want to buy. Compare the various selling prices and find the lowest one. Then, simply go direct to that dealership's Internet Department, sign the papers and drive your new car home - no negotiating, no hassles. To begin the process, get your free price quotes from AOL Autos. It only takes a few minutes. This service is totally free and you are under no obligation or pressure to buy. AOL, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner. Within 24 hours, you'll receive your bottom-line selling prices from dealerships in your area. Once you've compared the various prices and found the lowest one, you then have four good options: . â¢ You can go to the dealership that gave you the lowest price, sign the papers and drive your new car home -- no hassles, no negotiating. AOL Autos: Best deals of the month . â¢ You can try to negotiate the lowest price with the dealership in order to get the price even lower. There's nothing that says you can't. AOL Autos: Aggressive car buying tactics . â¢ You can shop the lowest price around to other dealerships to see if any of them are willing to beat it. AOL Autos: Which dealers treat you best? â¢ You can do nothing. If you feel unsure or uncertain, then set it aside for a while. You are not obligated to buy anything you don't want. By getting these low bottom-line selling prices via the Internet, you're avoiding the car salesman's entire negotiating game altogether. And you're buying your car at about the same price you would expect after lengthy negotiations. It's certainly the fastest and easiest way to beat the car salesman. AOL Autos: New rules to car buying . 2. Buy through the dealership's Fleet Department . Almost every dealership has a division called the ""Fleet Department."" It usually consists of only a handful of salespeople who specialize in selling fleets of cars -- large orders of several vehicles direct to businesses. This department is authorized by the dealership to sell their cars at bottom-line non-negotiable prices. The prices they offer are about the same as you would expect from an online price quote or after lengthy negotiations. A secret of the car business is that many dealerships' Fleet Departments also sell direct to the public. By the rules of the game, however, they can't advertise to the public since they don't want to compete with the dealership's retail sales team. So to buy from the Fleet Department, you have to specifically ask. To buy your vehicle direct from the dealership's Fleet Department, simply call the dealership and ask to speak with the Fleet Manager. When you get him on the line, explain to him that you're ready to buy a car and you'd like to buy it from him. If he asks you what business you are associated with, tell him where you work. He'll probably be happy to set up an appointment with you. When you arrive at the dealership, the Fleet Manager will show you the vehicle, allow you to test drive it, and then bring you to the office to discuss price. With absolutely no negotiations, he'll offer you a reasonable bottom-line non-negotiable selling price for the vehicle. If the price he gives you falls within the pre-set limits of your buying goal and you're satisfied with the deal, then you can buy the car. No pressure, no games, no hassles. If for some reason, you don't want to buy the vehicle, you are under no obligation. Simply thank the salesman for his time and leave on good terms. Then, if you'd like, you can visit (or call) the Fleet Departments of other dealerships to compare prices.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia has had its first death from swine flu, its Ministry of Health said Monday, bracing for more. The patient -- a 30-year-old man who lived in the country's Eastern Province -- was admitted to a hospital in the city of Dammam on Wednesday with a high fever, cough and shortness of breath. He died Saturday. Saudi Arabia has diagnosed more than 230 cases of the H1N1 virus this year. In the past few weeks, a debate about the virus has erupted in the Middle East. Of particular concern is how to keep it from spreading among the millions of visitors expected in Saudi Arabia during this year's Hajj -- a pilgrimage required of Muslims at least once in their lives. On Wednesday, Arab health ministers held an emergency summit in Cairo, Egypt, to discuss the issue. Guidelines were issued, banning various groups from participating in this year's Hajj -- children under 12, adults over 65 and people with chronic diseases. Saudi Arabia recommended that pregnant women stay home as well. At the close of the meeting, Saudi Health Minister Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah told CNN that, in all, Saudi Arabia had issued 15 recommendations to help ensure the safety and health of pilgrims participating in the Hajj. ""The most important of those is, first of all, that they should take the seasonal flu vaccine two weeks prior to Hajj,"" Al-Rabeeah said. Even with the guidelines in place, World Health Organization spokesman Dr. Ebrahim el Khordany acknowledged that it won't be easy keeping potential pilgrims away. El Khordany told CNN, ""It was discussed in detail how it's going to be worked out between the country and Saudi Arabia to find out the best way to do it and, of course, to make sure that people don't try to use their connections to get their visas or to get to go to Saudi, because people are really very keen to go to the pilgrimage."" The Saudi government has also said it will set up quarantine centers at airports as another preventative measure.","30-year-old man dies in hospital after suffering high fever, cough, shortness of breath .

"(CNN)  -- The search continued Tuesday for as many as 67 people missing after a boat carrying about 200 Haitians capsized, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted this crowded boat last week and repatriated its occupants to Haiti. The boat overturned Monday off Turks and Caicos, a British territory about 550 miles southeast of Miami, Florida. Searchers aboard boats and aircraft have rescued 118 passengers and found 15 bodies, said Petty Officer Jennifer Johnson, a Coast Guard spokeswoman, on Tuesday morning. The Coast Guard described the boat's occupants as migrants from Haiti. The overcrowded vessel was believed to have set sail from the Haitian port of Cap Haitien, the Turks and Caicos Sun newspaper reported. The search resumed at dawn Tuesday after being suspended because of darkness Monday night, Johnson said. The Coast Guard is contributing one boat, the 210-foot cutter Valiant, and three aircraft to the search, Johnson said. The aircraft are a Falcon jet out of Miami, an HH-60 helicopter and a slow-flying C-130 cargo plane out of Clearwater, Florida.  Watch Coast Guard rescue Haitians after boat capsizes Â» . ""If the weather and conditions are right, [the C-130] can fly really low,"" Johnson said. ""It makes a fantastic search aircraft."" Turks and Caicos authorities are using small boats in the search, she said. About 70 people were plucked Monday from a reef near the island group, authorities said. Four other bodies were found, though it was unclear which authorities located them. A nurse at Myrtle Rigby Hospital in the Turks and Caicos said that about 70 people were brought there, including four who had died. Five people were admitted to the hospital, and the others had minor injuries, the nurse said. The Coast Guard said it intercepted another ""grossly overloaded"" boat, with 124 Haitians aboard, late last week in the same region. Those migrants were returned to Cap Haitien on Monday. Overloaded vessels can quickly lose stability and capsize, sending migrants into the water, a Coast Guard release said. CNN's Jim Kavanagh and Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.","NEW: 15 confirmed dead after boat capsizes; as many as 67 missing .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A rarely seen portrait of Michael Jackson is on display inside a Harlem luxury car dealership. Macky Dancy, a partner at Dancy-Power Automotive, said the oil painting titled ""The Book"" is believed to be the only portrait for which Jackson sat. The oil painting titled ""The Book"" is on display at Dancy-Power Automotive in Harlem, New York. A different portrait of the entertainer was among items auctioned from his Neverland Ranch in April. It is not clear whether Jackson sat for that painting. The painting on display in Harlem belongs to Marty Abrams, a friend and customer of the owners of the high-profile dealership. The 40-inch by 50-inch portrait, by Australian painter Brett Livingstone-Strong, sold for $2.1 million in 1990. Abrams acquired it as part of an unrelated business deal in 1992 and had it stored. The painting shows Jackson sitting in Renaissance-era clothes and holding a book. Jackson sat for the portrait because he was a friend of Livingstone-Strong's. The painting was unveiled at the Dancy-Power Automotive Group showroom on Thursday but was removed Friday because of crowd concerns. It returned to the showroom floor Monday morning. Dancy said the painting's owner chose the showroom because it's near the Apollo Theater in Harlem, where the Jackson 5 won their first taste of fame by winning Amateur Night in 1967. He said Abrams hopes the painting in some way can raise money for charities in the Harlem neighborhood. Dancy said Abrams is not necessarily interested in selling the portrait. When news broke about the resurfacing of the painting, Dancy said, he received a phone call from representatives of Livingstone-Strong, the artist. Now, Dancy said, ""We are in the middle of possibly putting together the artist with the painting again. Maybe for some auctions or charitable shows or something of the sort."" The showroom features Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and other pricey cars and is famous for its celebrity clientele.","Oil painting said to be the only portrait for which Michael Jackson sat .

"(CNN) -- Officials recommended that more than 70,000 residents of the East Texas town of Bryan evacuate Thursday after a fertilizer warehouse caught fire, sending thick clouds of orange, toxic smoke into the air. City officials say they are worried the burning fertilizer could irritate skin and lungs. Another 10,000 residents of surrounding Brazos County were also included in the evacuation recommendation, officials said. City Manager David Watkins said 10 people were taken to a hospital with respiratory problems. Residue from the burning fertilizer ammonium nitrate can irritate skin and lungs. Smoke from the smoldering El Dorado Chemical Co. warehouse could be seen for miles. Watkins said he expected the fire to burn well into the evening, and that firefighters were not trying to extinguish the blaze, but were simply trying to keep it from spreading. Classes at nearby Texas A&M University were canceled, and the school opened Reed Arena, which can hold 12,000 people, for use as a shelter. ""We are prepared to do what it takes. We are bracing to possibly keep guests overnight,"" spokeswoman Sherylon Carroll said.","NEW: 10 taken to hospital with respiratory problems, city manager says .

"(CNN) -- Fifteen years ago this month, Rwanda declared a cease-fire in a genocide that left more than 800,000 dead. In the attacks that started in April 1994, Hutu militias and members of the general population sought out Tutsis and moderate Hutus -- and went on a 100-day killing rampage. In June of 1994, Rwanda was still in the grip of a 100-day killing rampage. Civilians and children got incentives to take part in the atrocities, including promises of land belonging to their Tutsi neighbors. It was one of the most brutal genocides in modern history. Some figures put the number of dead at 1 million, 10 percent of the population of the central African nation. Millions more were raped and disfigured. A whole generation of children lost their parents. What started the Tutsi and Hutu rivalry . The Tutsi ethnic minority and the Hutu majority had been at odds even before 1994. The rivalry started during colonial times, when the Belgians considered Tutsis the privileged ethnicity, thus giving them better opportunities. The Hutus were considered inferior, prompting resentment that was passed on through the generations. The first major assault on Tutsis occurred in 1959, killing thousands and prompting more attacks over the years. The animosity caused the Tutsis to flee to neighboring countries, including Burundi and Uganda. The Hutus took over the government when Rwanda gained its independence from Belgium in 1962, but the resentment remained. Hours before the genocide . In early April, a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was shot down near the capital, Kigali. The president, his Burundian counterpart and their aides were killed. A few hours later, Rwanda erupted into chaos. Some have accused current President Paul Kagame, a Tutsi, of masterminding the killing. Kagame, who led a Tutsi militia group at the time, has denied any ties. He has accused Hutu rebels of instigating the assassinations to incite fury and attacks on Tutsis. Differences between Hutus and Tutsis . They speak the same language and practice the same customs. However, most Tutsis are considered tall and lanky, which has led to speculation that they have Ethiopian heritage. During the genocide, the bodies of Tutsis were thrown into rivers by the Hutus, who said they were sending them back to Ethiopia. The aftermath of the genocide . After 100 days of death and destruction, the Tutsi militia led by Kagame defeated the Hutu rebels and took control of the government. Scores of Hutus fled to neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, where they have been accused of inciting more violence. Rwanda has invaded Congo various times to launch an offensive against Hutus allegedly linked to the genocide. After the cease-fire, a multiethnic government made up of Hutu President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President Kagame came into power. Bizimungu was later accused of ethnic discord and jailed. Kagame became president in 2000. Trials for genocide suspects . Top officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide are tried in the Rwandan justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal, which is based in Tanzania. Civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried in gacaca courts. The latter are community courts conducted by a panel of nine civilians in an open field. The courts allow survivors to point out and confront their attackers. Gacaca means ""open grass"" in the local language. Human rights organizations say the gacacas fall short on delivering justice. State of the nation 15 years later . Rwanda is now considered one of Africa's most stable nations. Education, health care, tourism and trade -- which were destroyed in the genocide -- have improved dramatically. Kagame has made big strides against corruption, a major problem in Africa. However, critics have accused him of being an autocratic leader who has stifled the country's media. Others have said the growth in economy is limited to urban areas and has not trickled into rural areas.","Simmering hatreds between Tutsi and Hutu erupted in genocide in 1994 .

"(CNN) -- Iranian protesters have found a new outlet to mobilize and take action. The presidential election has proved how much opposition supporters can demand change without necessarily taking to the streets. Just give them a computer and an Internet connection and watch what they can do. Supporters of defeated Iranian presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi protest in Tehran on June 13, 2009. At the height of the protests and disorder in Tehran on Saturday and Sunday, Twitter was used to give graphic accounts to a worldwide audience - even if they were a maximum of 140 characters. Tweets from ""Change for Iran"" were among several that offered real time updates: ""...my friend saying more than 100 students arrested, I can't confirm this but the numbers are high. bastards just attacked us for no reason, I lost count of how much tear gas they launched at us! ...we have now some students with urgent need of medical attention I'm calling out to all ppl who can come here don't leave us."" Some Iranians are already veterans on social networking sites with loyal followings. They offer the world a unique voice: free, unfiltered and very different from what the Islamic Republic of Iran's media propaganda offers viewers and readers. Internet service is available in Iran but it is still in its infancy. Available in homes, on hand-held devices and in select cafes, the Internet is slow and unreliable at times, says blogger and aspiring journalist Ali from Tehran, a supporter of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mossavi. This makes services such as Skype almost impossible to operate.  Watch the role technology has had in the election Â» . Still, it provides users with an outlet to the outside world as the country waits for broadband and wider wireless coverage. With the absence of text messaging and mobile services -- both were cut off across the country on and around election day and were still blocked on Sunday -- Twitter proved to be the most reliable communication technique between people inside Iran and millions of others on the outside thirsty for any update. Twitter has enabled people to express to the world their hopes for the elections, excitement at the chance of exercising their right to vote, jubilation in President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's camp and shock and disappointment among Mossavi's supporters. Now they're keeping the Twitterverse ablaze with information about Moussavi, his challenge to the election results and his intent to request their annulment. Moussavi's supporters comfortably outnumber Ahmadinejad's on Twitter but both are represented. Facebook is also very popular in Iran, says Ali. He wholeheartedly believes that Facebook was the reason behind what he describes as a successful campaign by President Ahmadinejad's main rival. Ali says Moussavi campaign managers organized supporters, planned gatherings and garnered support through Facebook pages dedicated to the Reformist candidate. ""His Facebook page got huge amount of fans on it, pictures spread extremely fast,"" says Ali. It was used on Saturday and Sunday to organize and announce street protests, to send out warnings about police activity, but especially to keep followers abreast of his whereabouts. They were the first to talk about his forced house arrest. President Ahmadinejad also jumped on the social networking bandwagon ahead of the race. However, his popularity there pales in comparison to that of Moussavi. Both candidates' pages remain a main source of information for updates and breaking news. In fact we've seen many cases of news breaking on Facebook first while confirmation came later, including Moussavi's house arrest and Ahmadinejad's planned addresses. According to Iranian bloggers, website filtering falls under the oversight of the Intelligence Ministry in conjunction with the Ministry of Information and Iran's judiciary. Bloggers complain that at times the ministry filters words like ""violence,"" ""unrest"" and ""democracy."" Recently, Ali believes the censors were filtering content based on a candidate's name. Moussavi supporters claim filtering particularly targeted their candidate after his popularity soared and authorities feared he would pose a serious challenge to Ahmadinejad. Another challenge for Iranians comes from the U.S. Because of its sanctions against Iran, some services like video conversations are not allowed. So, it's a tap dance sometimes to figure out the best way to talk to someone in Iran. People don't like to use landlines or mobile phones for fear of their calls being traced. They don't like e-mails as they can leave a trace. They do however feel comfortable with services like Google Talk. They find it safe, as no one can see what they look like and with common Iranian first names like ""Ali"" and ""Shahrzad"", as my main contacts are named, they find a way to communicate with the world as few Iranians have done before.","Iranians protesting presidential election use Internet to mobilize and take action .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Thirty-eight years ago, Joseph McGinty Nichol was a boy in Kalamazoo, Michigan, playing with toy robots. Many of the robots in ""Terminator Salvation"" are real machines, which increased realism, the cast says. Today ""McG,"" as he is better known, builds and blows up real robots. The prominent filmmaker is the driving force behind one of the season's summer blockbusters, ""Terminator Salvation,"" which is filled with very expensive and very explosive robots. The choice to use real robots when possible, instead of CGI (computer generated images), was deliberate, McG said. According to the director and the film's stars, the decision to use real machines was a testament to the growing sophistication of the moviegoing public, whom they believe can ""feel"" the difference between actors standing in front of a green screen versus actors interacting with the real thing. It was also done in honor of the legendary special effects supervisor, four-time Oscar winner Stan Winston (""Jurassic Park,"" the other ""Terminator"" films), who passed away during filming last year.  Watch the robots in action Â» . The director and three of his cast members -- Christian Bale, Bryce Dallas Howard and Anton Yelchin -- took a time out with CNN to explain why gravity and singed eyebrows both played a role in ""Terminator Salvation."" Bryce Dallas Howard: That was something that was really important to McG ...  when an audience member sees this film, that they can actually feel what's occurring. I think that audiences are very savvy now. We can feel when something is CGI and that's no disrespect to CGI -- we couldn't do this movie without it -- but, whenever possible, in the tradition of Sam Winston, he wanted to build the robots. So a lot of what you see is real. McG: And if you drop something, we've spent our whole lives watching physics in play, and if you say, just have the CGI do that, people can tell something's off, and it releases you from being involved in the picture. So, we built all the robots, we built all the sets, we blew them up for real, a great many of us lost our eyebrows! Christian Bale: It was kind of comical at times because something that's meant to be so intimidating was actually surrounded by five guys with these kind of puppet rods I had to blank out or I would start laughing. But, the end result is something really formidable and you know, really iconic in movie history. Anton Yelchin: Now I'm obsessed with the robots! I'm so [annoyed] that this guy or whoever it is that's in charge of it wouldn't let me have one!","""Terminator Salvation"" filmmakers decide to use many real robots .

"(CNN) -- John Spieker stood on the back porch of his newly rented Bailey, Colorado, home, thankful for his Good Samaritan landlord and worried that his previous home, parked in the driveway, wouldn't get him to work the next day. John and Katie Spieker stand next to their camper with baby son, Jacob. His 1977 Toyota Dolphin camper, which Spieker rescued from a salvage yard, had carried him, his wife, Katie, and 4-month-old son, Jacob, from Florida to Colorado earlier this summer, a cross-country sojourn in search of work. He was uncertain it could handle the 14-mile commute the next morning, but he'd make do. ""I'm gonna get up extra early every morning like I have been, and if it [the camper] doesn't get to work, I'm gonna hitchhike,"" Spieker said last week. ""I have a wife and a son to support."" Spieker had been making $12 an hour plus commission at his information technology job in Trenton, Florida. Katie was working part-time in a candle shop, and between them they pulled in a little more than $2,500 a month. But Katie, 21, quit to have the baby, and they moved into a bigger, more expensive house to accommodate their larger family. As June approached, Spieker, 36, was told his hours and commission were being cut as Florida's economy sank. ""It got to the point where $6.50 an hour with a house just ain't gonna happen. I was trying to do good for my family, but what can I do?"" he asked. His last day of work in Florida was June 30. With Florida's unemployment rate at 10.6 percent in June, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, he investigated where prospects might be better, settling on Colorado (7.6 unemployment), and if things didn't work out there, North Dakota (the nation's lowest unemployment at 4.2 percent). The Spieker family prepared for the trip by holding a yard sale a few days before they were set to leave Trenton, a town of 1,800 near Gainesville. They dutifully cleaned up the home they rented but could no longer afford. ""You're not going to pay the rent, you get out of the house, you know?"" Spieker said. They hit the road with $1,000 in cash, a cell phone, some food and what clothing they could fit. The rickety old camper required some minor repairs along the way: a new battery strap after being bounced around on a rough Alabama highway, some brake work after one stuck near St. Charles, Missouri. Spieker said he sold wire art in taverns during the journey to earn extra money. He was teased by opportunities that didn't pan out. ""I never actually saw this before, but some towns are actually putting billboards up that say 'This town has jobs,' "" he said of his travels through the nation's heartland. ""I actually went to check it out,"" he said. ""They've got a couple jobs, but nothing really great. They've got some jobs I'm not qualified for, in the medical field,"" he said. Still without work after arriving in Colorado, the Spiekers lived ""out in the woods"" for a few weeks. They didn't consider themselves homeless, John Spieker said, ""just camping."" Using computers at a local office supply store and the library, Spieker and his family have been able to tap private and public assistance to care for themselves. A local church has taken care of some day-to-day needs. ""I went down and talked to them and said, 'Hey this is what the situation is, if there's any help available.' They said they could probably help us out with food, baby needs,"" Spieker said. ""And we're actually going to apply for medical assistance."" As for food stamps, Spieker said he'd rather the program be used on the infirm than someone like himself who could provide -- no matter how meager the fixings -- for his family. ""I'm sure there's other people out there that don't have the motivation or the ability [to work] that can use the food stamps,"" he said. Katie doesn't fret about the family's circumstances either. She said she leaves ""all the financial details up to John."" ""My main job is to take care of Jacob,"" she said. Life got a bit easier on July 20, when Spieker landed work at an auto parts store. A person he connected with through an online forum offered the Bailey house for $350 a month rent, a $400 discount off the normal price. The home's owner is working a temporary contract construction job on the other side of Colorado, Spieker said, enabling the deal. But the ""For Sale"" sign out front and real estate agent's lockbox on the front door remind Spieker about how temporary his lodgings may be. While he's grateful for the auto parts job, nothing is certain there either. A national chain is trying to take over the independent retailer, he said. ""It's a struggling company,"" Spieker said. ""At the same time, he's busy enough to where he needs three people behind the counter."" He's making $10 an hour. But he knows that won't keep his family housed when the cheap rent goes away. ""At this point we have a place to stay for two or three months. He said 'maybe three, probably two,' "" Spieker said, recounting his landlord's words. ""I like it here. I just need something better-paying,"" he said. If he didn't find something soon, he said, ""At this point, I'll be right back into the same scenario."" But for the moment, the Spiekers are enjoying what they have. ""The house is great. It's a one-bedroom, it kind of looks like somebody decided to build an A-frame. It has a really, really nice view,"" Katie said. Drinking in the surroundings on the back porch, John Spieker agrees. ""I have the most awesome view,"" Spieker said, looking at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. ""I can't bring myself to walk off the back porch.""","Florida man's pay is reduced until he can't support his family .

"(CNN) -- Jeneba Jalloh Ghatt is the first to admit that she likes nice things. Stylist Philip Pelusi has offered his clients bargains and hosted  two designers' shows to help them save money. But these days when she passes the new upscale shopping area en route to her Chevy Chase, Maryland, office, she refuses to even glance at the lavish goodies. ""There's a Ralph Lauren store, a Louis Vuitton store, Tiffany's,"" said the attorney and principal of The Ghatt Law Group. ""I drive by and I don't even look in that direction."" With the economy in shambles and so many people losing their jobs and homes, it is no longer considered cool to brag about possessions and purchases. For many during a deepening recession, conspicuous consumption is out and frugality is the new black. ""People have long used the way they shop and what they buy as a way to communicate with other people about their values, their tastes and their interests,"" said Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist and professor at Golden Gate University in San Francisco, California. ""A year ago, what was considered the ultimate status symbol would have been the chicest bag or the most luxurious outfit,"" Yarrow added. ""Now what's chic is being the most knowledgeable and efficient at saving money."" Yarrow said that despite the tough economic times, there are many Americans who still have disposable income. Those people are choosing not to spend, she said, or making more thoughtful purchases. ""What I am saying is that we have moved from an era of conspicuous consumption to an era of considered consumption,"" Yarrow said. ""People at one time wanted to showcase all of the things they are buying and now they are stopping and really thinking about it."" Brett Wright, co-founder and chief creative officer of Uptown Magazine, is also seeing evidence of that attitude shift. iReport.com: What adjustments are you making to your budget? His publication is targeted at what he terms the ""triple A's"" -- affluent African-Americans and those who want to be. Wright said he is seeing consumption of big ticket items being put on hold or done more discreetly. ""Buying the new red Ferrari is certainly not in favor,"" Wright said. ""Everybody is trying to do things sort of under the radar screen. No one is looking to be as ostentatious as they may have been in the past."" Consumers are looking for value for their spending, Wright said, and focusing on ""How do you live like a king without having to spend a king's ransom?"" To that end, Wright and his staff are brainstorming ways to address the change in spending habits in their publication. ""We don't believe that luxury lifestyle has gone away,"" Wright said. ""We're looking at maybe not having the $250,000 watch, but a great watch you can get for perhaps $7,500."" Renowned hairstylist and salon owner Philip Pelusi said he, too, has seen the focus shift to more bang for the buck during the economic downturn. Pelusi said clients are opting for money-saving tactics like extending time between visits, partial highlights or getting services on ""training nights"" for the salon, which can trim their bill up to 60 percent. ""We are doing everything we can to accommodate the clients,"" said Pelusi, whose Tela Design Studio in Manhattan has only seen a slight decrease in business. Pelusi is also reaching out to others in the industry who are looking to economize. Two designers, Susan Cianciolo and ""Project Runway"" finalist Jillian Lewis, opted to forgo staging more expensive shows and used Pelusi's design studio during Fashion Week for their presentations. Marilani Huling is a Washington-based jewelry designer who said she has reduced prices on her creations to cater to her clientele. Huling said that during the recent ""Crystal Couture"" event in Virginia, one of the most popular presenters during the two-week fashion festival was Goodwill Industries. ""Goodwill had stylists put together things off their racks and put them on the runway models,"" Huling said. ""I was surprised, because everything really looked good."" HLN consumer advocate Clark Howard said a new term is ""in-sourcing"" instead of ""out-sourcing."" ""People had their collection of 'Mys,' "" Howard said. ""My massage therapist, my yard person, my hairdresser. Now people are really stepping back from that and saying 'If I cut my own lawn, I'm going to have that $60 in my pocket.' "" Howard said he has noticed from listeners to his popular call-in radio show that even those who really don't need to cut back are still choosing to do so. That didn't happen, he said, during the last deep recession from 1979 to 1982. Howard said he attributes the rush to downsize in part to the 24-hour news cycle, which continues to pepper the public with bad news. ""People didn't have access to the constant drumbeat of news that they have now,"" he said. With so much personal spending being tied to emotion, Howard said consumers are being much more cautious while they ride out the economic turmoil and are taking comfort in being able to score good deals. Ghatt posted unabashedly on Twitter when she spotted a pair of Cole Hahn shoes originally priced at $180 going for $20 at Marshalls. When a friend expressed his surprise that she would go public with shopping at a discount store, she had a quick comeback. ""I tweeted and said 'Don't you know that bargain divas are in style now?' "" Ghatt said, laughing.","Conspicuous consumption is out and frugality is in during recession .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Actress Patricia Clarkson has a giggle whenever she thinks about the handwritten letter she received from the great Woody Allen. Woody Allen, Patricia Clarkson, Evan Rachel Wood and Larry David worked together on ""Whatever Works."" The actress, who first worked with the famed director on the 2008 film ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" was tickled by a letter on Allen's personal stationery in which he said he had written a part for her, ""but if you have something better to do, I'll understand."" ""You know, he had me at the letter,"" Clarkson said. ""It's Woody Allen! 'If you have something better to do'? Woody, come on!"" Clarkson definitely made time to perform in Allen's latest film, ""Whatever Works."" The movie centers on a quirky, grouchy New Yorker -- played by the aptly cast Larry David -- who abandons his privileged life to become more Bohemian and hooks up with a younger woman played by Evan Rachel Wood. David, the ""Seinfeld"" co-creator known for his curmudgeonly ways and his hit HBO series ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" had appeared briefly in two earlier Allen films, ""Radio Days"" and ""New York Stories."" EW ranks every single Allen film . David said he was slightly hesitant about embracing a role as large as that of Boris Yellnikoff in ""Whatever Works."" ""I read the script and I looked at the first page and there's Boris all over the first page, then I turned to page 50, and there's Boris on page 50, then I went to the last page, and there's a big monologue by this character Boris, and I thought, 'Oh, wow, this is something,' "" David said. ""So I called [Allen] up on the phone, and I said, 'I don't know if I can do this, you're making a big mistake!' ""  Watch David talk about Allen encouraging him to ""stretch"" Â» . David said Allen convinced him that he could pull it off. He said he enjoyed his time acting for the iconic director who, he said, was great to work with and allowed his actors freedom. ""If you're not comfortable with something, he doesn't want you to do it,"" David said. ""He doesn't mind if you change his words -- he's very easy. It was very easy to work with him."" It wasn't as easy to work with Clarkson, David said, because she is such an amazing talent. ""You forget that you're in the movie because you're just enjoying what she's doing,"" David said. ""Then all of a sudden it dawns on you, 'Oh, hey, I've got a line coming up, I better get back to this movie.' "" Clarkson, who recently garnered buzz for her appearance in the Justin Timberlake-Andy Samberg ""Motherlover"" SNL skit, plays Marietta, the mother of Yellnikoff's young paramour. She echoed David's admiration and said working with the comedian in an Allen-helmed film was incredible. ""You have a part written by Woody, you're being directed by Woody, and then you're acting with Larry David,"" she said. ""It's just genius, genius, genius, and then you have Evan Rachel Wood, who's this beautiful, amazing emerging star. I was in heaven every single day on that set."" The movie marks Wood's debut in a comedy, and like David, she found the experience a bit daunting at first. ""Not only am I doing Woody Allen dialogue, but opposite Larry,"" she said. ""Thank God he was just as nervous as I was, because he does 'Curb,' but that's mainly improv, so he never had to really memorize lines before."" Her character Melody, Wood said, isn't exactly dumb, but she is earnest. ""She is incredibly naÃ¯ve and just a very sweet Southern girl who sees the good in everything and everybody and is determined to have a happy life, while Boris is determined to have a miserable one,"" she said. ""I think that's why they end up together. Opposites attract."" And even though Wood grew up in North Carolina, she said Allen encouraged her to tap even further into her roots for the role. ""Woody always told me, 'More Southern, more Southern,' "" she said. ""I was so worried about going over the top, and he really pushed me. I'm glad he did."" Although some of the characters hail from below the Mason-Dixon line, ""Whatever Works"" was shot in the mainstay setting of most of Allen's films, New York City. Clarkson, who was born in New Orleans but lives in New York, said she marvels at how the director is able to attack similar themes like love, romance and the life of New York intellectuals while still keeping his films fresh. ""And yet, I don't know how he does it,"" Clarkson said. ""And for me, this character, he takes this kind of archetypal Southern character, and he's such a Yankee, yet he figures out this beautiful way to come at this character fresh, which is almost impossible, and he did it.""","Woody Allen's new film is ""Whatever Works""

"(CNN) -- The man suspected of trying to attack the Dutch royal family by crashing his car near their bus has died, Dutch police said Friday. A car is pictured after crashing into the crowd waiting for the visit of the royal family in Apeldoorn. The man, whose name was not released, had been seriously injured in the crash Thursday in the town of Apeldoorn, about 45 miles east of Amsterdam, police said. He died early Friday, police said. He had been charged with trying to attack the royal family, authorities said. Were you there? Send us your video, images . Police searched the man's house but found no weapons, explosives, ""or any other clues that could lead to the involvement of other people,"" police said. Five people, as well as the driver, were killed and 12 were wounded in the incident, which happened during the country's annual Queen's Day celebration, police said. Crowds had lined the streets to see Queen Beatrix and her family ride by in an open-top bus during the Netherlands' annual holiday.  See who the Dutch royal family are Â» . As the bus moved along, a black hatchback zoomed past it. The crowds were behind barriers off the road, but security officials and journalists, including many cameramen, were in the road as the car went by. The car crashed into the low metal railing around a column on the side of the road. The vehicle appeared heavily damaged even before the crash, but the reason for that was unclear. There was no one other than the driver in the car at the time, police spokeswoman Esther Naber said. Members of the royal family saw the crash and gasped, then quickly sat down as the bus continued driving. The attack caused outrage in the Netherlands, newspapers Friday widely expressing disbelief and suggesting the monarchy would have to change. ""Queens Day will never be the same,"" the Trouw newspaper said. ""The Netherlands always has been proud of their no nonsense royal family. With this comes a Queen who not only cycles a bike, but also mixes with people without obvious security measurements. Is that still possible now the royal family has been the target of an attack?"" The Algemeen Dagblad newspaper agreed. """"What is going to happen on the 30th of April next year? And will we continue to see the members of the royal family cycling through the canals of Amsterdam or hunting for bargains in the Bijenkorf in The Hague?"" Queen's Day is a national holiday in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Aruba. The tradition started in 1885 and celebrates the birthday of the queen. Although Queen Beatrix's birthday is January 31, she officially celebrates her birthday April 30, according to the Dutch government. Queen's Day is known for its free market all over the country, where anybody is allowed to sell things in the streets. Other activities include children's games and musical performances. The day is marked with the color orange all over the country as a reference to the colors of the royal family, who come from the House of Orange-Nassau. Emmy Dexel contributed to this report.","Incident happened during the Netherlands annual Queen's Day celebration .

"(CNN) -- In the black market of prison life, cell phones have become perhaps the hottest commodity. Now, Texas is among a growing number of state governments going after them. Hundreds of contraband cell phones were found behind bars or in transit to Texas inmates in 2008. Tiny, easy to hide and an unmonitored link for convicts to the outside world, cell phones are valuable contraband, fetching a greater asking price from convicts than some shipments of illegal drugs. John Moriarty, inspector general for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said that one phone can fetch as much as $2,000. ""It takes one crooked prison worker to populate a whole prison unit with them,"" he said. More than 1,200 wireless phones sit in law enforcement evidence rooms, all found behind bars or in transit to Texas inmates in 2008. Moriarty is the investigator and bloodhound the state of Texas uses to trail the illegal traffic. ""These are not stupid people,"" he said of the coordinated efforts to slip phones into the prison and hide them. ""There are a lot of hands in between and they all want a piece of the action."" Accomplices on the outside vary from family members, to friends to fellow criminals who buy or steal the phones and charge them with minutes. The contraband is then moved through an elaborate series of drop points and usually ferried into the walls of a prison by a guard or trustee -- an escape engineered in reverse. Finding the dirty prison employee is often the key. ""Some of these guys make next to nothing, so you can see how easy it could be to corrupt them,"" Moriarty said. State Sen. John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat and the chair of the state senate's Criminal Justice Committee, became an ally of Moriarty's after one phone call in October. He picked up a phone slip from his secretary and called the number on it -- only to realize he had returned a call to a death row inmate's cell phone. The inmate, he said, was Richard Tabler -- a convicted double murderer who was sharing a wireless phone with nine other inmates. ""At first I thought it was a hoax,"" said Whitmire, who said he called the state justice board and ""read them the riot act."" Whitmire is one of the sponsors of a bill in the Texas Legislature that would crack down on convicts caught with phones and allow prison systems to monitor and detect cell signals. It's en route to Gov. Rick Perry's desk after clearing both houses of the legislature this week. Other efforts are under way at both the state and federal level. In January, U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, introduced legislation that would let prisons jam cell-phone signals within their walls. Last month, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley asked the federal government for permission to do so in his state. Prison officials in Arizona are training dogs to sniff out cell phones.","Texas is among a growing number of states going after contraband cell phones .

"(CNN) -- If you sell it, they will come. Prices are expected to grow for Michael Jackson autographs like the one he gave this young fan in 2002. That's the hope at least for many offering Michael Jackson related merchandise and memorabilia, including autographed items and domain names, in the wake of his surprising death. Almost 20,000 items were up for sale after his death on the popular auction site eBay, where collectors could snap up everything from the rare to the ridiculous. Among the many T-shirts, record albums, DVDs and posters, there were also magazines about Jackson, dolls and copies of newspapers announcing his death. There were Michael Jackson gloves (sparkly, of course), masks, wigs, sunglasses and fedora hats. Anyone in the mood for some senior soda could try and win an auction for an unopened six-pack of Pepsi from the 1984 Jacksons world tour. For those seeking to establish Web sites, domain names were available including ""ILoveYouMichael.com,"" which was selling for the ""buy it now"" price of $5,000. Officials at eBay said that compared with the daily average of the week prior, Thursday's gross merchandise volume for Jackson memorabilia increased by 275 percent and sold items increased by 210 percent. New listings were up 61 percent, while the average selling price of items had increased by 31 percent. Online merchant CafePress also offered a variety of items, including mugs, ""R.I.P. Michael Jackson"" magnets and dozens of T-shirt designs, including one screened with a drawing of tennis legend Billie Jean King and the words ""not my lover."" Some of the hottest items may turn out to be the ones bearing Jackson's signature. On eBay, bids for what the buyer claimed was a signed Michael Jackson  guitar had reached almost $1,300 by Friday afternoon. Jerry Ohlinger, owner of Jerry Ohlinger's Movie Material Store in New York, predicted that although Jackson was generous in giving autographs, the price for a legitimate autograph probably will at least double from the $150 to $300 range it was prior to his death. ""He would sign autographs whenever he appeared in person,"" Ohlinger said. ""For instance, he visited our store at least three times, and he signed autographs for all of the employees."" As a comparison, Ohlinger said, an autograph for the late actress Marilyn Monroe, who also was known to sign a great deal during her lifetime, sells for about $5,000 because of great demand. As of Friday, items purported to be autographed photos of Jackson were ranging in price from just over $5 to several thousand dollars. There is no way to predict whether there will be a sudden influx in demand for Michael Jackson memorabilia and merchandise, Ohlinger said. All of the hoopla would probably tickle the pop icon, who Ohlinger said was himself a fan of star items. Whenever Jackson would visit Ohlinger's Manhattan store, he would shop for vintage photos of some of the legendary ladies of cinema, including his very dear friend Elizabeth Taylor, Ohlinger recalled.","NEW: Sold Jackson items on eBay increase 210 percent compared to last week .

"DANVILLE, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- When Joseph Homicz's doctor found what could be dangerous blockages of the arteries, he ordered catheterization, a common procedure in which tubes are inserted into the body to check the blood flow. Dr. Peter Berger, far right, has a 40-item checklist covering steps before, during and after a procedure. But Homicz's treatment was not quite ordinary because he was sent to a cardiologist working at Geisinger Health System in Danville, Pennsylvania. Geisinger, which operates hospitals, community clinics and its own insurance company, is enacting what some consider radical ideas to improve patient care and lower costs. It's a system that President Obama has billed as one of the nation's ""islands of excellence."" Homicz's procedure was part of the Proven Care program, in which all of a patient's medical professionals work together to ensure no mistakes are made. It is everyone's job to make sure any errors are caught, and doctors are graded on the entire treatment a patient receives from the time of diagnosis through an operation to the care received weeks or even months later. ""We want to make it harder to make a mistake,"" Dr. Peter Berger, Homicz's cardiologist, said after the procedure.  Watch more on Geisinger's approach to health care Â» . Berger has a 40-item checklist covering steps before, during and after the procedure, including checking whether the catheterization is really needed to ensuring he has the right patient on the table. Berger, who is also the system's director of clinical research, says patients and doctors both benefit from this type of medicine. ""Every study that has been done has shown that doctors and health care systems aren't as good at administering all of the things a patient needs as we ought to be,"" Berger says. ""There are so many watchful eyes on the patient. All members of the team have an assigned responsibility, and we are all making sure we all do our job. I absolutely think that the patients benefit from that kind of approach."" Leading up to Homicz's catheterization and during the procedure, nurses and doctors checked off specific items and were encouraged to check in on what Berger was doing. Geisinger says this approach encourages teamwork, which leads to better results, less mistakes and increased profits. ""We got a lot of buzz out of the fact that we re-engineered all our care from beginning to end,"" Dr. Glenn Steele, president and CEO of Geisinger said. He said company employees went out and studied how medical professionals around the country were conducting specific procedures and incorporated the best of what was found.  Watch more of Steele's take Â» . ""When you're having heart surgery how tightly should you control the level of your blood sugar? Should you do that with a continuous drip of a medicine called insulin? What should your temperature be exactly when you come out of the operating room and go to recovery room? All of those things are thought or have been proven to be related to the probability of you having a perfect outcome, but none of those things has been formally engineered into a process until we did it,"" Steele said. Geisinger says its procedures and operations cost patients less than others. Some patients who have Geisinger insurance are able to pay a set price. In return, if within 90 days after a procedure they develop any related complications  -- for example an infection, pneumonia, a bleed in the area -- they get free treatment. Geisinger estimates about a third of those using Proven Care are eligible for this guarantee. ""We've found huge decreases in hospitalization and rehospitalization for those patients because they're better cared for,"" Steele says. The company also helps keep patients with chronic problems from getting worse by assigning case managers to consult and check in with patients as often as necessary. For example, James Connelly, a 78-year-old patient with a history of congestive heart failure, kidney disease and artery disease, was admitted to the hospital in May of last year after gaining 14 pounds. After doctors stabilized him and sent him home, Connelly enrolled in the partnering initiative. Each day he enters his weight on a Web site, which is monitored by his case worker. A year later he has lost 14 pounds and is much healthier. Through technology and its use of electronic medical records, the company says it has shaved costs by preventing unnecessary tests. Also, patient data can be accessed at any of the hospitals or 40 clinics Geisinger operates. So can the Geisinger system be replicated nationwide? Geisinger executives say not all of what they have put in place will work elsewhere, however, they say a good portion -- more reliance on electronic records and a greater emphasis on collaboration -- will help dramatically improve health care. ""I think what we can do over the next few years is rather than to try to come on the right formula, the right template for all of the reform, I think what we can do is scale this thing up,"" Steele said. ""I don't think we have to push the entire system off the cliff because...there is a lot that is designed out there that couldn't do what we are doing.""

"(CNN) -- When it came to second bananas, Ed McMahon was second to none. Ed McMahon turned being a sidekick into art. McMahon, known to generations of Americans through ""Tonight,"" ""Star Search,"" ""TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes"" and as a commercial pitchman, died Tuesday. He was 86. For 30 years on the ""Tonight Show"" -- and several years more beforehand -- he was Johnny Carson's trusty sidekick, introducing him, feeding him straight lines, making the guests comfortable on the couch. It was a job that generally aimed the spotlight at Carson, the host. But it made McMahon a star nonetheless. ""He was a star in his own right. Being a sidekick didn't mean he was any less,"" Doc Severinsen, the longtime ""Tonight"" bandleader, told CNNRadio. ""Johnny defined what the host should be and Ed defined what the sidekick was."" David Letterman, whose ""Late Night"" followed Carson's show on NBC from 1982 to 1993, said in a statement: ""Ed McMahon's voice at 11:30 was a signal that something great was about to happen. Ed's introduction of Johnny was a classic broadcasting ritual -- reassuring and exciting. Ed was a true broadcaster, and an integral part of Johnny Carson's 'Tonight Show.' We will miss him.""  Gallery: Ed McMahon through the years Â» . McMahon, known to generations of Americans through ""Tonight,"" ""Star Search,"" ""TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes"" and as a commercial pitchman, died Tuesday. He was 86. While Carson could be insular and shy off camera, McMahon was always possessed of an outsized, hail-fellow-well-met attitude, comedian Joan Rivers -- a frequent ""Tonight"" guest and guest host -- told CNN. ""I remember him with great affection, and I remember him [as] very solid whenever I hosted the show. ... When you needed him, he was a rock. A real rock,"" recalled Rivers. ""He went beyond the 'Tonight Show' and had his own identity and America liked him very much. He was a good guy. He was the neighbor.""  Watch Rivers' memories of McMahon Â» . Dick Clark -- who really was McMahon's neighbor in 1950s Philadelphia, when Clark hosted ""American Bandstand"" and McMahon was a local TV star -- remembered his ""Bloopers"" co-host as a man with ""a really big heart."" ""Fifty years ago, Ed and I were next-door neighbors. Over the years, our friendship grew while he became one of America's favorite television personalities,"" he said in a statement. ""We were together for years. Ed was a big man, had big talent and a really big heart. We'll all miss him."" Rivers remembers McMahon as someone who was always willing to reach out. After she left the Carson show -- which she had hosted frequently in Johnny's absence -- for her own late-night show, she remembered becoming persona non grata with many in Hollywood. But not McMahon. ""Ed McMahon always, whenever he would come in a restaurant or see me anywhere, would make it his business to come over and say hello,"" Rivers said. ""And that was going against, quote-unquote, 'boss' orders.' ""  Watch McMahon recall the invention of ""Carnac the Magnificent"" Â» . The boss, however, knew his sidekick's value. In vaudeville vernacular, a ""second banana"" was the guy who played off the star comedian (the ""top banana""). He was the straight man, the set-up guy, the performer who smoothed the way and occasionally got in his own line, all in the service of the lead. And few were better than McMahon. ""Ed was the best at what he did and will never be replaced,"" said Don Rickles, a longtime friend, in a statement.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- More than 2,500 Nigerians caught in the fighting between Islamic militants and government forces have fled their homes in the northern part of the country, a Red Cross spokeswoman said Wednesday. Mothers and their children take refuge this week at a police office in the northern Nigerian city of Maiduguri. More than 400 people have been killed, and 150 bodies were lying in the general hospital at Maiduguri, according to Aliyu Maikanu, a Red Cross disaster officer in the northeast. Most of the violence has been on the outskirts of the city, officials said. ""It's a terrible situation for me. It's a very serious battle -- something I have not seen in my life,"" Maikanu said. She said only security personnel were free to move around due to the risks. Up to 1,000 militants are holed up at their base of operations in Maiduguri, and police have cordoned off the area, she said. National police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu said Wednesday that police were able to free 187 women and children whom they claim were being held in the compound of the Islamic militants' leader, Mohammed Yusuf. Under the sect's strict form of sharia law, the group that was released was shielded from public view, Ojukwu said. He said 100 arrests have been made across the north. Shehu Sani, president of the Civil Rights Congress, a human rights organization based in northern Nigeria, said people were seeking refuge in police and military barracks and in hospitals. The militants disagree with the government's teaching of Islam in the region, maintaining that the government allows itself to be influenced by Western values. They have been targeting high-profile government institutions, police and Islamic clergy, Ojukwu said. The operation to defeat the militants is ongoing, he said, and police have been deployed in all northeast and northwestern states. There is a history of religious violence in central Nigeria, where majority-Muslim North Africa meets largely Christian sub-Saharan Africa. Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 people were killed there in riots in 2001. Last week the human rights organization alleged that police and soldiers killed at least 133 people during two days of riots last year between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria. Most of the victims were young Muslim men, often unarmed, the group said in testimony before a state commission. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 180 women, kids freed from militants' compound, official says .
