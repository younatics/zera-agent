"(CNN) -- A California mother is scheduled to appear in court on Monday after being accused of wrapping a chain around her son's ankles and locking it. Irma Navarro, 37, was arrested last week on suspicion of willful child cruelty, according to a statement from the Santa Ana Police Department. She remains in custody. Navarro allegedly shackled her son because she did not want him ""running the streets and getting into trouble or mixed up with the wrong group of kids while she was at work,"" the statement said. It was not immediately clear whether Navarro had retained representation. Officers found the child, 10, in the courtyard of an apartment complex. He had a long chain wrapped around his ankles, they reported. The chain was locked and had to be removed with bolt cutters. A witness told police she and a friend had noticed the boy leaning against a tree and crying. She asked how the chain and lock got around his ankles, and he allegedly told her, ""My mom did this to me,"" police said. Navarro has three children. Another one of her children was being watched by a baby sitter, while the third was at school at the time of the incident, police said. All three have been placed in protective custody by social services.","Irma Navarro, 37, is scheduled to appear in court Monday .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Federal authorities have received a ""plausible but unsubstantiated"" report that al Qaeda may have discussed targeting transit systems in or around New York, the Department of Homeland Security said. Al Qaeda suicide bombers could target New York City subways, federal security officials say. ""These discussions reportedly involved the use of suicide bombers or explosives"" on subway or passenger rail trains, according to a joint Homeland Security and FBI statement issued Tuesday. ""We have no specific details to confirm that this plot has developed beyond aspirational planning, but we are issuing this warning out of concern that such an attack could possibly be conducted during the forthcoming holiday season,"" the statement said. The uncorroborated information indicates that al Qaeda may have discussed in late September targeting New York transit systems, Homeland Security spokeswoman Laura Keener said. She said the memo was issued as a precaution so local officials could make decisions appropriate for their areas. Although no adjustment is being made to the national threat level, she said, transit passengers in large metropolitan areas such as New York may see increased security in the days to come. That presence might include uniformed or plainclothes security officers, federal air marshals, canine teams and security inspectors, Keener said. New York police also are deploying additional resources on the city's mass transit systems as a precaution, said a statement by Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. ""It is not uncommon for the department to receive threat information and to adjust our resources accordingly,"" Browne said. The FBI received the information through a channel that has provided reliable information in the past, so the agency is taking the threat seriously, counterterrorism sources said. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security said they had no further information on the threat. ""We are working closely with the U.S. intelligence community, state and local law enforcement and homeland security officials to vet and corroborate this reporting, and will continue to investigate every possible lead. We'll provide updates as we obtain further information,"" the statement said. The public should remain vigilant and report suspicious activity to authorities, it said. Al Qaeda has the means to launch such an attack, said CNN senior international correspondent Nic Robertson, who has covered al Qaeda extensively since before the September 11 attacks. ""The al Qaeda-affiliated groups are still willing to make these attacks,"" Robertson said. ""What we've seen in the past is, they've become capable of making these homemade bomb devices with detonators and exploding them by cell phones or by suicide bombings."" However, he said, it also would be possible for al Qaeda to plant false information. ""They would love to sort of create fear when they're not actually capable of creating a strike. ... I've seen it myself, in Afghanistan. You get the Taliban out there on the ground, and they're very capable of knowing that the troops are listening to them, and feeding and sowing false information trails saying, 'We're over on this part of the hill' when they're nowhere near it. They're very capable and knowledgeable about feeding false information.""","Suicide bombers may be used against New York transit, government says .

"(CNN) -- More than 20,000 people -- most of them civilians -- have been killed in Syria's 18-month crisis. The violence continued unabated Wednesday with fierce attacks reported across the country. Here are the latest developments in the Syrian civil war: . On the ground: The battle for Aleppo intensifies . The Syrian regime touted gains on Wednesday in the quest to control Syria's largest city and commercial hub, Aleppo: . ""Units from our heroic Syrian armed forces are in confrontations with terrorist armed groups"" in Aleppo, ""inflicting upon them heavy losses in their numbers and equipment,"" state-run TV reported. Regime and rebel fighters have battled for months in Aleppo, where civilians routinely dodge snipers and attacks from the air. On Tuesday, regime forces shelled a bakery in nearby Marea, causing more than a dozen casualties, opposition activists said. Government forces have previously attacked bread lines in Aleppo province, according to human rights groups and U.N. officials. Residents in opposition-friendly areas often wait in lines at night to avoid being targeted by government aircraft. Across the country, at least 172 people were killed in fresh violence on Wednesday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Sixty-seven of the deaths occurred in Aleppo, it said. World reaction: European official says the world is at a ""deadlock"" on Syria . The European Union is preparing additional funds to support relief through education, food and water, EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton said. ""We face a dangerous stalemate,"" she said Tuesday in a statement. ""The truth is that, despite all the efforts, the international community is in a sense at a deadlock ... the U.N.

Some 550,000 of the 2.2 million people in Homs province need humanitarian aid, World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said after a U.N. mission composed of health experts visited the embattled province last week. ""The urgency of scaling up delivery of humanitarian aid is exacerbated by the approaching winter,"" he said. About half of the province's physicians have left, and only about three surgeons remain, he said. Many of the medical facilities across the province have been damaged or destroyed, leaving the few remaining hospitals overwhelmed with patients and short on medicine and supplies.

"(CNN) -- A British stuntman who parachuted dressed as James Bond during the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony has died, UK media reported. Mark Sutton, whose performance was one of the highlights of the opening ceremony, was in Switzerland at the time of his death. Police in Switzerland's Valais Canton did not name him, saying formal identification is under way after the incident Wednesday morning in the Trient area. The 42-year-old died after hitting a cliff while jumping in a ""wingsuit"" from a helicopter, a police statement said. He and another man jumped from a height of about 3,300 meters in the Grandes-Otannes area in the Alps, near the border with France, the statement said. ""They then flew remaining close to the mountain, with the intention of landing near Le Peuty, near Trient, in Switzerland,"" it said. ""During this flight, one of the men suffered a fatal fall. According to a preliminary investigation, it appears that he fell after hitting a cliff."" The Briton was in Chamonix with 20 other professionals ""considered among the best in the world in this discipline,"" police said. They had been gathered there by a company that specializes in extreme sports, with daredevil feats filmed and broadcast via the Internet. The UK Foreign Office confirmed the death of a British citizen in Switzerland, and a spokesman said the office stood ""ready to provide consular assistance."" Sutton jumped from a helicopter above the Olympic stadium alongside a fellow stuntman dressed as Queen Elizabeth II in an opening ceremony show seen by millions. Gary Connery, who played the queen, made an apparent reference to news of Sutton's death on Twitter. ""All you jumpers/flyers out there, stay safe, make wise choices and know your limits and your locations. Live to tell your stories. One love,"" he posted late Wednesday. Wingsuit jumping is an extreme sport carried out by experienced skydivers who use a special suit -- which looks like a superhero's cape -- to increase the surface area of the body. The large suit allows them to extend their time in free fall before deploying a parachute to land. John Hitchen, national coach and safety officer for the British Parachute Association, said the organization was saddened to hear about the death of Sutton, who was a member. He said jumpers need to be experienced to use wingsuits, which allow the user to slow their descent, to glide to a degree and move horizontally to the ground. Although the details are unconfirmed as yet, Sutton may have been ""terrain flying,"" which involves flying very close to mountains or cliffs, Hitchen said. ""You get a buzz from it but it's potentially quite hazardous,"" he said. People we've lost in 2013 .","NEW: British Parachute Association is saddened by news of the death of a member .

"(CNN) -- It's not the Internet to Evgeny Morozov. It's ""the Internet"" -- with quotation marks. Morozov is trying to make a point. Thanks to the Web's rapid spread and overwhelming influence on 21st-century society, we've come to think of cyberlife as something distinct from our everyday interactions. To proponents, it has brought a cornucopia of information that will allow society to fix its most intractable problems. But in his new book, ""To Save Everything, Click Here,"" Morozov pushes back against that belief. He is skeptical of such ""solutionism,"" pointing out that just because smart technology has its benefits doesn't mean it's going to lead to utopia. (After all, one man's utopia is another's ""Brave New World."") It's not like Morozov is a Luddite. He has a website and maintains an active Twitter feed with more than 40,000 followers, and he digs deep into information sites and services. It's just that he wants the public to stop and think about the consequences of our headlong rush in embracing the latest digital tools. CNN spoke via e-mail with the noted tech thinker about why he wrote the book, the flaws in being overawed by the latest gadgetry and the costs of data accumulation. The following is an edited version of our interview. CNN: Why write the book? Do you feel like you're swimming upstream against popular opinion, and do you care? Evgeny Morozov: While writing my first book, ""The Net Delusion,"" I became fascinated by two questions. First, why do we find our current technological situation -- of which the Internet is certainly the most attractive and popular example -- unique, and what role this uniqueness plays in policy. Second, now that technology companies play such an important role in public life -- mostly because they run the digital infrastructure through which much of this life happens -- what are the costs and benefits of enlisting them in important social and political projects? In the new book, I continue with the same two questions but shift my attention from authoritarian states and foreign policy to more mundane, domestic issues. What makes us think that problems like obesity or climate change might be technologically solvable? And what makes us think that technology companies, with their penchant for apps, would make good allies in this fight? As for the ""swimming upstream"" part, it doesn't bother me at all. CNN: You talk a lot about ""the Internet,"" putting the term in quotes so it's not considered its own marvelous entity. But isn't ""the Internet,"" even if it's not all its promoters say it is or want it to be, a huge leap forward in communications? Morozov: This might be trivially true, but the problem with terms like ""the Internet"" is that they blind us both to perverse effects of connectivity -- connectivity does not equal democratization, just like social capital does not equal a robust civil society -- and the fact that digital technologies have very different effects in different contexts. So while I have no problem acknowledging some changes in scale, what I oppose is the idea that, somehow, the effects of the ""Internet"" unfold to some trajectory that is visible to digital gurus in Silicon Valley. The reason for putting ""the Internet"" in quotes is simply to indicate that we have accumulated too many myths to continue without harming our own ability to arrive at wise policy. CNN: I'm struck by how easily modern technology can be circumvented -- not even by cutting wires or jamming transmissions but by sidestepping it entirely. (I recall some post-9/11 war games in which a U.S. officer had success by avoiding electronics in favor of messengers, handwritten letters and the like.) Why are these lessons so hard for solutionists to learn? Morozov: Let me guess: Because solutionists spend far too much time with venture capitalists and far too little with people who actually use the technologies they build? The British historian David Edgerton has a wonderful book called ""The Shock of the Old,"" where he shows that our accounts of technology suffer from the innovator's bias: We do not spend nearly enough time looking at how technologies are actually used or maintained. If we did, we would discover that the pace of technological change is much slower and that many ""analog"" technologies have a much longer shelf life than the actual supermarket shelves would suggest. CNN: Do we confuse convenience with solutions? Morozov: For much of its existence, design was all about convenience. We wanted to hide technology so that users are not distracted into thinking about the tools they use. To some extent, the current privacy debacle can be explained this way as well: We have built this thing called ""the digital economy,"" which runs very fast and is very efficient. But its efficiency is enabled by the fact that our personal data leaves our browsers and travels to some server -- Google's or NSA's -- in the least obtrusive manner possible. Is it good? Well, if all you care about is uninterrupted browsing experience, it is. But shouldn't there be other considerations? CNN: Many sites and apps make use of crowdsourcing and aggregation to rate products and services, boiling detailed critiques down to raw numbers. Your thoughts? Morozov: We need to understand what exactly is being reduced as we transition from individual criticism to crowd criticism to -- soon, I'm sure -- algorithmic criticism. It's not a straight line toward progress and objectivity that digital gurus claim it is. It should be our task (or at least my task as an intellectual) to show that we are being sold damaged goods, that the mere fact that some things are being ""disintermediated"" doesn't meant that we are transitioning to a superior cultural environment with better, more reflective criticism. CNN: In the book, you express concern about the Quantified Self movement, those ""datasexuals"" who monitor every aspect of their lives. But is there anything wrong with the practice? History is full of hard-core diarists and quantifiers. Morozov: The scale today is clearly different. Our smartphones are -- by default -- capable of the kind of monitoring that was previously unavailable to most. There's also an interesting -- some would say disturbing -- economic layer here, as much of the data that we collect about ourselves can also be sold. My fear is that many institutions will eventually alter how they treat people who refuse to self-track. There are all sorts of political and moral implications here, and I'm not sure that we have grappled with any of them. CNN: What are your thoughts on the NSA scandal? Morozov: I've been warning about the utility of social media -- and digital infrastructure more generally -- for surveillance purposes for a very long time. So I can't fake surprise or outrage at the recent revelations. CNN: Along those lines, you mention the many ways corporations provide incentives for us to offer our information (or disincentives for opting out). How do we say ""no"" when the economic benefits (coupons, targeted sales) are so attractive? Morozov: The problem is that we don't say ""no."" This marketizaton of personal information is a big mistake. We need to start seeing privacy as a commons -- as some kind of a public good that can get depleted as too many people treat it carelessly or abandon it too eagerly. What is privacy for? This question needs an urgent answer. If my decision to earn a buck off my personal information will greatly constrain the lives of people in the next generation, should I sell my data? I'm not saying that it will necessarily result in more people choosing to share less. But the politicization of information sharing -- the act of turning it from a purely economic matter into an ethical one -- is a necessary start. CNN: How do you use the Internet? What digital tools do you find useful? Morozov: (A prelude: I do hope that this question will soon make as little sense as ""how do you use electricity."") Well, I use both to get things done! ""The Internet"" is not some separate realm -- it's not a parallel universe that we enter under an identity that is different from our usual self; it's just a collection of services. Does the data network through which Kindle delivers my daily newspapers count as ""the Internet""? If it does, I use it quite a lot, as I get seven daily newspapers -- anything from The Wall Street Journal to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung -- that way and perhaps a dozen magazines. But some of those I also read over my iPad. I used to be a heavy user of apps like Flipboard, but to quote the famous computer scientist Don Knuth, I find myself more and more inclined to get to the bottom of things, and spend more time with books (I probably spend an hour a day on Amazon.com buying new books, many of them online) and more long-form writing. I have less and less use for the cloud -- not so much because of privacy concerns but because I just find the overall ""always-on"" proposition a hindrance to getting all the reading done. So I try to have days where, save for my Kindle, there's little contact with the ""Internet."" My fairly intuitive rule is simple: whatever allows me to get more reading done must be a rule/tool worth embracing.","Author Evgeny Morozov questions technological ""solutionism""

"Editor's note: Rep. Jared Polis, a Democrat, represents Colorado's 2nd Congressional District and is appearing in CNN.com's ""Freshman Year"" series along with Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah. Rep. Jared Polis says the federal Defense of Marriage Act should be repealed. (CNN) -- After weeks of looking for the perfect puppy, my partner Marlon and I adopted Gia last month from the Colorado Humane Society and brought her back to Washington with us. We wanted to make sure we adopted a small breed that wouldn't grow too large for us to bring on board the aircraft and commute with from Colorado to Washington each week. We finally found a beautiful 11-week-old terrier mix and adopted her on the spot. Her slightly larger and noisier two brothers were there with her, and we bid them farewell and escorted our puppy to her new home. With the health care debate temporarily on hold until House leaders bring a new bill to the floor, members of Congress have had a chance to once again address the plethora of issues on our legislative plates. For me, this meant working on important education and environmental legislation as well as speaking in favor of LGBT equality and immigration reform, while trying to spend time with Gia during her important formative weeks. Thirteen years ago, Congress passed the so-called Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which effectively outlawed same-sex marriage. At that time, no states allowed same-sex couples to marry. It was a so-called ""defense"" against something that was only hypothetical at the time. Today we have tens of thousands of married same-sex couples in this country, raising families and paying taxes in the five states that have granted them the right to marry. Both President Clinton, who signed DOMA into law in 1996, and Rep. Bob Barr, who originally authored DOMA have agreed it is time for its repeal. This law prevents states from determining what marriages to allow or not allow by second guessing them at the federal level. To end this injustice, I co-authored legislation that would ensure that valid marriages are respected under federal law, and spoke at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol announcing the bill's introduction this week. The Respect for Marriage Act will provide couples with much-needed certainty that their lawful marriages will be honored under federal law and that they will have the same access to federal responsibilities and rights as all other married couples. The Respect for Marriage Act would not tell any state who can marry or how married couples must be treated for purposes of state law, and would not obligate any person, church, city or state to celebrate or license a marriage of two people of the same sex. It would merely restore the approach historically taken by states of determining, under principles of comity and full faith and credit, whether to honor a couple's marriage for purposes of state law. Churches should be able to decide what kinds of unions are sanctified by their denomination, but not what kinds of unions are accepted in the civil arena. As an example, the Catholic Church will not remarry a divorced person (without an ""annulment""), but divorced men and women are allowed to remarry under civil law. No one should be denied the opportunity to choose his or her spouse. It is a basic human right and deeply personal decision. Throughout history, we have only moved forward when society has distinguished between traditional values and valueless traditions. The so-called Defense of Marriage Act is a valueless tradition that, like laws against interracial marriage that were finally overturned by the Supreme Court in 1967, undermines the spirit of love and commitment that couples share and sends the wrong message to society. It is time for its repeal. DOMA is out of date and out of touch with the heart of the American people. It is causing these same-sex couples and families serious and lasting harm and it is time for its repeal. Immediately following the DOMA repeal press conference, I switched gears, put on my yarmulke, and took part in an interfaith prayer vigil to end the hateful anti-immigrant rhetoric that been heard on the nation's air waves and, sadly, even spread to halls of Congress. When talking about immigration reform, I remind people that, regardless of where our parents come from, the United States was built by immigrants and continue to grow and progress in part because we have a vibrant and innovative immigrant community. That's why it is so personally frustrating to me when organizations cause hysteria instead of promoting a national debate on immigration policy. It's a disservice to the American public and a disservice to the debate, which is one of our most important policy debates. Unfortunately, this anti-immigrant hate speech has spread to the halls of Congress, threatening to poison the health care debate. America's Affordable Health Choices Act (H.R. 3200) explicitly prohibits undocumented immigrants from subsidized coverage in Section 246 where it says ""No Federal Payments For Undocumented Aliens. Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States."" Regardless of this fact, immigration continues to be used by some, including U.S. Representative Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, as a tactic to stop debate and progress in health care reform. Wilson's now infamous ""You lie"" outburst during President Obama's speech to the Congress offended our sense of decorum and civil debate so much that the House voted in a resolution that his comments were out of line. I think when the American people saw his outburst, they saw it for what it was. Obviously we cannot and will not solve the immigration debate through health care legislation. But with millions of immigrants living in this country and seeking health care while they're here, we also cannot ignore the urgent need to fix our broken immigration system. Until we fix our immigration system, many undocumented immigrants will continue to lack insurance and drive up costs by using emergency rooms as their primary care providers. Whether it is immigration, health care, or any other issue, the American people expect their elected representatives to build fair and workable solutions and to engage in debate that is not based on false information or lies. And as we saw at our prayer vigil, members of Congress, people of faith, law enforcement, organized labor, the business community, and Americans across this country are raising their voices in favor of real solutions rather than hateful rhetoric. Gia got stung by a bee on her paw this weekend, and we rushed her to the animal hospital. The vet was able to find the stinger and remove it, and she only limped for a day. But our nation will continue to limp until we remove the bee stinger of expensive foreign wars from the paw of our nation. We could fully fund health care reform and reduce the deficit with the costs of the expensive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and we would still have enough left over to teach our undocumented immigrants English. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jared Polis.","Jared Polis: Federal government shouldn't intervene in state marriage laws .

"(CNN) -- A Southwest Airlines jetliner sustained substantial damage when its nose gear collapsed during landing in New York and it skidded down the runway, injuring 10 people. The National Transportation Safety Board said on Tuesday that the extent of damage to the Boeing 737-700 prompted it to launch a full investigation of Monday's incident at LaGuardia airport. ""When the nose wheel collapsed it didn't just neatly fold back up there but it produced collateral damage in the nose wheel well,"" safety board spokesman Eric Weiss told CNN. Separately, Southwest reached out to Flight 345 passengers, some of whom reported chaos and confusion in the cabin as the plane slid down 7,000-foot Runway 4 with its nose scraping the tarmac. Airline officials, in e-mails obtained by CNN, apologized for the ""unexpected experience"" and inconvenience and expressed concern for their well being. Southwest is refunding air fares and sending them complimentary tickets for future travel. Southwest, the largest domestic airline, did not respond to efforts by CNN to confirm the e-mails. Passengers recounted the final harrowing moments of what had been a delayed, but uneventful flight from Nashville. Kathy Boles, a passenger, said a ""strong jolt"" shook the cabin when the gear failed and the nose slammed into the tarmac at about 5:40 p.m. ET. ""It was just a bang and a bounce, and then a slam on the brakes and a skidding feeling,"" Boles told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360Â°."" ""I feel extremely blessed to have come off that,"" she said. ""It just really felt like the plane could have broken in half, it was such a hard impact."" Fellow passenger Anastasia Elliot said the situation was ""pretty chaotic."" ""We hit the ground pretty hard and slid,"" she said. ""There was a lot of smoke filling the plane, just a lot of smoke and burnt rubber."" Another passenger said it felt like the plane crashed and then skidded to a stop. ""Everything in the plane that was loose went flying forward,"" Bill Roland said. ""There were cell phones, iPads, books (and) drinks all skidded up."" Passengers escaped the plane down emergency chutes. LaGuardia flight delays related to the incident impacted the morning rush as crews removed the disabled twin-engine jet from the edge of the runway where it came to rest. It was towed to a hangar. By evening, delays had returned, but they were tied to normal stormy summer weather along the East Coast. NTSB protocol involves reviewing cockpit voice and data recorders as well as interviewing crew members and reviewing flight logs and maintenance records. Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration will also be party to the investigation as is customary. Southwest said in a statement that it was working with the NTSB and Boeing. The plane, which entered service nearly 14 years ago, was last inspected on July 18, Southwest said. No details about the inspection were released. In addition to 10 hurt on the plane, a Port Authority police officer was treated for heat exhaustion, the agency said. Initially, the FAA said the crew reported a possible nose gear problem before landing but later amended that to say no issues were noted ahead of time after a review of air controller tapes. The 737 has a conventional hydraulic landing gear system -- a unit under each wing and a steerable wheel that extends from under the nose. Pilots can land safely with only the main gear operable as those wheels absorb the weight of the plane when it first meets the runway. The nose is then set down for the remainder of the landing roll. Nose gear problems on commercial jets occur from time to time, but the crew normally would be alerted to any issue during approach by warning lights and would have time to abort a landing or come in on just the back wheels. Southwest is the biggest domestic airline and flies only 737s. It has more than 600 of the workhorse aircraft in its fleet. Monday's incident followed a runway crash of an Asiana Airlines jetliner in San Francisco last month. Investigators in that crash will not determine a cause for several months at least, but initial attention has focused on actions of the crew during approach.

"(CNN) -- One of the first photos it sent home showed a self-portrait of its shadow. The dark gray specter of machinery against a lighter grainy backdrop showed up minutes after the news of its arrival, as if to say ""I'm here!"" With its cameras as our eyes, it opened our minds to un-roved territory. If you're a NASA engineer, you might even call it ""she."" Curiosity, NASA's most sophisticated and complex Mars rover, touched down on the Red Planet on the morning of August 6, 2012 (August 5 if you're in Pacific Daylight Time). The $2.5 billion mission set out to explore Gale Crater, which was thought to have once hosted flowing water, and find out if that environment was once habitable. Spoiler alert: It was. But that's not all the rover found while traveling 1.6 kilometers across Mars' barren surface during its 12 months on the planet. Curiosity has collected 190 gigabits of data and sent back more than 36,700 full images and 35,000 thumbnail images, NASA said. The rover has also fired more than 75,000 laser shots to help scientists analyze the composition of material, and collected samples from two rocks. NASA scientists joke that the ""warranty"" on Curiosity is two years, since that was the rover's design specification, said Ashwin Vasavada, deputy project scientist for the Mars Science Laboratory Mission. But other robotic vehicles have far outlasted their projected lifetimes. NASA landed twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity on Mars in 2004, and Opportunity is still chugging along. (Spirit stopped communicating in 2010). Now, Curiosity is on its way to Mount Sharp, a three-mile-high structure made of layers that, scientists believe, recorded Mars' geological history. ""It's a lot of work and a lot of people involved, but it's wonderful in the sense that it's really capable scientifically,"" Vasavada said of the rover. ""We're always amazed at how much we can do through this robot."" To mark the anniversary of its first year on Mars, Curiosity played ""Happy Birthday"" to itself Monday night, using an on-board instrument to beep out the tune. No word on whether anyone was listening. Here are five fascinating milestones from Curiosity's first 12 months: . 1. OMG, it actually landed. #mindblown. How do you land a two-ton, car-sized rover on another planet? Engineers thought about it a lot, and came up with a complex plan requiring a sky crane and the world's largest supersonic parachute. The acrobatic maneuvers required to get it safely to the ground were dubbed the ""seven minutes of terror,"" as featured in a NASA video simulation depicting just how many things had to go right to get the rover on the ground in one piece. Adam Steltzner, lead engineer overseeing the rover's arrival, told reporters a few days before the big night, ""I promise you it is the least crazy of the methods you could use to get a rover the size of Curiosity on Mars."" For the social media generation, this was our moon landing. The Internet went wild over a rover flight director who showed up for work on landing night with a mohawk, got hailed as ""Mohawk Guy,"" and later received a shout-out from President Barack Obama. Curiosity itself has a verified Twitter account (with 1.3 million followers), and tweeted that night, ""I'm safely on the surface of Mars. GALE CRATER I AM IN YOU!!! #MSL."" ""The overall highlight, I think, even a year later, still is planning successfully and seeing Gale Crater for the first time,"" Vasavada said. He added: ""We landed much more smoothly than we ever rehearsed it."" 2. Life on Mars could have existed. This was the major science highlight of Curiosity's inaugural Martian year, Vasavada said. Although this discovery builds upon previous ideas, Curiosity provided enough confirmation for scientists to finally come out and say it: The environment Curiosity has been exploring was once habitable. ""We now know Mars offered favorable conditions for microbial life billions of years ago,"" said the mission's project scientist, John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology. Curiosity became the first robot to drill on another planet, and the powder on the drill bit gave the scientists sufficient evidence to say that life could have survived in that area. The drill material had chemicals important for life in it, including sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon. Also excitingly for scientists, the sample contained a type of clay that forms in the presence of water. The rover's Mast Camera (Mastcam) additionally spotted evidence of water-bearing minerals in the Yellowknife Bay area where Curiosity first drilled. Scientists detected minerals using the camera's infrared-imaging capability. Gallery: Curiosity's best photos of the Red Planet . This area that Curiosity has been exploring is part of an alluvial fan, a formation of debris left by a river that once flowed into the crater, scientists say. ""We investigated the fan and found evidence that there was very likely an intermittent lake that had freshwater at one point,"" Vasavada said. 3. Mars is red on top, gray below. That material in the drill bit that the rover used to probe rock wasn't the same orange color that's so familiar to us from the rover's photography. Instead, it was gray, scientists said in February. ""You can probably bet that when things turn orange, it's because there's a rusting process of some kind going on that oxidizes the iron in the rock,"" Joel Hurowitz, sampling system scientist for Curiosity at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said at the time. 4. The planet's atmosphere was destroyed a long time ago. Using instruments on board Curiosity, scientists determined that the Martian atmosphere hasn't changed much in the last 4 billion years, and during that whole time it has been thin, as well as inhospitable to life as we know it. Initially, however, after the planet formed 4.5 billion years ago, the planet's atmosphere was 100 times denser than the Earth's atmosphere, scientists say. Their results were published in the journal Science in July. We could learn even more about the atmosphere from NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission orbiter, which is expected to launch in November. This spacecraft will have techniques to measure the current rate of loss of the atmosphere. 5. Radiation makes the trip to Mars dangerous for humans. Curiosity spent 253 days getting to Mars in 2012. During that time, the mission (officially called Mars Science Laboratory) was collecting data about radiation on the journey to the Red Planet using the Radiation Assessment Detector device. An analysis of this data, published in the journal Science in May, found that Mars-bound pioneers would be exposed to radiation levels that could effectively retire astronauts under NASA's current standards. ""The radiation environment in deep space is several hundred times what it is on Earth, and that's even inside a shielded spacecraft,"" said Cary Zeitlin, principal scientist for the Martian Radiation Environment Experiment. Scientists are working on faster engines to shorten the trip to Mars, and may be able to conceive of a spacecraft with better shielding. 501 days in space with your spouse: Could you handle it? What's next? Drive, drive, drive! The rover's second year will be mostly about the five-mile drive to Mount Sharp, Vasavada said. So far, Curiosity has stopped a lot to test out its instruments, collecting and analyzing samples and exploring particular areas. Now, it will drive as far as it can every day -- but not at Earthly highway speeds. Vasavada's hope is to get the rover to Mount Sharp by next summer. During the drive, the rover will continue snapping photos, and the meteorological instruments will still take measurements. Curiosity will stop if it spots anything -- a structure or formation, or the improbable Martian -- that looks interesting to scientists. In 2020, another NASA rover is planned to join the small fleet of human-made vehicles on Mars. This one may be able to collect samples for potential return to Earth, and test technology relevant to human exploration. Meanwhile, the Opportunity rover rolls along, in its 10th year, exploring Mars on the opposite side of the planet from Curiosity. None of these rovers may ever meet. But perhaps their tracks will mark the paths where humans will someday tread. Buzz Aldrin: Get to Mars within 20 years .

"(CNN) -- NBC News veteran John Palmer -- who worked the White House beat during two presidential administrations and anchored the network's initial coverage of the space shuttle Challenger disaster -- died Saturday, the network announced. The Kingsport, Tennessee, native, 77, passed away after a brief illness, according to NBC. ""John was a brilliant, brave and tireless journalist who guided viewers through many of the most significant events of the past half-century -- from the early days of the civil rights movement through the tragedy of 9/11,"" NBC News said in a statement. ""He covered five presidents and traveled to every corner of the world, always showing the empathy and compassion that helped set him apart."" A graduate of Northwestern University and Columbia University, Palmer joined NBC in 1962. He spent considerable time overseas earlier in his tenure with the network, including in Beirut during the October 1973 Arab-Israeli war and in Paris between 1976 and 1979. By 1980, Palmer was back in the United States -- including his reporting on the failed attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran, which earned him the Merriman Smith Memorial Award for presidential news coverage -- as a White House correspondent. He was a news anchor on NBC's ""Today"" from 1982 to 1989. Palmer interviewed the likes of Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat, legendary medical researcher Jonas Salk and Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan as the anchor of ""Instant Recall,"" a nationally syndicated news program, starting in 1990. That was the year he left NBC, going on to work parts of three years with Monitor Radio and Television as an anchor and correspondent. Palmer rejoined NBC in January 1995, staying with the network through his retirement in 2002. News of Palmer's death spurred an outpouring of admiration from people around the news media landscape. The Washington Post's Dan Balz called the late NBC stalwart ""a terrific journalist"" and ""very good man."" Deborah Norville, who replaced Palmer as news anchor on the ""Today"" show, recalled via Twitter him being ""kind, welcoming (and) helpful to me years ago."" CBS News' Mark Knoller echoed many in calling Palmer a ""great gentleman and a great reporter,"" while former Atlantic and Bloomberg reporter Jared Keller described him as ""a wonderful friend and one of my journalistic role models.""

"(CNN) -- For all of our post-2012 election talk about the changing culture, the changing demographics and, perhaps, a changing party, preliminary thoughts out of D.C. about the 2016 election have us headed toward not much change at all: Clinton vs Bush ... again. I am as intrigued by the prospects of these two juggernauts, Jeb and Hillary, locking ideological horns as I am repulsed by the thought of half of my life being dominated by two family names. One, Clinton, has risen from the ashes after the White House. The other name, Bush, is so toxic that the past two Republican nominees avoided saying it in public, opting instead to skip their combined 12 years in office and head straight back to Reagan. Face it, Hillary has baggage, but Jeb has Bush, and that, moreso than his record as governor of Florida or ideas for the future, will determine, at least at the beginning, how he is received. That explains why more than a few conservatives were not thrilled to hear that he was thinking of running. Is it fair for a 59-year-old man to be judged by the actions, or inaction, of his father and brother? Of course not. And we certainly wouldn't judge Hillary solely based on our opinion of Bill. Yet, as we know, politics is a lot of things but fair is not one of them. I can already see some super PAC funded by -- oh, that's right, they don't have to tell us -- creating ads morphing George H.W. Bush into George W. Bush and then Jeb Bush, with a Michael Moore voiceover saying, ""same name, same failed policies."" Politics: Jeb Bush Jr. hopes dad will run for president . That would be great for Clinton, or whoever eventually claims the Democratic nomination, but not necessarily good for the country. It's not a good thing for the country when voters are robbed of the opportunity to hear smart ideas for superficial reasons. Like Howard Dean's infamous yelp or Jon Huntsman's quiet demeanor. And in my book, discounting the idea of a candidate because of his brother's shortcomings is superficial. If someone doesn't like Jeb Bush, let it be because of the record of Jeb, not because of the record of everyone in the White House named Bush. There are things I like about Jeb and things I don't, but both are based upon what he has done. And if we want an election based upon substance instead of that GOP primary circus we had in 2011, that is how we need to judge both Clinton and Bush. Assuming, of course, it is Clinton and Bush. The speculation is here, but the reality is years away, and a lot can happen. Politics: Behind the scenes of Clinton's ""shuttle diplomacy"" Jeb may not find the conservative support he needs because many view him as a RINO (Republican in name only) while Hillary says she's tired. (And I'm sure she is ... tired of not being president.) We heard a lot of talk about change after this year's election. The biggest change that's needed is a move away from hyperbolic reactions to inconsequential events. In August 1988, Jeb's father, in a brief meeting with President Reagan, introduced three of his grandchildren to the Gipper this way: ""These are Jebby's kids from Florida, the little brown ones."" Call me crazy, but I doubt at any point in Jeb's life would he introduce his children to anyone as ""the little brown ones."" This isn't to paint the father as anything scandalous but to make the point that Jeb is his own person, with his own thoughts and own ideas. Earlier this year, Jeb Bush spoke his own mind, calling the rhetoric during the Republican primary disturbing and saying that his party was behaving stupidly with regard to Latino voters. I don't recall his brother or dad being that bold in criticizing his own party. Jeb deserves to be credited, or discredited, on his own merit, not on the record of the men who served as president before him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: For all the talk of change, 2016 may be another Bush-Clinton race .

"(CNN) -- Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's Twitter account and VK Russian social networking profile have drawn heavy public scrutiny, but he left another, more hidden social media trail: a deleted Instagram account that sources close to him tell CNN once belonged to the accused Boston bomber. The Instagram account, with the user name ""jmaister1,"" no longer exists, and friends of Tsarnaev's say it was deleted only recently. An Instagram spokesman declined to comment on the account or disclose when the account was deleted. CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem says the account could be significant. ""If I were an investigator right now, obviously the platform he deleted matters the most,"" she said. Traces of the jmaister1 account were still visible this week in Google's Web cache and on other archiving sites. Digital sleuths often use those tools to find glimpses of deleted material. When oversharing online can get you arrested . ""It's exactly like an archive,"" tech entrepreneur and programmer Sam Altman explained. ""So no matter what changes were made to the page today, on the current server, Google has this sort of imprint from a couple of weeks ago."" Tsarnaev's complete account could not be recovered with those tools. Google's cache stores the pages it indexes for variable lengths of time: sometimes days, sometimes weeks. The digital traces that remain show that Tsarnaev added a ""like"" on several photos referring to Chechnya that were posted by other Instagram users. One shows Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev, a onetime government official who later masterminded terrorist attacks against Russia. Basayev was killed in 2006. Another pro-Chechnya image that Tsarnaev ""liked"" carries a string of hashtags including #FreeChechenia #Jihad #Jannah #ALLAH #Jesus and #God. An academic Chechnya expert whom CNN consulted said the images illustrated a familiarity with Chechen politics and iconography. Tsarnaev's Instagram account wasn't widely known; CNN spoke with several friends of his who said they were unaware of its existence. Two of his high-school classmates, however, spoke about the account and said he used it to keep in touch with a close-knit group of school friends. The two classmates say they are shocked by -- and in some cases skeptical of -- the charges being levied at the friend they knew as ""Jahar."" As one said, ""Jahar was the last person you'd expect to do this. I've honestly never heard anybody say anything bad about him."" Since Tsarnaev's account was deleted, little of what he wrote and posted remains publicly visible, but Kayyem expects investigators to take a closer look at whatever data they can reconstruct. ""Were there clues embedded in the combination of images that can tell us something about what Dzhokhar was thinking?"" she asked. ""Some of those pictures are very benign. Some of them standing alone don't mean anything."" Instagram makes clear in its terms of service that it will turn its records over to law enforcement officials when it receives a valid subpoena or search warrant. ""Given the volume of real-time content on Instagram, some information may only be stored for a short period of time,"" Instagram says on its site.

"(CNN) -- They look like typical Mormon missionaries. Dressed in black pants, white shirts and black ties and carrying backpacks, the two men walk up a driveway and step though a gate. But their mission was anything but godly, say Las Vegas police, which released images of the men on Tuesday. The two are accused of posing as missionaries to rob a family home. They knocked on the victim's door asking to talk about religion, police say. After about five minutes, they allegedly jumped and punched the homeowner. ""Something went around my neck. A hand went around my mouth, and I screamed for my wife,"" Terence Delucia told CNN affiliate KTNV. His screams woke his wife and daughter. Both reportedly hid in their closets. The two men took about $3,000 the family had been saving for a trip to Disneyland, along with three iPads and an iPod, KTNV reported. Then they fled. Police describe the first suspect as a white male, between 22 and 28 years old, 5 feet 7 inches or 5 feet 8 inches tall, and 130 to 145 pounds. The second suspect is a black male, between 22 and 28 years old, 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet 1 inch tall, and 190 to 210 pounds.

"(CNN) -- Two days of testimony by a former partner of reputed mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger ended dramatically Tuesday when Kevin Weeks and Bulger -- once so close that they spoke nearly every day for more than a decade -- shouted at one another across a federal courtroom in Boston. Bulger's lawyer, J.W. Carney, tried to portray Weeks as an opportunist who knew how to manipulate the system, someone who cut a deal with prosecutors to serve just five years in prison for aiding and abetting five killings, several of which, Weeks testified, he saw Bulger commit. ""You won against the system,"" said Carney. ""What did I win? What did I win,"" Weeks said, his voice sounding strained and tired. ""Five people are dead."" Asked whether that bothered him, Weeks shot back, ""We killed people that were rats, and I had the two biggest rats right next to me ..."" At that, Bulger turned and hissed, ""You suck."" ""F--- you, OK,"" snapped Weeks. ""F--- you, too,"" shouted Bulger as the jury watched. ""What do you want to do?"" said Weeks, his eyes locked on Bulger, who was flushed and staring right back. U.S. marshals stood between the two men, and U.S. District Judge Denise Casper instructed them both to follow the rules of the court before Weeks was dismissed, his testimony over. Bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades when prosecutors say he ran Boston's Irish mob. He also faces charges of extortion, racketeering and money laundering. Why we can't get enough of the gangster life . Prosecutors spent most of the morning questioning Weeks about killings he said he saw Bulger commit. Weeks recounted to the court graphic details of how Bulger killed Arthur ""Bucky"" Barrett, Joey McIntyre and Deborah Hussey. In the summer of 1983, Weeks said Bulger organized a meeting with Barrett under the guise of having stolen diamonds that he needed to have taken off his hands. When Barrett arrived at the house, Bulger, his crime partner Steve Flemmi and Weeks were waiting. The group then chained Barrett to a chair and grilled him for hours about a rival gang and local drug dealings, Weeks said. Barrett tried to buy his way out of being killed, describing to Bulger where he had hidden $40,000 in cash. Weeks said Bulger left the house to pick up the cash while he and another associate watched Barrett. When Bulger returned to the house, he instructed Barrett to walk down to the basement. Then Bulger put the gun to the back of Barrett's head, pulled the trigger, and according to Weeks, ""nothing happened."" When Bulger realized that the gun's safety was still on, he removed it and shot Barrett. Weeks said he also saw Bulger shoot McIntyre in the same house where he killed Barrett. His methods were the same, too -- he chained McIntyre to a chair, where he admitted to letting authorities capture a boat carrying 40 tons of marijuana slated for sale by Bulger and his gang. ""Jim Bulger took out a rope and started strangling McIntyre; it was too thick, it just gagged him and then Jim asked the victim, 'do you want one to the head?' "" Weeks said. McIntyre said, ""Yes sir,"" and Bulger shot him five times. Weeks said he also witnessed the killing of Deborah Hussey in that same home. On a day in early 1985, Weeks said he came downstairs after hearing a ""thud"" and saw Bulger strangling Hussey, whose lips turned blue as her eyes rolled back into her head. After each of the three slayings, Flemmi prepared the bodies to be buried by removing the victims' teeth. This practice earned him the nickname ""Dr. Mengele,"" after the infamous Nazi physician, Weeks said. The victims were buried in the basement of the house only to be moved to another makeshift grave because the owners of the house were selling it. ""It was cheaper to move the bodies than buy house,"" Weeks explained. Most of the cross-examination focused on Weeks' decision to testify against his former crime partners, including Bulger, Steven Flemmi and rogue FBI agent John Connolly. Weeks acknowledged that Bulger hated informants, explaining South Boston's code as: ""You never give up your friends. You never rat on your enemies. You take care of your own business."" At times Weeks seemed apologetic, saying he had hoped Bulger would never be caught ""so he wouldn't be in the circus we're in."" After escaping a 1995 indictment, allegedly on a tip from a rogue FBI agent, Bulger went into hiding for 16 years, landing himself on the FBI's most wanted list before being arrested with his girlfriend in Santa Monica, California, in 2011. However, Weeks defended his actions, saying he had been shown Bulger's informant file by fellow South Bostonian, or ""Southie,"" and disgraced FBI agent John Connolly and that, ""You can't rat on a rat."" He says no one has given him any trouble since he returned to South Boston, not even the Italian mafia, which allegedly continues to operate. In 'Whitey' Bulger's gang, death was way of life . When Bulger's lawyer suggested Weeks had lied at times, Weeks shot back almost in disbelief: ""I've been lying my whole life. I'm a criminal."" But he clarified that his lies were confined to smaller matters, not the testimony he has provided at nearly five trials. Carney asked, ""What lies do you tell your wife?"" ""I'm not cheating,"" said Weeks by way of explanation. ""Does she know you're lying?"" asked Carney. ""We're divorced,"" Weeks responded.","Kevin Weeks, former partner of James ""Whitey"" Bulger, testifies against reputed mob boss .

"(CNN) -- Charles Saatchi told a London newspaper Tuesday that he went to police voluntarily over an incident in which he grabbed his wife, celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, by the throat to avoid it ""hanging over all of us for months."" The furor over the incident dominated the British press Tuesday, a day after Saatchi accepted a police warning related to the case. In a statement to The Evening Standard newspaper, for which he is a columnist, Saatchi said: ""Although Nigella made no complaint I volunteered to go to Charing Cross station and take a police caution after a discussion with my lawyer because I thought it was better than the alternative of this hanging over all of us for months.""

Opinion: The rich and famous are not immune to domestic abuse . Saatchi, age 70, looked stony-faced as he left his home in central London earlier Tuesday and declined to respond to questions from waiting journalists. London's Metropolitan Police said a 70-year-old man ""accepted a caution for assault"" at a police station Monday afternoon but did not name Saatchi. ""Officers from the community safety unit at Westminster were aware of the Sunday People article which published on Sunday 16th June and carried out an investigation,"" a Metropolitan Police spokesman told CNN. ""This afternoon Monday 17th June, a 70-year-old man voluntarily attended a central London police station and accepted a caution for assault,"" the spokesman said. CNN contacted Saatchi's company for comment but has not received a response. According to a UK government website, a caution is issued for minor crimes. ""Cautions are given to adults aged 18 or over for minor crimes -- eg writing graffiti on a bus shelter,"" the website says. ""You have to admit an offence and agree to be cautioned. If you don't agree, you can be arrested and charged. ""A caution is not a criminal conviction, but it could be used as evidence of bad character if you go to court for another crime."" Sunday People, part of the stable of tabloids published by the Mirror Group, published the photos Sunday of Lawson and Saatchi at a restaurant. The tabloid's website includes the caption: ""Nigella Lawson attacked in public by Charles Saatchi."" Earlier, a representative for Lawson confirmed that the chef and her children had moved out of their home. 'Playful tiff' Saatchi gave his version of events Monday to The Evening Standard. London police: Man accepts warning in Nigella Lawson incident . ""About a week ago, we were sitting outside a restaurant having an intense debate about the children, and I held Nigella's neck repeatedly while attempting to emphasize my point,"" Saatchi told the paper. ""There was no grip, it was a playful tiff. The pictures are horrific but give a far more drastic and violent impression of what took place. Nigella's tears were because we both hate arguing, not because she had been hurt,"" he added. ""We had made up by the time we were home. The paparazzi were congregated outside our house after the story broke yesterday morning, so I told Nigella to take the kids off till the dust settled."" The restaurant involved told CNN that its employees did not witness any such incident. Lawson's Facebook page is filled with messages from fans expressing their support for her. Lawson is known as the ""queen of food porn."" She has written numerous successful cookbooks and hosted TV shows. With the furor making headlines, UK domestic violence groups made the point that domestic abuse is an enduring and widespread issue. ""Domestic violence is a massive social problem in this country,"" Sandra Horley, chief executive of UK domestic violence charity Refuge, said in a statement. ""Last year over one million women were abused. Every week in England and Wales, two women are killed by current or former partners. ""There are still so many myths and misconceptions surrounding this horrific crime. People often think that it only happens in poor families ... but the truth is that domestic violence affects women of all ages, classes and backgrounds. Abusive men are just as likely to be lawyers, accountants and judges as they are cleaners or unemployed."" Horley said that perpetrators of domestic violence ""frequently try to minimize or deny their behaviour,"" but that violent incidents rarely occur only once and can escalate to more extreme behavior. ""Research shows that strangulation is a key risk factor for domestic homicide,"" she said. ""Last year, almost 50% of the women we supported had been strangled or choked by their abusers.""

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Indicted real estate developer and political fundraiser Tony Rezko, whose links to Sen. Barack Obama have brought his name into the national spotlight, was arrested Monday morning, an FBI spokesman said. Rezko was taken into custody by the FBI at his Wilmette, Illinois, home just outside Chicago following a government motion to revoke his bond, said FBI spokesman Tom Simon. Rezko -- whom Sen. Hillary Clinton referred to in a debate as having run a ""slum landlord business"" -- has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of conspiracy, influence peddling and demanding kickbacks from companies seeking Illinois state business. Obama, speaking Sunday to ABC's ""This Week,"" described Rezko as ""a friend of mine, a supporter, who I've known for 20 years."" Rezko has contributed to the campaigns of numerous Democrats, including Obama -- though the Illinois senator has vowed to give up all funds connected to Rezko. Obama has already given to charity more than $80,000 in campaign contributions linked to Rezko. When asked about news reports suggesting he may have received more money than that connected to Rezko, Obama said, ""What we've done is we've traced any funds that we know of that we think were connected to him. And if there any other funds that were connected to him that we're not aware of, then we will certainly return them. It's in our interest to do so."" Obama said in a debate that as an attorney he did just about five hours of work for a Rezko project. Obama has not been accused of any legal wrongdoing. ""I did make a mistake by purchasing a small strip of property from him, at a time where, at that point, he was under the cloud of a potential investigation,"" Obama told ABC Sunday. Shortly after his election to the U.S. Senate, Obama bought a house for $300,000 below the asking price. The same day, Rezko's wife bought the lot next door for full price. Months later, Obama bought a sliver of the Rezko land to expand his yard. As a state senator, Obama wrote letters supporting some Rezko deals.

"(CNN) -- Murder charges against an elderly woman with dementia were dropped in New Jersey Superior Court on Monday after evaluations by multiple doctors and experts determined that she was not fit to stand trial. Judge Terrence Cook dismissed the charges against Fredricka Rosa, 78, in Burlington Superior Court. She was charged with first-degree murder after allegedly shooting her husband, Valpa C. Rosa, in July 2012. She was also charged with unlawful possession of a weapon, according to court documents. Rosa was diagnosed with dementia four years ago. After Rosa was arrested, she underwent three evaluations by state and defense experts, who deemed her not competent to stand trial due to her dementia. Three doctors were also consulted and came to the same conclusion, said Burlington County Deputy Public Defender Cedric Edwards. The Burlington County prosecutor's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment. ""I think that's appropriate (that charges have been dropped),"" Edwards told CNN, noting that Rosa's dementia had progressed so far that she seemed unaware of why she was in court. ""I'm not even sure she knows her husband is dead. After the hearing, she wanted to know where her husband was,"" Edwards said. Rosa reportedly shot her husband with his own gun. He had four guns -- two handguns and two shotguns -- that he kept in the house for personal protection, according to her daughter, Rosetta. She said her father obtained gun locks but never used them. While it is unclear what Fredricka Rosa's motive was, Edwards believes it may have been connected to abuse that Valpa Rosa reportedly inflicted on his family. ""I get the feeling that they felt the father was overbearing and abusive towards the mother and towards (their children),"" Edwards said.

"(CNN) -- Navy Yard gunman Aaron Alexis left a trail of so-called red flags that, in hindsight, seem quite glaring, even if the impetus for this week's deadly rampage remains murky. For almost 10 years, he showed that he was troubled -- and had a predilection for violence -- even if friends and family members familiar with his emotional problems seem floored that he was disturbed enough to shoot and kill 12 people in Washington on Monday. They may seem like minor episodes when compared with Monday's shootings, but when pieced together, they provide ample fodder for critics who question how Alexis maintained the security clearance that gave him access to the Navy Yard. 2004 'blackout' On the morning of May 6, 2004, Alexis fired his Glock into two tires of a Honda Accord near a Seattle home where he was staying. He was arrested and charged with malicious mischief. Alexis told police the car's owner, a construction worker, had disrespected him, leading to an anger-fueled ""blackout,"" according to a police report. His father told Seattle police that Alexis had post-traumatic stress disorder after working as ""an active participant in rescue attempts"" after the 9/11 attacks, the report said. Alexis' dad further told police his son had anger management issues related to PTSD. ""It appears as if investigators were aware of the incident, interviewed him and were satisfied that it did not preclude granting the clearance,"" a senior naval officer said of Alexis' 2007 enlistment. Navy chief defends program that screens contractors after audit shows problems . 2008 nightclub arrest . About five months after being granted a ""secret"" security clearance -- the year after joining the Navy -- Alexis was kicked out of a metro Atlanta club for damaging the furnishings, according to a police report. Outside, Alexis cursed profusely, and when he defied police orders to stop, they arrested him for disorderly conduct, the report said. The arrest was integral in the Navy's decision to try to end his military career, which wouldn't culminate for another three years, but Alexis was never stripped of his security clearance. 2010 gunfire incident . Fort Worth, Texas, police arrested Alexis in September 2010 after he allegedly fired a bullet through his ceiling into a neighbor's apartment. According to records, he told police he accidentally fired the weapon while cleaning it. He was calm when police arrived. He was never charged. Texas was Alexis' last official address, and friend Kristi Suthamtewakul said he spoke Thai, practiced meditation at a Buddhist temple and participated in his community. But he also hinted at a residual anger. ""One of the things he talked about was 9/11 and how he was there and he saw the towers come down from where he was working,"" Suthamtewakul said. ""He had an anger towards the terrorists who did that and took innocent people."" 2011 Navy discharge . When the Navy began pursuing Alexis' general discharge, a dismissal that could have affected his security clearance, he had eight instances of misconduct on his record. Among them were insubordination, disorderly conduct, drunkenness and unauthorized absences from work, a U.S. defense official said. He eventually left the service with a less-severe honorable discharge because there were no convictions or evidence to necessitate a general discharge, the official said. Alexis was allowed to keep his security clearance so long as he used it in another official capacity within two years, which he did after gaining employment in September 2012 with a contractor, refreshing computer systems in Japan. In recent weeks, he sought help from a Veterans Affairs hospital in Rhode Island, his second such visit to a VA facility. While authorities are investigating the circumstances of those visits, sources differ on why Alexis wanted help, variously saying he was either hearing voices or having trouble sleeping. Suthamtewakul recalled Alexis expressing impatience with the VA: ""He was very frustrated with the government and how as a veteran he didn't feel like he was getting treated right or fairly."" Vetting military contractors: How did Navy Yard gunman get in? August 'microwave machine' allegation . Last month, police in Newport, Rhode Island, responded to a harassment complaint at a Marriott hotel. There, Alexis told them that someone ""had sent three people to follow him and to talk, keep him awake and send vibrations into his body,"" a police report said. These individuals had followed him to three hotels in the area, Alexis told police, and spoke to him through the walls and floor and used ""some sort of microwave machine"" that sent ""vibrations through the ceiling, penetrating his body so he cannot fall asleep,"" according to the August 7 report. Alexis also told authorities, according to the report, that ""he does not have a history of mental illness in his family and that he never had any sort of mental episode."" Police notified Navy officials, the report said. Asked for comment, Naval Station Newport officials referred CNN to the FBI, which had no comment. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Chelsea J. Carter and Jake Tapper contributed to this report.","Numerous incidents in Aaron Alexis' past show that he was troubled, prone to violence .

"(CNN) -- Three people were killed and 19 injured when a bus carrying about 40 passengers to an Indianapolis church overturned Saturday afternoon. ""I saw bodies everywhere, kids in shock and disbelief,"" said John Murphy, who had stopped along the northern Indianapolis road. ""There was an awful lot of blood."" The bus was returning from a camp in Michigan, said Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard. Among those killed were the youth pastor for Colonial Hills Baptist Church, Chad Phelps, and his wife, Courtney, said Jeff Leffew, a church deacon, at a press conference Sunday. Courtney Phelps was pregnant, and the couple were expecting their second child next month, Leffew said. Tonya Weindorf, a mother of five who was a chaperone on the trip, also died, he said. ""They are with God in heaven right now. We know that without a doubt,"" Leffew said, ""but we grieve for the fact that they are not here with us."" The deacon asked for prayers and support as the church and victims recover. ""We're going to have a long road,"" he said. Most of those on board were teenagers, according to Indianapolis Fire Department spokeswoman Rita Burris. The driver told witnesses that the vehicle's brakes failed as he was trying to make a left turn, she said. The bus ended up on its side on a concrete road barrier with luggage and other debris strewn on the roadway. Indianapolis police spokesman Michael Hewitt said two passengers were airlifted from the crash, nine were treated and released at the scene of the accident and others were taken to local hospitals. Seven teenagers are being treated at the main hospital and children's hospital at Indiana University Health, according to Sally Winter, public relations coordinator for IU Health. One is in critical condition, and the six others are in good condition, Winter said. The bus is believed to be the only vehicle involved in the crash, according to Hewitt. ""Please pray for all involved,"" the Indianapolis Fire Department tweeted. Rose Vorenkamp was driving when she saw the overturned bus and saw ""people running"" to help. Having been trained through her job in first aid and CPR, she moved closer and saw what she described as a girl trapped under the bus, bloodied passengers with head injuries and at least one person with a dislocated shoulder. The fire department noted that four passers-by arrived first to help, including one who helped pull the driver from the bus. Those helping were met soon by firefighters and crews from 12 ambulances and four helicopters. By then, traffic in the area had been shut down, and all the casualties had been sent to local hospitals. Family members subsequently gathered at the church, Colonial Hills Baptist, where the bus had been heading. The scene there was ""remarkably positive, very sad, but at the same time very together,"" Ballard said. ""Some of the teenagers are hurting very badly; you can see it in their faces,"" the mayor said. Some people at the church thanked him for visiting and generally appeared strong, Ballard added, surmising that ""it's very clear that they are being guided by their faith right now."" Still, the mayor added, they might have some tough days ahead of them. ""The next few days are always very, very painful as they come out of the shock of it,"" he said.","NEW: Deacon says youth pastor, his wife and a chaperone among three dead in bus crash .

"(CNN) -- The 23-year-old woman in Harare, Zimbabwe, said she could talk, but only briefly. It was 3:30 p.m. there and she had to be home before the 6 p.m. curfew, she said. Movement for Democratic Change official Fredrick Shaba is treated for stab wounds after an attack last week. ""I should be home in an hour, hour and a half. If I'm not home by then, it means trouble,"" she said Tuesday. Zimbabweans are accustomed to violence, but the beatings and bloodshed have been epidemic since early April, days after opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai pushed longtime President Robert Mugabe into a runoff election for the nation's top post. Tsvangirai dropped out of the race this week, citing intimidation and vote-rigging. He is now in hiding at the Dutch Embassy, uncertain like most Zimbabweans whether the violence would continue. Zimbabweans and outside observers say militias loyal to Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) have engaged in intimidation tactics designed to deter Tsvangirai's supporters from casting ballots.  Watch people run in fear » . ""Violence has been taking place mainly in the countryside, people having their hands chopped off, fingers broken, etc. -- the reason for that being to prevent them from voting in the runoff,"" said a journalist Tuesday in an e-mail from Harare. Both the woman and journalist requested anonymity out of fear they could be targeted for talking. ""If you talk too much, they come looking for you, they hunt you down, they beat you,"" the woman told CNN. Rapes and maimings are being reported across the country. On Monday, the United Nations Security Council condemned ""the campaign of violence,"" which it said was responsible for scores of dead opposition activists and the beatings of thousands.  Watch why the U.N. says a fair election is impossible » . ""There are so many people who are dying right now. We're not even sure how many people have died,"" said the woman in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital. In his letter announcing he was dropping out of the presidential race, Tsvangirai said at least 86 people have been killed, 10,000 wounded and 200,000 people displaced. At a rally Monday in Chipinge, a rural town near the Mozambique border, Mugabe brushed off the death toll, calling Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change a creation of the West. ""Britain and her allies are telling a lot of lies about Zimbabwe, saying a lot of people are dying. These are all lies because they want to build a situation to justify their intervention in Zimbabwe,"" Mugabe said, according to the state-run Herald newspaper.  Watch how past interventions in Africa have fared » . In his Tuesday letter, Tsvangirai -- who has called the election ""a sham"" -- said the impossibility of a fair election convinced him to bow out. ""The violence, intimidation, death, destruction of property is just too much for anyone to dream of a free and fair election, let alone expect our people to be able to freely and independently express... themselves,"" he wrote. ""For this reason, my party and I have resolved that we cannot be part to this flawed process."" The journalist was in the capital Sunday when ZANU-PF youths attacked an opposition rally at a stadium, just hours before Tsvangirai announced his exit from the poll. Despite a Saturday court order allowing the rally, the militias blocked the roads as MDC supporters arrived, he said. ""Those who tried to ask the reasons why, they were assaulted,"" the journalist said. ""Later, some MDC supporters came chanting songs and they were beaten up by the ZANU-PF militia with logs, stones or anything that was in sight."" Mugabe has denied accusations of violence and has countered that MDC supporters are inciting violence across Zimbabwe.  Watch how Londoners want to ""make Mugabe history"" » . The journalist said he has seen violence perpetrated by MDC faithful, but it is a recent phenomenon and usually retaliatory. ""I saw a ZANU-PF youth being beaten Sunday evening,"" the journalist said. ""He had been spotted at the rally venue and was then followed to his home in the evening by MDC youths."" The government-sponsored violence has scared people into carrying and wearing ZANU-PF regalia -- flags, bandanas and T-shirts bearing the national colors and emblazoned with ""100 percent empowerment."" Other popular slogans include ""WW,"" which means ""win or war,"" and the more blunt, ""June 27 Mugabe in office by whatever means."" ""WW means if ZANU-PF loses it goes to war,"" the journalist said. ""It is a threat or meant to confuse the electorate. It shows that ZANU-PF has nothing to sell to the people for them to vote for it, so they now resort to intimidation."" The journalist said he witnessed such saber-rattling at a ZANU-PF rally last week in Norton, about 19 miles southwest of Harare. ""People were told that they must not vote again for the MDC or there will be war,"" he said. ""They were told that there would be a camera seeing how they would have voted.""  See how the election unfolded » . Even MDC supporters are tying the red-yellow-and-green ZANU-PF bandanas around their neck or over their heads, said the woman in Harare. ""You need to move around with this,"" she said. ""If you're driving a car, you need to have this in your car. I have one in my car now. If you don't, they will think you're MDC and they will mess you up big time."" Added the journalist, ""Because of the violence taking place, people have been looking for ZANU-PF regalia to 'protect' themselves. The assumption is that if you are in ZANU-PF regalia, you support it."" Asked if hopes for Zimbabwe's future dissipated with Tsvangirai's departure from the race, the journalist said there are mixed emotions. Some are eager to vote Friday and want to ""finish off"" Mugabe, some are tired of the violence, some are hopeless and some are scared, he said. Others are relieved Tsvangirai dropped out because it could mean an end to the violence. ""Myself, I've lost hope,"" said the woman in Harare. Even if the violence were to vanish, Zimbabwe would remain crippled by its economy, long decimated by inflation and unemployment. Basic goods are scarce and expensive. Loaves of bread last year sold for about 5,000 Zimbabwean dollars, the woman said. The price then was steep because of skyrocketing inflation, but today, 5,000 Z-dollars would be a bargain.  Watch a Zimbabwean envoy warn against micromanagement » . Recently, she said, she saw bread selling for 550 million Z-dollars. ""That was quite reasonable,"" she said of food prices of late. The woman said she makes the equivalent of $10 a month. Though the official exchange rate is 7.5 billion Z-dollars to the U.S. dollar, the Harare woman said she has seen exchange rates as high as 15 billion to 1. Even if you have money, it's not guaranteed you can get basic necessities. The government has imposed price controls, forcing manufacturers to close their doors because they cannot make a living. ""Basically, there are no goods to talk about,"" the journalist said. ""Most commodities are now on the black market."" You could stand in line for two or three hours for bread and not get a slice, and the price for a loaf on the black market could be as much as 10 billion Z-dollars, the woman in Harare said, explaining that she has made the 300-mile drive to South Africa to pick up food because there were no real grocery options in Zimbabwe.  Watch Tsvangirai explain times are desperate » . ""The way our money has changed,"" she said, ""I've had a tough time keeping up."" There are questions about whether the southeastern African country's leaders can negotiate a settlement to mitigate Zimbabwe's turmoil. Mugabe said at a rally Tuesday that he would be ""open to discussion"" but only after the runoff, the Herald reported. Tsvangirai said Wednesday that he was open to considering a postponed election, or even a negotiated transition of power. Tsvangirai also said in his Tuesday letter, and reiterated Wednesday, that he would consider a new election. However, it would rely heavily on the oversight of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, which Tsvangirai has accused of espousing the philosophy ""that a president does not come to power through the electoral process, but rather, through the barrel of a gun."" Until the commission can ensure a free and fair election, Tsvangirai wrote Tuesday, ""the presidential election question remains unresolved.""","Journalist says he's seen ""people having their hands chopped off, fingers broken""

"(CNN) -- In another clear sign that the severely strained relations between the two sides is slowly improving, North Korea has agreed to a proposal from the South that they resume the reunion of families separated in the 1950-53 Korean War. The meetings would take place on September 19, during the Chuseok harvest festival, the North Korean news agency KCNA reported Sunday. North Korea set off months of unsettling tensions with a long-range rocket launch in December followed by an underground nuclear test in February. The North's menacing rhetoric against the United States and South Korea hit a fever pitch in March and April after the U.N. Security Council voted in March to slap tougher sanctions on the regime and amid U.S.-South Korean military drills in the region. The KCNA report said the North and the South, following an agreement to reopen the Kaesong Industrial Zone, will talk about the possibility of resuming cross-border tours at Mount Kumgang. The Kaesong Industrial Zone, is an industrial complex the two nations share. It's been closed since April when the North pulled out its workers. Mount Kumgang is a North Korean resort where a South Korean tourist was shot by a North Korean soldier in 2008 after allegedly walking into an off-limits area. The reunion will take place at the resort. ""The Kaesong Industrial Zone and the tours to Mt. Kumgang resort are valuable works common to the nation which should not be delayed as they are symbols of reconciliation, unity, reunification and prosperity,"" the KCNA report said. American imprisoned in North Korea moved to hospital . Bittersweet reunions . The tragedy of the divided families dates to the 1950-1953 Korean War, when the Cold War's division of the peninsula into two nations became permanent. Amid fighting, millions of Koreans became refugees -- either fleeing the violence or fearing political reprisals from one side or the other. In winter of 1950, an estimated 650,000 refugees fled North Korea when United Nations forces retreated in the face of a surprise Chinese offensive. There is no direct telephone or mail contact between the two Koreas, but some families in the South have managed to broker surreptitious voice and written contact with their relatives in the North in recent years, as North Korea's border with China has become more permeable and illegal cell phones have penetrated the insulated state. The first family reunions took place following a landmark summit between the two Koreas in 2000. Since then, 17,100 people representing 3,500 families have been reunited on more than a 18 separate occasions. The meetings are bittersweet; the chances of any of the divided family members meeting again are slim. The last such reunion took place in 2010. According to a report at the time, some 80,000 South Koreans registered with their government to join one of the infrequent reunions, but 40,000 people are believed to have passed away or given up hope, according to the South's Ministry of Unification. Numbers north of the Korean demilitarized zone are unknown. North Korean Mass Games: Why this year they're different . Kaesong closing . The shuttered Kaesong complex is one of the main casualties of the recent period of fiery threats and provocative moves by North Korea. In early April, Kim Jong Un's regime began blocking South Koreans from entering the manufacturing complex, which sits on the North's side of the heavily fortified border and houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies. Pyongyang then pulled out the more than 50,000 North Koreans who work in the zone's factories, saying it was temporarily suspending activity there. The North Korean decision to halt operations surprised some observers, since Kaesong was considered an important source of hard currency for Kim Jong Un's regime.

"(CNN) -- Never underestimate the little guy. At just 22 meters long, the new hi-tech America's Cup yacht is more than three meters shorter than its predecessor. But that hasn't stopped the $10 million boat -- dubbed AC72 after its 72-foot hull -- making big waves in the sailing world. The super sleek yacht makes its America's Cup debut this year, replacing the larger 25-meter ACC, which first raced in 1992. Along with its shorter hull, the new vessel will also have far fewer members on board -- down from around 17 to 11. But if you thought its smaller size and smaller crew made it less speedy, think again. The new yacht features two hulls, giving it the appearance of a ""flying boat,"" and helping it to cut across the water with ease. But with greater speed -- around 40 knots -- comes greater safety concerns. Earlier this year, British Olympic gold medalist Andrew ""Bart"" Simpson was killed when the AC72 he was training on capsized in San Francisco Bay.

"(CNN) -- What would you have done? Last month in Florida, a school bus driver witnessed a vicious assault on a 13-year-old boy. He radioed the bus dispatcher and frantically begged for assistance, as he feared the victim was being seriously injured. But he did not intervene. While the victim's physical injuries may heal, his psychological trauma will undoubtedly linger, including the harrowing knowledge that no one would help him. Teens trained to spot drama before it turns dangerous . But before we pile on the driver, let's be clear: The most egregious wrongdoers here are the violent teens. They victimized a boy horribly and wronged the agonized bystanders. The driver's anguish over his own inaction may be real and palpable, but should he still have done more? Obviously, he wasn't confident enough of his own physical ability to handle several violent teenagers, although he had a special responsibility to protect the children on that bus. We all want to think that we would disregard our own personal safety to help children, but in a highly charged moment, a bystander is forced to make an instant, possibly haunting judgment about risk and danger. Violence works both by crushing a victim and by intimidating others. When you're not there, it's easy to dismiss the terror, but for the bystander, it's often a lose-lose proposition. Fail to intervene, and it haunts you; intervene, and you may become the victim. Intervention requires bystanders to overcome the basic self-protective instinct that ensures their own survival, and that's probably why there's no one we admire more than those who disregard their own personal safety to help others. Teachers' lesson in heroism and healing . Despite that admiration, and despite our sense as adults that we need to protect children, many of us find that we do not, and cannot, intervene as bystanders. To complicate matters, some violent situations can actually be worsened when a bystander intervenes. My own research (PDF) at the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center at Bridgewater State University, and similar studies (PDF) at the Youth Voice Project at Penn State, have found that bystander interventions in bullying episodes frequently backfire. The bully, feeling publicly humiliated, takes revenge against the original victim. Knowing that you might worsen the victim's situation only makes these incidents more frustrating. If an adult shouldn't throw himself in the middle of a physical altercation, what else can he do? In the Florida situation, there was an immediate danger that required a response but not necessarily significant physical risk. A recent study in the journal Aggressive Behavior found that interveners typically used nonviolent methods. If the school bus company had developed a set of emergency procedures that didn't require high personal jeopardy, perhaps the entire crisis could have been avoided. Bus drivers can be trained in the use of tools and techniques that can help disable violent teens (e.g., use of pepper spray). Calls to dispatch can be augmented with 911 calls and emergency ""panic"" buttons. No one likes to consider that such preparations are necessary, and they will cost money, but by thinking ahead and preparing for such scenarios, we might be able to avoid a situation where the choice is simply who will end up with the broken bones.

"London (CNN) -- Britain's police swung into action Thursday as two separate incidents, one involving a security scare on a bus and the other six terror arrests, pointed to the heightened state of alert ahead of the London Olympic Games. Security is a central concern for UK authorities and the organizers of the Olympics, which start in three weeks. After launching a major response to the security alert on the bus, which led armed officers to close a major motorway, police in Staffordshire concluded the incident was not terror-related. But its officers responded ""swiftly and proportionately"" to credible information from a concerned member of the public, a Staffordshire police statement said. ""We can now confirm that, whilst this was a genuine security alert, the significant concerns reported to us were unfounded,"" the statement said. ""The information received concerned a report of vapor escaping from a bag which on investigation turned out to be a health improvement aid for smokers."" Hours earlier, police in London arrested five men and a woman on terror charges, although they said the operation was not related to the Olympics. The six, aged from 18 to 30, were all arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism and are being questioned, London's Metropolitan Police said. Officers searched homes in east, west and north London as well as business premises in east London. One of the men arrested had worked from 2007 to 2009 as a police community support officer for the Met Police, the force said in a statement, and ""was not deployed in a specialist or sensitive role."" Police community support officers are members of staff who work alongside the regular police force, mostly to tackle local anti-social behavior and low level issues. The operation in London is not linked to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the police said. British security officials on alert for Olympic terror threats . Additional security measures will be in place in London and elsewhere during the Olympics. They include the siting of missile defense systems around the capital and fighter jets on standby at air bases close to London. Police and intelligence agencies have also stepped up monitoring efforts. Thursday's dramatic closure of the busy M6 Toll motorway, near Birmingham, had many hallmarks of a response to a potential terror threat and could be seen as a sign that police are taking no chances. Armed police, firefighters and military bomb disposal units raced to the scene as passengers were evacuated from the bus, which had pulled over near the town of Lichfield. Police in Britain are not usually armed when they respond to incidents. Officials insist no specific terror threats tied to Olympics . Passengers were lined up on the tarmac for questioning, and their luggage and the vehicle searched, before police confirmed that there was no terror threat and that no one was considered a suspect. ""Our utmost priority was the safety and security of those people on the coach and those traveling on the motorway,"" the force said. The 48 passengers who were on the bus from the northwestern city of Preston to London are now being taken on to their planned destination, a spokeswoman for Megabus said. ""We would like to thank our customers for their patience and understanding during today's police operation, which followed concerns raised by a passenger during the journey,"" a statement from the bus operator said. ""The safety and welfare of our passengers and our staff is our absolute priority."" The bus has been moved and the highway has reopened, police said. Government officials from Washington to London insist there are no known specific or credible terror threats tied to the Olympic. Nonetheless, authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are urging vigilance. The Metropolitan Police is leading the ""largest peacetime operation"" seen in the United Kingdom as it seeks to keep the public safe, it said, with up to 9,500 police officers from London and elsewhere to be deployed on the busiest days of the Olympics. As a result, London's residents and its visitors can expect to see a large police presence on the streets and airport-style security at Olympic venues. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro, Claudia Rebaza, Laura Smith-Spark and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","NEW: One of those arrested on terror charges previously worked in a police support role .

"(CNN) -- Airport transportation security officers are probably the least understood and most maligned of federal employees. Travelers hate them for taking away water bottles and making them take off their shoes. If a story is reported about them, it's along the lines of a little old lady getting groped. They are the victims of unflattering stereotypes that make easy targets for cheap laughs. Even President Barack Obama made a joke about pat-downs in a 2011 State of the Union address. And when the Government Accountability Office found increased Transportation Security Administration officer misconduct, it just ratcheted up their unpopularity. The report was jarring and disturbing -- rising numbers of absenteeism, theft and intentional security lapses. Obviously, these are red flags that can't be ignored. Report: TSA employee misconduct up 26% in 3 years . Unfortunately, instead of taking on the issue of stopping the misconduct, GAO's focus was on how TSA ""could strengthen oversight of allegations of employee misconduct,"" the safe issues of process oversight, management of the accusations and data gathering versus digging into the controversial root causes of the actual misconduct. TSA's response was to assure us it fires those proven to have violated the public trust. In fact, it does. It will be tempting for TSA leaders to rally around solutions involving tougher discipline, deeper investigations and more thorough documentation. That would be exactly the wrong way to fix the real problem. In today's TSA, too many officers switch off their minds in favor of just finishing out the shift without rocking the boat. This may be the root cause of the GAO-identified misdeeds. TSA needs to have its officers switched-on and motivated. The security workforce comprises many who stepped up after 9/11 to stop terror attacks. My experience with transportation security officers is that they are overwhelmingly dedicated, sharp, willing and empathetic to passengers and their problems. As The New York Times correctly pointed out in an editorial: ""T.S.A. asks its officers to enforce rules of questionable utility while giving them remarkably little discretion. ... That is a huge waste of human talent."" Inside look at TSA bomb training . Considering that the human brain is the most sophisticated technology on the planet and that the officers have experience with hundreds of thousands of passengers, the question would seem to be: ""How do we get the most from this resource that we already pay and have on duty at checkpoints?"" It is not through additional rules and a more robust disciplinary process. Security officers are in the best position to use their experience and training and detect a threat not covered in the Standard Operating Procedure. Al Qaeda knows the rules and designs its attacks to comply with it. To stop attacks, officers thinking on their own needs to be encouraged, not disciplined. Once officers are allowed to think for themselves, it opens the door for mistakes and criticism. But people can be taught the fundamentals of risk management, which provides a framework for making informed judgments. The risk strategy must be carefully thought out -- complexity theory, with its network orientation, is the best way to think about transportation security risk -- and risk management tools understood and applied. A nation with no airline security . Armed with substantial intelligence resources, TSA's air marshals, inspectors and security officers need to be nimble in thinking about and applying the principles of risk management. But they also must be empowered to act. TSA needs to make these changes right now to take on the root causes of its public and security issues. It needs to clean up the mind numbing, overly complicated checkpoint ""standard operating procedure,"" which no longer matches our security needs and allow officers to act. What needs to be changed: . • The intrusive pat-down needs to be discontinued in favor of a lighter technique supplemented with available technologies. • The ""prohibited items"" list needs to be radically reduced to ban only real security threats such as explosives and toxins. As far as carrying knives, the FAA should make it a serious federal offense to intimidate a member of the flight crew or another passenger with a blade -- and then TSA can remove blades from the prohibited list. Blades represent virtually no threat to the aircraft at this point. And the baggie rule should be dropped. Current technology allows threat liquids to be detected when they are taken out of the carry-on and scanned in a bin. • Passengers should be chosen randomly for shoes and coat inspections. Precheck programs for frequent fliers that expedite security screening should be applied to all travelers. • Workers need to be retrained in risk management and encouraged to use their own judgment and experience, consulting with team members, to make prudent discretionary security calls. • The pay-for-performance system for transportation security officers needs to be reinstated. When transportation security officers unionized, merit pay was replaced by the seniority system -- essentially, if officers follow the standard operating procedure, they get regular pay raises up till retirement regardless of how well they perform. • We need to allow real private-sector innovation to compete and play a more meaningful role in security. Today, a fig leaf system is in place that calls itself ""private sector"" but is in reality just personnel outsourcing. These outsourced employees have to follow the TSA process exactly -- the only difference is that they get to charge an 8% markup on all their expenses. We need to get new ideas from outside the TSA that can be tested at our checkpoints. A clear risk management strategy along with these changes, taken together, would energize checkpoint activity, bring the public more on board, drive out the few bad apples, and improve security.

"(CNN) -- Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo on Wednesday ordered the replacement of top military commanders, a day after publicly dismissing rumors circulating the capital about a military coup. The announcement came from the armed forces themselves, not the president's office. In his capacity as commander-in-chief, Lugo named replacements for the heads of the army, air force and navy, according to a statement from the armed forces. One day earlier, Lugo had addressed -- and dismissed -- reports of a possible coup. ""In recent days rumors have surfaced about the placement of bombs, new kidnappings, assaults, coup d'etats,"" Lugo said at a news conference Tuesday. ""We are a friendly, participative government, willing to analyze the criticisms we receive, but don't confuse that for a moment with a showing of weakness,"" Lugo said, adding that nothing would remove him from the presidential palace until the end of his term in 2013.  Lugo, who was elected to a five-year term last year, is a former Catholic bishop. His victory brought an end to 61 years of one-party rule in Paraguay, but the honeymoon did not last long. In April, Lugo admitted he fathered a child during the period he was still a priest, and that he may have possibly fathered more. The revelation, which came as a shock to most, hurt his campaign image. Calls for his resignation began then and have continued, as Lugo has struggled to push reforms through a majority-opposition legislature. The new military commanders will be sworn-in at a ceremony Thursday morning.","Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo named replacements .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian firefighters called off their search for survivors Monday, one day after a church roof collapse in Sao Paulo killed at least nine people and injured more than 100 others. Firefighters work early Monday at the site of a church roof collapse in Sao Paulo, Brazil. All those listed as missing have been located, and officials said they believe they will not find any more victims, BandNews FM said on its Web site, citing Ronaldo Marzagao, Sao Paulo's assistant secretary of public security. On its Web site, the public relations firm handling communications for the church, Brickmann & Associados Comunicacao, listed the names of nine fatalities and more than 100 parishioners being treated at 15 hospitals. The youngest fatality was 15 years old; the oldest was 80, the agency said. Officials had no comment on what caused the collapse at Reborn in Christ Church, a popular evangelical congregation in the heart of Brazil's largest metropolis. The incident took place at about 7 p.m. Sunday (4 p.m. ET). Earlier Monday, firefighters used search dogs to comb the rubble. Several hundred worshippers were attending Sunday evening services at the evangelical church when the structure's concrete roof fell in on them. Witnesses told Record TV that they felt a strong wind followed by a blast -- after which, as one put it, the roof collapsed ""like dominoes."" Swarms of church members crowded the scene Monday, many of them praying for loved ones as bodies were pulled out. At the time of the collapse, victims were treated on the pavement in makeshift emergency care units, while others in critical condition were rushed off to nearby hospitals. Attendance at U.S.-style evangelical churches has mushroomed in Brazil, challenging the long-dominant Roman Catholic Church, with rousing Sunday worship services. Reborn in Christ is one of the largest congregations in Sao Paulo. Helena DeMoura contributed to this report for CNN.","NEW: Brazilian firefighters call off search for survivors .

"(CNN) -- When Michaela Cross, a U.S. student at the University of Chicago, posted a CNN iReport about the sexual harassment she says she experienced during a study abroad trip in India, the response was overwhelming. Cross' story, which is now the most-viewed iReport of all time, spawned thousands of impassioned comments and responses, many from women who live in India or who had traveled there and who wished to share their own experiences. Sexual harassment in India: 'The story you never wanted to hear' ""This is a side of India that is a reality to most young women who reside here -- or for that matter travel here,"" said Meera Vijayann, 27, from Bangalore in India. ""I wish I could take your pain away,"" said Anaka Kaundinya, 22, from Mumbai. Sexual harassment remains a pervasive problem in Indian society. Often referred to by the euphemism ""Eve-teasing,"" a 2011 survey supported by UN Women found 95% of females in New Delhi said they felt unsafe in public places. Earlier this year the country introduced stricter anti-rape laws following the fatal gang rape of a young woman in New Delhi, but gender inequality remains embedded within Indian society. As reports of another gang rape emerged in the Indian city of Mumbai on Friday, the issue remains as pertinent as ever. While Cross has garnered attention for speaking up about her experience, she's not alone. Four women with connections to India shared their own experiences, whether they felt it fair to single out India on the issue, and how best to tackle the problem. Please note that CNN cannot independently verify the incidents described below. Shwetha Kalyanasundara, 27, business development professional from Chennai . When I read Cross' article I was ashamed of my country (for the first time). But I realized that I cannot sit in my comfortable space and watch people tear my country down. Almost every woman who grows up in India has been subjected to some kind of sexual innuendos ... but for every man who cannot control his libido and gives in to his over-crazed sexual drive, I can assure you that there will be 10 men who will fight for you and your dignity. Keeping chivalry alive: Men respond to India rape crisis . In Sanskrit, we say ""Matha, Pitha, Guru, Deivam"" (translated: Mother, Father, Teacher, God). The meaning of this adage is the greatest truth and is the order in which we offer reverence. This is the basic tenet in existence from time immemorial, and every man has been taught to place the womankind even above God. Indian men know to treat their women with respect. And I cannot tolerate your generalization that Indian men are bad. You cannot blame the entire male population for the actions of few. In all the countries I have been to, I have been subjected to roving eyes and sexual overtures from men. I have been leered and heckled by cab drivers and pedestrians alike. Even a middle-aged woman is not spared. Let's not be too dramatic here and accept that sexual crimes against women are a problem the world over. Shaheen Madraswala, 22, student in U.S., grew up in Mumbai . Born and raised in India, I moved to the USA three years ago to pursue my undergraduate education. Like Cross, I studied abroad in the fall of 2012. My chosen destination was Paris. Upon my return, I told family in India and friends from around the world exactly what they expected to hear. I told them I was in love -- in love with Paris. I did indeed relish the experience of living in a country whose culture and language is so different from my own. How it feels to be a woman in India . However, I fell short of mentioning the time I was harassed by a drunk man at the Gare Montparnasse, while numerous people simply stood and watched, the time I was groped by a man on a bus who threatened to follow me home, or the time I was actually followed back home from my afternoon run at Champ des Mars. This, unfortunately, is a woman's plight, wherever in the world she might be. Although an Indian women who is expected to be used to the staring and teasing, I am not prepared. I am not prepared to look over my shoulder after sunset. I am not prepared to think twice before using public transport. I am not prepared for the reactions that my clothing might elicit. Having lived in three of the world's megacities, Bombay, Paris and New York, I have been equally unprepared wherever I might be, for the simple reason that I am a woman. The pervasiveness of sexual harassment is global. Aishwarya Subramanian, 25, reporter from Bangalore . A lot of us in India ... feel a collective responsibility for what happened to Cross and feel terrible for what's happened to her. But I also think it is terribly unfair to turn every man in India into a monster. It also hurts to read comments where people urge others to stay away from this beautiful country. Should solo female travelers avoid India? As someone who lives here every day of her life, it hurts when someone says ""if you have white skin, you should stay away from India."" It's this kind of racist bigotry we should try and overcome. Yes. Unfortunately I have been groped at and harassed by men. I am a runner and every time I set out to run by myself, I make sure I have my phone with me and pepper spray in case men on the streets decide to harass the girl running in sweatpants (I never wear my shorts on solo runs). But that's not what the country is all about. It's a big nation that should not be generalized. In any city you will find millions talking different languages, following different cultures. You simply cannot speak for all of them in one breath. It's not possible in India. I think sexual harassment is a global problem, and it's something women have to live with every day of their lives. It's unfortunately as bad as it gets in India. I really do believe that there needs to be mass education to help change attitudes toward women. Sanjana Govindarajan, 21, student from Mumbai . Reading line after line of Cross' story filled me with an overwhelming sense of shame. I have been stared at, leered at, groped and followed by strangers for close to 11 years of my life. And yet, I feel ashamed before I feel indignant. I believe the poor treatment of women and their sexual objectification is endemic in Indian society today. Children might be taught to treat women with respect in their classrooms, however, most of them go back home to see the exact opposite in implementation by members of their families. 'She could have been me': Action urged after Delhi gang rape case . It appears to be a fairly daunting and uphill task to go about educating a billion-plus population about the importance of proper treatment of women, and in a way that translates into meaningful change in the society. But it needs to happen. Stricter laws would be an essential part of the solution. Police apathy and in some cases, blatant disregard for the plight of the victims only encourages and empowers this disgusting behavior. I think it is most important for women to come out and speak about the issue. We have grown up being taught to remain silent about sexual abuse. I think one of the most significant changes one can bring about in this situation is to remove the shame attached to being a victim of sexual abuse. If we talk about it more, millions of women will draw strength from speaking the truth and will come closer to being liberated.","U.S. student's iReport on harassment In India most viewed iReport of all time .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The world's oldest person has died in Japan, aged 116 -- just days after the passing of a Chinese woman with a rival claim to the title. Jiroemon Kimura, a former postman, died of natural causes in hospital in his hometown of Kyotango, western Japan, in the early hours of Wednesday, city officials told CNN. In December, Kimura had been recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living person, and as the oldest man whose age had ever been verified. ""I wanted him to live longer,"" his nephew, Tamotsu Miyake, told Japanese television network TV Asahi. ""His life was respectable; I would like to say 'thank you' to him."" Kimura, who attributed his longevity to eating light, healthy meals, worked for the post office until his retirement in 1962, continuing to carry out agricultural work until the age of 90. Only the third man in history verified to have reached the age of 115, Kimura had seven children, 14 grandchildren, 25 great-grand children and 14 great-great grandchildren. On his passing, the mantle of oldest living person passes to fellow Japanese Misao Okawa, a 115-year old woman from Osaka. A rival claim . Shortly after Kimura made the record books in December, China's state news agency Xinhua reported on a woman from the southern province of Guangxi with a rival claim to being the world's oldest person. Luo Meizhen, from the remote village of Longhong, had an official ID card and residency permit -- both issued in recent decades -- stating she was born in 1885, making her 127. In 2010, a Chinese state-sponsored research institute claimed to have verified the documents. But her claim to record longevity was not officially recognized internationally, due to questions over of the reliability of birth records when she was born, and because of claims she had given birth to the youngest of her five children aged 61. On Tuesday, Luo's son Huang Youhe told AFP that his mother had died at the weekend after months of illness, aged 127. ""She was a kind person, but at times had a very bad temper,"" said her grandson, Huang Heyuan. ""She had a strong character."" Luo, who had worked as a farmer, hailed from an area known as Bama county, which has a reputation for the longevity of its residents. Rise of 'supercentenarians' If accurate, Luo's 127 year lifespan would have made her the oldest person ever, surpassing France's Jeanne Calment, who died aged 122 years, 164 days in 1997. According to a 2010 study by a German demographic research institute, the countries with the highest number of ""supercentenarians"" -- those aged 110 and over --are the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The study, prompted by rising numbers of centenarians, found more than 600 supercentenarians internationally. Researchers estimated there were more than 400 supercentenarians in the U.S., and found 78 in Japan. As with the centenarian bracket, women far outnumbered men, with women accounting for 9 in 10 of the U.S. supercentenarians. CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report.","Jiroemon Kimura, the world's oldest man, has died in Japan, aged 116 .

"(CNN) -- Like many people, I've been riveted by the George Zimmerman trial. I call it ""the George Zimmerman trial"" because that's what it is, but the more I watch, the more I wonder: Should it be renamed ""the Trayvon Martin trial?"" I'm not just talking about some of the media's tabloid-like focus on Martin's background, his personal history, his school records and -- outside the courtroom -- the toxicology report. I'm talking about an aspect of the case that never comes up in the media coverage, one that I would argue is key. This murder trial, in and out of the courtroom, has been boiled down to one question: Was Zimmerman in fear for his life and thus justified in defending himself by shooting and killing Martin? It has been framed this way -- in terms of Zimmerman's mortal fear -- since the shooting in 2012. Zimmerman's assumptions led to death, prosecutor argues . Some people have forgotten that Zimmerman was not even arrested initially. It took more than a month for the special prosecutor to bring the second-degree murder charge. And if not for mass protests across the country, he might not be the defendant in a murder trial at all. The question that has not surfaced in the courtroom -- the elephant in the room -- is this: Did Martin fear for his life after being followed and confronted by a stranger while going to the store to buy candy and a soft drink? Was he, Martin, justified in standing his ground and defending himself when this stranger, an apparent stalker, approached him in a threatening manner? Zimmerman didn't identify himself and never said he was part of the neighborhood watch group. Think about it: We're told over and over that if Zimmerman was afraid of Martin, according to Florida law, he had the right to put a bullet in the chamber of his concealed handgun, get out of his car after being told not to by the 911 dispatcher and follow and confront Martin and shoot him to death. At the same time, we are told that Martin, who had far greater reason to fear Zimmerman, practically and for reasons of American history, did not have the right to confront his stalker, stand his ground and defend himself, including by using his fists. We are told that this was entirely unjustified and by doing so, Martin justified his own execution. Running updates from the Zimmerman trial . The phrases ""stand your ground"" and ""self-defense"" have been repeated endlessly by anchors, pundits, analysts and experts, but rarely applied to Martin. How could this be? Why is this other question ignored? Surely it will come up as we approach the trial, I thought. But it hasn't. What's going on here? How can the Florida law apply only to Zimmerman and not to Martin? I remembered the sharp, sometimes bitter commentary provoked by Spike Lee's 1989 film ""Do the Right Thing,"" particularly in reaction to its climactic scenes, when the police murder a black teenager and Lee's character throws a trash can through the window of the white-owned pizza place. Years after the movie came out, Lee told an interviewer, ""White people still ask me why Mookie threw the can through the window. ...Twenty years later, they're still asking me that."" ""No black person ever, in 20 years, no person of color has ever asked me why,"" he said. This speak volumes about race and power relations in this country. Opinion: Zimmerman trial - it's about race . Here's what I think: Assuming Martin did engage Zimmerman physically, perhaps if the teen had hit back a little bit harder, perhaps if he had been able to prevent Zimmerman from grabbing his concealed and loaded gun and perhaps if witnesses had come to Martin's aid, then maybe he would be alive today. That's speculation. One thing I feel sure of is that if Martin, in fear for his life, had used Zimmerman's own gun to shoot and possibly kill his attacker, when the police arrived on the scene, they would not have failed to charge him with murder. Why hasn't the prosecution team used Florida law to argue strongly for Martin's right of self-defense, his right to stand his ground against a stalker? Why not turn the tables on Zimmerman's exclusive claim to that argument? It will be interesting to see whether this question even gets posed for the jury at all. It certainly will be front and center as this case is tried by the jury of history. And future generations will likely puzzle over how the term ""racial profiling"" could have been banned by the judge before the trial even began. This country's racial history, the list of names, like Sean Bell, Amadou Diallo, Oscar Grant and other victims of ""deadly force"" by the policeâ€”these represent an even bigger Elephant in the Room. They may have been ruled irrelevant in the courtroom, but they are certainly relevant to those who seek justice in this society. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Miller Francis.","Miller Francis: George Zimmerman trial should be renamed the Trayvon Martin trial .
He says question not raised: Wasn't Martin the one standing his ground, facing a stalker?
We're told that by defending himself, Martin justified his own execution, he says .

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and the opposition demanded independent investigations Wednesday into countering accusations of the use of chemical weapons, allegations that prompted most members of the U.N. Security Council to call for a probe. The demands, made in writing to the United Nations, came a day after the government and the rebels accused one another of using chemical weapons in fighting in the flashpoint province of Aleppo and a rural suburb of the Syrian capital of Damascus. Even as both sides accused the other of using such weapons, the U.S. ambassador to Syria and other officials said there was no evidence to substantiate the reports. ""So far, we have no evidence to substantiate the reports that chemical weapons were used yesterday,"" Ambassador Robert Ford told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""But I want to underline that we're looking very carefully at these reports. We are consulting with partners in the region and in the international community."" Ford, who was pulled from Syria when the United States closed its embassy in Damascus more than a year ago, said he was ""skeptical"" of Russian reports that the rebel Free Syrian Army had used chemical weapons. Competing calls for investigations . Throughout the civil war, which began in 2011, it has been difficult for the international community to determine the validity of claims by both sides of violence and casualties because access to the country has been severely restricted by the Syrian government. Even so, the United Nations confirmed Wednesday it was studying a written request received from Syrian government officials, who were calling for a neutral party to investigate their claim. A majority of the members of the U.N. Security Council plan to send a letter to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to request an inquiry to ""shed light"" over the reports, said Gerard Araud, the French ambassador to the United Nations. He made the comments after Wednesday's closed-door meeting of the Security Council. The letter asks Ban to conduct a ""swift, thorough and impartial"" investigation, Philip Parham, the UK's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, said. Parham described the Syrian government's demand as a request for a narrow investigation, looking into only one alleged incident. ""The way in which they have framed the request prejudges the outcome of the investigation by alleging it's the opposition that is responsible for that case of use of chemical weapons,"" he said. The Security Council is calling for a broader investigation. The rebels' coalition government, meanwhile, demanded an international investigation and called for a delegation to visit the sites of the alleged attacks. Military analysts believe the Syrian government may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world. Specifically, the supply is believed to include sarin, mustard and VX gases, which are banned under international law. Syria has denied the allegation. The use of chemical and biological weapons are banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Syria is not one of the 188 signatories to the convention, which bans the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. In recent months, reports have repeatedly surfaced that Syrian forces moved some of the chemical weapons inventories possibly because of deteriorating security in the country, raising fears the stockpile could fall into the hands of al Qaeda-linked groups working with the opposition should al-Assad's government fall. As a result, the United States has been talking with neighboring countries about the steps needed to secure the weapons stockpile should al-Assad be forced from office. Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday reiterated his warning to Syria's government that it would be held accountable for the use of chemical weapons ""or their transfer to terrorists."" ""We intend to investigate thoroughly exactly what happened,"" Obama told reporters during a joint news conference in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The president said he was ""deeply skeptical"" of Syrian government claims that the opposition used chemical weapons. Obama has previously said Syria's use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line."" ""We have been very clear to the Assad regime -- but also to other players on the ground -- that a red line for us is, we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized,"" he told reporters. ""That would change my calculus; that would change my equation."" Intelligence agencies pore over the evidence . Intelligence officials around the world were investigating the accusations, U.S. officials told CNN on Wednesday. Investigators were talking to rebels and defectors, poring over medical intelligence regarding symptoms reported by doctors and looking at satellite imagery used to track missiles launched and chemical weapons movements, the officials said on condition of anonymity. They were not authorized to release details to the media. A spokesman for Netanyahu, Mark Regev, told CNN that Israeli officials had no confirmation that chemical weapons had been used. But Regev's comments did not square with those of Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni. ""It is clear for us here in Israel"" that chemical weapons have been used in Syria, and an international response should be on the table, Livni told CNN in an exclusive interview from her home in Tel Aviv. Livni wouldn't say whether there is evidence the Syrian government has directed the use of any chemical weapons. But she said the development would pose a direct threat to Israel, which shares a border with Syria. Their concerns centered on an attack Tuesday in Khan al-Asal in the northern province of Aleppo. State-run media blamed rebels for the attack, which it said killed 25 people and injured more than 110 others. Rebels say they have no chemical weapons . On Wednesday, Syria's U.N. ambassador, Bashar Ja'afari, said the Syrian government has asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to open an investigation into the alleged use of chemical weapons by ""terrorist groups,"" which is how the government refers to rebels. But the opposition Free Syrian Army said rebels don't have access to chemical weapons and blamed the casualties on a government missile. Separately, an opposition group said the government attacked the rural Damascus suburb of Ateibeh with ""chemical rockets,"" causing an unspecified number of deaths along with cases of suffocation, nausea and hysteria. There was no immediate government response. The reports ignited a firestorm of reactions, with Russia slamming the rebels and some U.S. lawmakers saying that Washington might need to take action against the Syrian government. Observers: Images are not consistent with a chemical weapons attack . But images posted by Syrian state-run media of the aftermath of the Aleppo incident, which the government blamed on rebels, are not consistent with a chemical weapon attack, some observers said. ""There are no images of the site of the attack; just of some affected people. These people do not show outward symptoms of a CW (chemical weapon) attack. Definitely not mustard; definitely not a nerve agent,"" wrote Jean Pascal Zanders, senior research fellow at the European Union Institute for Security Studies. ""There are far too many people, including non-medical staff, around the affected persons. Apart from a surgical mask, nobody wears any protective garment or gas masks. If there would have been a CW attack with one of the agents known (or believed) to be in Syria's arsenal, then most of the people present would have been fatally or seriously contaminated."" He added that, during the Arab uprisings, witness reports cited chemical attacks, but none had been confirmed. ""People are exposed to a wide range of toxicants in today's battlefield,"" he said in an e-mail. ""Furthermore, once a rumor gets around, people are more likely to think that they suffer from symptoms similar to the ones being rumored."" Q&A: What's Syria's chemical weapon potential, and what are the health risks? Not the first round of claims . U.S. officials pointed to previous claims that the Syrian government used chemical weapons, which were found to be false after extensive investigation. The Syrian government did not use chemical weapons against residents of Homs in a December attack, a U.S. State Department investigation showed, but did apparently misuse a riot-control gas in the incident, according to senior U.S. officials. The officials said the State Department launched a probe from its consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, after reports from doctors and activists that dozens of people suffered nervous system, respiratory and gastrointestinal ailments after inhaling the gas in Homs on December 23. The civil war -- which began two years ago after a government crackdown on Syrian protesters -- has left around 70,000 people dead and uprooted more than 1 million others, the United Nations has said. CNN's Tom Watkins, Saad Abedine, Jessica Yellin, Nick Paton Walsh, Jake Tapper and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: The Security Council asks Ban Ki-moon for a ""swift, thorough and impartial"" investigation .

"Washington (CNN)  -- President Obama told his war council Wednesday that the U.S. troop commitment to Afghanistan is not open-ended, and he asked for revisions to options he previously received for sending more troops, a senior administration official told CNN. The war council -- made up of top Cabinet, Pentagon and administration officials -- met with Obama for the eighth time to discuss a request by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan for up to 40,000 more troops. The meeting lasted more than two hours, according to the senior administration official. ""The president and his team discussed the length of time that it would take to implement the options he's been presented,"" the senior official said. ""The president believes that we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended. After years of substantial investments by the American people, governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time to ensure a successful transition to our Afghan partner."" In particular, Obama pushed for revisions in proposed plans for troop increases to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government, the official said. The president's questions at the meeting could change how many troops eventually are sent to Afghanistan, as well as how long they would be there, according to the senior administration official. Before the meeting, Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, said the meeting would continue evaluating how best to carry out the mission in Afghanistan. Petraeus provided no specifics on options under consideration, but said the process is approaching completion. ""I think we are indeed nearing a decision on this very important topic,"" he said, emphasizing the need to focus on the mission of ensuring that Afghanistan ""does not once again become a sanctuary or safe haven for al Qaeda and the kind of transnational extremists that carried out the 9/11 attacks."" Earlier, a senior administration official and a U.S. military official independently told CNN that one option presented to Obama calls for sending about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in addition to the 68,000 already committed to the country. The military official said the plan would send three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade of about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000 troops; and 4,000 to 5,000 support troops. The combat brigades would be brought in gradually, in three-month intervals, according to the military official. The troops would be spread across the country, mainly focusing in the south and southeast, where much of the fighting is, according to the official. The military official said the option has been a favorite at the Pentagon in recent weeks. That is only one option, the senior administration official emphasized. Three other options, the official said, would be ""different mixes,"" or ""different components of it."" The senior administration official said Obama was expected to ask the war council meeting about cooperation the United States can expect from the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, civilian support the United States is willing to offer, and support the United States can expect from other countries. On Wednesday night, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that concerns have been raised recently by the U.S. Ambassador in Kabul about Karzai's ability to rid his country's government of corruption and mismanagement. All those factors could lead to ""further refinements"" or some ""greater elements being considered,"" the official said, adding: ""He's got to fine-tune this, put it all together ... for what direction best advances our interests."" Despite reports to the contrary, Obama has not decided the number of U.S. troops he will send to Afghanistan, White House officials said. Such reports are ""absolutely false,"" Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Anyone who suggests otherwise, ""doesn't have, in all honesty, the slightest idea what they're talking about."" White House officials would not say whether Wednesday's meeting with the war council would be Obama's last with that group before deciding on Afghanistan. They said he would continue to discuss the war effort in smaller groups in coming days, including during his trip to Asia, which starts Thursday. Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee urged Obama in a letter sent Wednesday -- Veterans Day -- to agree to the request for additional troops by U.S. military leaders in Afghanistan. The letter, signed by 10 GOP committee members, said success in Afghanistan will require local leaders and citizens being able to govern and secure their own country without ""substantial"" international assistance. ""This won't be perfect or easy, but it will allow America's fighting men and women to leave Afghanistan with honor, and it will enable Afghans to build a better, more peaceful future,"" the letter said. ""That is our goal, and we must stay in the fight until is is won."" Republican leaders have criticized Obama for taking so long to decide on the troop request, but Petraeus said the process of analyzing the situation has been ""very useful."" ""There has been a refinement of objectives; there has been discussion of various courses of action,"" he said. ""There have been explanations and discussions about how the civilian component of this will complement what is done by the work of our military troops. All in all, I think it has been a very productive couple of months that we have spent on this."" Also Wednesday, a new national poll showed Americans are split over whether Obama is taking too long to decide whether to send more U.S. troops to the war in Afghanistan. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey also indicated that, by a narrow margin, Americans think the president should listen to the recommendations of the generals in charge of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. According to the survey, 49 percent of people questioned say the president is taking too long to decide whether to increase U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan; 50 percent do not. ""There is a gender gap on this question, with most men saying Obama is taking too long and most women willing to give him more time,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""That's due in part to the partisan differences between men and women, but gender differences on the use of military force, and maybe even differences in how the genders make important decisions, can also be contributing to the split."" The poll indicates that 52 percent think Obama should listen to the generals, with 48 percent saying the president should take other matters into account as well. But a troop buildup remains unpopular, with a separate question indicating that a majority opposes sending more troops. Roughly one in five Americans opposes more troops, yet also thinks that Obama should pay attention to the U.S. military leaders in that country, Holland said. ""That suggests that a lot of people who don't support a troop build-up are unaware of Gen. Stanley McChrystal's request for a bigger U.S. military presence there,"" he said. ""And that, in turn, indicates that the military leaders in the field might provide Obama some political cover if he decides to increase troop strength there."" The poll also suggests widespread agreement among Americans that Afghanistan will never have a stable democratic government, with only one in 10 people questioned saying that will occur within a year, and one-third saying it will ever happen. Overall, 56 percent of Americans oppose sending more troops, while 42 percent favor increasing troop strength. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted October 30-November 1, with 1,018 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser and Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","Obama discusses options with war council Wednesday afternoon .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- From HMS Titanic to the Black Pearl, Hollywood has long felt the lure of the open sea, but who are the seafaring heroes that have plotted a course into our imaginations? Kevin Costner as half-man half-fish Mariner, who bungee jumps off an oil tanker to save humanity in 1995 sci-fi ""Waterworld"" From ""Pirates of the Caribbean's"" Captain Jack Sparrow to ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" hero Christian Fletcher played by a dashing Marlon Brando, here are the top 10 mariners in the movies. Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Tell us below in the SoundOff box. 10. 'The Riddle of The Sands' (Tony Maylam, 1979) Movie mariner: Arthur Davies Played by: Simon MacCorkindale . In this film adaptation of a 1903 adventure novel, two young men on a yachting holiday sail their way to saving a nation. Sensing something sinister after being watched by a German navy patrol boat, Davies and his pal stumble upon a dastardly plan to invade England in a flotilla of specially designed barges. By masterfully navigating his small boat through a series of complicated sand banks they outwit the cream of the German Navy to foil the plan. 9. 'Captain Jack' (Robert Young, 1999) Movie mariner: Jack Lammiman Played by: Bob Hoskins . Despite his boat being declared unseaworthy, rebellious sailing novice Lammiman determinedly sets sail from Whitby, England on course for the Arctic Circle with a rag tag crew including a vicar and a female pensioner. In his quest to honor his hero Captain William Scorseby he eludes an international search by marine authorities and makes it to the Arctic Ocean where he manages plants an honorary plaque. 8. 'Mutiny on the Bounty' (Lewis Milestone, 1962) Movie mariner: Fletcher Christian  Played by: Marlon Brando . One of many films based on the novel based on the true story of the munity on board HMS Bounty. When the Bounty sets sail from Portsmouth in 1787, pernicious Captain Bligh will sacrifice anything to get the ship to its destination as quickly as possible -- even the crew. Enter our hero First Lieutenant Fletcher Christian (Marlon Brando), who leads a mutiny, setting the captain out to sea in a longboat. Picking up a host of beautiful women from Tahiti, he and his men hide from the Royal Navy -- who will hang him for his crime -- on remote Pitcairn Island. It end in tragedy when the crew, fearing he will return to England to face Captain Bligh in court, set fire to the Bounty, and Christian dies trying to save it. 7. 'Dead Calm' (Philip Noyce, 1989) Movie mariner: Hughie Warriner  Played by: Billy Zane . A yachting holiday turns into a nightmare when an Australian couple rescue Hughie Warriner (Billy Zane), who claims his shipmates have died of food poisoning. Only they haven't, he's murdered them, and Rae (Nicole Kidman) is his next target. His first attempt at strangling her is foiled when Rae knocks him out with a spear gun, and sets him out to sea in a rescue raft. But it isn't enough to stop him returning for another go. Despite being clandestinely drugged with sleeping pills, he manages to navigate the raft back to the yacht to try again, where Rae's husband wisely shoots him with a flare gun. 6. 'Captain Horatio Hornblower' (Raoul Walsh, 1951) Movie mariner: Horatio Hornblower  Played by: Gregory Peck . In this 1951 drama based on three of the eleven Horatio Hornblower novels written by C.S. Forester, there is very little the fictitious sea captain cannot do. Commandeering a 50-gun frigate in a surprise night attack: no problem. Taking on and sinking four French ships: job done. Overpowering a Dutch crew to free a boatful of British prisoners of war: just say the word. Sailing into the sunset with the lovely Lady Barbara Wellesley (Virgina Mayo): all in a day's work. 5. 'Waterworld' (Kevin Reynolds, 1995) Movie mariner: Mariner  Played by: Kevin Costner . In a post-apocalyptic world where the ice caps have melted and the land is under thousands of feet of water, a mutant man with gills known only as Mariner (Kevin Costner), saves us all, by bungee jumping off the side of a ship to rescue a girl with a map showing the way to dry land tattooed on her back. They live happily on the top of Mount Everest until the elusive Mariner is drawn back to the only life he has ever known: the water. Climate change skeptics, take note. 4. 'Erik the Viking' (Terry Jones, 1989) Movie mariner: Erik  Played by: Tim Robbins . In this Monty Pythonesque take on Norse mythology, brave Erik the Viking (Tim Robbins) charts new seafaring territory by sailing his warship over the edge of Earth and into Outer Space, where he politely petitions the wolf who swallowed the sun to spit it out again. Unique in sailing terms, Erik is not overly dependent on favorable wind conditions, preferring to navigate his way from one place to another by blowing on a magic horn. 3. 'Wind' (Carroll Ballard, 1992) Movie mariner: Will Parker  Played by: Matthew Modine . Real America's Cup sailing boats provide most of the set for this 1992 movie. The talented Will Parker (Matthew Modine) tames the wind, the waves and the forces of misogyny in the old boys club that is the world of elite sailing, and walks off with the America's Cup. And, of course, the girl. 2. 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' (Peter Weir, 2003) Movie mariner: Jack Aubrey  Played by: Russell Crowe . The hero of twenty Patrick O' Brian novels, Admiral Sir John Aubrey (Russell Crowe) pursues a superior French ship under orders to ""burn, sink or take her as a prize."" But it's not straightforward, and he almost loses everything trying to round Cape Horn. 1. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' (Gore Verbinski, 2003) Movie mariner: Captain Jack Sparrow  Played by: Johnny Depp . The indefatigable Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Pirate Lord of the Caribbean, and star of three Pirates of the Caribbean movies, must be Hollywood's finest seafarer. Scourge of the Royal Navy, hero to his motley band of Pirates, and regular rescuer of damsels in distress. Oh, and his dad was in the Rolling Stones.","Plucky Brit's sailing skills save the UK from invasion in ""The Riddle of The Sands""

"(CNN) -- The seeds just can't stop tumbling out of Wimbledon and on Monday it was the turn of world No.1 and five-time champion Serena Williams to experience that sinking feeling. The American crashed out of the grass court grand slam in the last-16 following a shock defeat by Germany's Sabine Lisicki -- her first reverse in 35 matches. Favorite for the title, Williams lost the opening set 6-2 before roaring back to level a pulsating contest by taking the second 6-1. But Lisicki, seeded 23rd at the tournament, produced one of the greatest performances of her career, coming from a break down to take the final set 6-4 and send shockwaves through tennis. After knocking out the defending champion, the 23-year-old German burst into tears of joy when addressing the media for the first time. ""I am still shaking, I am so happy,"" she told the BBC. ""Serena played a fantastic match, she is such a tough opponent. It is an amazing feeling to win this match. ""This is such a special place for me and the crowd were brilliant to me. I gave it everything I had, I fought for every single point to try to win it somehow."" A Wimbledon semifinalist in 2011, Lisicki will play Estonia's Kaia Kanepi for a place in the last four. The German has never gone past the fourth round at any grand slam outside of Wimbledon but she has an impressive record at The All England Club, having reached the quarterfinals three times, and a curious one as well. For she has beaten the reigning French Open champion at all four of her last Wimbledon championships. Since she missed the 2010 edition through injury, the run starts in 2009 when she beat Svetlana Kuznetsova, a success that has now been followed by defeats of Li Na in 2011, Maria Sharapova the following year and Williams herself on Monday. In a tournament packed with shocks, the dethroning of 16-time grand slam winner Williams is arguably the greatest of all -- despite the defeats for Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in the opening rounds last week. The win was all the more surprising given that the powerful American bounced back so strongly from losing the first set that she won nine consecutive games on the way to taking a 3-0 lead in the deciding set. But Lisicki broke back and even though Serena responded in similar style, the German once again overcame the American's serve to level the set at 4-4. After the match had gone past the two-hour mark, Lisicki earned her first match point and after that went begging she made no mistake for the second to claim surely her greatest win to date. Williams' remarkable twelve months - a spell where she won the Wimbledon, U.S. Open, French Open and Olympic titles - was finally at an end however and she was quick to praise her opponent. ""It's not a shock,"" the 31-year-old said. ""She plays really good on grass. For me any loss is extremely tough to overcome. I just have to go back to the drawing board and figure out a way to win those matches."" The last time Williams lost a match on court was when she was beaten in the final of the Qatar Open by Victoria Azarenka on 17 February. Lisicki will face Kaia Kanepi after the Estonian ended Laura Robson's dream of becoming the first Briton to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 29 years. The 19-year-old was the first British woman to reach the second week at Wimbledon since 1998 but left the court in tears after being beaten 7-6 7-5. Should Kanepi reach her first grand slam semifinal, she will meet either Agnieszka Radwanska, last year's runner-up, or Li Na in the semifinals. The fourth seed from Poland overcame Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova 4-6 6-3 6-3 while the Chinese sixth seed demolished Italian 11th seed Roberta Vinci 6-2 6-0 in just 55 minutes. Looking to win her second grand slam after her Roland Garros title two years ago, Li has reached the quarterfinals for the third time at Wimbledon and is seeking her maiden semifinal appearance. Few would have predicted that Sloane Stephens would be the last American left standing in both singles draws but after her 4-6 7-5 6-1 defeat of Puerto Rican youngster Monica Puig, the 20-year-old is through to the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the first time. The 17th seed will meet the 15th seed after Marion Bartoli, the beaten finalist in 2007, defeated Italy's Karin Knapp in straight sets. In the remaining quarterfinal, 2011 Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova will face Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens.","Serena Williams suffers shock defeat in last-16 of Wimbledon .

"(EW.com) -- Heaven knows, Morrissey is miserable now. A&E's breakout pro-hunting hit ""Duck Dynasty"" returned Wednesday night to record ratings. The season three premiere delivered 8.6 million viewers. That's huge. It's not only the most-watched ""Duck Dynasty"" episode ever, it's A&E's most-watched telecast ever and ranks as cable's biggest reality show telecast so far this year. The 10 p.m. episode (the first of two back-to-back airings) was up 132 percent vs. the second season premiere. Plus, a full 5 million of the viewers were in the adults 18-49 demo. The return of ""Duck Dynasty"" benefited from an unexpected gift-from-the-PR-gods when British singer and animal rights activist Morrissey cancelled his planned Feb. 26 performance on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" at the last minute in protest of the ""Duck Dynasty"" stars appearing the same episode. Morrissey called the show's stars — who own a family business that makes products for hunters — ""animal serial killers."" Kimmel later hit back during his show's Tuesday monologue: ""While I respect his stance on this, I really do, there's a very good reason why I didn't dump the 'Duck Dynasty' guys for Morrissey. And that's because they have guns."" Kimmel also added of the famously downbeat singer, ""He keeps finding new ways to depress us."" The host aired a parody video for ""a new ""Duck Dynasty"" product for vegans."" Joan Rivers called out on Heidi Klum joke . The pop singer then countered that Kimmel ""found time to jokingly promote gun-ownership — hugely amusing for the parents at Sandy Hook, no doubt. He also promoted his special guests ""Duck Dynasty"" -- who kill beings for fun. None of the above issues are, of course, as important as Jimmy Kimmel himself, who has finally revealed his show to have an overwhelming loss of meaning. Tune in and relive the intellectual fog of the 1950s."" Kimmel followed that up by tweeting yestrerday, ""Note to Morrissey — if you have more dumb statements to make, I invite you to make them where I do, on my show."" He included in the tweet a link to the cover art for Morrissey's 2004 album You Are the Quarry, which featured the singer wielding a machine gun. The Christian-friendly A&E docu-series has been on a ratings tear since catching fire last year. One surprising survey found that ""Duck Dynasty"" received more mentions on Facebook in 2012 than any other TV series, including social-network-friendly hits like HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" and CBS' ""The Big Bang Theory.""

"(CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela is ""in good shape,"" the country's president said Monday, but new images seem to suggest otherwise. In a video released by the South African Broadcasting Corp., Mandela sits at his home in Johannesburg in a plush beige chair with a pillow supporting his head and a blanket covering his legs. South African President Jacob Zuma sits beside Mandela, who does not appear to engage with reporters or others in the room. At one point, one of Mandela's grandsons takes a picture. When the flash goes off, Mandela closes his eyes. He is known to be sensitive to flash photography. The 94-year-old, who was South Africa's first black president, was discharged from the hospital on April 6. He was admitted in late March and received treatment for a recurring lung infection and pneumonia. ""The doctors gave us a report and, of course, we saw him. He's looking very good; he's in good shape,"" Zuma told the SABC. ""We are very happy. We think that he's fine."" Zuma said he spoke with Mandela and that they shook hands and he smiled. The president's comments echoed a statement released by the African National Congress. The governing party said that officials are satisfied that Mandela ""is in good health and is receiving the very best medical care."" The video released Monday is the first of the former leader since his birthday in July. Mandela, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has become increasingly frail over the years. His history of lung problems dates back to when he was a political prisoner on Robben Island during apartheid. He contracted tuberculosis during his imprisonment. He underwent treatment for a lung infection and had surgery to remove gallstones over the Christmas holiday in 2012, one of his longest hospital stays since his release from prison in 1990. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Kim Norgaard contributed to this report.","New images of the former leader appear to show a frail man .

"(CNN) -- February 26, 2012. That was the day two strangers -- Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager walking back with Skittles and an iced tea he'd picked up at 7-Eleven, and George Zimmerman, a white Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida -- met for the first and only time. It's been nearly a year since Zimmerman shot Martin to death. The incident generated huge outrage across the country for months and led to a wide-ranging conversation about the state of U.S. race relations. Zimmerman acknowledged shooting Martin but said it was in self-defense. Attorneys for Martin's family have accused Zimmerman of racially profiling Martin and shooting him ""in cold blood."" Attention to the case has died down substantially in recent months, and you may have been focused on other things. Here are a few things you might not know about the case, which is scheduled for a June 10 trial. 1. Photos, evidence trickle out, seemingly helping, hurting both sides . From the beginning, Zimmerman insisted he was a victim: Martin attacked him, then they tussled, he said. At one point, the teenager forced Zimmerman to the ground -- his head hitting the pavement -- and he cried out for help. It was then that Zimmerman, saying he had no other choice, shot Martin. Martin's family members say Zimmerman tracked down and sought out Martin, ignoring a 911 dispatcher's directive, then shot dead the unarmed teen. Unless there's a plea deal, the case is dismissed or there is another unexpected turn of events, the final decision of who is right and wrong will be made by jurors. What happened the night Trayvon Martin died . When they do, they'll delve into mounds of evidence, key elements of which emerged well after the initial hubbub erupted. For example, did Martin handle the gun he was ultimately shot with? No, according to test results made public last May, which showed evidence of Zimmerman's hands on the firearm, but not those of the teenager he killed. And an analysis showed that scrapings from underneath the teenager's fingernails did not contain any of Zimmerman's DNA, as may rub off in a prolonged struggle. Yet Zimmerman has said there was a bloody fight before the shooting, and he's got the pictures to prove it. Those include photos, reportedly taken minutes after the shooting, showing streaks of blood on the back of Zimmerman's head. And in December, a photo posted on Zimmerman's defense web site, one that his lawyers say was taken that same winter night, showed the defendant with blood on his nose and lips. Read police report . 2. George Zimmerman's legal defense fund keeps pulling in cash -- and needs it . As of January 2, the fund had raised $314,099, according to a web site established by Zimmerman's legal team to solicit contributions to help pay for the defense effort. That's up from the $180,000 Zimmerman raised on his own before turning the money over to his lawyer last year. What's the money been used for? The biggest single expense remains the $95,000 bond to secure his release from jail. The fund has also paid $61,747.54 in living expenses for Zimmerman and his wife, who are now living in an undisclosed rental home, at a price his legal team describes as ""reasonable,"" in Seminole County, Florida. Other expenses include $56,100 for security, a little more than $76,000 in expenses for the law firm and the case, and $3,201 in miscellaneous expenses. Those include Zimmerman's GPS monitoring fees, office supplies and the occasional pizza for interns on the case, who work for free, according to the web site. And they say they need much more money. Claiming that Zimmerman's team is already operating ""on a shoestring budget, relying on individuals who have been willing to work for free or at a substantially reduced rate,"" a message on the defense fund's web site predicts the total costs of defending Zimmerman will top $1 million. His two top defense attorneys, Mark O'Mara and Don West, have not been paid yet, the web site states. ""The state has virtually unlimited resources to prosecute George,"" the web site reads. ""To finance his defense, however, George relies on the generosity of individuals who believe he is innocent."" 3. Zimmerman is not just fighting the prosecution, he's also suing NBC . In December, Zimmerman filed a lawsuit accusing the network of taking his comments to a 911 dispatcher out of context in an effort to sensationalize the case. The lawsuit accuses the network of removing nearly a minute of dialogue and dead air between Zimmerman and the dispatcher to bring comments that Martin appeared to be ""up to no good"" and ""he looks black"" closer together. The lawsuit also accuses NBC of falsely claiming Zimmerman used a racial epithet in describing Martin. The network, Zimmerman's suit claims, used ""deceptive and exploitative manipulations"" to increase ratings. The network's airings of the edited recordings in March 2012 contributed to death threats that forced Zimmerman into hiding, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges that such coverage led to death threats against Zimmerman, who wears a bulletproof vest and was even dismissed from his college because it felt fellow students could be endangered. He also had to move from his neighborhood in Sanford, leading to various unforeseen expenses. ""Due to the defendants' journalistic crimes, Zimmerman has been transformed into one of the most hated men in America,"" the suit said. NBC Universal disputes the accusations. ""There was no intent to portray Mr. Zimmerman unfairly,"" the company said at the time. ""We intend to vigorously defend our position in court."" 4. 'Stand your ground' law doesn't apply, defendant's lawyers say . The Florida law, passed in 2006, says people who feel threatened don't have to retreat from danger, no matter where they are. And it became a huge point of contention after Zimmerman's arrest, with his supporters saying the incident demonstrated the precise need for the law and critics saying it encourages a ""Wild West"" or vigilante mentality. But Zimmerman's lawyers say it doesn't apply to his case, at least not exactly. ""In this particular case, George did not have an ability to retreat because he was on the ground with Trayvon Martin mounting him, striking blows, therefore the Stand Your Ground 'benefit' given by the statute simply does not apply to the facts of George's case: it is traditional self-defense,"" Zimmerman's attorneys said on the web site detailing his legal case. But they do intend to ask a judge to apply the immunity provisions of Florida's self-defense law to stave off a trial on the charges. Unstable ground: The fine line between self-defense and murder . The law says people who use fatal force within the guidelines set out by the law are immune from prosecution. A hearing on the issue could happen in April, according to the web site. 5. Trayvon Martin would have celebrated his 18th birthday this month . Martin would have turned 18 on February 5. His supporters marked his birthday with a peace rally in a historically black part of Sanford in central Florida, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. It was a relatively small affair, about 70 people, compared with the thousands who turned out regularly to support Martin's family and demand Zimmerman's prosecution in the weeks immediately after his death. Those rallies, led oftentimes by civil rights leaders from around the country, helped catapult the case into the national limelight. Trayvon Martin's parents ready to let jury decide fate of son's killer . Unlike early demonstrations, where supporters issued loud and relentless calls for justice, the Sanford birthday ceremony was more subdued. This time, supporters wore bracelets reading ""Band Together,"" WFTV reported, and called for healing in the community after the shooting, which divided black and white residents and put the police department in a harsh light for not immediately arresting Zimmerman. ""There's something coming out of this, and that's understanding. Sanford will be a better community for it,"" said lawyer Natalie Jackson, who was among those representing the Martin family in the spring. Two people who were front and center at those earlier rallies -- Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin -- were not in Sanford that day. Instead, they quietly and privately marked their late son's birthday in Miami, WFTV said.","Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman one year ago Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Gareth Bale's imminent transfer to Real Madrid for a reported world-record fee has been criticized by Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino. With Spain struggling amid a tough global economic climate, Martino questioned the appropriateness of Real spending on just one player a figure reputed to be at least $125 million and possibly as much as $145 million. ""He's a very good player, but the numbers seem to me almost a lack of respect for the world in general,"" the Argentine told reporters on Saturday at a press conference ahead of Barca's trip to Malaga. Bale, who plays for English Premier League club Tottenham, is next week expected to be unveiled as Real's fifth world-record signing since 2000. It will reportedly happen after Madrid, seeking to win back the La Liga title from Barca, play Granada on Monday in the club's second game this season. Barca spent $75 million to sign Neymar from Santos in June, but Martino said the Brazil striker is not guaranteed to start Sunday's match in Malaga despite the absence of the injured Lionel Messi. The four-time world player of the year is being rested as a precaution after suffering a bruised thigh in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Atletico Madrid last Wednesday. ""Honestly, I am not worried because I think he is fine,"" Martino said of his compatriot. ""What happened the other day was coincidence. I think it is totally unnecessary to take risks at the start of the season."" Neymar came off the bench to score the equalizer against Atletico, but Martino played down expectations surrounding the 21-year-old. ""I don't share this idea that says that Neymar must take over and take the lead if Messi is not there to do it,"" he said. ""We have Xavi, we have Andres Iniesta, Cesc Fabregas, Alexis Sanchez, Pedro. There are too many players to expect Neymar to automatically be in the starting line-up. ""Nothing is going to shorten the time we think is necessary for Neymar to be ready."" Bale has reportedly already traveled to Spain, and will not play in Tottenham's home match with Swansea on Sunday. The 24-year-old Wales international, who became the most sought-after talent on the planet following Neymar's decision to join Barca, also missed the London club's opening match of the EPL season last weekend. Spurs have twice broken their club transfer record in apparent preparation for Bale's departure, signing Brazil midfielder Paulinho and Spain striker Roberto Soldado, while a $45 million deal for Willian was hijacked by Chelsea despite the Anzhi Makhachkala player having passed a medical at White Hart Lane last week. In Saturday's EPL action, Liverpool joined Chelsea on two wins from two games after beating Aston Villa 1-0, as striker Daniel Sturridge followed up his goal from the opening victory over Stoke. Arsenal, beaten by Villa last weekend, relieved the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger by defeating London rivals Fulham 3-1 as Germany forward Lukas Podolski scored twice and France striker Olivier Giroud netted the other for the visiting team. Former Villa and England striker Darren Bent marked his Fulham debut with a goal after coming on as a second-half substitute, but Arsenal notched another morale-boosting win ahead of the second leg of the Champions League qualifier against Fenerbahce -- having won 3-0 in Turkey last Wednesday. Everton drew 0-0 at home to West Brom, and there was also a stalemate between Newcastle and West Ham, while Southampton hit back to hold visiting Sunderland 1-1. Hull beat Norwich 1-0 but fellow promoted side Crystal Palace crashed to a second successive defeat, losing 2-1 at Stoke. In La Liga, Valencia crashed 3-1 at Espanyol despite taking the lead through Portuguese forward Helder Postiga. David Lopez headed a 33rd-minute equalizer before second-half goals from Cristian Stuani and Thievy Bifouma sealed victory for the Barcelona-based team. Real Sociedad came back to earth with a bump following last week's 2-0 win over Lyon in the final Champions League qualifying round, being held 1-1 at promoted Elche. Mexico striker Carlos Vela saved Sociedad with a second-half leveler following Ferran Corominas' second-minute opener.","Real Madrid expected to complete world-record signing of Gareth Bale next week .

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- Malaysian authorities cracked down on protesters demanding free and fair elections Saturday, firing tear gas and arresting more than 1,600 people. Some 1,667 people had been arrested as of early evening, according to the Royal Malaysia Police, with 16 children among them. Protest organizers said at a news conference earlier in the day that about 400 had been detained. By Saturday night, police said the crowds had been dispersed. The government said the protest, organized by a loose coalition of opposition groups known as Bersih 2.0, was illegal. It had already declared Bersih an illegal organization and police said anyone found with Bersih-related materials, such as yellow T-shirts, could be arrested. ""Malaysians of all walks of life overcame the oppressive acts of the police to come out peacefully and in incredibly large numbers to show their love for their country and for the principles of justice,"" the coalition said on its website. ""We are nonetheless horrified that several hundred people have been detained, many of them without any justification whatsoever,"" it said. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim was among hundreds of protesters who gathered at the Hilton hotel in Kuala Lumpur before heading toward the Sentral Station. There the protesters breached police lines to march through the rail station, before being met by riot police with tear gas on the other side. Ibrahim posted on his Twitter account that he had sustained a minor injury during the demonstration and that a staff member had been badly hurt. He also said his youngest daughter had been arrested. Writing on his blog ahead of the protest, Ibrahim said the ""intended peaceful gathering"" was to bring Malaysians together ""as one united people in pursuit of clean and fair elections."" He went on: ""Our reason for gathering is pure and simple -- to demand that the electoral roll be cleaned, that the postal voting system be reformed, that indelible ink be used, a minimum 21 day campaign period be instated, free and fair access to media for all be provided, public institutions be strengthened, and for corruption as well as dirty politics to be stopped."" Opposition groups have been seeking to put pressure on the ruling party, which has been in power for decades, ahead of elections expected to be called next year. Among their demands are the use of indelible ink to ensure that voters cannot cast more than one ballot and an extension of the campaigning period, . The Malaysian state news agency Bernama reported that the prime minister had attended an event Saturday at which he described the protest as ""an illegal rally organised by a section of our community."" ""If there are people who want to hold the illegal rally, there are even more who are against their plan to hold the illegal gathering,"" he is quoted as saying. There was a strong police presence around the city and many roads had been closed off, local media reports said. A similar demonstration called by the Bersih coalition in 2007 was broken up by police using water cannon and tear gas, local reports say. CNN's Eve Bower contributed to this report.","Malaysian police say more than 1,600 people were arrested .

"(CNN) -- Bras can do miraculous things these days (thank you underwire). But can they detect cancer? That's the claim for First Warning Systems new bra, equipped with a series of sensors embedded in the cups that pick up temperature changes in breast tissue and, says the Reno, Nev.-based company, provide a thermal fingerprint that can alert doctors to the presence of malignant cells. According to the company's website, the data generated by the sports bra can predict the presence of breast cancer with 90% specificity and sensitivity. Women wear it for 12 hours to accumulate a stable enough reading of temperature, and the measurements are fed into the company's algorithm that then spits out a result: normal, benign, suspected for breast tissue abnormalities, or probable for breast tissue abnormalities. Sounds like a good idea, right? Except that the concept of using temperature to detect disease may not be ready for prime time just yet. ""Hypothetically, it's conceivable that malignant processes would have a temperature gradient compared to non-malignant tissues,"" says Dr. Therese Bevers, medical director of the cancer prevention center at the Univ. of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. ""But that gradient may not be very large."" (MORE: A Fashionable Fitâ€”high-tech athletic gear) The idea of using thermograms to ferret out abnormally growing cells is already being used with an imaging device that takes a temperature reading of breast tissue. Tumors need nutrients to grow, and they start to siphon these off from their own blood supply, which they start to build as they amass more and more abnormally growing cells. All of this metabolic work generates heat, and it's this temperature change that thermograms â€” and the First Warning bra's sensors â€” are designed to pick up. But when these profiles, which show ""hot"" and ""cold"" spots that are supposed to correlate to cancerous and non-malignant tissue, respectively, are compared to mammogram, MRI and ultrasound tests, their findings don't always match up. ""We see some thermograms come back as abnormal, and we do all kinds of imaging with mammogram, ultrasound and MRI and we follow the women and nothing develops,"" says Bevers. ""And we have women with breast cancers that are not seen on the thermograms. It's not perfect, and needs to undergo much more rigorous testing to understand what role temperature readings can play in cancer screening."" Even if the readings provide a positive result, and if, as the company says, the tumors are at their earliest stages and barely detectable as a mass, it's not clear what doctors can do for women at that point. Surgery isn't an option until tumors reach a certain size that can be identified and removed, and radiation and chemotherapy are too toxic to start before cancers reach a certain threshold to justify the side effects. What do doctors do with a positive test? For now, they would likely have women come in for more frequent mammograms, MRI or ultrasound testing, to evaluate whether their abnormally growing cells morph into tumors or not. If that's the case, most women will probably have had their tumors detected by one of these methods anyway, even if they hadn't used the bra. Already, the latest data raise questions about the efficacy of mammograms in women in their 40s; the United States Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended that women wait until they are 50 to start yearly screenings, because studies showed that the costs of screening women in their 40s, including additional testing and complications caused by these supplemental procedures, did not save more lives. So while the idea of wearing a sports bra for 12 hours to detect breast cancer certainly sounds appealing, the bra may be a bit ahead of itself. It's not clear yet whether predicting, and ideally treating breast cancer with the bra can reduce deaths from the disease, or help women avoid more advanced and aggressive cancers. ""We really need to have more solid data before we start adding on tests, especially when we have tests [like the mammogram, MRI and ultrasound],"" says Bevers. Those tests aren't perfect either, but they do have a track record of helping to save lives. Related Topics: Fashion & Beauty . &copy 2012 TIME, Inc. TIME is a registered trademark of Time Inc.

"Washington (CNN) -- An ancient Persian symbol of freedom, tolerance and coexistence has joined documents like the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights and the Emancipation Proclamation in Washington. The Cyrus Cylinder represents the spirit and ideals of Cyrus, the leader of the Achaemenid Empire in the sixth century B.C. After peacefully conquering Babylon in 539 B.C.and declaring his principles on the cylinder, Cyrus freed the Jewish population of Babylon from long bondage and rebuilt the Temple in Jerusalem. The Cyrus Cylinder inspired many throughout history -- in particular 18th century Enlightenment philosophers, historians and politicians in Europe and America -- as a source of their thinking on human rights, settling conflicts and leadership. Thomas Jefferson reportedly owned two copies of the Cyropaedia, Xenophon's biography of Cyrus, and carried it for inspiration and guidance. Today -- far from ancient Persia and the Enlightenment, in a different, far more divided Middle East -- the United States is struggling to open a window to resolve long-lasting tensions with Iran, tensions entwined closely with the fate of Israel, America's principal ally in the region. ""The Cyrus Cylinder sets up a model to run a multifaith, multifaceted, diverse society, leaving a model of the Middle East as a unit and what it could ideally be,"" said Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, in a recent TED Talk. The 2,600-year-old, football-sized clay cylinder is on loan from its permanent display at the British Museum in London for a five-city tour that began Saturday in Washington. ""In the Jewish tradition King Cyrus is known as the divinely anointed figure who enabled the Jews to restore their sacred institutions,"" said Rabbi Sarah Bassin, executive director of the foundation NewGround, a Muslim-Jewish Partnership for Change. ""Many in exile chose not to return to Jerusalem and the Holy Land because they felt comfortable and safe with the lives they had in the Persian lands,"" Shared values and common heritage that draw people together are subject to interpretation and can also push people apart. Yet, Bassin argues, ""Israel's identity is woven with the ancient stories of the Bible that happened throughout its borders, and now it's helpful to emphasize these core narratives that contain examples of cooperation and coexistence as a reminder that a different paradigm is possible."" Rabbi Marc Gopin, director of the Center for World Religions, Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution at George Mason University, suggests a country should be defined by the values of its culture and history rather than the policies of its government. ""Disputes should attack issues, not civilizations,"" Gopin said. An expert on Arab-Israeli diplomacy, Gopin said such an approach creates more ""nuanced"" relations. Ping pong diplomacy . Nuances are seen in President Dwight Eisenhower's cultural exchange program in the 1950s, which sent American jazz musicians, dancers and other artists to countries with strained diplomatic ties with the U.S. during the height of the Cold War. That paved the way for Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev's visit to the U.S. in 1959. And an invitation from China to a U.S. national ping pong team in the early 1970s led to President Richard Nixon's visit in 1972 -- the first by a U.S. president since the Communist takeover in 1949. ""Exchange derives the history of values globally, and the social empathy that comes from cultural exchange is better than one thousand negotiations,"" Gopin said. Cultural exchanges are going on between the U.S. and Iran, even with the ongoing conflict over its nuclear ambitions. The U.S. wrestling team was welcomed in Tehran last month. Eight Iranian art experts have planned a visit to the U.S. as part of a State Department cultural exchange program, which coincides with the arrival of the Cyrus Cylinder. ""When you're engaging with Iran, you should communicate based on those shared values,"" Gopin said. ""We all love the same values. Yet, we happen to have disagreements, so what should we do about those disagreements? Which is the point that ultimately leads to arguments and diplomacy."" ""If Iranians see a single, even small indication that today, the United States is going to talk and act wisely, I can assure you that talking to the United States or any other nation around the world is welcomed by the Iranians,"" Mohammad Khazaee, the Iranian ambassador to the U.N., told CNN last week. With the Cyrus Cylinder tour coming to the U.S. during a pivotal time in the relations of U.S. and Iran, the wisdom of Cyrus could guide diplomats to build constructively upon shared values. ""Each time a leader brings out the best things in the people they are fighting, magical things happen,"" Gopin said. The Cyrus Cylinder is on display at the Smithsonian's Sackler Gallery and Freer Gallery of Art through April 28. It will be in Houston from May 3 through June 14; New York from June 20-August 4; San Francisco from August 9-September 22; and Los Angeles from October 2-December 2.","The 2,600-year-old Cyrus Cylinder is on five-city tour of U.S.

"Washington (CNN) -- A top-secret court has renewed the authority of U.S. national security officials to collect telephone data as part of an anti-terror surveillance program that was exposed by intelligence leaker Edward Snowden. In an unprecedented disclosure, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said it had decided to declassify and announce the program renewal, which occurs periodically but is never publicized. Snowden leaked classified information about the National Security Agency program to media outlets last month and then fled the country. He has been charged with espionage and remains in diplomatic limbo at the Moscow airport after seeking temporary asylum. His detailing of the surveillance effort that required communications giant Verizon to turn over caller information triggered outrage from civil libertarians, certain members of Congress and privacy groups concerned with the sweeping nature of the telephone snooping and a companion effort that monitors e-mails. Silicon Valley to feds: Disclose your data requests . Officials have said metadata on overseas-related communications does not include content but provides information about numbers dialed and received as well as length, date and time of calls. President Barack Obama says the government is not listening in on calls, and other officials have said said the massive collection program has helped to detect terror plots. The national intelligence office did not say when the periodic renewal order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was handed down, but NSA legal authority under the Patriot Act to collect telephone metadata surveillance was due to expire on Friday. The new transparency appears to be an effort by the Obama administration to be more forthcoming about the program, the administration of which was sharply criticized this week by members of the House Judiciary Committee. Opinion: Your biggest secrets are up for grabs . One influential Republican member of the panel, troubled by the sweeping nature of how the telephone surveillance had been carried out, questioned whether Congress would act when the surveillance program comes up for renewal in 2015. Following the Snowden leaks, certain information about telephone collection was declassified ""in order to provide the public with a more thorough and balanced understanding of the program,"" a statement from the national intelligence office said. Privacy? Forget it, we're all celebrities online now . ""Consistent with his prior declassification decision and in light of the significant and continuing public interest"" in the matter, the office decided to declassify and disclose publicly that it had filed an application to renew telephone metadata collection ""in bulk"" and that the court ""renewed that authority."" ""The administration is undertaking a careful and thorough review of whether and to what extent additional information or documents pertaining to this program may be declassified, consistent with the protection of national security,"" the statement said. Although Verizon was singled out in the Snowden leak on telephone surveillance, it is believed that the government obtains similar orders for other telecommunications providers. All must be periodically renewed by the FISA court. No communications companies were mentioned in the intelligence office statement on Friday.","Disclosure unprecedented as intelligence officials seek to be more transparent .

"(CNN) -- Gaze across Cannes Bay this week, and you'd be forgiven for thinking you had stepped back in time. Each year, the French seaside town -- better known for its glamorous film festival and extravagant superyachts -- is transformed into a haven of historic nautical engineering. Over 100 elegant wooden vessels, their white sails billowing like giant quills, will cruise the Mediterranean in one of the biggest vintage yacht races in the world -- the Régates Royales de Cannes. Forget throbbing engines and high-tech satellite gear. These multimillion dollar boats hark back to an era when sail ruled the waves, built from designs dating back centuries. ""Using vintage yachts is completely different to modern sailing - it's not all about performance and technology,"" said Angelo Bonati, chief executive of sponsors Panerai, who also spent three years and more than $3.8 million restoring a 1930s boat which will race this week. ""Each classic yacht expresses elegance, authenticity, craftsmanship, and above all, rarity and exclusivity."" He added: ""Everybody speaks the same language -- passion for the sea and a love for the great ladies of the sea."" For the love of sail . If Bonati's words seems dramatic, then perhaps it's a reflection of competitors' devotion -- and huge financial investment -- in these vintage vessels. With classic yachts costing up to $13 million, and often built using traditional techniques, it's rare to see just one on the high seas -- let alone a fleet. ""There are 100 of these boats at Cannes, and there are not much more than 300 of them in the world,"" said Celine Castellanet, organizer at the Cannes Yacht Club which helps run the regatta. ""You can find a modern yacht anywhere. But for the crews taking part, these boats are really attractive because they're so unique."" Hailing from every corner of the globe, many of the classic yachts have a rich history, with the oldest built in 1896 by renowned Scottish designer William Fife. Also setting sail will be the 1930 Shamrock V. Originally owned by legendary English tea magnate Thomas Lipton, it was the fifth and final yacht he fielded in the America's Cup -- without success. Race of a lifetime . Cannes is the final stop in the prestigious Panerai Classic Yachts Challenge, featuring 10 regattas held in the Mediterranean and east coast of America. The event is divided into three categories according to the age of the yachts -- those built before 1950, those built before 1975, and those built after 1975 but using classic designs. Depending on weather conditions, the yachts will race various routes across Cannes Bay for around five hours. But for the 3,000 sailors taking part, maneuvering the old-fashioned vessels takes not just specialized knowledge -- but brute strength. ""These boats are really heavy,"" said Castellanet. ""When they're launched they take a long time to stop and turn around."" ""Unlike modern yachts, they don't have hydraulics, so sometimes it takes 10 guys pulling on the same rope."" Royal beginnings . The roaring twenties were a golden era for the French Riviera, with the crème de la crème of European society holidaying -- and sailing -- at the pretty seaside town of Cannes. In 1929 the first Régates Royales was born, in honor of Christian X, King of Denmark. World War Two put a temporary halt to the event, until it was re-launched in 1978. Fast forward 35 years and the prestigious regatta now attracts 40,000 visitors each year. However, this year will also be an emotional event, with the death of Cannes Yacht Club president Jean-Claude Montesinos earlier this month. Castellanet paid tribute to Montesinos' sense of humor and huge enthusiasm for the race. It is that same enthusiasm which sees thousands of crew members taking part, despite there being no prize money. Rather than staying in ritzy hotels, many sleep on board the yachts. ""A lot of different people are involved. The boat owners obviously have a high level of income. But the crews are often younger people with the strength to pull the ropes,"" said Castellanet. ""It's not about prize money. People do it for the spirit of the race.""","Introducing Régates Royales de Cannes -- one of the world's biggest vintage yacht races .

"(CNN) -- An arrest has been made in the stabbing death of a man who was apparently killed in an argument stemming from a long and intense West Coast baseball rivalry. A few hours after the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants played at AT&T Park in San Francisco on Wednesday night, a man wearing Dodgers gear was stabbed and killed in a fight. It happened just a few blocks from the stadium, authorities said. The victim was identified as Jonathan Denver, 24, the son of a Dodgers security guard. Michael Montgomery, 21, of Lodi, California, has been charged with one count of homicide, San Francisco police said Thursday. It's not clear how the fight started. Police say the suspect was part of a group that wasn't at the game. The Giants defeated the Dodgers 6-4 in the Wednesday night game. ""The fact that anybody got into any sort of beef over the Giants and the Dodgers and somebody lost their life,"" San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr said. ""It's just senseless."" In a prepared statement, the Giants called the incident ""horrific."" The club held a moment of silence for Denver before a Thursday night game, and police bulked up security. A Dodgers statement said ""the pain that this has caused his family and friends is unimaginable."" The 91-68 and playoffs-bound Dodgers have had a successful year, clinching the National League West. The disappointing Giants, who won last year's World Series, are next to last in the West with a 74-85 record.","An arrest has been made in a stabbing death after a Wednesday game .

"(CNN) -- The 161 passengers aboard United Flight 1603 must have known something was wrong when a crew member announced on the cabin loudspeaker if anyone aboard was a physician. The pilot, Capt. Henry Skillern, 63, was suffering a heart attack. The in-flight emergency Thursday night that began somewhere in the skies between Houston and Seattle prompted the 737 to divert to Boise, Idaho. Air traffic controllers radioed the plane's first officer who updated them with the captain's condition. ""We got a man down, chest compressions going on right now,"" the first officer said. ""I'm not sure too much right now on status."" Once the aircraft was on the ground, first responders boarded and rushed Skillern to Boise's Saint Alphonsus hospital, where he later died. The tragedy threatens to reignite the debate over FAA age restrictions for commercial airline pilots. In 2007, the mandatory pilot retirement age was raised from 60 to 65. At that time the FAA said five pilotsÂ -- their ages ranging from 48 to 57 -- had died in-flight since 1994, when the FAA began following that statistic. Related story: Health vs. experience central to pilot-age debate . When the FAA was considering raising the retirement age, then-administrator Marion Blakey underscored the value of pilot experience, calling it ""an added margin of safety."" ""Foreign airlines have demonstrated that experienced pilots in good health can fly beyond age 60 without compromising safety,"" she said. Friday, former Department of Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo said she doesn't believe the Flight 1603 tragedy alone will fuel a new debate over the issue. But she says it does point out the importance of careful pilot health screening. ""People die everyday from unanticipated heart attacks, but in many cases you can find problems when you do a rigorous physical,"" says Schiavo, who's now at the law firm Motley Rice, where she specializes in aviation. The FAA has already shown signs that it's looking more closely at other pilot related health issues, including the effects of prescription and over-the-counter medications. ""I think the FAA will probably revisit whether they're monitoring pilot health stringently enough,"" Schiavo says. Current FAA regulations call for a medical examination every year for commercial airline pilots under age 40 and every six months for those over age 40. To pass the exam, they must not have an established medical history or diagnosis of coronary heart disease that has required treatment. All airline pilots are required to get EKG heart checks at the age of 35. For those age 40 and older, annual EKGs are required. And airline pilots are required to report any heart disease to the FAA, regardless of when they learn about it. It wasn't immediately known whether Capt. Skillern was piloting the plane at the time he became incapacitated. Typically, there are two pilots in the cockpit so that during an emergency, either pilot can quickly take control of the aircraft. Flight 1603's passengers waited at the Boise airport until United flew in another pilot from San Francisco, before they were able to continue their journey to Seattle. CNN's John Branch and Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report.","United Capt. Henry Skillern, 63, of Humble, Texas, died after heart attack, according to coroner .

"(CNN) -- Kids are scared of the dark. That's normal. But Deonta Howard is now even more leery of nightfall. The 3-year-old boy was shot in the face last week and now says that whenever the sun goes down in Chicago, people might get shot again. His mom was taking him home from the hospital late Wednesday when reporters caught up with them. He told them he wants to go home to see grandma, but he says he's not going back to the park in their Back of the Yards neighborhood on the South Side. That's where two men allegedly opened fire on him last Thursday. Bullets from an assault rifle and another gun wounded 13 people, police say. Two of the victims were 15 years old. Little Deonta was the youngest hit. Luckily, all survived. Authorities think the violence may have been gang related. Deonta was shy and gave brief, quiet answers. He was short on eye contact but long on bravery. The flu shot he got at the hospital hurt worse than the gunshot wounds, Deonta told CNN affiliate WBBM. His face doesn't hurt, he assured. But his face defied his bravado. The right side was so swollen that it pushed his nose off to the left. A big bandage covered his upper lip. Tears streamed down his right cheek. It didn't look like he was crying. The eye was swollen shut, irritated and watering, it appeared. He will need surgeries for the next 15 to 20 years to correct the damage caused by a bullet that entered Deonta's ear and exited through his cheek, his mother Shamarah Legget said. He has had two already. ""But it's ok,"" she said. ""I can deal with anything, as long as my baby comes home."" A reporter's microphone stirred Deonta's playfulness. He reached for it. ""I got shot,"" he said into it. ""Right here, right here, right here, right here."" He pointed to spots on his face. Four men arrested . Police have arrested four men in connection with the shooting. Two of the suspects -- Tabari Young, 22, and Bryon Champ, 21 -- fired shots onto a full basketball court, Chicago police said. Champ, is a documented gang member. All four have been charged with attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm, police said. Young is accused of firing the assault-style rifle. Police say Champ also fired a gun of some kind. A third suspect, Kewane Gatewood, 20, is accused of supplying the assault weapon, and Brad Jeff, 22, was allegedly the lookout during the shooting, police said. 'It's got to stop,' Grandmother says after 3-year-old shot in Chicago . Deonta's grandmother has made a plea to those fueling violence in Chicago. ""Y'all out here killing these innocent people, kids, parents, grandparents, mothers, fathers: It's got to stop. You need to stop,"" Semehca Nunn said. Chicago bans some semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines and restricts handguns. The FBI's annual crime report last week showed Chicago had 500 homicides in 2012, up from 431 in 2011 and more than any other American city. Chicago officials have said homicides this year are below the 2012 pace. Still, Chicago does not have the highest homicide rate in the United States. That distinction belongs to Flint, Michigan, with one homicide for every 1,613 residents, according to the FBI data. Detroit is close behind, with one killing for every 1,832 residents. In 2012, the number of violent crimes increased by 0.7%, compared with the previous year, according to the FBI figures. For Chicago, 7 weekend homicides represent progress . CNN's Mariano Castillo and David Simpson contributed to this report.","3-year-old Deonta Howard will require years of surgery to his face .

"(CNN) -- One of the scariest scenarios of any sport must be the realization by a jockey that the half-tonne animal underneath him is not going to land successfully as it flies over a fence six feet high at nearly 50 kilometers per hour. The onrushing blades of grass appear like blurred lines of green just prior to the ground stopping both rider and horse in brutal fashion. In the blink of an eye, a kaleidoscope of colors can turn to black -- and lives can be turned upside down. It is the nightmare prospect for any jockey, his family and friends too, in a sport whose protagonists are constantly followed by an ambulance -- a regular reminder of the all-too-real threat of severe injury, potential paralysis and, in extreme cases, death. ""I was numb when I heard the news,"" said Fidelma Toole, whose son Peter was in a coma for 13 days after he fell at Liverpool's Aintree racecourse, on Grand National day, in 2011. ""It just wasn't really sinking in."" Thankfully, after years of hard work, which involved being taught to talk again during 18 months in rehab, the Irishman's prognosis is overwhelmingly good. Now 25, Peter is not only walking and talking, albeit at a somewhat slower pace, but is also -- miraculously in the eyes of many -- riding again. Despite his experiences, Toole still gets tongue-tied when meeting a fellow Irish jockey. In March, JT McNamara -- widely regarded as one of the most effective amateur jockeys in the history of British racing -- fell at the popular Cheltenham Festival. Reportedly a month away from retirement, the 37-year-old has been paralyzed from the neck down ever since. ""John Thomas will never leave your mind,"" said Toole, who had visited his friend a couple of days before talking to CNN. ""I just pray to God that that didn't happen to me. It was the simplest of falls and you can't believe the damage. He can move his head around and talk just fine, but he can't do anything else."" Given his own past, does Toole have any words of advice? ""No chance,"" he replied solemnly. ""All I can do is just go to see him and be there for him."" As he knows only too well, the advantages of having someone thinking of you can be immeasurable. For from the moment his charge Classic Fly fell in an incident he still doesn't remember, the pioneering Injured Jockeys Fund (IJF) was by Toole's side. Quite literally so. Founded in 1964 to assist two paralyzed riders, one of whom had fallen in that year's Grand National, the organization has been easing the lives of those with career-debilitating injuries ever since. Not only does the IJF provide instant logistical support and limitless rehabilitative work at a state-of-the-art building, its host of initiatives also include the provision of mortgages for those whose incomes have been decimated by injury. ""Basically, we are a charity to support beneficiaries in a financial, medical and emotional way,"" Lisa Hancock, the CEO of the IJF, told CNN. ""In over 49 years, we have supported over 1,000 beneficiaries."" Last year, the Suffolk-based organization assisted more than 500 members of the racing family, with 35 -- or 7% -- being new cases. Not all of them are jockeys, for a quarter of the workload is devote to stable lads and grooms, but the procedure is often the same whenever anyone is seriously injured. Leaving all medical care to professional doctors, the IJF initially concentrates on arranging the logistical needs that can overload friends and family -- dispatching one of its so-called ""almoners"" to assess all the varying requirements. ""The most difficult bit of the job is when you do get somebody who is seriously injured because as much as you try to stay distant from it, you can't help but have it get under your skin,"" said Karen Sharpe, one of the body's nine almoners. ""You are living and breathing the accident with their family and friends yet you must remain separate from it and not let it affect you. ""If you're falling to pieces because you find it hard, you're absolutely no use to anyone else -- and that can be quite difficult. But equally, if you are able to do even a little bit to help, then it's hugely rewarding."" Described as ""a one in a million"" by Fidelma Toole, Sharpe was the almoner sent to look after the family when Peter suffered his career-ending fall. With doctors attending the comatose jockey, Sharpe devoted her attentions to the family, arranging their transfer from Ireland and accommodation in Aintree among a myriad of other measures. ""I just can't imagine how it would have been without Karen or the IJF,"" said Fidelma. ""You are not thinking those first few days. You're just in a different world, wondering how the outcome is going to be. ""Having Karen there was hugely important. You wonder where you would have started otherwise. From the time Peter got hurt, she was on the scene at the hospital and she never left."" Today, Peter is back home in Ireland, his racing career cruelly taken from his grasp (""forget that -- that's gone,"" he says sadly), but he is able to ride out horses for one of his old trainers. His road to recovery was hugely helped by a lengthy stay at Oaksey House, the purpose-built rehabilitation center opened in the southern English county of Berkshire and named after IJF founder Lord Oaksey. The charity also flew Toole back to Ireland, so how can it afford such extensive service? ""Generous supporters, donations, legacies and Christmas work,"" said Hancock. ""We need $4m to cover our costs every year and that is what we typically get. We are very fortunate the racing community has taken the IJF to its heart. ""They empathize with the dangers of a jockey's life. Those supporters who watch on TV or go to the course see what the jockeys are doing, derive pleasure from it and this is their way of giving back."" So much so that the charity is in a position to give significant financial benefit to those in need. Take the case of Chris ""Red"" Kinane, an assistant trainer kicked so hard in the head by a horse that his life hung in the balance. After a year in hospital and 14 operations to rebuild his skull, Kinane's wages crumpled -- so the IJF stepped in. ""We take over the mortgages of jockeys who cannot fulfill their payments,"" Hancock explained. ""We then link the mortgage to the house price index, which means our money is secure and which means they do not lose their home. It is a long-term way of helping our beneficiaries."" It is also yet another remarkable service from an organization little known outside British racing circles. Next year, the IJF will celebrate its 50th birthday -- and is opening a new building in the north of England, in Yorkshire, as it does so. Yet this will not set the tone for the second half of its century. ""We can't open any more centers as we have to cut our cloth accordingly,"" says Hancock. ""There are only so many jockeys. We are reasonably well-financed and that is due to prudent care."" In the meantime, the IJF will go about its essential business: an organization no fit jockey wants to know too well, yet one that none can live without should misfortune come calling.","Injured Jockeys Fund caters for those who suffer severe injury in the British racing community .

"(CNN) -- The second season of the Showtime hit ""Homeland"" ended with an explosive finale that left the CIA headquarters in shambles and a former war hero on the run, suspected of setting a bomb that killed 219 innocent people. The third season, which premieres Sunday, begins 58 days where season two left off. At the Washington premiere of the new season, the cast told CNN what to expect when ""Homeland"" returns. With that in mind, here are 10 things you need to know about what's coming up on the Emmy-winning drama: . 1. Brody is missing. In the two episodes provided to critics, former military hero Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis) is nowhere to be found. Now that he's a wanted terrorist -- whose videotaped confession from season one is public -- nobody knows where he is. The show's trailers reveal he's in hiding overseas, but how soon he shows up is anyone's guess. 2. The bomber of the CIA is revealed. The last season left viewers wondering if Brody was responsible for the bombing, but the true culprit (or culprits) will be revealed sooner rather than later. Jackson Pace, who portrays Brody's son, Chris, said we find out who set up the bombing and if Brody is culpable ""relatively early in the season."" 3. The CIA is in a mess of trouble. After missing all the signs of Brody's continued ties to terrorism and the plot to bomb the memorial service of the vice president, the CIA faces the consequences of another massive intelligence failure. Claire Danes, who plays intelligence expert Carrie Mathison, put it this way: ""The CIA is in a very precarious position, is being held on trial and may not survive."" 4. Brody's family is left to deal with the consequences. With her husband a wanted terrorist, Jessica (Morena Baccarin) is struggling to raise her two children under intense media scrutiny with the assistance of her mother after the military has turned its back on the family. 5. Dana is in a very dark place. Brody's daughter, Dana (Morgan Saylor), starts out the season in a really bad psychological place. ""Her father was one of her closest allies and his bombing, as it's known ... has really put her in a bad place,"" Saylor said. In fact, we learn early on that Dana recently attempted to kill herself. 6. Saul's loyalties are put to the test. In the aftermath of the bombing, Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin) is in charge of the CIA. His loyalty to long-term protÃ©gÃ© Carrie will again be put to the test as he tries to clean up the department's mistakes while seeking to protect the woman he's often clashed with in the past. 7. Carrie and Mrs. Brody will interact more. ""We have a lot of really great scenes together this season,"" Baccarin said about her work with Danes. In the earlier seasons, the two -- who have fought over the heart and loyalty of Nicholas Brody -- have only appeared together onscreen a few times, but expect more fireworks when they reunite. 8. The investigation into the bombing will play a major role. A Senate investigation is under way into the terrorist bombing. Both Saul and Carrie are asked to testify at heated hearings, where questions about Brody and his alliances with the CIA take center stage. 9. Everyone is at risk. In the season two finale, several main characters were killed off, showing that anyone could die at any moment. In fact, there were plans to kill off Brody, both in the first and second seasons. When asked how he makes the writers keep him alive, Lewis laughingly responded, ""I have something on each of them."" But no one knows how long those secrets can keep him -- or any of the other characters on the show -- alive. 10. Despite it all, the cast is hopeful about the future. Members of the cast sounded optimistic when asked what they would like to see happen to their characters. ""It would be amazing if the Brody family found a way to reconcile,"" Baccarin said. Danes said that if she could decide, her character ""would live happily ever after."" But as the show's fans know, that seldom happens on ""Homeland.""","Showtime's ""Homeland"" returns for third season on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Five years. Sixty-two episodes. One big, presumably bloody finale. Hundreds of possible ways it could end. With ""Breaking Bad"" careening toward a climax Sunday night, fans of the AMC show -- newly anointed by Emmy voters as the best drama on TV -- are feverishly doing the plot-resolution math. The Internet is buzzing with potential clues, predictions and crazy theories as viewers debate the most fitting way to send teacher-turned-drug-lord Walter White into the Albuquerque sunset. Which characters will survive? Will Walt die, and how? Who is the vial of ricin, and the machine gun in his trunk, meant for? What will become of wife Skyler, son Walt Jr., sister-in-law Marie and -- most pressing of all -- Jesse, his tormented ex-partner in crime? Cryptic comments by Vince Gilligan, the show's creator, have only stoked the speculation. ""We worked long and hard to ensure that ... the very last episode â€” would satisfy an audience,"" he told Entertainment Weekly. ""I am guardedly optimistic that we have achieved just that. And furthermore, trying to be as coy as possible, trying to give away as little as possible, I feel like this ending represents on some level, however small, something of a victory for Walter White. ""Read into that what you will. And try to be as open-minded as possible when you watch this episode, because it may not indeed feel like a victory. Or maybe it will."" Got that? Only Gilligan, his actors and crew know for sure how the show will end its run. But that hasn't stopped the rest of us from trying to guess. Here are five theories: . Hail the returning conqueror . This one is the most obvious, and therefore the most unlikely. Walt shows up at Uncle Jack's compound, seeking his stolen money, and somehow takes out Jack, Todd and the rest of the neo-Nazi thugs -- either with a surprise hail of bullets or a stealthy dose of poison. In the process, he also frees Jesse, who either is a) so grateful to be sprung from his hellish existence as a meth-cook slave that he walks away, or b) so angry that he kills Walt right there, extracting a measure of revenge on the ""mentor"" who ruined his life. Bryan Cranston: Man of the moment . Shakespearean tragedy . Despite its comic moments, ""Breaking Bad"" at its heart is an epic tragedy with a high body count. In some ways it would be true to the show's dark heart if things end bleakly for almost everyone: Walt's attack on Uncle Jack goes wrong, he and Jesse are killed and Skyler goes to prison or commits suicide, orphaning Walt Jr. and Holly and leaving Lydia free to go on supplying Europe with crystal meth -- Walt's last, bitter legacy. Gray's frenemy . Some fans of the show think Walt got so worked up watching Elliott and Gretchen Schwartz -- whose lucrative Gray Matter pharmaceutical company may have been rightfully his -- on ""Charlie Rose"" at that bar in New Hampshire that he's been jolted into seeking some long-repressed revenge. He sure bolted from the bar in a huff. But why would he need an automatic weapon to confront a couple of scientists? Besides, such a quest would distract from bigger potential showdowns with other characters. Photos: Memorable scenes from 'Breaking Bad' Expect the unexpected . It wouldn't be a shocker to see Walt survive a showdown with Uncle Jack and crew, only to be blindsided by another antagonist. We're going to assume that Walt Jr. -- about the only unsullied character left on the show -- is not going to suddenly break bad and kill his old man. But Skyler has had a lot of time to seethe about how Walt destroyed their family and left her facing a prison sentence. As we've seen, Lydia is not above some ruthless maneuvers to protect her interests. And then there's Marie -- poor, grieving Marie -- who now hates Walt to the core of her widowed soul and may want to avenge Hank's death. 5 questions 'Breaking Bad' must answer . The ""Felina"" theory . Sunday's final episode is titled ""Felina,"" which has sent the Internet scurrying to decode its potential meanings. One resourceful writer for Previously.TV has unearthed a Marty Robbins song, ""El Paso,"" which has a character named Felina. In the song a jealous cowboy kills a rival who was flirting with his love, Felina, in a bar. The cowboy flees town alone before returning for Felina some time later, only to be shot down in a face-off with five unseen men. Felina, says the writer, is a metaphor for Walt's criminal life -- the seductive power he feels when he's earning respect and millions of dollars. Then again, ""felina"" is also an anagram for ""finale."" So it may just mean Gilligan is messing with us. Because there's only one thing we can say for sure about ""Breaking Bad's"" last episode: All our predictions will be wrong. How do you think ""Breaking Bad"" will end? How should it end? Let us know in the comments.","The Internet is buzzing with predictions and crazy theories about how ""Breaking Bad"" will end .

"(CNN) -- As Congress prepares to return from its August recess, Washington is gearing up for a national conversation on the balance between security and liberty, between necessary surveillance and necessary privacy. That's a good thing. It would be an even better thing if the discussion were based on fact rather than contaminated by inaccuracies and posturing. A quick review of recent commentary suggests that may not be likely. For example, Fox News seems incapable of commenting on this story without the header ""NSA Scandal,"" a lead that brings with it its own conclusion. A prominent U.S. senator recently opined that, ""They (the National Security Agency) basically I believe probably are looking at all the cell phone calls in America every day."" Another lawmaker has already concluded that the NSA is ""an agency out of control."" And a former congressman on a Sunday talk show added to the sum total of human knowledge with this: ""CIA! Hello! I mean we have a CIA. What's the NSA really about?"" I fear that the coming debate will have all the characteristics of a mob -- thoughtless action driven by artificial urgency, unreasoning fear, emotion and misinformation. And that's a pity since the heart of this issue has been around for years and deserves serious discussion. As far back as at least 2000, the NSA tried to hit the real question head-on. The agency knew that past targets of its surveillance largely communicated on their own dedicated networks. There was hardly a civil libertarian alive who would be concerned about trying to intercept communications between the Soviet high command in Moscow and intercontinental ballistic missile silos beyond the Urals. But the threats of the 21st century do not communicate on their own networks. Terrorists, drug traffickers, arms proliferators and the like live on a unitary global information grid where their communications co-exist with the communications of the very people the NSA is committed to protecting. It was clear even pre-9/11 that the NSA could not do its mission without working aggressively on this common grid. It was also clear that the agency would not have the power to do so -- legally, financially or technologically -- unless the American people were convinced that this power would be limited to its intended purpose, that even as constitutionally protected communications mingled with and were sorted from targeted communications, they would still be protected. And that basically is the issue of the moment, whether the headline is PRISM, XKeyscore, metadata, ""upstream"" communications, Blarney or an alleged NSA secret room at an AT&T facility in San Francisco -- all of which have been featured in recent coverage. Americans will have to decide what constitutes a ""reasonable"" expectation of privacy and what running room they will give their government to search for the signals almost everyone agrees should be captured even as those signals co-exist with their own. Although Congress, the courts and two administrations have authorized what the NSA is doing today, these are not easy issues. Resolution will hinge on how much trust people have in their government, or at least this part of it. It will also hinge on how much danger with which people are willing to live. And if this is to be a fact-based discussion, resolution will also hinge on how well citizens understand a few basics of what exactly is being done. Unfortunately, much of the public discourse is confused to the point of incoherence. Take the question of authorities. How does the NSA get the power to do any of this? In most instances, since this is about foreign intelligence, authority comes from the president and is codified in Executive Order 12333. Only when a U.S. person is involved or for certain kinds of collection in the United States does the agency have to rely on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the court it established. This is important. Most intelligence collection -- by the NSA, CIA or any intelligence agency -- is not overseen by a court. Oversight comes from the president and the Congress. But it is still oversight. Breathless claims that some things are done without court review could well be true -- and not very relevant. Then there is collection involving Americans. Most casual commentators simply assert that anytime the NSA is listening to an American, the agency must have a warrant. Indeed, trying to calm current concerns, President Barack Obama told Charlie Rose that, absent a warrant, ""What I can say unequivocally is that if you are a U.S. person, the NSA cannot listen to your telephone calls. ..."" Actually, that's not quite correct -- and never has been. As the president suggested later in the interview, the NSA cannot target the communications of a U.S. person. If it is tracking the communications of a legitimate foreign intelligence target and that target talks to an American, the NSA indeed covers it -- and always has. This simply makes sense. Picture a known terrorist who makes a series of operational calls to confederates in say Paris, London and the Bronx. To suggest that the NSA has to stop coverage of the last call is ludicrous. This is what the NSA calls incidental collection of information to, from or about a U.S. person. When this occurs -- and it is not rare -- the agency is required to keep its focus on the foreign intelligence in the communication and minimize or mask the U.S. identity unless the identity is essential to the intelligence (as it would be in the example above). Keep this in mind when commentators claim that the NSA has collected the content of American e-mails or phone calls. That may be, but the NSA is not targeting them without a warrant. And then there are the numbers. Like The Washington Post's August 15 headline screaming, ""NSA broke privacy rules thousands of times per year, audit finds."" You have to dig deeper to learn (as I pointed out in another piece) that all of the incidents were inadvertent; no one is claiming that any rules were intentionally violated; and all of the incidents were discovered, reported and corrected by the NSA itself. In one example, the Post referred to ""large numbers of data base query incidents."" The NSA later confirmed that in one quarter there indeed were 115 incidents of NSA queries being incorrectly entered, mistakes such as mistyping or using overly broad search criteria. That's 115 out of more than 61 million inquiries made in that quarter, a compliance rate of .999998. In this, as in most issues, facts (and context) matter. Understanding beyond the accusatory headline or the facile quip is needed, or we will be just tossing slogans at one another, slinging volleys of hyperbole, stoking fears and anger and distrust, all of which will make it even more difficult to resolve an already very difficult question. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Hayden.","Michael Hayden: It's good for U.S. to discuss balance between liberty and security .

"(CNN) -- Nearly one in four people worldwide is Muslim -- and they are not necessarily where you might think, according to an extensive new study that aims to map the global Muslim population. Nearly two out of three of the world's Muslims are in Asia, stretching from Turkey to Indonesia. India, a majority-Hindu country, has more Muslims than any country except for Indonesia and Pakistan, and more than twice as many as Egypt. China has more Muslims than Syria. Germany has more Muslims than Lebanon. And Russia has more Muslims than Jordan and Libya put together. Nearly two out of three of the world's Muslims are in Asia, stretching from Turkey to Indonesia. The Middle East and north Africa, which together are home to about one in five of the world's Muslims, trail a very distant second. There are about 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, according to the report, ""Mapping the Global Muslim Population,"" by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. That represents about 23 percent of the total global population of 6.8 billion. There are about 2.25 billion Christians, based on projections from the 2005 World Religions Database. Brian Grim, the senior researcher on the Pew Forum project, was slightly surprised at the number of Muslims in the world, he told CNN. ""Overall, the number is higher than I expected,"" he said, noting that earlier estimates of the global Muslim population have ranged from 1 billion to 1.8 billion. The report can -- and should -- have implications for United States policy, said Reza Aslan, the best-selling Iranian-American author of ""No God but God."" ""Increasingly, the people of the Middle East are making up a smaller and smaller percentage of the worldwide Muslim community,"" he told CNN by phone. ""When it comes to issues of outreach to the Muslim world, these numbers will indicate that outreach cannot be focused so narrowly on the Middle East,"" he said. ""If the goal is to create better understanding between the United States and the Muslim world, our focus should be on south and southeast Asia, not the Middle East,"" he said. He spoke to CNN before the report was published and without having seen its contents, but was familiar with the general trends the report identified. The team at the Pew Forum spent nearly three years analyzing ""the best available data"" from 232 countries and territories, Grim said. Their aim was to get the most comprehensive snapshot ever assembled of the world's Muslim population at a given moment in time. So they took the data they gathered from national censuses and surveys, and projected it forward based on what they knew about population growth in each country. They describe the resulting report as ""the largest project of its kind to date."" It's full of details that even the researchers found surprising. ""There are these countries that we don't think of as Muslim at all, and yet they have very sizable numbers of Muslims,"" said Alan Cooperman, the associate director of research for the Pew Forum, naming India, Russia and China. One in five of the world's Muslims lives in a country where Muslims are a minority. And while most people think of the Muslim population of Europe is being composed of immigrants, that's only true in western Europe, Cooperman said. ""In the rest of Europe -- Russia, Albania, Kosovo, those places -- Muslims are an indigenous population,"" he said. ""More than half of the Muslims in Europe are indigenous."" The researchers also were surprised to find the Muslim population of sub-Saharan Africa to be as low as they concluded, Cooperman said. It has only about 240 million Muslims -- about 15 percent of all the world's Muslims. Islam is thought to be growing fast in the region, with countries such as Nigeria, which has large populations of both Christians and Muslims, seeing violence between the two groups. The Pew researchers concluded that Nigeria is just over half Muslim, making it the sixth most populous Muslim country in the world. Roughly nine out of 10 Muslims worldwide are Sunni, and about one in 10 is Shiite, they estimated. They warned they were less confident of those numbers than of the general population figures because sectarian data is harder to come by. ""Only one or two censuses in the world ... have ever asked the sectarian question,"" said Grim. ""Among Muslims it's a very sensitive question. If asked, large numbers will say I am just a Muslim -- not that they don't know, but it is a sensitive question in many places,"" he said. One in three of the world's Shiite Muslims lives in Iran, which is one of only four countries with a Shiite majority, he said. The others are Iraq, Azerbaijan, and Bahrain. Huge as the project of mapping the world's Muslim population is, it is only the first step in a Pew Forum undertaking. Next year, the think tank intends to release a report projecting Muslim population growth into the future, and then the researchers intend to do the whole thing over again with Christians, followed by other faith groups.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The defense secretary will not ban smoking by troops in war zones despite a recommendation to do so by a Pentagon-commissioned study. Defense Secretary Robert Gates says he does not want to compound stress in combat zones by banning smoking. Secretary Robert Gates' decision stems from concern about the stress troops face, said his spokesman. ""We are fighting two wars right now, using a force that we are demanding more of than we ever have before. They are under enormous stress and strain, and the secretary does not want to compound that stress by taking away from them one of the few outlets they have to relieve that stress,"" Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Wednesday. A new study commissioned by the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs recommends a complete ban on tobacco, which would end tobacco sales on military bases and prohibit smoking by anyone in uniform -- including combat troops in the thick of battle. According to the study, tobacco use impairs military readiness in the short term. Over the long term, it can cause serious health problems, including lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. The study also says smokeless tobacco use can lead to oral and pancreatic cancer. Morrell said that Gates has not seen the report and will consider the recommendations to move towards a goal of a smoke-free military. ""There may be things we can do to try to move towards that goal. But he has been very clear to me, up front, that one of the things he is not prepared to do is to restrict the use of tobacco products in combat zones,"" Morrell said. Anti-smoking activist Richard Daynard said Gates' decision was logical. But he predicted that, as smoking is banned on military bases outside combat zones, ""then the problem over time will resolve itself, even in combat zones."" The founder of the Tobacco Products Liability Project likened the situation to that which prevailed during the 1980s, when smoking aboard U.S. commercial airlines was banned. ""There was an exception for the cockpit, at least on some airlines, on the theory that you probably don't want your pilot, if he's hooked on nicotine, to be cold-turkey while he's trying to navigate your plane."" But, he said, the exception has been phased out. CNN's Adam Levine and Tom Watkins contributed to this story.","No ban despite recommendation to do so in Pentagon-commissioned study .

"(CNN) -- The crowd of farmers in the Nile Delta's Sharqiya Province cheered loudly whenever the neatly groomed candidate came out with a new promise. Jobs! Schools! Better social services! A better future! He smiled broadly as the cheering swelled, wiping the sweat off his brow with a white handkerchief. He wore a freshly pressed white shirt with an open collar, under a well-cut blue blazer. He was the picture of authority and self-confidence. Afterward, one of the farmers brushed off the other contenders in the presidential election as posers. ""There is no one else,"" he told me. ""The other candidates don't care about Egypt. They've been hired!"" His candidate, Hosni Mubarak, easily won the election, back in September 2005, though there is little doubt it was rigged in his favor. It was another ""historic"" election, the first multi-candidate presidential election ever, though the challengers never had a chance against an incumbent backed by the vast resources and lack of scruples of the Egyptian state. Today, Mubarak is under armed guard albeit in a luxury wing of a Cairo hospital, awaiting the verdict from his trial in early June. Much has changed since the last presidential election, but much remains the same. Mubarak came from the military, and the military, in the form of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), still runs the country. While SCAF has tried to talk the talk of the new era, all of its members rose through the ranks of the Egyptian military with the blessings of Hosni Mubarak. According to the U.S. State Department cables posted on the Internet by Wikileaks, midlevel Egyptian army officers referred to Field Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the head of SCAF, as ""Mubarak's poodle."" SCAF has overseen the process that led to this presidential election, in which Egyptians had the opportunity to choose their president from among 13 candidates on the ballot (although two pulled out of the race). Since Mubarak stepped down on February 11, 2011, SCAF has stumbled from one crisis to another, reacting with violence and brutality against protesters, but often ceding ground when Tahrir Square filled and passions boiled. SCAF has pledged to hand over executive power to a civilian president by the end of June. In theory, Egypt is on the cusp of monumental change. These are heady days in Egypt. Everyone seems to be pontificating on politics, comparing candidates, pondering platforms. The election is everywhere. The airwaves are full of it, Facebook and Twitter are abuzz with it, the streets are festooned with posters and banners. On the surface it seems so different from the predictable, managed, officially sanctioned politics of the Mubarak years. But the choice facing Egyptians is, actually, little changed. Under the old regime, Hosni Mubarak made it clear he was the champion of the status quo, holding back the Islamist tide, led by the then-banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood. In this election, voters can choose the status quo -- with some lip service to post-revolutionary reality -- in the form of former foreign minister and later Arab League Secretary General Amre Moussa or ex-civil aviation minister and briefly prime minister Ahmed Shafik. Or they can opt for a new Islamic order, either with the full-on Muslim Brotherhood candidate, U.S.-educated Mohamed Morsi, or the Islamic-lite candidate Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh. Add to the mix Hamdeen Sabahy, a Nasserist who appeals to the leftists and the nationalists. In recent days Sabahy's numbers have been rising, perhaps as a backlash against the paucity of choices among the front-runners. The establishment -- the bureaucracy, the military, the intelligence services and the business community -- clearly doesn't want to see the Islamists come to power. Tuesday, the semi-official Cairo daily, Al-Akhbar, ran an ominous page-three story with the headline: ""Beware of a military coup: the future will be frightening if the Brotherhood reaches the summit of power."" The source of this disturbing headline was none other than former vice president and veteran intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, quoted in the London pan-Arab daily Al-Hayat. He painted a grim picture of the Brotherhood setting up a revolutionary guard, along the lines of Iran, to fight against the Egyptian military. The military, he warned, does not know how cunning the Brotherhood can be. Another Cairo daily ran banner headlines warning that if either of the Islamist candidates wins it would be ""Apocalypse Now"" -- A Mosaic plague of catastrophic proportions will descend upon Egypt, with a breakdown in security, violence, kidnapping, thuggery and theft, massive capital flight, political isolation, unemployment, poverty, and illness. On top of all that, once the Islamists have power, the paper predicted, they will murder all their political opponents. Those who are opposed to the Brotherhood tend to see them as forked-tongue Taliban in ties, eager to impose Islamic law, force women to cover up, and ban alcohol. But for Egyptians struggling with rising prices and low wages, the Brotherhood offers the promise of a better future. Indeed, the view is not so grim among those who have received only the crumbs off the status quo's table. Gamal, a bank clerk living in the old Cairo district of Sayida Zaynab, will be voting for Mohamed Morsi of the Brotherhood. ""The health system is in bad shape, as is education,"" he says. ""Conditions for people in Egypt are very, very bad."" In the Nile city of Beni Suef, farmer Ashour Darwish attended a crowded Muslim Brotherhood rally, eager to hear Morsi speak. He supports the Brotherhood, he told me, because they are champions of what matters to him: ""justice, transparency, implementation of Islamic law, the plight of the poor farmers, and unemployment."" The Brotherhood's political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, won more than 40% of the seats in Egypt's lower house of Parliament in recent elections. After being hounded by the police and intelligence agencies for decades, they are finally free to operate, and aren't shy about flexing their muscles. Jihad Haddad, a young Brotherhood member, sees no reason why the group should be shy about its power. ""We came by the vote of the people and by the choice of the people,"" he says. ""What we really want is application of real reform policies on the ground, and we can't have that opportunity if we are out of executive power."" It would be rash at this point to make any predictions of who will actually win that executive power. The Muslim Brotherhood is a formidable organization that can mobilize its supporters and ensure a high turnout. They did it for the parliamentary elections and they'll doubtless be able to do it this time as well. But the prospect of both the legislative and executive branches dominated by the Brotherhood worries many. Magdi Zaki works in the Finance Ministry, and voted for the Brotherhood. But he feels they are novices in power, grandstanding on live broadcasts from the parliament, but doing little else. ""They have no political background,"" he says dismissive contempt, like a seasoned theatre critic dismissing a flop. Polls of potential voters have been all over the place, but they do show that a majority of Egyptians have yet to make up their minds. They debate the choices in taxis and buses, in the subway, in cafes, over breakfast, lunch and dinner, over Twitter and on Facebook, changing their minds between meals. One seasoned veteran of Egyptian politicsâ€”who requested anonymityâ€”chuckled over the fickle nature of the voters, and puts it this way: ""This is the first time I've ever had people ask me, 'Who do you think is going to win the presidential election?' I honestly have no idea.""","Much has changed since the last presidential election .

"(CNN) -- Think of it as a giant barometer for climate science. With a new groundbreaking study on climate change seemingly coming out every other week, it can be hard to keep up with the latest findings. Fortunately, every five to six years, the United Nations sums it up in a comprehensive report. That's what's going on this week in the Swedish capital Stockholm, where the latest Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is set for release on Friday. The document will bring together the latest research from top scientists around the field. The IPCC is recognized as the leading authority on the subject of global climate change. The first section of its new report -- the fifth since the organization was formed in 1988 by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization -- contains a ""Summary for Policymakers,"" aimed at guiding politicians and lawmakers worldwide on decisions regarding the environment over the next several years. The amount of research that goes into each section of the report is staggering. Friday's report is the culmination of work by over 250 authors from 39 countries and was subject to an extensive review process involving more than 1,000 experts. In addition to the rigorous scientific review, representatives of 195 governments are meeting in Stockholm to approve, line-by-line, each section of the Summary for Policymakers before its release. More than 850 expert authors from 85 countries contributed research for the full report, which will be released in three stages through April. The first, on the physical science behind climate change, will accompany the Summary for Policymakers on Friday. The second, expected in March, will cover ""impacts and vulnerabilities"" of climate change; the third, on mitigation efforts, is set to go out in April. Bloomberg: Why Sandy forced cities to take lead on climate change . What is expected in the report . Friday's report is expected to contain language that further identifies the role human activity is playing in increasing global temperatures through burning of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. The last report, in 2007, indicated that it was ""very likely"" that humans were responsible for most of the observed warming -- a judgment that corresponds to a confidence level greater than 90%. A draft that leaked in August raised that confidence level to ""extremely likely,"" or greater than 95% confidence that humans are responsible for the majority of global warming through carbon pollution. The impacts of this warming are already being seen through increases in extreme weather events like heat waves, droughts, and extreme flooding events, which the assessment will highlight. The report will lay out projections for climate change through the end of the century, based upon four different carbon emission scenarios. Those range from a low end which would require significant cutbacks in emissions, to a worst-case scenario in which carbon emissions would continue to climb unabated. The projections will provide more details about sea-level rise, for which observations show rates increasing, and should give a more precise estimate of the levels we will see at the end of the century. Loss of sea ice will also be addressed, and the report will discuss the accelerating loss of sea ice in the Arctic and the slight increase of ice seen in the Antarctic. Climate change may increase violence, study shows . Critics of the report . Despite the overall breadth of the scientific expertise involved, and the extensive review and approval process, the IPCC Assessment Reports spark quite a few criticisms, from both climate change believers and skeptics. Skeptics claim the IPCC exists only to produce further evidence supporting the idea of man-made climate change while ignoring opposing research. But climate change activists, and many climate scientists, believe that the IPCC's consensus-seeking policy produces conclusions and estimates that are too conservative. Another often-cited critique of the report is that, due to its size and lengthy approval process, it is already outdated by the time it is released. Several important studies already have been published in the past year in the constantly evolving science of climate change that will not be included in this assessment. Despite the critics, this week's document will serve as a major measuring stick for the current state of the world's climate and what type of change is in store. The Summary for Policymakers will be available Friday at http://www.climatechange2013.org.

"(CNN) -- Hands in pockets, a downward glance, tiger print glasses and Ralph Lauren from head to toe. Sounds like a fashion spread in a magazine, right? Except the model is a toddler from New York City, one of many whose notable outfit and saucy pose has inspired an audience online. Shoulders-up school portraits, these are not. These kids wear labels and looks usually designated for adults, and they wear them with panache. Some are more notable for the combination of clothes, for the slick lighting and scenery, or the oh-so-adult face they put forward for the camera. You'd probably call it swagger. When kids have it, they essentially look like petite versions of models in a Hugo Boss ad: A cool air of confidence exuded for camera-wielding parents. But is that swagger because kids are more fashion savvy? That the proud parents are just taking more photos? Or that fashion these days is more impressed by the sartorial choices of 3-year-olds? Maybe a little bit of everything. Julia Samersova, a casting director by trade, runs ""Planet Awesome Kid,"" a blog started in 2009 that catalogs the street fashion sense shown off by Brooklyn's youngest residents, and the attitude that goes along with it. Adler started by taking photos of children she saw around her neighborhood that had something special -- a great haircut, a really unique outfit or really great energy. It's a diverse, artistic community where the parents and kids have a high capacity for fashion, she said. ""We never got a 'no' from a parent, ever,"" Samersova said. ""The kids in Brooklyn dress better than the adults in most of the rest of the country, which is the truth."" But it turns out that the young and stylish are everywhere. ""We were getting e-mails from people all over the world, from China to Russia to Israel. From everywhere. From Africa."" she said. ""People were like, 'Oh, you think your kids dress the cutest in New York? Look how cute my kid is in wherever.'"" Planet Awesome Kid is hardly the only place on the Internet devoted to kid swagger: Pinterest and Tumblr have given rise to devotees of kiddie fashion. Some children, like Alonso Mateo, have fan pages devoted to his natural ability to put a high-fashion outfit together. On Tiffany Beveridge's viral Pinterest board, ""My imaginary well-dressed toddler daughter,"" there's a less serious approach to the trend. It started out innocently enough -- a catalog for the adorable little girls' clothing that came across her Pinterest page -- but her sense of humor quickly got the better of her. ""I began finding all the elaborately dressed and highly styled kids,"" said the the freelance copywriter from Philadelphia. Her immediate reaction was to add captions about the fantastic life of a fictitious daughter, whom she named Quinoa. ""Quinoa says why walk into a room when you can SHAZAM! into a room?"" she wrote under a photo of a solemn blonde child in a black dress and ballet flats, kicking one leg behind her. ""When Quinoa wants volume, she doesn't just tease her hair, she relentlessly bullies it,"" Beveridge labeled a photo of a wide eyed child with mile-high red hair. ""It was when Quinoa demanded a miniature deer at her Pre-K portrait session that I truly began to understand her gift,"" she posted on a quirky photo of a girl with a messy updo, red tights and an ultra-short mushroom print dress, standing over, yes, a miniature deer. ""It was also around that time that quinoa, the grain, had become extremely trendy, which I found hilarious. I mean, come on, a trendy grain? I figured it was only going to be a matter of time before somebody named their kid Quinoa,"" Beveridge said, ""and then I realized that person would be me."" Most of the images come from ad campaigns, but Beveridge has found that fashionably dressed tots have a large geographical footprint. ""I'll get tweets from people all over the world about 'Quinoa sightings' in their area,"" Beveridge said. What's less clear is how people feel about it. Some adults really love the looks. Some think it's cute or hilarious. Some find it weird, or even offensive. ""Is this cute and harmless or kind of perverse,"" Beveridge said. Kiddie swagger might be off most parents' radars, said Kevin Everhart, a clinical psychologist and professor in Denver who specializes in child psychology. Despite any artistry or irony these images present, they can have a much different meaning outside of Brooklyn or the fashion community, Everhart said. He worries about the potential for exploitation in mature styles that are sometimes picked, posed and photographed by adults, but very much featuring children. ""That sense of feeling creeped out is there for a reason,"" Everhart said. It's murky territory even for parents collecting, posting, organizing and distributing the images, he said. If parents actually focus on the social cachet of a child's outfit, they could end up objectifying their children. ""To some extent, these are children being treated like poodles,"" he said. Mass merchandisers and baby boutiques cater to that parental pride, and sometimes take advantage of it, he said. For example, baby shirts emblazoned with the logos of rock bands from the '70s and '80s say more about the parent than the child. ""They're selling an idea to a parent that says 'My child is cool; I'm cool. I'm much older, but I haven't lost it. I'm still just as happening as I was before,"" he said. Encouraging the sort of ""Zoolander"" affectations in kids is as easy as laughing at them or taking their picture. It teaches children that they get attention if they act that way, Everhart said. Often that's a completely unconscious exercise, for parent and child, he said. After all, it's not unusual for children to emulate what they see in pop culture. ""Every generation recreates its pop idols,"" he said, ""and much of what we see in youth culture is a response to the adult world."" But playing dress-up, after all, is one way toddlers learn about self-expression, Beveridge pointed out. ""We all know that toddlers can be extremely opinionated, so with these well-dressed kids, it begs the question of who's in charge,"" she said. ""I think we like to imagine both scenarios: Maniacal parents forcing this on their kids, as well as headstrong kids throwing a tantrum because they really, really want that Armani jacket."" There is something a little strange about just how much sass her 4-year-old daughter can show, said Samersova, the Planet Awesome Kid blogger. ""When I turn a camera on her, she automatically goes into some kind of weird, funky, funny pose,"" she said. But don't feel too bad if you've done your fair share of spamming Facebook or Instagram with your child's personal fashion show. A photo of a kid with swagger isn't necessarily creepy, or bratty or parental pride gone wild. ""It comes from, 'Oh my God, that dress is so cute on my daughter,'"" Samersova said. ""It doesn't have to be any deeper than that."" Do you think these kids are just expressing their natural fabulousness or that their parents need to step back and prioritize other qualities over fashion? Share your take in the comments section.","Blogs, Pinterest and Tumblr showcase photos of children wearing high fashion .

"(CNN) -- With all due respect to arachnophobes, I love spiders. Some might call me obsessed, but I've been studying spiders and spider silks for many years now and don't see an end in sight. There is simply too much to do. Spiders have been around for over 300 million years and are found in nearly every terrestrial environment. There are more than 40,000 species living today and each spins at least one type of silk. However, most spiders spin more than one type of silk. For example, the orb-web weaving spiders that are commonly seen in gardens during the day or near porch lights at night, typically make seven kinds of silk. Each silk is chemically and functionally distinctive. An individual spider can produce multiple varieties of silk because it has numerous silk glands inside its body. Some silk glands make one type of silk, another set of silk glands makes a second type of silk, and so forth. One of the unforgettable moments in my life was the first time I dissected a spider and saw its stunningly beautiful, translucent silk glands. Spiders make good use of their many silks. When you look at an orb-web, there's one type of ultra-strong and fairly stiff silk that makes up the scaffold. This silk, which is also used as the safety drag line, is tougher than almost all biological and man-made materials. The sticky spiral of the orb-web is composed of two different silks, one a glue and the other a highly stretchable fiber. The glue and the fiber are produced in separate glands and the spider dots the glue onto the fiber while building the web. TED.com: Put a value on natural . Spider silks, with their magnificent diversity and amazing properties, are the perfect system to engage people from different walks of life. Geneticists, engineers, biotechnologists, artists, natural historians, and comparative biologists (like me) can forge exciting collaborations. Researchers around the world are working on silks spun by spiders from around the world. Inspiration and knowledge are being exchanged along a modern version of the ancient silk road. Speaking of the ancient silk road, I'm often asked what's the difference between spider silk and silkworm silk, the kind of silk in a typical silk scarf or blouse. Silk used in textiles is spun from the mouths of caterpillars to form cocoons that protect them while they transform into moths. A silkworm has only one pair of silk glands and can make one type of fiber. TED.com: Silk, the ancient material of the future . Spiders, in contrast, have many silk glands, and the silk emerges from spinnerets located towards the rear of their bodies. Spiders are also able to spin silk from when they are very young and continue to do so throughout their lives. Researchers are drawing inspiration from spider silks to produce novel, protein-based, eco-friendly materials for use in medical, cosmetic, electronic, textile, industrial, and other applications. The potential is enormous, especially considering the mind-boggling diversity of spiders and their silks. For me, each day begins and ends with wanting to learn a little more about the secrets of spider silk. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cheryl Hayashi.","Cheryl Hayashi: Spiders spin many different kinds of silk .

"(CNN) -- Rain, floods, evacuations and power cuts may have hit Sochi -- but an Olympic size effort is underway to ensure the city is ready to host the 2014 Winter Games. Streets and homes were flooded Tuesday with Irina Rossius, the press secretary for Russia's Emergencies Ministry, forced to admit that a state of emergency was still in effect, according to Russian state agency, RIA Novosti. While the local Emergency Ministries branch had denied that a state of emergency had been imposed, ""the negative outlook"" for Tuesday night has led to a change in circumstances. It is estimated that 1800 workers are currently undertaking work to clean the city following the evacuations of residents. While 10 homes in the village of Mirny and some train stations in the Adler district are still flooded, the ministry stated on its website that rescue teams had made progress by pumping out water and allowing some trains to run. The ministry also confirmed that all 30 residents who were moved from the village of Kepsha have since returned home after the water level drop from 45 centimeters to 5cm. Flights at Sochi's regional airports were canceled amidst severe weather, while traffic jams left the roads in turmoil. Kubanenergo, the local power company, confirmed Tuesday that it had cut off the power in five regions to avoid risking power outages. The floods come at the worst possible time for Sochi with the International Olympic Committee coordination committee making its final visit to the city before the Games, which start on February 7. The commission's chairman, Jean-Claude Killy, will finish his visit on Thursday after holding meetings with organizers and visiting venues. ""The exceptional weather conditions in Sochi have not impacted the visit of the IOC coordination commission that is in Sochi from Sept 24 to Sept 26,"" read a statement sent to CNN by the IOC. ""The Commission's work is ongoing and they have just completed a successful visit to the mountain venues."" When contacted by CNN Wednesday, the Olympstroy press office insisted none of the venues had been damaged by the adverse weather. ""None of the sports venues in Imeretinskaya lowland and in Krasnaya Polyana have been affected by heavy rainfall,"" read a statement.

"(CNN) -- Vera has found a good man. He loves her and her 16-year-old daughter. His work provides their income and allows her to attend nursing school. They married two years ago and their future was set. Except for one thing. Lucio came to the United States illegally and has been living as an undocumented immigrant. At any time he could be deported to his native Peru. Although undocumented, Lucio was able to find work as a contracting muralist in Houston, where Vera -- a U.S. citizen -- was born and raised. He learned to speak English in less than three years for work and the need to communicate with the ""love of his life"" as he put it. ""I love this country and have made it my home. I want to be able to contribute to this country and give back in any way I can,"" said Lucio. He said he got his Tax ID number as soon as he started working because he wanted to get started on the right path and pay his taxes. Vera also depends on Lucio for emotional support as she suffers from PTSD. She is a victim of sexual molestation and suffered mental and physical abuse while growing up. They'd always planned for Lucio to apply for citizenship, but were afraid of going into the system that would require him to return to Peru for up to 10 years. ""I used to have nightmares about Lucio and I separating. I used to worry so much about it,"" said Vera, ""I wouldn't know what to do without him. If he left I wouldn't know how to run his business."" Now Vera and Lucio, whose last names we've agreed to withhold to protect their identity, are entering that system, hopeful that they won't be separated. Come March, many mixed-status families will breathe a sigh of relief knowing they won't have to remain separate for a long period of time while they apply to become legal residents in the U.S., according to a new rule made by the Department of Homeland Security announced last week. The new rule does not guarantee legal status to the undocumented immigrant -- the family still has to prove that the deportation of the spouse or parent would cause ""extreme hardship"" to the U.S. citizen. ""I'm so relieved he gets to stay here while we go through this process, it makes a big difference,"" Vera said. Sarah Monty, Lucio's immigration lawyer, is optimistic that his waiver will be approved. USCIS Director Alejandro Mayorkas said in a press release: ""The law is designed to avoid extreme hardship to U.S. citizens, which is precisely what this rule achieves."" ""The change will have a significant impact on American families by greatly reducing the time family members are separated from those they rely upon."" Under current law, immediate relatives of U.S. citizens who are not eligible to adjust status in the U.S. to become lawful permanent residents must leave the country and obtain an immigrant visa in their home country. Those who have accrued more than six months of unlawful presence while in the United States must obtain a waiver to overcome the unlawful presence bar before they can return to the U.S. after departing to obtain an immigrant visa. ""This final rule facilitates the legal immigration process and reduces the amount of time that U.S. citizens are separated from their immediate relatives who are in the process of obtaining an immigrant visa,"" said Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano in a press release. Monty fears that because the eligibility is so specific to a certain group of people, many undocumented immigrants are going to be confused as to why they do not qualify and suggests they seek out legal counsel. She said the new regulation was a huge step forward and sadly long overdue. Undocumented immigrants married to a U.S. citizen are the most vocal group said Monty, and if this provision works, this might extend to other groups. The new rule does not apply to U.S. children with an undocumented parent. In other words, you cannot give birth to your own waiver. The child, whether undocumented or not, must have a U.S. citizen as a parent. A legitimate concern for many -- if the waiver is denied -- is that individuals are also putting the government on notice that an undocumented spouse or parent lives in the U.S. because it might put themselves at risk for deportation. ""Applying for this waiver means that you are putting yourself out there. ICE told me that their priorities are to go after criminal aliens,"" said Monty, but added, ""Undocumented immigrants without a criminal history do not need to worry."" The National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum applauds the Obama administration for their rule change. NAPAWF teamed up with the National Domestic Workers Alliance to advocate to keep women and their families together at the We Belong Together campaign. During the past two Christmases they organized thousands of letters from children to be sent to congress asking them to stop deporting their parents. ""This is clearly a step in the right direction, but a lot more work needs to be done,"" said Wida Amir, Immigrant Rights Program Director at NAPAWF in an interview, ""We need a broader comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship. Congress needs to address the whole package.""","New rule can reduces time U.S. citizens are separated from undocumented relatives .

""We want to unite people around the world to build a sustainable future."" The message seems to hit home. Earth Hour 2012 has commitments from individuals, companies and landmarks to switch off lights in 147 countries and territories and over 5,000 cities, organizers say. Sydney's Opera House is scheduled to go dark, followed by Asian landmarks such as the Great Wall of China, the Tokyo Tower, Taipei 101 and the India Gate. In Dubai, the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, will switch off its lights. Other landmarks pledged to switch off: The Eiffel Tower in Paris, London's Big Ben, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro and the Empire State Building in New York. Kuipers will watch the spectacle from orbit, sharing photos and live commentary on the event from space for the first time. Taking place on the last Saturday each March, the numbers of people and countries participating has increased each year, Ridley says. ""It became easier than ever to connect people around the world,"" says Ridley. But Earth Hour's long term goal is to go ""beyond the hour."" For Ridley, the important question is not if action on climate change is happening, but ""is it happening fast enough,"" he says. ""We need to move a lot further, faster and as soon as possible. That is the big challenge, that we all move and that the economies can adapt to the change."" Organized by the World Wildlife Fund, Earth Hour started in Sydney in 2007, when WWF-Australia encouraged 2.2 million individuals and more than 2,000 businessmen to turn off their lights for one hour to support action on climate change.","Earth Hour asks individuals and businesses to turn off their lights at 8:30 p.m.

"(CNN) -- A 56-year-old British woman caught smuggling blocks of cocaine in her suitcase has been sentenced to death in Indonesia. Prosecutors in Bali had asked for a 15-year sentence for Lindsay June Sandiford, who was arrested last May carrying what officials said was cocaine worth an estimated $2.6 million. Read more: British housewife caught with $2.6M in cocaine could face death . But a panel of judges opted Tuesday to hand down the death penalty. Their decision was based on the defendant having shown no regret for what she did, Indonesian state news agency Antara reported. Sandiford, from northeast England, was found to have blocks of cocaine weighing 4.7 kilograms (10.4 pounds) in her suitcase when she arrived on the island of Bali in May, the court heard. ""We were surprised by the decision, because we never expected the death penalty,"" Ezra Karo Karo, a lawyer acting for Sandiford, is quoted by Antara as saying. He said the judge did not consider mitigating circumstances in his client's case, such as that she acted under the threat of violence to her family, the news agency reported. The UK Foreign Office confirmed the sentence but said only that it would continue to provide consular assistance. ""The UK remains strongly opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances,"" a Foreign Office statement said. Read related: Saudis defend Sri Lankan maid's execution, hit back at criticism . Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, has strict laws against drug trafficking. The head of Bali's Customs and Excise Agency monitoring division, Made Wijaya, warned at the time of her arrest that Sandiford could face execution if convicted. ""The main reason is because narcotics can massively endanger the young and, thus, whoever is caught with drugs should be severely punished. If three people can consume one gram of cocaine, then this operation has potentially saved up to 14,000 lives,"" he said. The UK-based group Reprieve, which works to secure the human rights of prisoners around the world, said Sandiford was a vulnerable person who should not have been sentenced so harshly. ""Lindsay has always maintained that she only agreed to carry the package to Bali after receiving threats against the lives of her family,"" said Harriet McCulloch of Reprieve. ""She is clearly not a drug kingpin -- she has no money to pay for a lawyer, for the travel costs of defense witnesses or even for essentials like food and water. ""She has cooperated fully with the Indonesian authorities but has been sentenced to death while the gang operating in the UK, Thailand and Indonesia remain free to target other vulnerable people."" Any appeal for Sandiford must be filed within 14 days, McCulloch said in a written statement. ""It is vital that the British government do everything possible to support Lindsay's appeal against the death sentence,"" she added. Sandiford's lawyer told Antara that it was likely that his client would appeal the sentence. Reprieve says that after her arrest, Indonesian police interrogated Sandiford without a translator, legal representation or the assistance of the British Embassy for 10 days. The U.S. State Department warns travelers to Indonesia of the risks of being caught smuggling drugs. ""Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Indonesia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines,"" or the death penalty, it says. ""Indonesian prisons are harsh and do not meet Western standards."" Paul Armstrong, Joseph Netto and Rudy Madanir contributed to this report.","""We never expected the death penalty,"" the defense attorney is quoted as saying .

"(CNN) -- U.N. inspectors returned to Syria on Wednesday to look into at least a half-dozen claims of chemical weapons use -- some allegedly by the regime, others allegedly by rebels. The team has already confirmed the August 21 use of chemical warfare near Damascus but did not explicitly say who was responsible. According to U.S. estimates, that attack left more than 1,400 people dead. The move came the same day a U.N. diplomat told CNN that three basic premises have been agreed upon for a U.N. Security Council resolution on Syria's chemical weapons disarmament. Russia has basically agreed to the points, but ""small issues"" remain to be decided, the source said. The deal could still fall apart. According to the source, the three premises are: 1. Accountability for attacks on August 21; 2. Binding and enforceable language for measures against Syria in case of violations in the disarmament regime or the use of chemical weapons; 3. The council will remain seized of the matter, meaning that further discussion will be expedited. The resolution would not authorize automatic use of force if Syria is said to be in violation, as was previously sought by the United States, the source said. Among their tasks, investigators will try to figure out if chemical weapons were used in the northern city of Khan al-Asal in March. State-run media blamed rebels for the attack, which it said killed 25 people and injured more than 110 others. Syrian rebels, meanwhile, accused government forces of a chemical weapons attack on the rural Damascus suburb of Ateibeh. Syrian rebels reject interim government, embrace Sharia . But the inspectors face a litany of challenges, like trying to find physical and forensic evidence from more than six months ago. Then there's the security situation. During the inspectors' last visit, mortar shells landed near their hotel in Damascus, and their convoy came under fire while en route to a scene. And just like their investigation into the August 21 attack, the inspectors will only try to determine whether chemical weapons were used during this trip, not who was responsible. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Holly Yan, Nick Thompson and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Three premises have been agreed upon for a Security Council resolution, source says .

"(CNN) -- What's in the coffee in Canada? Apparently something that's making a few folks pretty generous. At least six times this week, customers at Tim Hortons restaurants have paid for their own cups of coffee and cups of brew for the next 500 or more people in line, according to media reports. The first 500 free javas were gifts of an anonymous donor at a Tim Hortons in downtown Edmonton, Alberta, on Monday, CTV reported. A man in his 20s bought a double-double and a doughnut and told the clerk to put the next 500 large coffees on his debit card, according to the report. ""(The staff was) thinking maybe he was so blessed that he wanted to share his blessing, or maybe he won the lotto or something,"" store manager Joanne Averion told CTV. The act has been repeated five times since, in Calgary, Alberta, on Tuesday, and in Red Deer, Alberta, and Ottawa on Thursday, and two more times again in Edmonton on Thursday, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The last case is the only one where the coffee donor has taken credit. Monica Kavanaugh bought 800 cups at the Tim Hortons in Edmonton's Royal Alexandra Hospital on Thursday. ""It's a way to give back,"" Kavanaugh told the CBC. ""They've (hospital staff) helped my father a lot, and I just feel, why not give a little back to the hospital?"" Earlier Thursday, someone paid for the next 500 cups at the hospital Hortons. It's all great business for Tim Hortons, but the company says it's serendipity, not a marketing stunt. ""As brilliant as this is, I can assure that Tim Hortons has nothing to do with the Good Samaritans that have been purchasing coffees across the country,"" Tim Hortons representative Michelle Robichaud told CTV. ""We're just as surprised and thrilled as our guests have been by these incredible random acts of kindness,"" the CBC quoted Robichaud as saying. ""Our only role is really in pouring the cups of coffee.""","Six times this week, donors buy coffee for more than 500 .

"(CNN) -- To claim fans have been eagerly waiting for Dominican author Junot Diaz's next book would be an understatement. Diaz took the literary world by storm with ""The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,"" a story about the life of ""poor lovable"" ghetto nerd Oscar de Leon, narrated by Yunior, the main protagonist in Diaz's first novel, ""Drown."" The story of a chubby Dominican boy growing up in New Jersey won a Pulitzer Prize in 2008, National Book Critics Circle Award, and was named Time's No. 1 Fiction Book of 2007. Not too shabby. Now, in ""This Is How You Lose Her,"" a collection of stories released last week, Diaz brings back the character of Yunior to tell the ""important and necessary story of the inner lives of 'bad boys,' "" as the acclaimed author says. Born in Santo Domingo and raised in New Jersey, the Rutgers alum took some time out of his book tour to talk about his new book, what his family thinks of his writing and the unique voice in his work. CNN: Was it difficult to write ""This Is How You Lose her,"" considering all the attention ""Oscar Wao"" received? Diaz: I don't think it was difficult for that reason. It's one thing to write something about a poor lovable nerd who in some ways who could not find love and whose larger culture sort of rejects him and another to write about a messed-up-in-the-head cheater. And, to make that character and that story in some ways sympathetic was the greater challenge. CNN: Was ""This Is How You Lose Her"" more difficult to write than ""Oscar Wao""? Diaz: No, I wouldn't say that. With me, all books are incredibly difficult. They all come with their formidable challenges. I'm pretty much frightened of everything I write. This book just took longer. ""Oscar"" took me 11 years, this book took me 16 years. I don't think it was in any way more difficult, it just happened to take longer. CNN: What inspired you to write this book? Diaz: I think that you almost never get the inner life of men in any way that makes sense to men. Most of the books I read where we hear about men's internal life, I have to tell you, they are as far away from reality as you can imagine. These scientists always tell you that men spend every six seconds thinking about sex, but have you ever seen a book that in any way reflects sort of the larger masculine sensibilities? I think part of me thought that it was important to get at men's inner lives and, more importantly, more personally to use a Dominican, New Jersey male in the background as sort of ground zero as the central reference. CNN: What does your family think about your writing? Diaz: I'm convinced they can't really wrap their minds around it. We're an immigrant family. We're a conservative family. I'm considered something of a nut because of the brutal honesty that I bring to some my stories. I think my family finds it a little appalling at times, but you know, what can you do? You just pray that one day, they'll get around to reading it and see the value in it. Right now, I've got to tell you, it is not on the table. I can go visit my family for four or five years straight and no one will mention that I'm a writer. There's something mildly improper about it, more like something mildly disreputable about it. CNN: Is the voice in ""This Is How You Lose Her"" similar to the way you speak? Diaz: It's hard to say, because I live in so many different worlds ... the way I talk to my boys, family, work, the way I talk to my students, or the way I talk when I feel scared. The book is a highly wrought object. It's engineered. It may seem casual. It may seem conversational or vernacular, it may lead people to believe that this is my voice but if I read a page, you would begin to realize how artificial the experience is. Fiction is an artisan that convinces its reader that it's real. The voice in the book, while it may have tone and highlights directly from me, this voice is highly artificial. It doesn't really represent the way I speak. CNN: What is it that you want your readers to understand about this book? Diaz: There's not a lesson that I'm sort of asking my readers to walk away from but more of an encounter and a conversation that I'm trying to encourage. Again, I think that if one wants to teach a lesson, it's so much better to write fiction. With nonfiction, we have a totally different set of stakes. What I was most committed to was using this male Dominican experience to wrestle with, to encourage my readers to wrestle with, larger questions about masculinity, larger questions about relationships. Larger questions about intimacy. Read an excerpt from ""This Is How You Lose Her"" here. This excerpt contains profanity; reader discretion is advised.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The plan to raise what would be the world's tallest building in a dizzyingly fast time is in danger of not getting off the ground at all. According to reports in Chinese state media, Broad Group, the developers for Sky City, have so far failed to get the proper permits required to proceed with construction. The company put the first spade in the ground in the 202-story project to much fanfare on July 20. Developers hope it could be built within the year. The 838-meter construction in Changsha, the capital of China's central Hunan province, would rise ten meters higher than the world's current tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. ""Broad is still currently in the beginning stages of arranging the construction project,"" a Changsha Urban Planning Department representative told CNN. ""So far, they've undergone the process to obtain 136 mu [22 acres] of land, but that's it. They're still in the very basic beginning stages. We've been giving a lot of attention to this case, and everything they've done has been according to law."" For its part Broad Group insisted everything was above board. ""We have not yet started work on Changsha's Sky City,"" a Broad Group press officer told CNN. He added that they have evidence to show no laws have been broken. Penalties for illegal construction vary widely across China between the countryside and cities, as well as between residential and commercial use. In Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, baseline fines for illegal construction range from 5% to 10% with investigative fees as much as doubling the amount. Additional penalties for various infractions can then double the original fine, according to one official government website. In the southwest megacity of Chongqing, the fine for the illegal construction of a commercial building is 50% of the cost of construction, according to another government site. If similar penalties exist in Changsha as for Chongqing, Broad Group could be fined nearly $750 million. Sky City's total construction cost is $1.46 billion. Construction advocates have touted Sky City's green credentials: It will save on energy and land use, creating an all-in-one home, office, shopping, farming and recreation environment for some 30,000 residents that no one ever needs to leave. Critics -- including architectural experts and the Chinese public -- worry about safety because of the use of non-traditional building techniques and the pace of construction. Broad Group pioneered the use of pre-fabricated steel-and-concrete blocks -- akin to Lego blocks -- that can be quickly hoisted into place. While the Burj Khalifa took five years to build, Broad Group says this ""fast-building technology"" means it can construct Sky City in just ten months. Sky City will be completed in April 2014, said Broad Group in earlier statements. However when questioned by CNN, the company's press officer hesitated to provide a start date for construction. He added that plans will be announced at an as-yet unscheduled future press conference, leaving construction plans for Sky City firmly frozen on the ground.","Chinese state media reports Sky City does not have required permits to start construction .

"(CNN) -- Twitter co-founder Biz Stone has been using Facebook quite a bit lately, and he has some friendly advice for the company, from one social network to another. Stone thinks Facebook should offer an ad-free subscription version for $10 a month. A premium version of Facebook could appeal to people who don't want to wade through the barrage of ads for a juice-cleanse delivery service or Edward Snowden fan fiction (these are the actual ads I currently see on my Facebook account). ""In general, the ads on Facebook don't seem particularly useful or engaging. However, ads on the service are universally tolerated because that's what makes Facebook free, and free is nice,"" Stone said in a post on Medium. The company could also throw in some special features for these Premium customers to sweeten the pot, according to Stone, though he doesn't suggest anything specific. He does a bit of math to show how lucrative a paid tier could be. If just 10% of the service's 1 billion active users dropped $10 each month, the company would make $1 billion a month. For the first quarter of 2013, Facebook reported making just $2.85 per user from ads in the U.S. and Canada. That number is lower globally. Advertising makes up 85% of Facebook's revenue. The rest comes from payments and other fees, which include social games and virtual goods, and amounts to about 65 cents per user for the quarter. The subscription model is common among tech companies offering content, such as music or TV shows on Pandora, Hulu and Netflix. But it hasn't taken off with many social networks. LinkedIn offers premium accounts that have beefed-up search, mail and other features starting at $20 a month. As an April Fool's joke this year, Twitter announced a premium service that, for the low cost of $5 a month, would include all letters in tweets, including vowels. The lowly free service would be rebranded Twttr and include only consonants. Stone isn't joking with his new suggestion, though. In his post, he also said that Facebook was too complicated. ""The truth is, if I can't figure an application out in a minute, I usually move on to something else. Too many settings and options frustrate and confuse me. I like making simple stuff because I enjoy simple stuff,"" he said. He recently hired a few ex-Facebookers for his new startup, and they guided him through optimizing all the settings for the least overwhelming experience. He's now using Facebook regularly to keep in touch with family, but like any regular Facebook user, he still has gripes about how it works. This isn't the first time someone has suggested a paid, premium version of Facebook. But because he's Biz Stone and Twitter is a hugely successful social network, people are paying attention -- unlike when your distant cousins or people you knew in high school complain in Facebook's news feed.","Twitter co-founder Biz Stone suggests Facebook launch a paid version without ads .

"(CNN) -- The judge in southern West Virginia who faces federal conspiracy charges after being accused of plotting to frame his secretary's husband in various crimes has been charged in another conspiracy case, U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said Thursday. Mingo County Circuit Judge Michael Thornsbury allegedly conspired with other county elected officials to cover up evidence of alleged ""illegal drug use and other misconduct"" by late Mingo County Sheriff Eugene Crum,"" Goodwin said. A Mingo County drug defendant earlier this year began to provide the FBI with information about the misconduct, Goodwin said in a news release. Crum learned that the informant and his attorney were providing information about Crum to the FBI, the release said. As a result, Crum, Thornsbury and other Mingo elected officials ""conspired"" to protect Crum and stop the informant, who was referred to in the charging document as G.W., it said. ""They arranged to offer G.W. favorable plea deal if he would fire his attorney, who was assisting G.W.'s communication with federal authorities, and replace him with an attorney chosen by Crum and the other elected officials,"" the release said. Earlier this year, Thornsbury pleaded not guilty to federal conspiracy charges stemming from an alleged plot to falsely implicate the husband of his secretary after she broke off an affair with the judge. Thornsbury's trial date was set for October 15, and he was released on a $10,000 bond. Federal documents allege that a five-year vendetta included plotting to plant drugs under the husband's car, recruiting a state trooper to arrest the man on bogus theft charges, and persuading a police officer to arrest him on groundless assault and battery charges.","Mingo County is in southern West Virginia .

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen has emerged as the leading candidate to replace Ben Bernanke as Fed chairman, a White House official tells CNN's Athena Jones. This comes after Larry Summers, after months of contentious debate, withdrew his name from consideration to head the central bank over the weekend in a process that some say has become unusually politicized. Summers was often discussed as President Barack Obama's preferred choice for the job. He was a key economic adviser during the president's first term and is a former treasury secretary. There was no information on Wednesday about when a final decision on a nomination would be made. Bernanke's term ends in January and Obama plans to select a successor this fall. If nominated and confirmed by the Senate, Yellen would become the first woman to hold the job. She has the support of a number of Democrats on Capitol Hill as well as many fellow economists.","Janet Yellen, the No 2 Fed official, would succeed Ben Bernanke if nominated and confirmed .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York City police officer and his brother are accused of illegally selling high-powered weapons and using their law enforcement credentials to smuggle guns overseas, the U.S. attorney's office said. Rex Maralit, 44, an NYPD officer, and his brother, Wilfredo Maralit, 48, a Border Protection officer in Los Angeles, bought high-powered assault rifles, sniper rifles and pistols and then sent them to customers in the Philippines, the U.S. attorney's office said. The brothers were arrested Thursday. A third brother in the Philippines, Ariel Maralit, 43, took specific orders from customers, authorities said. Between 2009 and March 2013, the brothers in America would special-order the desired firearms and send them internationally in disguised shipments, according to a complaint from the U.S. attorney's office. Firearms dealing is regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and requires gun dealers to first obtain a license. The Arms Export Control Act requires exporters of firearms to obtain approval and requires licenses for the export of military-style weapons such as the brothers allegedly sent. ""As alleged, rather than upholding and enforcing the law as they had sworn to do, these defendants made international gunrunning a family business,"" U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a news release. ""The brothers used their knowledge of the law to circumvent it, and sent dangerous weapons overseas without regard for the ultimate destination or targets."" Both brothers are expected to appear in court Friday.","NYPD officer and his brother, a Border Protection officer in Los Angeles, are arrested .

"(CNN) -- Poor, poor celebrities. It's probably overwhelming to be famous and on Facebook. The volume of posts, comments, likes and mentions on any given day is vastly higher for well-known people than it is for mere mortals. Getting a grasp on the quick-moving chatter and knowing when to speak up takes effort. Facebook is working on a new mobile tool that would make it easier for the VIPs to slog through the noise and better communicate with their fans, according to a report from AllThingsD. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed in an e-mailed statement that the company is working on ""mobile features designed to help public figures interact with their fans"" and said it was only testing them with a select group of people for now. It's not clear how the feature makes it easier for the super-popular to sift through mentions from followers, or what was so difficult about doing it from the current mobile apps. It's likely the feature will be useful to social media professionals more than actual celebrities. The more important the person, the smaller the chance that they are checking their own Facebook page to see what their friends are up to and post selfies. It's common for a social media manager to use the social network on an actor or musician's behalf to post information about public appearances, carefully chosen snapshots and other updates. The helpers aren't just there to save famous people time. Celebrities are lucrative brands that often depend on a carefully crafted and controlled public image. Facebook wants to be a place where they can manage that image. Twitter has dominated as a platform where the famous can broadcast their latest news and have some casual back and forth with fans. Some high profile people do use the site to communicate all on their own, as evidenced by the many entertaining late night ramblings and Twitter fights. Facebook has tried other Twitter-inspired features over the past year, including rolling out hashtags and offering verified pages to separate the impostors from the real public figures. The company is not shy about taking features that have been successful on other platforms and adding them to its own. If Facebook can take over as a place where the famous go first to make an important announcement, or even a denial, it could ratchet up the company's reputation as a go-to news source. The association would also lend some additional ""cool"" to the site, which is edging into its older age (for a social network) and concerned about staying youthful and relevant. But some folks online were complaining about the perceived elitist nature of special treatment for big shots. ""Dear Facebook: Put away the red carpet for celebs, we're happy with just friends,"" wrote Twitter user Tom Flowers.","Facebook is testing out a mobile feature for VIPs only according to AllThingsD .
The tool would make it easier for the famous to talk to fans through the social network .

"Washington (CNN) -- When President Barack Obama took the podium on Tuesday night, he followed in the footsteps of generations of presidents before him: speaking to the American people about a critical issue facing the United States. But he didn't follow literally in those footsteps: Unlike many presidents before him, he spoke from the East Room -- not the traditional setting of the Oval Office. From President Ronald Reagan announcing the invasion of Grenada to President H.W. Bush announcing the beginning of the Gulf War to President George W. Bush announcing the invasion of Iraq, presidents have chosen to use the visual power of the ""Oval."" Obama, though, has used that iconic setting for prime-time speeches only twice during his presidency, both within months of each other. In June 2010, the president sat behind the Resolute desk and updated the nation on ""the battle we're waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens,"" after the Deepwater Horizon exploded off the coast of Louisiana. In August of that year, Obama made a point to reference the setting of his speech announcing the end of the combat mission in Iraq. ""From this desk, seven-and-a-half years ago, President Bush announced the beginning of military operations in Iraq. Much has changed since that night,"" Obama said. When it was time for Obama to make his major military announcement -- the May 2011 death of Osama bin Laden -- he chose to walk down the long White House hallway to his East Room podium, the same setting he used for his Syria speech. Obama is not the first president, though, to break with tradition of either the location or timing in making major pronouncements. President Bill Clinton's first comments on his missile strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998 came from an ad-hoc press room set up in a Martha's Vineyard school where he was on vacation. He would make a second, more formal announcement later that day from the Oval Office. President H.W. Bush regularly used the Oval Office, and he made perhaps the earliest-ever speech in December 1989: A 7:20 a.m. nationwide address to announce military action in Panama.","Obama's speech Tuesday night was in the tradition of other U.S. presidents .

Though investigators haven't determined the cause, Kester suspects it to be another incident of arson. ""I think this act of hate will bring us together,"" she told CNN iReport. The FBI is already investigating a fire that scorched the roof of the building on July 4 and has offered a $15,000 reward in conjunction with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The bureau has released surveillance video and a photograph of a man caught on surveillance cameras throwing some sort of incendiary device onto the building in that incident. Federal agents have begun an investigation into the new blaze, ""and we are basically waiting for a determination to be made on the cause,"" FBI spokeswoman Bridget Patton told CNN. ""If it is determined that the fire was deliberately set or intentionally set, then we will investigate it to the full extent possible,"" Patton said. The attack took place during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ends August 18. Kester said the mosque was a target of other acts of vandalism. In September of 2008, a sign at the mosque was set on fire and was also determined to be arson, according to CNN affiliate KODE. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for increased police protection at other places of worship in the wake of the fire and is offering a $10,000 reward for information on the latest incident. The city of Joplin was the site of a monster tornado that ripped through the area in 2011. At least 161 people were killed and miles of businesses, homes and schools were destroyed. Kester said she is confident the community resolve shown after that devastating storm will again be present as the mosque and its members look to rebuild. ""Joplin survived such a devastating storm and we came together. We can all come together and build a great community once again,"" Kester said. The mosque's burning comes as an Islamic center in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, prepares to open for the first time after years of legal wrangling, vandalism and anti-Muslim sentiment. The controversy erupted in 2010, when planning commissioners approved an expansion project at the existing mosque. The construction site has been vandalized several times, including an arson attack in 2010 and ""not welcome"" spray-painted on a sign announcing the project. Federal authorities have charged a Texas man with calling in a bomb threat to the center before last year's anniversary of the September 11 attacks. The Islamic Center of Murfreesboro is awaiting its certificate of occupancy -- the final step needed to open.

"(CNN) -- A fire station in a historic area of Philadelphia caught on fire Friday morning, said Battalion Chief Michael Richey. Around 11:30 a.m. on Friday, calls came in to report a fire at the ""Benjamin Franklin Firehouse"" on the corner of Arch and Fouth streets in historic Old City Philadelphia. The firehouse sits on a block between the Betsy Ross house and Benjamin Franklin's tomb, Richey said. No injuries were reported and great efforts were made to ensure that no historical landmarks were damaged by the fire, Richey said. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but it is believed to have originated in a medic unit on the ground level of the firehouse, Richey said. ""There was significant damage to the firehouse and the apparatus floor area, and the medic unit looks like the engine area is completely lost,"" said Richey, who said the blaze was put out in nine minutes. Forty firefighters and eight fire trucks responded to the scene, including the engine's own firefighters, who were out on a training mission when the fire started, Richey said. Efforts to repair the damaged firehouse are already underway, but it is unknown when the fire station will reopen, Richey said. Although the firehouse is in a historical area, the firehouse itself is not considered a historical landmark, and was built in the 1970s, according to Richey.","""Benjamin Franklin Firehouse"" catches fire in historic neighborhood .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Osama bin Laden typically wore a cowboy hat while tending his garden. Its broad brim obscured his features from the view of pesky eyes or satellite cameras that might blow his cover while he was hiding out in Pakistan, according to a report first published widely in Pakistani media. The 337-page leaked report details the domestic life of one of the world's most wanted men in his final days of life. Bergen: bin Laden's life on the run . It also bashes Pakistani authorities for failing to keep the al Qaeda leader out of the country, and for failing to prevent the U.S. raid by Navy SEALs that killed him in May 2011. The report bears the names of a former top diplomat, a supreme court justice and former officers of the military and police. A senior government official who was closely associated with the commission that produced the report confirmed its authenticity to CNN. Citing a news piece by Al Jazeera, the first to report the story, the official said the documents being discussed in the news are part of a report that was submitted to the prime minister's office. Bin Laden's death: How the story unfolded . Veggie growing contest . The famous terrorist's life was speckled with quirky measures designed to keep him under the radar, the report said. Al Qaeda's No. 1 spent lots of time doting on his some dozen children and grandchildren in the six years he spent in his walled compound in the city of Abbottabad, said terror expert Peter Bergen, commenting on the report. They could not pass time watching TV or surfing online, because bin Laden had no Internet connection and no satellite television hook-up. He also didn't have a phone line, all measures to avoid detection. For the same reason, the children were not allowed to play with other kids in the neighborhood. They spent the bulk of their lives within the compound's walls. When bin Laden was not personally giving them religious instruction, he took them out into the yard. He would award them prizes if they grew particularly good vegetables in the garden. Opinion: From bin Laden to Boston . Faking deafness . Bin Laden fled to Pakistan a month after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, moving from the south to the north and then hopping from town to town before landing in Abbottabad in 2005. While he was on the run, one of his wives gave birth four times and had to be taken to local hospitals, but it was obvious that she was not from the region. She spoke Arabic instead of Urdu, Pakistan's official language. Bin Laden's family feared this might raise suspicions. So, they told doctors she was deaf and mute. While on the run in the restive tribal region of the Swat Valley, bin Laden shaved off his recognizable beard, according to the report. Men helping him told others not to ask any questions about the tall stranger, who spoke Arabic. While in Swat, police once pulled bin Laden's driver over, but he quickly settled the matter before the officer had a chance to get a closer look at the clean-shaven man riding with him. After arriving in Abbottabad, a woman living in the same building with bin Laden recognized him from his image shown on cable TV. Her husband, who was helping bin Laden, went into a panic, the report said. He told her to mind her own business and forbade her and all other women in the house from watching TV anymore. Opinion: Who really killed bin Laden? The assassination raid . The measures kept bin Laden from being recognized for years in a city also home to one of Pakistan's largest military complexes. The CIA eventually suspected he was there and recruited a Pakistani doctor to run a vaccination program in Abbottabad in an attempt to find bin Laden by locating his children through their DNA. Eventually the United States did find the al Qaeda leader and assassinated him during a special forces raid on his compound. He was later buried at sea, the U.S. military said. Although the SEALs were within Pakistan's borders for three hours, its military did not detect them. ""The radar systems were not looking for that kind of intrusion from the Afghan side of the border,"" terror expert Peter Bergen said. He feels sure that will change now. The report also dedicated 22 pages to fighting terrorism and keeping people like bin Laden from taking refuge in the country again. The report's authors blast Pakistani authorities at every level of government, intelligence and the military for not stopping the U.S. mission, calling it ""a story of complacency, ignorance, negligence, incompetence, irresponsibility, and possibly worse at various levels inside and outside the government."" Pakistan's government considers the assassination operation a violation of its sovereignty, basically an act of war. No public release of bin Laden death photos .

"(CNN) -- A massive rocket carrying a new U.S. spy satellite lifted off from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base Wednesday. Details about the satellite, designated NROL-65, are classified. But the three-booster Delta-IV rocket used to send it aloft Wednesday is the heaviest in the U.S. inventory, capable of putting a 25-ton payload into low Earth orbit. It's one of two launches the top-secret National Reconnaissance Office has on the books for late 2013, NRO Director Betty Sapp told a congressional committee in April. The payload in Wednesday's launch is thought to be ""a $1-billion high-powered spy satellite capable of snapping pictures detailed enough to distinguish the make and model of an automobile hundreds of miles below,"" the Los Angeles Times reported. The 232-foot-tall booster was developed by the U.S. Air Force and the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin. NROL-65 is the second launch from Vandenberg of the Delta IV Heavy. The first was in January 2011.","NEW: The new National Reconnaissance Office satellite was launched Wednesday .

"Washington (CNN) -- Under cover of darkness, two people wearing dark clothing and ski masks enter a fire truck while its crew is busy with a rescue. They grab keys to secure areas of Washington's subway system and flee. And it all happens just blocks from the Pentagon. In a jittery post-9/11 world, it's small wonder the incident has raised concerns. But Washington Metro officials and authorities in Arlington County, Virginia, attempted to tamp down fears the September 19 theft is terror related. They said the suspects stole numerous items from the truck, and likely did not target the keys. Moreover, the officials said they quickly took unspecified steps to secure the region's transit system. The incident occurred just across an interstate from the Pentagon between 4 a.m. and 4:30 a.m., while the crew tended to a patient. An on-board video-camera captured images of the thieves as they either approached or departed the truck, Arlington Police Department spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said. Both Sternbeck and Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said numerous items were lifted, including the Metro keys. Both declined to say how many keys were taken, or what the keys opened. The fire crew reported the theft promptly, Sternbeck said, and canine dogs were sent to the scene. Sternbeck said police have not released the video of the suspects, but might if detectives feel it would help the investigation.","Two thieves in masks strike while fire crew tends to rescue near Pentagon .

"(CNN) -- Fresh reports of global espionage. Furious European officials. A plea from the vice president. The weekend was packed with twists and turns in the case of former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and the secret documents he's leaked. Snowden, who faces espionage charges in the United States, is still in Russia and seeking asylum from Ecuador. Here are some key recent developments that CNN is reporting: . New allegations about U.S. spying . Germany's Der Spiegel and Britain's The Guardian have published stories with new claims about U.S. surveillance, citing NSA documents leaked to them by Snowden. The reports, which CNN has not independently confirmed, include allegations that: . â€¢ In Brussels, Belgium, the agency targeted the Justus Lipsius Building, which houses the European Council and the EU Council of Ministers, the union's main decision-making and legislative body. â€¢ In Washington, Der Spiegel claims, the NSA installed bugs in the European Union's building and infiltrated its computer network. â€¢ One NSA document leaked by Snowden describes 38 embassies and missions as ""targets,"" and it details surveillance methods that include planting bugs in communications equipment and collecting transmissions with specialized antennae. Targets included France, Italy, Greece, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, India and Turkey, according to The Guardian. Outraged European officials ask U.S. for answers . European officials reacted with fury to the reports that the NSA spied on EU offices. ""I am deeply worried and shocked about the allegations,"" European Parliament President Martin Schulz said in a statement. ""If the allegations prove to be true, it would be an extremely serious matter which will have a severe impact on EU-U.S. relations."" German officials have said the claims, if true, are reminiscent of the Cold War. French President Francois Hollande said any U.S. surveillance targeting officials from his country must stop immediately. U.S. officials have said they'll address the concerns through diplomatic channels. They haven't spoken publicly about the specific allegations published by Der Spiegel and The Guardian. Schumer and McCain: Russia should pay a price for harboring Snowden . Two high-profile senators on Sunday admonished Russia for not handing over Snowden, who's hiding in Russia as he seeks asylum in Ecuador. Republican Sen. John McCain said Snowden's actions amounted to a ""slap in the face to the United States"" and called President Vladimir Putin ""an old colonel KGB apparatchik"" who ""dreams of the restoration of the Russian Empire."" Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer said Sunday he's not sure what should be done to get Snowden back, but Russia should ""pay a price"" for ""doing what they did."" ""(Putin) ought to know he is going to pay a price here because he goes out of his way to stick his finger in the eye of America, whether it is Iran, Syria, and now this,"" he said on the same Fox program. ""He has got lots of vulnerabilities."" Biden to Ecuador: Don't give him asylum . Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa says he got a phone call from U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Friday. Biden asked him ""to please reject"" Snowden's asylum bid, Correa said. The Ecuadorian leader said his country would be cautious about processing Snowden's asylum request. ""We have to act very carefully but with courage,"" he said, ""without contradicting our principles but with a lot of care, responsibility and respect, of course, towards the U.S. -- but also respect for the truth."" On Saturday night, Correa said the ball was in Russia's court. ""In order to process this request, he needs to be in Ecuadorian territory,"" Correa said in an interview with Ecuador's Oromar TV on Saturday night. ""At this point, the solution for Snowden's final destination is in the hands of the Russian authorities."" Bush slams Snowden, defends NSA surveillance . Former U.S. President George W. Bush sharply criticized Snowden. ""I think he damaged the security of the country,"" he said in an exclusive interview with CNN over the weekend. Asked about an NSA program that tracks people's Internet activity, Bush said, ""I put that program in place to protect the country. One of the certainties was that civil liberties were guaranteed."" Filmmakers release the first Snowden movie . A group of amateur filmmakers in Hong Kong has already filmed a short thriller dramatizing the events that unfolded in the city last month. The five-minute film was shot over four days, said freelance videographer Edwin Lee, describing it as a ""foot-on-the-gas"" guerrilla operation. The script was mostly written the day before shooting, and actors had no rehearsal time, he added. In its first week, the film has garnered more than 60,000 views on YouTube. The movie ends with the former NSA contractor's June 23 flight to Moscow. But the world is still waiting for the next chapter in Snowden's story. CNN's Josh Levs, Claudia Rebaza, Michael Martinez, Jethro Mullen and Alexis Lai contributed to this report.","Citing leaked NSA documents, European publications publish fresh allegations of U.S. spying .

"(CNN) -- Tests done on 12-year-old Zachary Reyna show no signs of activity from the brain-eating parasite he contracted earlier this month, according to his father. Doctors had given Zachary the same experimental anti-amoeba drug used to treat 12-year-old Kali Hardig recently in Arkansas, the Reyna family told CNN affiliate WBBH. The Arkansas girl is only the third person in the last 50 years to survive this deadly parasite. Extensive damage has been done to Zachary's brain, his father wrote Wednesday on a Facebook page dedicated to the Little League baseball player. Right now the family is looking for signs that his brain is still active. ""This is a small victory but we know the battle is not over,"" he wrote. ""I feel like Zac was in a slump. ... All ball players go through them. We all do. As his Dad and Coach I do all I can to help him get out of it by giving him extra training and making adjustments to his swing. We all go through tough times and we need to find God and prayer to get through theses slumps of life."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it will make the experimental drug that helped fight Zachary's amoeba available to physicians who consult it. The drug was originally created for breast cancer treatment, but has since been found effective against free-living amoeba infections. Zachary's family told CNN affiliate WBBH-TV that the boy was kneeboarding with friends in a water-filled ditch by his house in LaBelle, Florida, on August 3. He slept the entire next day. Zachary is an active seventh-grader, his family said, so sleeping that much was unusual. His mother took him to the hospital immediately. He had brain surgery, and doctors diagnosed him with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, according to WBBH. The family said he is currently in the intensive care unit at the Miami Children's Hospital. After hearing of Zachary's case, the Florida Department of Health issued a warning for swimmers. High water temperatures and low water levels provide the perfect breeding ground for this rare amoeba, called Naegleria fowleri, officials said. They warned the public to be wary when swimming, jumping or diving in freshwater with these conditions. Kali Hardig was infected with the same parasite last month and was at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock. The cases are nearly always deadly, but Kali's condition is giving the Reyna family some hope. ""We continue to be amazed by Kali's progress,"" her family said in a statement last week. ""Today she's able to sit up on her own, write some words on a white board and stand with assistance for very brief stretches. She's even able to throw and catch a ball with her therapists. We are grateful for the continued prayers from Kali's supporters, which no doubt drive her recovery."" Her attending physician, Dr. Vikki Stefans at Arkansas Children's Hospital's Progressive Rehab Unit, said in a statement: ""Kali's progress is definitely a credit to her wonderful family and support system. There is no longer a question of whether she'll survive and do well, but just how well."" Zachary's family is hoping he becomes survivor No. 4. ""He's strong,"" his brother, Brandon Villarreal, told WBBH. ""He's really, really strong."" Getting Naegleria fowleri is extremely rare; between 2001 and 2010, there were only 32 reported cases in the United States, according to the CDC. Most of the cases have been in the Southeast. Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm freshwater, most often in the Southeastern United States. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. There is no danger of infection from drinking contaminated water, the CDC said. ""This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of,"" Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC-TV about Kali's case. ""Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die."" Why 'nightmare bacteria' on the rise . Dr. Sanjiv Pasala, one of Kali's attending physicians, said doctors immediately started treating the girl with the experimental anti-amoeba drug they received directly from the CDC. They also reduced the girl's feverish body temperature to 93 degrees. Doctors have used that technique in some brain injury cases as a way to preserve undamaged brain tissue. Several weeks ago, doctors checked the girl's cerebral spinal fluid and could not find any presence of the amoeba. Willow Springs Water Park in Little Rock is the most likely source of Kali's infection, the Arkansas Department of Health said. Another case of the same parasite was reported in 2010 and was possibly linked to Willow Springs, a three-acre sand-bottom, spring-fed lake. ""Based on the occurrence of two cases of this rare infection in association with the same body of water and the unique features of the park, the ADH has asked the owner of Willow Springs to voluntarily close the water park to ensure the health and safety of the public,"" the health department said. Willow Springs' website says its water is pH-balanced, chemically treated, chlorinated and routinely monitored by the health department. What's in your pool water? The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. ""Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,"" the agency website says. ""After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days."" Here are some tips from the CDC to help lower the risk of infection: . • Avoid swimming in freshwater when the water temperature is high and the water level is low. • Hold your nose shut or use nose clips. • Avoid stirring up the sediment while wading in shallow, warm freshwater areas. • If you are irrigating, flushing or rinsing your sinuses (for example, by using a neti pot), use water that has been distilled or sterilized.

"(CNN) -- Atletico Madrid recorded their first victory in the league over Real Madrid this century with a 1-0 victory at the Bernabeu on Saturday. A first half strike by Brazilian striker Diego Costa maintained Atletico's 100% start to the La Liga season and secured a first league win against Real, home or away, since the 1999/2000 season. The game's only goal came in the 11th minute when Costa gathered in Koke's inch-perfect through ball before executing a crisp side-foot finish past keeper Diego Lopez. Real had their chances to equalize -- Karim Benzema going close with headers in the 23rd and 26th minute -- but Atletico's defense held firm as the first half came to a close. Luka Modric and world-record signing Gareth Bale -- making his Bernabeu debut -- expanded the home side's attacking options when they were introduced at the start of the second half but it was Atletico who remained in the ascendency as the game wore on. Costa should have doubled Atletico's lead in the 60th minute but scuffed his shot after being sent through one-on-one with goalkeeper Lopez before Real cleared their lines. Read more: Messi testifies in tax trial . Sixty seconds later, Gareth Bale was brought down by Felipe on the edge of the Atletico penalty area only for Ronaldo to balloon the resulting free kick miles over the crossbar. Koke came the closest of anyone to scoring in the 81st minute, hitting the woodwork with a glorious looping left-foot before Real pushed for an equalizer in the dying minutes of the game. Their efforts came to nothing and defeat -- their first in the league this season -- leaves them on 16 points, five points adrift of Atletico and Barcelona. The reigning champions also made it seven wins out of seven in La Liga on Saturday with a 2-0 triumph over lowly Almeria but the victory was overshadowed by an injury to Lionel Messi. The Argentine was substituted midway through the first half after hurting his thigh and now is a doubt for Tuesday's Champions League tie against Scottish champions Celtic. Despite leaving the game so early, Messi still found time to influence the match scoring his eighth league goal of the season in the 20th minute. A neat exchange of passes with Alexis Sanchez was finished with a sweetly struck left-foot shot. Adriano made it 2-0 in the 56th minute as Barcelona cruised to a comfortable victory. Elsewhere, Valencia's 1-0 win over Rayo Vallecano lifts them to sixth in the league while Real Sociedad and Sevilla played out a 1-1 draw. There were two matches in Serie A on Saturday with Napoli going top for 24 hours at least after a 2-0 away win at Genoa. Two first-half strikes from Goran Pandev earned Rafa Benitez's men a comfortable win ahead of what promises to be a fascinating Champions League tie against Arsenal on Tuesday. Read more: Chelsea draw, United lose, Arsenal go top . AC Milan recorded their second league win of the season with a 1-0 win against Sampdoria at the San Siro on Saturday evening. Slovenia's Valter Birsa scored the game's only goal in the 46th minute to lift the Rossoneri to eighth in the table. Sampdoria stay in 18th place. Roma can return to the top if they beat Bologna in Sunday's evening kick-off. Inter Milan will also leapfrog Napoli if they record any sort of win at Cagliari. Meanwhile in France, Paris Saint-Germain continued their unbeaten start to the season with a 2-0 victory over Toulouse on Saturday. Brazilian teenager Marquinhos opened the scoring for the French champions in the 41st minute before Edinson Cavani made sure of the three points scoring from the penalty spot in the 79th minute. The win sees PSG, who entertain Benfica in the Champions League on Wednesday, move one point ahead of Monaco who face Reims on Sunday evening. Marseilles are currently third, level on 17 points with Monaco after a 2-0 win at Lorient.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- They had gambled with their lives to journey from as far as Iraq and Lebanon in search of a better life. But for 22 people the wager ended in death off the coast of Indonesia, after their vessel capsized, a government spokesman said Saturday. Many children lay among the lifeless bodies authorities pulled from the seas of the coast off West Java. But 28 others emerged alive from the waters and received treatment for minor injuries at a hospital in Cianjur, said Martinus Sitompol, an Indonesian government spokesman. Rescuers continue to search for 30 more people believed to be on the boat, when it overturned. Their fate is yet uncertain. Many of them likely lie buried far beneath the waves. Sitompol could only wager a guess why the boat capsized. He said some on the boat were from Iraq and Lebanon. ""It's possible they ran out of fuel,"" he surmised. ""It's possible that they didn't know how to man or steer the boat."" There are many ways for overfilled, unseaworthy crafts off the coast of Indonesia to spill the people they were carrying into the ocean. It happens many times a year. The Australian media said the vessel was headed for Australia's Christmas Island, a common landing point for such boats. For some, Australia is the land of their hopes, but the government there has had its fill of capsizing, broken down refuge boats and enacted legislation this year to dash them. It is now forbidden for illegal immigrants arriving by boat to ever live on Australian soil. This mishap precedes a visit by new Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to Indonesia. Such dangerous boats carrying asylum seekers from Indonesia to Australian shores have long been a sore spot with its government.","Many children lay among the lifeless bodies authorities pulled from the seas .

"(CNN) -- A Philadelphia priest who narrowly escaped prosecution during a recent clergy abuse scandal that rocked the city's archdiocese has been arrested on charges that include raping an altar boy. In a grand jury presentation in 2005, the Philadelphia District Attorney's office revealed allegations against Father Robert Brennan, now 75, that included more than 20 alleged child sex abuse victims, according to Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams. All of the cases were beyond the statute of limitations, and Brennan was never charged in that case, Williams said at a press conference Thursday. That investigation led to the June 2012 child endangerment conviction of Monsignor William Lynn, the vicar of clergy for the diocese. The conviction marked the first time a U.S. church leader has been convicted of such a crime. Police: Pennsylvania priest caught with pantless 15-year-old . Williams said that Lynn would've faced additional charges in connection with this case but that he avoided prosecution by three months due to the statute of limitations. In this new case, Brennan is charged with rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, and aggravated indecent assault in connection with alleged incidents that took place between 1998 and 2001 when the victim was 11 to 14 years old, according to Williams. The allegations include digital penetration and oral sex. He was arrested on September 25 in Maryland, according to a statement released by Williams' office. ""A serial abuser is now behind bars thanks to the brave actions of this young man,"" Williams said, adding that the young man was prompted to report the alleged abuse in the wake of Lynn's conviction. Marci Hamilton represents the victim, now 26 years old, and two other alleged victims whose cases could not be prosecuted because they were beyond the statute of limitations. The archdiocese stripped Brennan of most of his duties in September 2005, though he remained a priest. The diocese said in a statement that Brennan's laicization is in progress with the Holy See, but did not provide a date when that process began or when Brennan would be formally defrocked. The diocese says it has ""cooperated fully"" with the current investigation. Williams commended the diocese for promptly reporting these most recent allegations. According to a statement released by Williams' office, the victim reported the abuse to the diocese in January 2013 and it was immediately brought to the attention of authorities. ""It takes tremendous courage for any sexual assault victim to come forward and report the horrors he or she endured,"" the district attorney said. Ex-pope breaks silence, denies cover-up .

"(CNN) -- Kepler-22b is the first confirmed planet in the ""habitable zone,"" the area around a star where a planet could exist with liquid water on its surface, that has been discovered by NASA's Kepler mission. The planet's radius is about 2.4 times that of the Earth. It is located about 600 light years away. Its orbital period is shorter than that of the Earth: a ""year"" on Kepler-22b is 290 days instead of 365. There were two other planets confirmed this year by other projects in the habitable zone, but their stars are much cooler than our Sun, and their orbits are more like that of Venus or Mars, scientists say. Kepler-22b is 15% closer to its star and we are to the Sun. But since Kepler-22b's star is dimmer, lower in temperature and smaller than our Sun, researchers' modeling suggests it is a similar temperature to the Earth, said Bill Borucki, Kepler principal investigator at NASA's Ames Research Center. ""If the greenhouse warming were similar on this planet and had a surface, its surface temperature would be something like 72 Fahrenheit, a very pleasant temperature here on Earth."" The warmer a planet, the more evaporation of water there would be, Borucki said. A planet can't have a surface temperature that's very hot without losing all of the surface water. The Kepler mission reported in February that it had found 54 planet candidates in the habitable zone; Kepler-22b is the first of these to be confirmed, and those results will be published in The Astrophysical Journal. There are still 48 potential planets from that batch. Researchers find planets by examining the brightness of stars as a function of time; brightness drops when a potential planet crosses the star. Three transits are required for a planet confirmation. The period of the transit of Kepler 22-b was 7.4 hours. It did not appear to give off its own light, indicating it is a planet and not a star. Scientists do not yet have a measurement of the mass of Kepler 22-b, which would tell them more about the composition of the planet. This summer, when the planet's star will be high in the sky, ground-based telescopes can attempt to get its mass. Opinion: Why we need Hubble successor . The planet is even more mysterious because its radius is between that of Earth and Uranus and Neptune, both of which have radii about four times the size of Earth's. So we don't know what a planet in this size range typically looks like. ""We have no planet like this in our solar system,"" he said. Is life restricted to Earth, or could it exist somewhere like Kepler 22-b? It may be that the characteristics of Earth, with its particular position in the solar system, particular magnetic field strength and presence of larger planets like Jupiter make Earth very rare in having life (this is called the ""Rare Earth Hypothesis."") But it's also possible that life in the universe is common, and we're only one example. ""As soon as we find an independent example of life somewhere else, we'll know it's ubiquitous throughout the universe. We're all looking for No. 2,"" said Jill Tarter of the SETI Institute. The Kepler mission has now identified a total of 2,326 planet candidates. You can read more about the Kepler discoveries at the mission website.","Kepler-22b is the first confirmed planet in the ""habitable zone"" where liquid water can exist .

"(CNN) -- Chicago police have arrested a fifth suspect in connection with a shooting that injured 13, including a 3-year-old child, earlier this month. David Logan, 22, faces charges of unlawful use of a weapon and obstructing justice, police said Saturday. The arrest happened on Wednesday. Bullets from an assault rifle and another gun wounded the 13. Two of the victims were 15 years old. Deonta Howard, a toddler, was the youngest hit. Luckily, all survived. Authorities think the violence may have been gang-related. Before Logan's arrest, four others had been arrested in connection with the shooting. Police said two of the suspects -- Tabari Young, 22, and Bryon Champ, 21 -- fired shots onto a full basketball court. Champ is a documented gang member, according to authorities. Those four have been charged with attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm, police said. Young is accused of firing the assault-style rifle. Police say Champ also fired a gun of some kind. A third suspect, Kewane Gatewood, 20, is accused of supplying the assault weapon, and Brad Jett, 22, was allegedly the lookout during the shooting, police said.

"(CNN) -- I'm going to be honest: I didn't expect to get excited over the new iPhone 5S. In fact, just last summer I wrote about how I had fallen out of love with my iPhone. I spoke of the thrill being gone. And even though I knew it wasn't the fault of the iPhone, but iDean, it didn't make it any better. I was clearly taking my iPhone for granted. In fact, I found myself checking out other phones -- sneaking a glimpse at my best friend's Samsung Galaxy. I even would Google images of the new BlackBerry when I was home alone. But the new iPhone 5S has changed all that. I dare say it's making me fall back in love with the iPhone. And it appears I'm not alone; a record 9 million-plus new iPhones were sold on the first weekend they were available. Another view: Why I'll never ditch my BlackBerry . Look, how could anyone resist the new iPhone 5S? It's the gold standard for smartphones -- and in fact it comes in gold. That color phone is for sale on Ebay for $1,500, slightly higher than an actual ounce of gold. The new iPhone may look the same as the old one on the outside, but just like the guys from ""Duck Dynasty"" have taught us, just because things look the same, it doesn't mean they are. The new iPhone boasts a faster processor, an updated camera and even a Touch ID fingerprint system for better security. While I don't have the new iPhone yet, its rollout has made me appreciate my older iPhone and the great times we had together. Like when it helped me find my way with its ""maps app"" when my older GPS had lost satellite reception because it was ""too cloudy."" Or when an iPhone app became a white noise machine helping me sleep me on a long plane flight. And, of course, I can't thank my iPhone enough for all the hours it spent with me in the bathroom as a replacement for reading a newspaper. In fact, the iPhone 5S is making me forget about all the arguments I had with Siri. And when I say ""arguments,"" I mean me yelling at my iPhone because Siri kept nagging me with comments like: ""Sorry, Dean, I don't understand what you're asking."" BlackBerry: Why breaking up is hard to do . Is the BlackBerry better than the iPhone? It's like comparing ""Honey Boo Boo"" with HBO's ""Newsroom."" Sure, ""Honey Boo Boo"" may be popular, but watching it will make you dumber. The iPhone has been a big part of my life for more than six years. And during that time we have shared so many great moments, which are all conveniently stored as photos in my iPhone. So keep your BlackBerrys, Androids and Galaxys. I'm an iPhone man and will likely be one for years to come, and not just because of the $350 early termination fee. I may not be perfect, but iDean appreciate loyalty and I appreciate the inner and outer beauty of my iPhone.

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Dubai has grown rapidly from a small trading hub into a thriving city, and one of the key players in this transformation is a company called Tatweer -- which in Arabic means ""to develop."" Executive Chairman, Saeed al Muntafiq has been there from the start and played a huge part in the expansion and diversification of the tiny Emirate. Inflation is not the biggest threat to growth in Dubai, says Saeed al Muntafiq . Al Muntafiq talks to MME's John Defterios about the changes he has witnessed, and what he sees for the Emirate's future. Defterios kicks off by asking Al Muntafiq if he thinks Dubai's rapid growth has created an economic bubble and whether inflation is the biggest threat to growth. (SM): I wouldn't say it's the biggest threat. I would say there are many challenges that we face and have faced in the past, and will continue to face. And one of which is inflation, and we have programs to sustain it, and insure that it contributes to development. The other is the attraction of talent. Ensuring that we understand how the world works, and how we can integrate Dubai in this system is another challenge. (JD): Are you interested in moderating growth here because of the potential bubble? (SM): I've personally heard of these reports from many, many organizations over the last five to seven years. In order to understand them, I think one needs to break down the statement and this asset real estate bubble that is referred to. We need to look at the industry. And the industry for us is broken down into three to four different folds, ranging from residential, all the way to hotels, and hospitality assets. Now, if these were standing on their own, I think there would be merit to the hypothesis. But they are not, because in Dubai they are all clustered around strategies. So, personally speaking, I don't believe there is a fear of that bubble, because it's managed around certain variables, certain clusters, and we keep our eyes on it. (JD): What do you accept as a reasonable inflation rate with growth running at 10 or 11 percent for the last six years? What is acceptable from the Tatweer perspective? (SM): Anything between four and five percent is acceptable. (JD): And you're running at nine right now. So do you need to bring it down? (SM): Well, it depends which figures you look at, and which industries you examine. And our industries, as I said, are predominately driven by the clusters that we are mandated to develop and grow, and those range from hospitality, all the way to entertainment and leisure. I think, as far as inflation is concerned, we need to go skin deep, because there is a whole basket of products that contribute to that item. It is not just real estate - the price of milk is one item in a basket that contributes to the information number. (JD): There are strains throughout the region right now related to food security. Does that concern you? (SM): These are challenges and fears we have faced, and have overcome over the last 50 years. We've been doing this for the last 20 to 22 years. I'm not saying we have answers for everything. That would not be prudent. I'm saying we are a proactive government. We are a government that recognizes its faults as in when they happen. But we are not egotistic and unable to say 'okay, let's find a solution.' (JD): You are one of the key players here, and you have a number for projects that you've noted under management right now. I understand you threw away a lot of the feasibility studies that were handed to you. You didn't think they were grand enough. Is that true? That you just said look - this is just way to conservative for my tastes right now? (SM): That wasn't me. That was my boss I'm afraid. (JD): You're referring to Sheikh Mohammed? (SM): Yes. His Highness. At least with two of the clusters that we drive, which are healthcare and entertainment, specifically in Dubailand. Rest assured all have feasibility studies. My job as a manager is to ensure that all of those yield an acceptable return to the stakeholder.

"(CNN) -- Interpol said Thursday it issued a ""red notice"" for Samantha Lewthwaite, the so-called ""White Widow,"" at the request of Kenyan authorities, but the international police agency added that the notice dealt with a 2011 incident. Reports that a white woman was among the terrorists who stormed a mall in Nairobi last weekend have prompted a slew of media speculation about Lewthwaite, a British woman whose husband was one of the suicide bombers in the 2005 London terror attacks. Known as the ""White Widow,"" Lewthwaite, 29, has been wanted by international counterterrorism officials since authorities found bomb-making materials in her Mombasa, Kenya, apartment in 2011. She vanished shortly before a raid. The red notice is for charges related to the explosives, not the Westgate Mall attack, Interpol said. Red notices issued by Interpol alert law enforcement around the world that a person is wanted, but they are not international arrest warrants. ""By requesting an Interpol Red Notice, Kenya has activated a global 'tripwire' for this fugitive,"" said Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble. ""Through the Interpol Red Notice, Kenyan authorities have ensured that all 190 member countries are aware of the danger posed by this woman, not just across the region but also worldwide,"" he said. Witnesses said they saw a female militant inside the mall during the attack. And a senior Kenyan official confirmed Tuesday that a woman was involved. Yet another official said Wednesday that authorities can't say much about who the woman was or what she was doing. Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed the Westgate mall Saturday. At least 67 people were killed and as many as 63 people are still unaccounted for.","NEW: Witnesses say a woman was among the Kenya mall attackers .

"Tegucigalpa, Honduras (CNN) -- U.S. Vice President Joe Biden vowed Tuesday to help Honduras and other Central American nations defeat drug traffickers and fight corruption. But at a meeting with Central American presidents in Honduras, Biden stopped short of supporting a proposal that has gained growing attention in the region in recent weeks: drug legalization. Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina said last month that he supported measures to decriminalize drug production, trafficking and consumption. On Tuesday, Central American leaders announced plans to debate the idea at a meeting later this month. Biden ""said that he was in favor of an open and genuine debate about the decriminalization of drugs as long as the procedures and possible results are analyzed,"" according to a Honduran government statement distributed to reporters after Tuesday's meeting. ""Resources cannot be wasted if they are not going to achieve concrete results,"" the statement said, quoting Biden. ""Resources must be focused on integrated, conclusive strategies and programs."" After meeting with Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Monday, Biden said there was no chance the Obama administration would change its policy opposing drug legalization, according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. ""In every country that has experimented with the legalization or decriminalization of drug consumption, the part of the population that consumes illegal substances grows,"" he said, according to Notimex. In an interview with CNN en EspaÃ±ol last month, Perez Molina defended his position. ""What I've done is put the topic back on the table. I think it is important for us to have other alternatives and to talk about decriminalization. ... We need to talk about decriminalization of the production, the transportation and, of course, consumption,"" he said. On Tuesday night, Honduran President Porfirio Lobo said Central American leaders meeting in Tegucigalpa ""listened with attention and interest to the proposal of the president of Guatemala about the search for alternative mechanisms for the fight against drug trafficking"" and would debate the issue at a meeting in Guatemala on March 24. Honduras is a key drug trafficking corridor and has the world's highest murder rate, with 82.1 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010, according to the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime. Lobo and other Central American leaders have repeatedly argued that drug use in the United States fuels escalating violence throughout the region. On Tuesday, Biden told reporters the United States ""shared responsibility"" but also noted that Central American countries must work to stop drug production. He pledged that the United States would provide economic assistance and training to Honduran law enforcement and judicial officials. ""One of the areas in which we will hopefully be of help is in vetting the police, the prosecutors and the judges,"" Biden said. ""My experience has been: The people of the country have to be able to have confidence in the integrity of each of those institutions, if progress is going to be made.""

"(CNN) -- Hasbro announced plans Monday to unveil a black and silver Easy-Bake Oven after meeting with the New Jersey teen who started a campaign asking the toy maker to offer the product in gender-neutral packaging. McKenna Pope's Change.org petition earned more than 40,000 signatures and the support of celebrity chefs who backed her request to change the Easy-Bake Ultimate Oven's girl-centric pink and purple packaging to include boys, too. She also asked Hasbro offer the product in different ""non-gender-specific"" colors that appeal to boys and girls. Hasbro said the black and silver design has been in development for 18 months and pointed out that the oven has been offered in a variety of colors since 1963, including teal, green, yellow, silver, blue and purple. ""We value input from our consumers and given the widespread interest in McKenna Pope's story, we extended an invitation to McKenna and her family to visit Hasbro and meet with our Easy-Bake team,"" Hasbro said in a statement. The company did not say whether it would change the packaging to include boys in its marketing. The 13-year-old launched the petition after on behalf of her 4-year-old brother, who wanted an Easy-Bake oven for Christmas. She could find them only in pink and purple, which she felt would discourage him and other boys from using them. Teen says pink toy oven excludes boys from kitchen play . On Monday, McKenna delivered boxes filled with petition signatures to Hasbro's headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. ""I was so excited when Hasbro asked to meet with me. I wanted to make sure they were hearing the feedback from 40,000 people who supported my campaign,"" McKenna said in a statement from Change.org. ""I'm thrilled that they not only recognize the importance of a gender-neutral Easy Bake Oven, but also, they've committed to launching one in 2013. Now, boys and girls can choose any color oven they want!"" The new design will be unveiled at the New York Toy Fair in February with the rest of Hasbro's new products for the year, the company said. McKenna's petition generated national conversation about how packaging and marketing might enforce gender stereotypes and discourage children from playing with particular toys. Others, including the Toy Industry Association, said toys come in different colors based on feedback from consumers and retailers.","Hasbro invites teen who launched Easy-Bake oven petition to view new prototype .

"(CNN) -- With the deadly fertilizer plant explosions in the city of West on its mind, Texas will develop an online database that will allow residents to view local facilities that hold hazardous materials. The creation of the database, which does not require a legislative vote, was announced by state Rep. Joe Pickett, D-El Paso. Residents will be able to input their ZIP code into the database, which will then show the nearest hazardous sites, Pickett told CNN Tuesday. Pickett is the chairman of the state legislature's Homeland Security and Public Safety Committee. In April, a fire at the facility operated by West Fertilizer Company set off two explosions that registered on seismographs as a magnitude-2.1 earthquake and were felt 50 miles away. The plant held 270 tons of highly volatile ammonium nitrate on site, according to regulatory records. Records: Texas plant hadn't told feds about explosive fertilizer . The new database will not only list sites with high volumes of ammonium nitrate, but also other volatile chemicals, Pickett said. There are 16 sites, mostly located in unincorporated areas, that house large amounts of ammonium nitrate, the lawmaker said. There may be up to 129 sites listed on the hazardous materials database, with varying levels of risk assigned to them, he said. The site will also provide information for contacting authorities about concerns about such facilities. A launch date for the database will be announced in about two weeks, Pickett said. The blasts in West leveled a portion of the town, damaging numerous homes, a nursing home and the town's high school and middle school. FEMA denies West additional aid . Authorities haven't publicly determined what caused the deadly situation, saying it could have started from a spark from a golf cart, an electrical short or could have been set intentionally. In May, authorities announced they had launched a criminal investigation into the case, though no one has been charged.","New Texas database will track hazardous chemicals .

"(CNN) -- Funny, personable, attractive and charismatic are just some of the words used to describe Gu Kailai. The wife of Bo Xilai -- a one-time rising star of the Chinese Communist Party -- once had it all: a powerful husband, a dynamic career and vast wealth. But it all unraveled in November 2011 when Gu and her household aide Zhang Xiaojun poisoned British businessman Neil Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room. During her one-day trial the following August, Gu issued a statement saying she didn't deny the accusations levied against her, but ""accepted all the facts written in the indictment"" -- including poisoning Heywood at a time when she thought her son's life was in danger, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. ""During those days last November, I suffered a mental breakdown after learning my son was in jeopardy,"" Gu, 53, said shortly before the trial concluded. ""The tragedy, which was created by me, was not only extended to Neil, but also to several families."" She eventually received a suspended death sentence, with Zhang given nine years in jail. Timeline: Bo Xilai's fall from grace . Gu's world started crumbling when she and Zhang were arrested in April 2012. The same day, Xinhua announced that Bo had been stripped of his seats on the Communist Party's Central Committee and Politburo, the nation's ruling organs, for an unspecified ""serious breach of regulations."" Ambitious and outgoing, Gu typified the international outlook of the second generation of China's political elite. She has even been described by some as the ""Jackie Kennedy of China."" Gu and her husband were both descendents of China's revolutionary heros -- Gu from Major-General Gu Jingsheng, a prominent revolutionary military figure, and Bo from Bo Yibo, considered one of the ""eight immortals"" of the revolution that created modern China. These associations may have fostered the connections essential to getting ahead in the new China of the past three decades. But in the 1960s, Gu and her husband were targets during the political upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. Bo spent almost five years in re-education camps as a youth, and published reports say Gu was forced to work in a textile factory and a butcher's shop as a 10 year old. These hardships only served to galvanize the phenomenal ambition of the couple, analysts say. Fluent in English, Gu is a lawyer who took a leading role in a legal battle in the United States involving several Chinese firms, eventually winning the lawsuit for the Chinese companies. She later wrote a book about the legal fight called ""Winning a Lawsuit in the United States."" Gu's involvement in Heywood's murder may have remained undetected, if not for former Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun. In February 2012, Wang fled to the U.S. consulate in Chengdu where he alleged that Bo had covered up Heywood's murder. Bo was later stripped of his post as Chongqing's party chief and his memberships in the Politburo, Central Committee, and Communist Party. In late July, he was charged with bribery, corruption and abuse of power. Gu is currently serving a suspended death which likely be commuted to life imprisonment if she doesn't commit any crimes during the first two years. CNN's Jaime FlorCruz contributed to this report.","Gu Kailai found guilty of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood .

"(CNN) -- At least 158 people have been killed since fighting broke out earlier this month between separatist rebels and soldiers in the Philippines, state news reported Wednesday. The majority of those killed, 125, were militants from the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), the government-run Philippines News Agency (PNA) said. Also among the reported dead were 15 members of the military, five from police, and 13 civilians. The lengthy crisis in Zamboanga City began when large numbers of rebels from the Muslim militant group came ashore more than two weeks ago. They took roughly 180 people hostage in coastal areas of the city. After attempts to negotiate the hostages' release failed, security forces moved in, resulting in intense bursts of fighting. The vast majority of the captives have now been freed, but authorities believe the rebels are still holding around five people, Lt. Col. Ramon Zagala, a military spokesman, said Wednesday. The unrest has fueled fears of increased instability in a region where the central government is pursuing a new peace plan after decades of violence. More than 109,000 people have been displaced in Zamboanga City and close to 19,000 are displaced in Basilan province, according to the United Nations, which described the situation Wednesday as a humanitarian crisis. Zamboanga City, on the southwestern tip of Mindanao, is a mainly Christian city. ""We are increasingly alarmed by the situation and the growing needs of people caught up with violence,"" said Luiza Carvalho, U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator in the Philippines. ""We are particularly concerned for the most vulnerable, especially the well-being of women and children."" Hundreds of houses have caught fire during the fighting. Authorities have accused the rebels of deliberately starting the fires. The rebels are a faction of the MNLF, a separatist movement founded in 1971 by Nur Misuari with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for Muslims in the mainly Catholic Philippines. The MNLF signed a peace deal with the central government in Manila in 1996, but some of its members have broken away to continue a violent campaign. Last month, Misuari issued a ""declaration of independence"" for the Moro nation -- referring to Mindanao's indigenous Muslim population -- after complaining that the MNLF had been left out of a recent wealth-sharing agreement with another insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state on resource-rich Mindanao.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A number of Kenya's Cabinet members and defense officials were warned about the possibility that the terror group Al-Shabaab was planning to carry out a Westgate-style attack a year before gunman stormed the Nairobi mall, according to several police and intelligence sources. The warnings were made by the country's National Intelligence Service as part of regular situational reports given to cabinet members, the inspector general of police, members of the National Security Advisory Council and military intelligence. CNN has seen an electronic version of those reports, which contain an extensive list of terror threats from several regions across Kenya over an extended period, but they also specify Al-Shabaab posed a threat to several targets, including Westgate Shopping Mall. The news about the intelligence warnings come amid revelations that the mall favored by Westerners and tourists was long-considered a possible terror target. CNN has also learned that the Westgate mall attackers tortured some of the hostages. Military doctors said militants severed hands, cut off noses and, in some cases, hanged hostages. CNN has seen photographic evidence of one dead victim with a hand amputated. Inquiry begins . Members of Parliament are expected Monday to begin grilling intelligence bosses, including the head of the National Intelligence Service, over the apparent intelligence failures. The news of the intelligence warnings follow the September 21 terror attack at Westgate that resulted in a four-day standoff that left at least 67 people dead and parts of the shopping center destroyed. Thirty nine are still unaccounted for, possibly buried beneath the rubble. The attackers claimed to be members of the Somali-based Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab itself made statements claiming responsibility, including saying on Twitter that it sent the gunmen in retaliation for Kenya's involvement in an African Union military effort against the group, which is al Qaeda's proxy in Somalia. Kenyan forces killed five terrorists, and 11 others are in custody over possible links to the attacks, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said. Immense work remains . But an immense amount of work remains to learn how Al-Shabaab, a terror group thought to be badly bruised by recent losses in its Somalian homeland, was able to pull off such a well-coordinated and brazen attack. Last year, the Kenyan military was part of a peacekeeping force that defeated Al-Shabaab forces to liberate the key Somali port of Kismayo. Since Kenya launched attacks against Al-Shabaab in Somalia in 2011, the group has hurled grenades at Kenyan churches, bus stops and other public places. It was the deadliest terror attack in Kenya since al Qaeda blew up the U.S. Embassy there in 1998, killing 213 people. Terrorism experts say the attack bears eerie similarities to the 2008 siege of a hotel in Mumbai, India -- another upscale target with Western appeal. Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani terrorist group that attacked the hotel for more than three days, killing 166 people.","NEW: Militants severed hands, cut off noses and hanged hostages .

"(CNN) -- Unable to defeat their political rival at the ballot box, some in the Venezuelan opposition are resorting to a tactic familiar to Americans: questioning the birthplace of the president. In the United States, the so-called ""birther"" movement disputed President Barack Obama's legitimacy, claiming that he was born in Africa and therefore is ineligible for the highest office. Even when Obama's birth certificate was made public, some called it a forgery. No birth certificate has been produced for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Rumors of Maduro's birthplace surfaced before he was elected in April, but in recent weeks they have gained new life. In the Venezuelan version of the birther movement, its proponents say Maduro was born in neighboring Colombia and is either a Colombian citizen or a dual citizen, either of which would make him ineligible to be president. The leaders of the movement have taken their complaint to Venezuela's Supreme Court, to Colombian authorities and even to the European Union. The claim is controversial in Venezuela. Maduro's supporters ignore the question as nonsense. The president has not addressed the question directly, but on several occasions said during speeches that he was born in Caracas. The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to CNN's calls for comment. The movement has gained the support of some opposition parties, which have asked the president to release a copy of his birth certificate. ""This is an international problem,"" Pablo Medina, a member of the opposition Patriotic Assembly, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Medina presented a letter to the European Union asking them to scrutinize Maduro's nationality and take a position on the matter. He went to the European Union because other governments ""should know that any contracts or any agreements that they sign with Nicolas Maduro, a Colombian citizen, are invalid, illegal, null and void."" This week, three lawyers asked the country's highest court to order Maduro to reveal where he was born, and what his parents' nationality is. The birthers in the United States are considered a fringe group, and it's unclear how seriously Venezuelans consider the accusations against Maduro. The theory that Maduro is not eligible to be president is welcomed by some Venezuelans who see it as a sliver of hope to unseat him. Maduro, the hand-picked successor of the late Hugo Chavez, narrowly won the election. Venezuela remains a polarized country, and there is a feeling that some factions will latch on to any tactic to remove Maduro from power. Others ignore the issue altogether, or look at it with curiosity. ""I sincerely regret these rotten, ill-intentioned campaigns, which make us think about what would have happened if this country was in the hands of people who only act to destroy the dignity and reputation of others,"" wrote pro-Maduro columnist Casto Gil Rivera in the pro-government newspaper Correo del Orinoco. Rivera wrote that he has known Maduro since he was a child -- in Caracas. The fact that Maduro's birth record has not been located in either Venezuela or Colombia allows the doubts to persist. According to Maduro's official biography, he was born in Caracas in 1962. During a speech in Italy in June, Maduro named a specific Caracas neighborhood as his birthplace as he recounted an anecdote about his childhood. He described it as a middle-class neighborhood and spoke of a memory he has of that place when he was 8 or 9. Medina says his group has sought Maduro's birth record in the place where he says he was born, but found nothing. To him, that is evidence that the president is not Venezuelan. But no birth records for Maduro have turned up in Colombia, either. A Colombian newspaper and radio outlet investigated allegations that the president's has Colombian roots in Cucuta, a town on the border with Venezuela, and found residents who had memories of Maduro as a child there. However, both media investigations turned up no evidence that Maduro was born in Colombia. There is no record of anyone with that name having been born in Cucuta, RCN Radio reported. So far, Venezuela's birther movement also has found no evidence to back their claims, much like their American counterparts. But, in another similarity, they stubbornly refuse to back down. Asked whether he had any concerns about risking the credibility of the opposition by linking it to a birther claim, Medina said he is certain that he is right. He said he was not aware of the way the birther movement is viewed in the United States. Journalist Osmary Hernandez contributed to this report from Venezuela.","Some Venezuelans are questioning the nationality of President Maduro .
This is similar to the birther movement in the United States .
No birth records for Maduro have surfaced in Venezuela or Colombia .
It is to be seen whether this is a fringe movement or if it will take root ."
"(CNN) -- Eduard Khil, a Soviet-era singing star who found renewed popularity as the viral Web's ""Mr. Trololo,"" died Monday, Russian media reported. Khil had been in a St. Petersburg, Russia, hospital since suffering a stroke in April. He was 77. Khil was considered one of the Soviet Union's great performers in the '60s and '70s. But his claim to fame in the rest of the world came in 2009 after a YouTube video posting of him performing the Russian pop song ""I Am Glad, 'Cause I'm Finally Returning Back Home."" With a toothy grin, Khil delivers a clearly lip-synced performance minus lyrics, instead using a series of made-up syllables, including the ""trololololo"" that captured the hearts of millions. According to New Music Express, the original lyrics, about a cowboy riding his horse home to meet his sweetheart Mary, were censored because they were deemed ""un-Soviet."" That led to his ""mouth music"" version, which ends up sounding like a mash-up of yodeling and jazz-era scat singing over a cheesy orchestral arrangement. Soon, the video was being used online as a new target for the bait-and-switch Rickroll meme in which a user posts a link to something supposedly relevant or interesting but turns out to be a ridiculous or annoying video or image instead. The original video was viewed more than 12 million times, with alternate versions and parodies racking up millions more. Khil became aware of the song's viral success after hearing his grandson humming the tune, according to Know Your Meme. Khil performed it several times afterward, with family members even starting a YouTube channel for him. On Monday, Khil was remembered on the same social-media sites where his video spread. Several tributes had been voted up to the main page of Reddit, and both his real name and ""Mr. Trololo"" were trending on Twitter. ""Oh no, Mr. Trololo (i.e. Eduard Khil) has died,"" Jon Fingas, an editor for tech blog Engadget, wrote on the site. ""The world is a sadder place. ... I'm glad the Internet gave him a lasting memory!""","Eduard Khil was a popular Soviet-era singer of the '60s and '70s .

"(CNN) -- In the year since Steve Jobs' death, Apple has undergone a gradual and subtle brand makeover, shaking off some of the more unpleasant characteristics associated with Jobs and taking on bits of the personality of its new leader, Tim Cook. For all his brilliance at product design, Jobs showed little interest in glad-handing with Apple partners or investors. By contrast, Apple from the outside has appeared more open under Cook, thanks to a number of orchestrated meetings and trips meant to appeal to the various factions -- consumers, investors and politicians -- interested in the world's leading tech company. In May, Cook went to Washington to meet with congressional leaders to open lines of communication that were mostly blocked in previous years. Apple was no stranger to lobbying (although it spends far less than some other Silicon Valley companies, like Google), but sending Cook was a way of letting politicians know Apple was ready to grow its relationship with Capitol Hill and that the company might take a stronger interest in policy issues in the future. Apple also has worked harder to woo Wall Street. There was a bus tour of investors that stopped at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, where they were treated to cookies and a presentation by Apple's chief financial officer. A more sizable act of goodwill was the cash dividend Apple paid out to investors -- the first in 17 years. On a call with investors in February, Cook answered questions, cracked jokes and was generally open and friendly. Did Apple's fanboy fever peak with Steve Jobs? After an outcry over working conditions at the factories of Apple's manufacturing partners, most notably Foxconn, Cook took swift action. He took a trip to China and toured a Foxconn plant in person. Apple also allowed the Fair Labor Association to do a thorough audit of conditions at the China factories, and Apple vowed to improve pay and hours. The most recent display of the company's shift in tone was its reaction to the bungled iOS 6 Maps app. The new Maps app crafted in-house by Apple to replace Google Maps on iPhones and iPads was riddled with flaws, from missing features to misplaced businesses, landmarks and even towns. A week after the phone hit stores, Cook apologized for the map publicly and, with surprising humility, even pointed customers to competing products. Some pundits compared his swift and contrite reaction to a terse and rare public apology from Jobs more than a month after complaints over the iPhone 4's antenna erupted in 2010. Who is the next Steve Jobs (and is there one)? Cook's mea culpa is just the latest demonstration of how he, and by extension Apple, is different from Jobs and the Jobs era at the company. Cook comes off as having a far more relaxed and approachable personality, and he is less inclined to be the center of attention. His product announcements are not one-man shows, but presentations shared with other Apple executives. He is still discovering his own style -- a tricky undertaking given the abnormal amounts of scrutiny that follow Apple's every move. A recent article by Bloomberg Businessweek, citing interviews with current and former Apple executives, employees and partners, states ""the company is happier and even somewhat more transparent than it was during Jobs' tenure ... There are fewer frantic calls at midnight, and there's less implicit pressure on engineers to cut short or cancel vacations in the heat of product development cycles."" Cook recently announced that most Apple employees at company headquarters will get the week of Thanksgiving off with pay, according to reports. Unfortunately for Apple's soft-spoken chief executive, he has been incessantly compared to his predecessor after every presentation, successes and failures. ""To simply put Steve Jobs on some sort of pedestal and say Apple could do no wrong under Steve's leadership is wrong,"" said Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg. Remember Ping, Apple's failed attempt at a social network centered around music? Cook has not launched any bold new products in the past 12 months. So far, the company has only released minor updates of popular products, like speedier laptops, the new Mac operating system, the refreshed iPod line and the new, taller iPhone 5. They've all been met with solid reviews (Maps app aside) and sold well. Apple has gone on to become the most valuable company in history. A year ago on October 4, Apple stock closed at $381.80 a share. On Wednesday, it closed at $671.45. But by staying the course, Cook has raised some concerns that he may lack the imagination and the bold ability to conjure up mind-blowing new products, which was Jobs' hallmark. Cook's last major responsibility was decidedly left-brained: streamlining Apple's supply chain. Some question how much credit for Apple's recent financial success should go Cook and how much is residual carryover from Jobs' regime. He prepared the company and its executives to carry on his vision and spent years grooming staff and setting up Apple to continue on seamlessly without him. Is it any surprise that it's continued to do so well? Your thoughts on the next Steve Jobs . Gartenberg says that while Jobs gave the appearance of being entirely in control, he did not in fact design each new device single-handedly. Apple has about 12,000 employees in the United States, not counting retail and support staff. It is a large, well-oiled machine that knows how to design and sell beautiful products that consumers want. ""The company is on cruise control,"" said Tero Kuittinen, an analyst at Alekstra. Kuittinen thinks the recent Maps kerfuffle could have a material impact on Apple and iPhone sales down the line, but we won't know until 2013. Early stats -- like moving 5 million iPhones 5s in the first weekend of sales -- can't foretell what's going to happen at the end of a model's life cycle. ""Apple has a huge amount of good will among consumers. They've started eating away at that,"" said Kuittinen, referring to the Map app problems. Kuittinen believes the big decisions that will define Cook are still yet to come. Some are decisions Jobs never made, such as whether to drop the price of the iPhone to be competitive in emerging markets. Cook has already proven that he is aggressive about international sales. The iPhone 5 will be in 100 countries at the end of this year -- a far speedier and more expansive roll out than previous Apple devices. It's still too early for anyone to predict Cook's long-term success or failure, observers say. And the true impact of Jobs' absence won't be known for two years or more. ""The biggest challenge Apple has is not product,"" Gartenberg said. ""They are going to have to manage this legend of Steve Jobs.""","In the year since Steve Jobs' death, Tim Cook has subtly altered Apple's image .
Concerted efforts have been made to reach out to investors and Washington .
Tim Cook's quieter, more approachable style is setting a new tone at the company ."
"(CNN) -- To the people of the Internet who knew his work, he was an ""enormous intellect,"" a ""brilliant and determined spirit"" and a ""hero of the open net."" To federal prosecutors, he was a criminal. The suicide of Internet activist Aaron Swartz continued to send shock waves Monday through the hacker community, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the larger online world. Swartz, a digital prodigy who helped develop social-news site Reddit and RSS, the technology that allows websites to send updates to subscribers, was found hanged Friday in his Brooklyn, New York, apartment. His death has inspired a flurry of online tributes and mobilized Anonymous, the loosely defined collective of so-called ""hacktivists"" who oppose attempts to limit Internet freedoms. Swartz, 26, faced allegations that he stole millions of online documents -- mostly scholarly papers -- from MIT through the university's computer network. Some saw it as a harmless stunt, but U.S. prosecutors disagreed and slapped Swartz with federal charges for which he could have faced decades in prison. His family issued a statement Saturday criticizing prosecutors for seeking ""an exceptionally harsh array of charges (for) an alleged crime that had no victims,"" and claiming that decisions made by prosecutors and MIT officials ""contributed to his death."" Swartz's suicide also prompted some soul searching at MIT. President L. Rafael Reif has requested an analysis of MIT's involvement in the case against Swartz, from the time the university first perceived unusual activity on its Web network in 2010 to the present. ""I have asked that this analysis describe the options MIT had and the decisions MIT made,"" he said in an e-mail Sunday to members of the MIT community. ""All of us at MIT are extremely saddened by the death of this promising young man who touched the lives of so many,"" Reif added. ""It pains me to think that MIT played any role in a series of events that have ended in tragedy."" That didn't stop Anonymous from claiming credit late Sunday for defacing several MIT websites. Users of MIT's network lost access to most sites for nearly three hours Sunday night, according to the Tech, the campus newspaper. Someone claiming to represent Anonymous posted a statement online calling the government's prosecution of Swartz ""a grotesque miscarriage of justice."" The statement then listed four ""wishes,"" including reform of computer crime laws and a renewed commitment to ""a free and unfettered Internet."" The defaced pages appear to have been removed Monday. MIT's news office did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment. Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment to CNN on Swartz's case, citing respect for the family. Carmen M. Ortiz, the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts, quietly dropped the charges against Swartz on Monday. Swartz's funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in Highland Park, Illinois. Meanwhile, by Monday afternoon scores of people had posted tributes to Swartz on Reddit and on a memorial site, Remember Aaron Swartz. ""I and others like me feel his death so keenly in part because we aspire to be the misfit, the wunderkind, the maker that he was,"" wrote blogger David Brunton. ""Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and issues,"" wrote his friend Cory Doctorow, co-editor of tech blog Boing Boing. ""I think he could have revolutionized American (and worldwide) politics. His legacy may still yet do so."" Using the hashtag #pdftribute, hundreds of academic researchers also posted their papers online via Twitter Sunday and Monday to honor Swartz's memory.","Suicide of Internet activist Aaron Swartz sends shock waves through the Web .

"(CNN) -- The fertilizer plant that blew up in Texas last week warned state and local officials but not federal agencies that it had 270 tons of highly volatile ammonium nitrate on site, according to regulatory records. The April 17 fire and explosion at West Fertilizer Co. killed 14 people and devastated the small town of West, Texas. Investigators have said they're not sure how much ammonium nitrate was actually on site at the time of the explosion, however, since plant records were destroyed in the blast. Obama tells victims' families that nation will help them recover . The company sold ammonium nitrate and anhydrous ammonia, both commonly used as fertilizers. It had notified state and local emergency management officials of its stock of both in its most recent declaration of hazardous chemicals, filed in February. However, the risk management plan it filed with the federal Environmental Protection Agency in 2011 mentioned only anhydrous ammonia, which produces suffocating fumes and can cause burns if mishandled. The plan listed as a worst-case scenario ""the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes"" and did not warn of the risks of explosion. Federal law requires any operation that holds more than a ton of fertilizer-grade ammonium nitrate to report that stock to the Department of Homeland Security. Proposed new rules would cut that to 25 pounds. But Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a Senate subcommittee Tuesday that West Fertilizer doesn't appear to have reported its ammonium nitrate stock to federal officials, adding, ""We're following up on that."" In a statement issued earlier this week, after the first lawsuit against it was filed in connection with the explosion, the company said its focus ""remains on the fact finding."" ""We continue to do everything we can to understand what happened to ensure nothing like this ever happens again in any community,"" it said. ""To that end, the owners and staff of West Fertilizer Co. are working closely with investigating agencies. We have encouraged all employees to assist in the fact finding to whatever degree possible."" Among the dead was plant foreman Cody Dragoo, who was also a member of the town's volunteer fire department. The explosion happened about 20 minutes after the first report of a fire there. It registered on seismographs as a magnitude 2.1 earthquake and could be felt 50 miles away. Town devastated by fertilizer explosion is guided by the West way . Last week's explosion damaged numerous houses, a nursing home and the town's high school and middle school, all of which were built within a few hundred feet of the plant. That's raised concern about similar facilities in other towns, both in rural communities like West and major cities like Houston, the heart of the oil industry. Animals become symbols of hope in Texas town . ""I know there's hundreds of public schools on the fenceline or very close to these industrial plants,"" said Neil Carman, a former Texas Department of Environmental Quality inspector now working for the state Sierra Club. ""I wouldn't be surprised if it's over 1,000."" Zoning restrictions are rare in the state, and Carman said there have been thousands of complaints from neighborhoods in areas like Houston, Beaumont and Corpus Christi, home to numerous oil refineries. West Fertilizer had been twice cited by federal regulators twice since 2006. In 2012, the Transportation Department's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration fined West Fertilizer $5,250 for storing anhydrous ammonia in tanks that lacked the proper warning labels. The agency originally recommended a $10,000 penalty, but it was reduced after the company took corrective action. In 2006, the EPA fined it $2,300 owners to correct problems that included a failure to file a risk management program plan on time. The TCEQ also investigated a complaint about the lingering smell of ammonia around the plant the same year.","West Fertilizer reported having 270 tons of ammonium nitrate on hand in February .

"(CNN) -- When trash disappears into the dumpster, where does it go? A straightforward question for many of us, but in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte there's seldom a simple answer where garbage is concerned. That's because the catadores (trash collectors) of the ASMARE cooperative are adept at transforming any old disused material into furniture, jewelry or even works of art. ""I have two jobs,"" explained 39-year-old collector Edimar Ferreira. ""I go and collect the trash and then I transform it into art. I make small sofas, wooden benches, tables, and other plastic adornments."" ""We have a phrase (at ASMARE): 'o seu lixo e o meu luxo,' (roughly translated as 'your trash is our luxury,')"" he cheerily added. See also: Brazil's middle class boom . Catadores like Ferreira are a familiar sight in towns and cities across Brazil -- a motley collection of individuals who sift through mountains of street trash or landfill to locate paper, cans, bottles, metals and other types of recyclable materials. A 2010 estimate by the Business Commitment for Recycling (CEMPRE) association stated that there were roughly one million catadores in Brazil, although only a small number work officially for cooperatives and organizations like ASMARE. Many are the formerly homeless, ex-convicts or individuals who have stumbled upon hard times, selling what they find to recycling companies. Arts and crafts . In recent years, however, the cash return for many of Belo Horizonte's catadores has become too inconsistent to ensure a stable income. The solution that ASMARE -- a professional group representing nearly 200 pickers-- came up with was to get creative with the one material they have plenty of -- trash. Recruiting the help of local artists and volunteers, ASMARE has run an arts program for the best part of a decade where workers are taught how to transform the recyclable items they find during their daily collections. ""The art center started with the purpose of us being able to make our own carts, and then for the catadores' children to learn how to make crafts and other art pieces with the material collected,"" said Dona Geralda, founder and president of ASMARE. ""The main benefits are the generation of employment and income for the catadores and their children. We (have now) started to implement the culture of 'garbage that is not garbage,'"" added the 63-year-old, who has herself been a catadore since she was eight. See also: Brazil's thriving African culture . All items created at ASMARE are sold in a shop near the organization's headquarters, with profits shared equally amongst the catadores. Combining art sales and the money accumulated from selling on recycled materials, an ASMARE worker's monthly income now averages out a respectable 1,700 Brazilian Reais (about $800). Branching out . Yet although it was one of the first to introduce creative programs (as well as claiming to be the first catadore cooperative in Brazil), the Belo Horizonte outfit is far from alone in its aesthetic endeavors. Other organizations and artists have adopted similarly imaginative tactics in undertaking creative projects with catadores in recent years. In Sao Paolo, a street project called ""Pimp My Carroca"" has been adding colorful graffiti to the wooden carts used by many catadores since last summer. The 2010 Oscar-nominated film Wasteland documented the catadores of Rio de Janeiro's now closed Jardin Gramacho landfill as they became subjects of works by the Brazilian artist Vik Muniz. The artworks eventually sold for tens of thousands of dollars each. See also: Does Brazil deserve its B for BRIC . According to Mauricio Soares, an artist who heads the ASMARE creative program, helping catadores to produce art is about much more than just the obvious financial or creative benefits. ""In Brazil the catadore is often discriminated against because of their origin,"" Soares said. ""Therefore, linking art to recycling allows them to go to places that they have never been before and they end up having better acceptance because their creative work gives them a good visibility,"" he added. Recycling attitudes . Soares also sees the potential to promote the possibilities of recycling across the country. ""Art through recycling aims to arouse people's consciousness to think about what trash is or is not,"" Soares said. ""This new consciousness will help us to promote waste reduction. ""When people see a recycled art piece, for instance, on a woman's neck they may begin to understand that it is not (just) trash,"" he added. See also: Send us your favorite pictures of Brazil . This is something that Ferreira strongly agrees with. He points to what he has learned since he began the ASMARE program two years ago as an example of how attitudes to trash can change. ""This experience has made me look at recycling in a different way,"" he said. ""There are materials that I used to throw away that now I keep, because I can already envision making some nice piece with it later. I don't see the material only as trash anymore.""","Catadores are waste collectors who pick through trash to source recyclable materials .
There are an estimated one million catadores across the country .

"(CNN) -- Apple is getting pushed around a lot these days. Digerati reaction to the iPhone 5 was ""meh,"" response to the iPad Mini was akin to ""it's about time"" and we are all more excited about unicorn-like products such as an iWatch and iTV than the things you can buy right now. Apple's strength is its Achilles' heel: We expect it to reinvent on schedule and when, in our infinite wisdom, we believe it is not, we treat it like the kid who no longer belongs in our clique. Some of this is to be expected when a company with as incredible a recent track record as Apple's seems to be resting more on its laurels than finding new battles to win. Since the quixotic introduction of the iMac in 1998 -- reinvigorating the desktop computer well into the age of portables -- Apple has been on a tear: . • The iPod (2001) • The iTunes Store, allowing the purchase of single music tracks (2003) • The Apple retail store (2004) • The iPhone (2007) • The iPad (2010) And you can add to list that Steve Jobs' revitalization of the animated feature film through his acquisition of Pixar. That's a lot of imagination in a very short time. Apple hasn't just dominated the story for a decade: It has written the story of the past decade. That is a lot to live up to. Most companies can't. It's particularly brutal for tech (as opposed to, say, shampoo) companies, which at best can usually hope to set the pace for only about generation until they settle into a comfortable middle class. Call it the Microsoft Curve. Microsoft dominated through the red-hot '90s, the height of the PC era. It isn't going anywhere. It still prints money by selling MS-Office and Windows licenses. But look at a five-year stock price chart, and you'll see it has gone exactly nowhere. The only people dancing for joy about owning a Windows computer seem to be in those Surface Pro TV ads. At the bottom of the pile there is the sad tale of Palm -- the hottest tech company on the planet for far too brief a time. Palm Pilots were once everywhere. But the company stumbled by failing to recognize quickly enough that, in the age of the Internet, no one wanted a portable device that couldn't get online. How Samsung is out-innovating Apple . Another hard luck case is Research in Motion -- now BlackBerry. That company did get the portable device memo, but it spectacularly misjudged the smartphone revolution sparked by Apple. Now Apple is this unfamiliar territory: Successful on paper, products seen everywhere, Macbooks and iPhone placed in seemingly every TV show and movie and yet ... the cool factor is cooling off. There is a big difference between atmospherics and actuality, of course. But nobody wants to be thought of as a has-been in the making. The lesson of tech history is that smart companies crash when they believe what they have already done is all they need to do: that doubling-down and trash-talking the competition is what it takes. Exhibit A? Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer himself, whose initial public reaction to the iPhone was that business customers wouldn't want it ""because it doesn't have a keyboard, which makes it not a very good e-mail machine."" This would be a good time to mention that increasingly large numbers of these ""business customers"" now want an iPhone at work, challenging Microsoft at what has been its enterprise stronghold. Apple's search for its next billion-dollar product . Success is never assured, but it can only be extended only two ways: If you corner the market, impossible in the uberdisruptive tech space, or if you are unabashedly willing to question everything, all the time. Facebook began life as the world's most exclusive private social network -- only Harvard students need apply. But it became a public company worth $68 billion because it decided instead to become the world's least exclusive private network. Even Palm's trajectory might have been different if it had inverted its thinking in time: Imagine a Palm Pilot not as a personal information manager with connectivity, but a connected device with PIM applications, and you have described exactly what the smartphone is today. There is no reason to think Apple won't thrive financially for years to come, just like Microsoft. But its continued reputation as the chief arbiter of cool is being challenged. Apple may still have the best-selling smartphone in the world, but the many others powered by rival Google's Android operating system -- and especially those made by Samsung -- far exceed the iPhone. For years, tech writers reviewed each new smartphone on a simple grading scale: Is this the iPhone killer? None has been, but collectively the point has been made: . No phone has killed the iPhone, but plenty of them co-exist just fine, thank you very much. We expect the unexpected from Apple, and the company does nothing to tamp down these expectations. So when it doesn't dazzle us, ennui begins to creep in. Apple is also burdened by what I called at the time the meaningless milestone of having become the biggest company ever. Where do you go from there? You are either still the biggest, or slipping. Consolidating your lead is fine and all, but it isn't sexy. My own prediction of Apple's prospects is that needs to worry about becoming a mid-packer only after the CEO Tim Cook and designer Jony Ive -- the other tow members of the triumvirate headed by Steve Jobs -- are no longer with the company. Until then, perhaps a decade from now, you bet against Apple at your own peril.

"(CNN) -- Consider for a moment how much Google knows about you. Depending on what services you use, it might have a record of every word or phrase you've searched, locations you visit the most and where you are right now, your scheduled meetings and trips, and any other information buried in e-mails. Some might find it unsettling that a $265 billion tech company in California knows them so intimately, but Google is working hard to use that data to deliver more personalized products, not just targeted ads. On Monday, Google's predictive search feature Google Now finally rolls out for iPhone and iPad users as an update to the existing Google Search app. The tool, which has been available for Android devices since last summer, uses the wealth of data Google has about an individual to serve up information it thinks he or she will find useful at the moment it's most needed. On a typical weekday morning, Google Now might automatically show the weather where you live, the traffic for your morning commute and the final Giants score from the night before. If you have a trip planned, it can display your flight status, when you need to leave to get to the airport, relevant currency conversions, directions to the hotel and nearby landmarks to visit at your destination. Each nugget of information displayed is called a card, and the types of cards a person sees depends on what Google services he or she chooses to tie into the app. Your search history tells Google Now what you're interested in, including what sports teams you follow, music you listen to, stocks you own and the news you are most likely to follow. You can train Google Now over time by swiping away any cards that you don't want. ""We're providing answers before you've even asked the question,"" said Tamar Yehoshua, Google's director of product development. Using your phone's location information, it can show train times when you get close to a station, concerts coming to a venue near you, photogenic landmarks in the vicinity, and suggest events in the area to check out. One of the most promising tie-ins is to Gmail. Confirmation e-mails for restaurants, flights, hotel bookings, concerts or other ticketed events and shopping receipts are easily lost in the inbox. Google Now identifies these types of e-mails and turns them into cards, so you can track a package you're waiting for or use your phone as a boarding pass at the airport. For now the most intriguing features are tied to travel, where Google Now helps juggle reservations and also shares local information you might find in a guidebook. You can choose what services to use with Google Now, so if the idea of Google parsing your e-mails sounds like an invasion of privacy, you can limit it to just Web history and location information. Google already uses a lot of this data to serve ads in Gmail and on search results. These types of apps are sometimes compared to personal assistants, someone working in the background to keep your schedule in check and make sure you have the information needed to coast through a busy day. There are other predictive assistant apps such as Grokr and Osito that you can give access to your e-mail and calendar information, but for many, Google products are already integrated into every part of their lives. According to comScore, Google apps were four of the top five most downloaded apps across both operating systems in 2012, coming in after Facebook. Google is also in a unique position to know what information people are most interested in seeing and when they want it based on the giant volume of Web searches processed by the search engine daily. According to Yehoshua, only 16% of the queries entered into Google in a given day are searches it has never seen before. Google Now has been called a Siri competitor. Like Apple's voice assistant, the iOS Google Search app already had voice search functions that let you ask questions in natural language, and both can answer back or show search listings when a question is beyond their pay grade. However, Siri is deeply integrated with the iOS operating system. Google has been able to tie Google Now into the Android system, but it's more limited on the iPhone and iPad. For the time being, Google Now has no push notifications, which means you'll have to open the search app to see what it has in the queue for you. Google Now may not be the computer of the future that predicts your every need, but as people get more comfortable with their personal data being used to analyze them, predictive apps can expand their scope to collect even more data from tools such as wearable pedometers and other sensors. The more information they have about a person, the closer apps and smartphones can get to becoming actual personal assistants.","Google Now predicts what information you are likely to want before you look it up .

"(CNN) -- Either Mitt Romney got really popular last weekend, or something funky was going on with his Twitter feed. The Republican presidential nominee's account on the site, which had been gaining followers at a clip of about 3,000 to 4,000 a day, appears to have gained more than 116,000 followers Friday and another 24,000 on Saturday. That's according to Twitter Counter, an online tool that charts the number of followers that Twitter accounts have over time. Other tools show slightly different numbers and space the gains out differently over a three-day period. The spike was noticed by Zach Green, who runs 140elect.com, which monitors social-media activity in politics. He charted the growth as 23,926 new followers on Friday, 93,054 on Saturday and 25,432 more on Sunday. With political campaigns increasingly using social media as a tool to communicate with supporters, a strong presence on sites like Facebook and Twitter is regarded as a measure of relevance. As such, some politicians have been accused of using tricks to artificially inflate their online presence. For example, Romney's opponent in the primaries, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, was dinged by a report that as few as 8% of his 1.3 million Twitter followers were real. The rest were drummed up by a program that creates fake accounts to swell someone's follower ranks, the report said. (The campaign denied it.) Romney had about 807,000 followers Tuesday morning, up from about 670,000 four days ago. The Romney campaign says it had nothing to do with the spike in the former Massachusetts governor's follower list. ""We have reached out to Twitter to find out additional information regarding the rapid growth,"" campaign spokesman Zac Moffat told BuzzFeed. The campaign did not immediately respond to CNN's message seeking comment for this story. Green told Mashable, a CNN content partner, that someone else may have added fake followers in an effort to embarrass the Romney campaign. He said the new followers don't appear to come from any legitimate increase in popularity. Green's analytics didn't show any increase in Twitter mentions, retweets or other signs that typically would accompany organic growth on the site, he said. Several online services offer clients the chance to ""buy"" Twitter followers, although their sites are vague about where the followers come from or how they are acquired. One such service, BuyTwitterFollow, promises to supply 25,000 new followers for a fee of $225. Even with the bump, Romney remains far behind President Barack Obama on Twitter. Obama has about 17.8 million Twitter followers -- and, it should be noted, the built-in advantage of having been president of the United States for the past 3Â½ years.","Mitt Romney sees a large increase in the number of his followers on Twitter .

"London (CNN) -- Three-dimensional (3-D) printers have come a long way from their 1980s origins as machines for building prototypes for industrial engineers and architects. Today, thanks to advances in technology and high-performance materials, they are being hailed as enablers of a ""new industrial revolution."" The technology, which creates 3-D objects layer by layer from 2-D computer models, could transform manufacturing in the 21st century. Hod Lipson, director of Cornell University's Creative Machines Lab and co-author of ""Fabricated: The New World of 3D Printing,"" says there's virtually no material you can't print with. ""We are focusing on bio-printing and recently worked on food printing. Now we are focusing on multi-material printing -- integrating electric wires, batteries and motors,"" Lipson said. ""We really want to print a robot that will walk out of a printer. We have been able to print batteries and motors, but we haven't been able to print the whole thing yet. I think in two or three years we'll be able to do that."" Lispon says the commercial 3-D printer market is now growing exponentially, likening the change to the switch from mainframe computers to desktop during the 1980s. You can now buy printers for $1,000 going up to around $500,000, he says. But you might not need one at all. ""If you're interested in, say, making iPhone covers and you wanted to make them high quality, you could send the file online and it could be shipped overnight to you or your customer. So, essentially there is a cloud manufacturing model that is happening that is allowing people to do this,"" Lipson said. See more: How you can 'print' 3-D objects at home . The scale of 3-D products is also expanding with printing ranging from the micro scale right up to building-size, according to Lipson. Most people are printing toys at the moment, but industrial applications are also growing. Engineers at EADS (The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company) -- parent of plane manufacturer Airbus -- are at the vanguard of the rapidly advancing field. The benefits are enormous, says Jonathan Meyer, leader of Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) Research at EADS Innovation Works, based in the UK. ""For us, it's very advantageous to have a technology where we don't need specialized tooling. When you invest in tooling it drives you to a requirement for higher volumes in order to make the cost case,"" Meyer said. EADS is working with titanium alloys, high-strength steels and aluminum alloys, turning them from powder into a solid object (a process called sintering) using a laser or an electron beam. As well as cutting down on waste, the technology also presents the opportunity to make new system parts that are more complex than ones made using conventional machining, Meyer says. Hydraulic manifold channels can now be curved instead of straight, he says, while complex small-scale trusses can now be defined with far greater accuracy. Compared to machining, printing reduces weight by up to 65% without compromising on strength, the company says. ""That's one of the things that has surprised a lot of people. We can achieve properties that are equivalent to or, in some cases, better than available materials from plate products,"" Meyer said. None of these new 3-D parts are flying around in Airbus's current fleet, but Meyer is confident they will be by the end of the decade, helping make planes lighter and more fuel efficient. By 2050, EADS envisages wings, perhaps even whole planes, being built by vast 3-D machines. ""It will require a shift in technology and with that comes other constraints and capabilities. But multi-meter, high-value parts are realistic in that time frame. It's a very serious focus,"" Meyer said. 3-D printing won't be a direct replacement for all existing manufacturing technologies, but it will be ""a very, very significant introduction of capabilities to complement that,"" he says. Whether Lipson's robot manages to walk out of a printer in the near term remains to be seen. Whatever happens, it's going to be a lot easier to make things, Lipson says. ""The bottom line is that for the first time in human history complexity is free -- making something complicated takes the same amount of time, resources and skill of making something simple,"" said Lipson. ""This is a profound departure from the past.""","Advances in 3-D printing could transform manufacturing in the 21st century .

"(CNN) -- American Airlines has found cracks in large pylons that hold engines onto the wings of two of its 767-300 aircraft, according to the airline and to the planes' manufacturer. Concerned the problem may exist on other airline fleets, Boeing says it plans to advise airlines to inspect the parts more frequently than the current recommendation of every 1,500 takeoff and landing cycles. ""This is considered a safety issue. You're talking about the strut that connects an engine to the wing,"" said Boeing spokesperson Peter Conte. American Airlines spokesman Tim Wagner said the problem was first discovered on one of its 767-300s about two weeks ago during a maintenance check targeting other parts of the aircraft. The airline then found cracking on one more 767-300 after inspecting a total of 56 aircraft -- 767-300 and 767-200s -- a process American Airlines completed Monday night. ""We found these issues when it's best to find them, which is early on,"" said Wagner. The airline has sent the first damaged pylon to a metallurgy lab to try to determine why it cracked. ""Until that metallurgy testing is completed no one knows what the cause is,"" said Wagner. The damaged planes were among American's older aircraft, Wagner added. American flies Boeing 767-300s on international routes as well as long-haul domestic routes. The 767-200s fly primarily transcontinental routes. Airlines have previously found similar cracks at the holes where the pylon attaches to the wing, which led Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration five years ago to recommend checks every 1,500 cycles. At that time, when the FAA issued an airworthiness directive it said, ""We are issuing this (directive)  to prevent fatigue cracking in the primary strut structure and reduced structural integrity of the strut, which could result in separation of the strut and engine.""","American Airlines found cracks on two 767-300 aircraft .

"(CNN) -- A charter bus bound for a casino overturned on an interstate highway in Los Angeles County on Thursday morning, injuring 46 people, officials said. Most of the injuries were minor to moderate, Saul Gomez of the California Highway Patrol told CNN. Several trauma patients were airlifted by helicopter. ""Luckily, none are life-threatening, and the situation has stabilized for now,"" Gomez said. Witnesses were still being interviewed, and it was too early to ascertain a cause of the wreck, he said. The bus, which was on its side off of Interstate 210 near Irwindale, had traversed four lanes before coming to rest. The stretch of highway is popular with tour buses headed to casinos. The wreck occurred at about 10 a.m. (1 p.m. ET) The crash happened on eastbound I-210 near the intersection with Interstate 605, nearly 20 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. By early afternoon, one eastbound lane of I-210 was open. Medical helicopters landed on the highway to transport victims, and numerous emergency personnel were tending to people at the side of the highway, video from CNN affiliate KCAL showed.

"(CNN) -- Protesters across six continents on Saturday demanded the release of hundreds of detainees in Iran who were arrested in the bloody aftermath of the Islamic republic's disputed presidential election. Iranian demonstrators in Pakistan shout slogans during a demonstration in Islamabad. The global day of action that spanned about 100 cities was organized by United For Iran and supported by several human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders. ""We are all working for the same Iran,"" Shirin Ebadi, the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner and a native Iranian, told a crowd in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. ""Iran is our homeland, let us be united."" Roxana Saberi, the Iranian-American journalist who spent four months in an Iranian jail earlier this year, addressed a crowd in Chicago, Illinois. ""I'm very, very touched ... that all of you have turned out here, on this very important day, and that you're speaking out for those Iranians whose voices cannot be heard,"" she said.

Protesters waved green flags, held up green signs and wore green wristbands and shirts -- the color is symbolic of the opposition movement in Iran. iReport.com: Are you at a protest? Share your photos, video . The sea of green also appeared in Washington, where hundreds of Iranian-American protesters marched from the United Nations Information Center to the U.S. Capitol building to call on the United Nations to take a more active role in addressing alleged human rights abuses inside Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ""This is a show of solidarity with the people inside Iran,"" protester Khosrow Akbari said. ""Iranians all over the world are united to send the message that they will not tolerate the human rights abuses inside the country."" British protesters outside the Iranian Embassy in London wanted to show solidarity for those Iranians ""who feel too intimidated, too fearful"" to go back out on the streets to protest, reported CNN Correspondent Paula Newton. Several of the demonstrations, especially in the United States and Europe, called for Western governments to be more vocal about the reported human rights violations in Iran.  Watch a report about the protests around the globe » . ""Enough is enough,"" said Parviz Shahi, a demonstrator in London. ""How many people do they have to sacrifice?"" The demonstrations on Saturday condemned the Iranian government's violent response to citizens who claim the June 12 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was fraudulent.   Hundreds of thousands of Iranians took to the streets after the election, and many were met with brutality from security forces that resulted in death or serious injuries. ""These acts are a direct assault on the Iranian people's human and civil rights -- and those of everyone who supports these ideals around the world,"" United For Iran said on its Web site. ""Our only aim is to condemn the widespread and systematic violations of the Iranian people's human rights and to call for full restoration of their human and civil rights,"" the group says. Hundreds of people were detained after the elections, but officials say ""only the organizers of the conflict"" were still behind bars. Government officials announced last week that the ""confessions"" of the remaining detainees will soon be broadcast. Ebadi called on all Iranians to ignore such broadcasts, saying they were forced by the government. ""Don't listen to these lies,"" she said Saturday, in a speech captured in an i-Report video. Saturday's events came ahead of Ahmadinejad's swearing-in ceremony, scheduled for the first week of August. Ahmadinejad's political rivals also continued their call for the release of detainees Saturday in an open letter to a handful of grand ayatollahs who are ""sources of emulation"" for many Shiite Muslims in Iran and abroad. ""This is not and will not put our country and our system on a path of fairness and justice, and will only darken the face of the Islamic republic, in the hearts and souls of all Iranians as well as those around the world,"" says the letter, signed by reformist Mir Hossein Moussavi, fellow opposition candidate Mehdi Karrubi and former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who supported Moussavi in the presidential race. The letter was published on Moussavi's Web site, Ghalam News. ""Worst than this is that the security organizations are mysteriously pursuing the wrong and fabricated thoughts that the activists are tied to the foreigners and ... have, therefore, given way to illegal, immoral and unethical confession extraction methods,"" the letter says. Meanwhile, in Berlin, Germany, about 2,000 people turned out to rally for Iranians. A moment of silence was held, and about 40 people have been participating in a hunger strike over the past three days, CNN Correspondent Frederik Pleitgen reported. ""We are watching Iran, hoping that they (the government) come to their senses and realize that this is their own people they're shooting at,"" said Sahand Zamani, whose cousin -- 19-year-old Sohrab Aarabi -- was reportedly shot dead on June 15 during one of the bloody protests that followed the presidential elections. ""I certainly think that Sohrab is standing for a lot of young Iranian people and ... his death is a national tragedy in Iran, as well as I think a tragedy worldwide. A 19-year-old boy getting shot because of his opinion -- this has a meaning,"" Zamani said. ""But I hope he can find rest and peace and this won't happen again."" Germany is one of Iran's major trade partners, prompting the Berlin protesters to call on their government to get tough with Tehran over the Islamic republic's human rights record and nuclear ambitions. United For Iran said it wants U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to send a delegation to Iran to investigate the fate of political prisoners; the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, including journalists; an end to state-sponsored violence; freedom of the press and Iran's adherence to international agreements it has signed.","Ahmadinejad's political rivals call for detainees' release in letter to ayatollahs .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, at the glittering Emirates Palace hotel, in front of a who's who of the United Arab Emirates, the front page of the world's newest daily broadsheet was unveiled. The world's newest daily newspaper . Editor-in-chief, Martin Newland, former editor of the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph newspaper, showed the new Abu Dhabi paper off to an audience which included  Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed. ""The National"" has been designed in the style of a British broadsheet and aims to give the capital of the United Arab Emirates a public voice. It has an editorial team of 200 -- including a host of former Daily Telegraph employees hired by Newland -- which is the largest working on an English-language daily in the Middle East. Among Newland's new staff is Bill Spindle, former corporate finance editor of the Wall Street Journal, who is business editor. Former Daily Telegraph Paris correspondent, Colin Randall is executive editor of the paper. ""Abu Dhabi is about to have a national daily newspaper, and I hope and believe that it will be a very good one,"" he wrote on his blog francesalut.com in the run up to the launch. The paper's breadth of coverage is indeed impressive -- the first edition included 20 pages of business, arts, news and sport. ""It is a late stage of my career to be participating, for the first time in the thrill of launching a national newspaper. ""If truth be told, it is also a late stage in the career of newspapers themselves for an event of this kind to be occurring. I cannot imagine many parts of the world where anyone would think of embarking on such a project,"" Randall continues. ""The National"" is owned by an investment fund controlled by the Abu Dhabi government -- one of the richest governments in the world -- and it is yet another expression of the ambitiousness of the federation's plans for the future. In spite of the grandness of the launch, there is no obvious business case for a new daily in Abu Dhabi. Fewer than 500,000 adults with English as their mother tongue live in Emirate and there are already five daily newspapers catering for this section of the market. In fact, the most obvious gap in the market is for a popular newspaper aimed at Hindi speakers. Press freedom is another issue that is lurking under ""The National's"" shiny new veneer. In the run up to the launch, editor Newland glossed over the issue of editorial freedoms in the state-owned broadsheet. Sheikh Mohammed's presence at the launch is a sign of his backing and insiders say he wants a newspaper that reports on a federation-wide basis and is prepared to challenge official complacency wherever it exists. But it is impossible to say that ""The National"" is independent. A paper that can fearlessly criticize government policy in the federation is still a long way in the future.

"(CNN) -- Phillip Prince has been sitting in his tractor-trailer, stuck on Interstate 40 near Groom, Texas, for hours. Nine hours and four minutes, to be precise. Prince and his co-driver were due in California at 1 p.m. Tuesday, where they were going to drop off 25,000 pounds of frozen pizza. But then they came upon what the National Weather Service is calling ""a crippling, historic blizzard."" ""It was pretty nasty when we first got into it,"" he said. ""But then it turned into a whiteout."" Prince, who has been a long-haul driver for nine years, says he's never seen it this bad, as he explained his situation on CNN.com's iReport. The line of trucks is five to six miles long. It's frustrating, the west-bound driver said, because he can see snowplows in the east-bound lanes. He hopes to get moving soon; he's down to eating his last box of Lucky Charms. The good news is that it has stopped snowing. The winds are still 55 mph, but the skies are clear though the roads are not. The storm has been moving east during the day, dumping records amount of snow along the way. In Woodward, a town in northwest Oklahoma, firefighters were unable to reach a burning house because they ran into 4-foot snow drifts. The snowplow sent to dig them out also became stuck, Matt Lehenbauer, the director of Woodward, said Monday afternoon. ""At this point, we can't keep ahead of snowfall rates,"" he said. ""Right now, the situation is pretty critical."" At least six calls came in from other stranded motorists, he said. As of 3:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET), 15 inches of snow had fallen in Woodward, the most snow accumulation since 1971, the National Weather Service said. Blizzard warnings were set to expire at midnight across the Texas Panhandle, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. The powerful storm will move northeast through Oklahoma on Monday night, prompting blizzard warnings there. Blizzard conditions are expected to move into south central Kansas early Tuesday, bringing another round of heavy snow to Wichita, which just experienced record snowfall last week. As the storm moves into eastern Kansas, winds will die down and whiteout conditions are less likely. However, heavy snow is still forecast with snowfall totals over a foot in some areas of southeast Kansas. The storm is leaving behind a huge mess in its wake. Almost all roads in the Texas Panhandle were impassable Monday, and the state Department of Transportation pulled virtually all of its snowplows off roads because of whiteout conditions, Texas DOT spokesman Paul Braun said Monday morning. On its Facebook page, the weather service posted a video of the wind and snow whipping a U.S. flag outside its Amarillo office. ""If after watching the last video you thought you could still get out and travel, well you haven't seen anything yet!"" the Facebook post said. And later, it followed that up with another indication of how bad things were getting. ""Amarillo Airport just recorded a gust of 65knots/75mph! This is truly a historic blizzard!"" the second Facebook post said. ""Conditions have NOT improved. Please stay inside and do NOT venture out."" As of 4 p.m. (5 p.m. ET), 19 inches of snow had fallen in Amarillo -- an all-time single day record for February, the weather service said. Monday's accumulation also ranked as the second highest single-day snowfall accumulation ever recorded there, the agency said. For some, the service's warnings didn't come soon enough. Emergency crews were having trouble reaching drivers who were caught on the roads, Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Gabriel Medrano said. Cars were in ditches, he said, because drivers couldn't tell where road ended and ditch began. National Guard units were being sent to help stranded motorists, the Texas DOT said. CNN iReporter Jason Boyett in Amarillo posted a video showing near-whiteout conditions at 7:40 a.m., and followed that with another showing a drift nearly 3 feet high outside his front door. ""We get high winds and we get big snowstorms, but they're not often combined,"" Boyett said. Track the massive winter storm . Whiteouts were also reported in Oklahoma, where as of 10 a.m. Central time, the state had closed all highways in six counties -- Ellis, Harper, Woodward, Beaver, Texas and Cimarron -- until further notice. ""Roadways and ditches are snow packed with no visibility and are very slick and hazardous. All travel is discouraged,"" the Oklahoma Department of Transportation said. As much as 16 inches of snow could fall in western areas of the state, the weather service said. Oklahoma Lt. Gov. Todd Lamb declared a state of emergency for 56 of Oklahoma's 77 counties. Visibility was low in Fairview, Oklahoma, midway between the Panhandle and Oklahoma City, said CNN iReporter Brandi Whitacre. ""Right now it is snowing so heavily I can barely see down our driveway, which is 100 yards or so. It is coming down,"" said Whitacre, who added that'd she'd lost satellite TV service and was experiencing intermittent power outages. Are you there? Send stories and photos . The blizzard is the second major winter storm to hammer the region in a week. The number of people under blizzard and winter storm warnings, watches and advisories totaled 35 million, according to CNN's weather unit. Wichita schools were closed for the third straight school day as the new storm roared in on the heels of one that dumped up to 22 inches of snow on some areas late last week. Kansas' governor on Sunday extended a state of emergency declaration to include the new storm. Gov. Sam Brownback said Monday that one person had been killed in a single car accident in Sherman County. Officials blamed the fatal wreck on icy roads. The Kansas Department of Transportation reported that many highways in the central part of the state, including Interstate 70, were completely covered by snow and ice on Monday morning. All flights in and out of Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport in Texas were canceled until noon on Monday. Preston Smith International Airport in Lubbock was also closed, CNN affiliate KCBD reported, and Texas Tech University in Lubbock shut down on Monday because of the storm. While millions will see snow -- including Chicago, where 3 to 7 inches of snow and sleet are expected by Wednesday morning -- rain may rule for the next few days in parts of the Southeast. In Mobile, Alabama, on the Gulf Coast, residents prepared for the possibility of heavy rain and wind gusts as strong as 30 mph by Monday night. The rain is part of a band affecting several Southern states where tornado watches were in also effect Monday night.

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Francesco Schettino, the captain of the ill-fated Costa Concordia cruise liner, wants to get back on the ship. His lawyers Monday formally asked a panel of three judges for permission to tour the ship's bridge and engine room as part of a defense strategy that he says will prove that was not the only person responsible for the disaster. The liner, which crashed on the rocks off Giglio Island in January 2012, killing 32 people, was rotated back to vertical last Monday. The unprecedented maneuver, called parbuckling, exposed a twisted mass of metal, dotted with mattresses, passenger luggage and deck chairs on the ship's previously submerged starboard side. Now that the Concordia is upright, there can be further investigation of the captain's alleged mishandling of the ship. Read more: Concordia righted . Defense lawyers for Schettino agreed with lawyers representing more than 200 civil parties against the captain, including Giglio Island and several passenger and environmental advocacy groups, in asking for a new examination of the ship now that it is upright. Such an examination could include divers going deep into the belly of the vessel to examine whether watertight doors sealed properly, and whether automatic generators functioned. He also wants to walk the judges through the command bridge in a re-creation of the night of the crash. Half of the command bridge was submerged for 20 months. The trial began with preliminary hearings last March, but Monday was the first time the court heard any substantial evidence in the case. A panel of maritime experts addressed the role of the Indonesian helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin in the accident. Rusli Bin and four others were convicted in a plea deal in July for their role in the disaster. A Florence court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements. Led by Adm. Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the maritime experts, including professors, ship engineers and ship captains, presented their independent analysis and fielded questions from lawyers on a number of issues, including whether or not Rusli Bin's misunderstanding of Schettino's commands played any role in the accident. Interactive: Costa Concordia salvage attempt . According to recordings from the ship's bridge from the vessel's black box, Schettino had directed Rusli Bin to turn ""hard to starboard"" in English, but Rusli Bin can be heard asking ""hard to port?"" He then turned the ship right instead of left just 13 seconds before it hit the rocks. Dragone told the court that those 13 seconds made no difference, since it takes a lot longer than that to change a ship's course. ""The impact would have been the same,"" he said. Schettino, on the other hand, argues that the back half of the ship would not have hit the rocks at all if the helmsman had understood his directions clearly. The Concordia's bow skimmed safely past the rocks, but the port side of the stern clipped off a 96-ton chunk of an outcropping that was well marked on maritime maps. ""In that moment, I asked the helmsman to turn the ship left, and he made an error and did not, and instead turned hard to the right,"" Schettino told the court. ""If he had not made that error, and had not turned the wheel the wrong way, we would have avoided hitting the rocks."" 5 convicted over deadly wreck . But Schettino had been the one to order the Concordia to veer more than four miles off course in the first place to do a fly-by salute to a former sea captain who had retired on Giglio. The discussion of the day in court was essentially who made the second mistake. At one point, the trial was suspended while the three judges deliberated whether there were grounds to halt the trial altogether while an appellate court in Florence considers the validity of the plea bargains. The judge ruled that the two cases could go on in tandem without compromising justice. The trial is expected to last through the fall with a string of witnesses, including passengers, crew members and islanders, who say they saw the captain on shore looking for dry socks before all the passengers had been safely evacuated. Schettino is also expected to take the stand in his defense to explain his theory that he is a hero who saved the lives of more than 4,000 people, not a villain whose negligence led to the deaths of 32. No passengers died on impact. All of the 32 victims died during the evacuation, which makes Schettino's alleged errors fundamental in proving his guilt or innocence.

"Washington (CNN) -- Police in the nation's capital have arrested a woman in connection with the splattering of paint in two locations inside the National Cathedral, a Washington Metropolitan Police Department spokesman said. Jia Mei Tian, 58, was charged with defacing property. When officers arrested he on Monday, she had green paint on her clothes and shoes, and paint cans were found in three bags she had with her, according to a police report obtained by CNN. Officials said it was not clear whether the paint discovered Monday at the National Cathedral and on a statue outside the Smithsonian Castle was related to the incident last week at the Lincoln Memorial, though all three locations were marred with green paint. The arrest of the woman was related only to the National Cathedral incidents. The police report said that her clothes were sent to a forensics team to determine if the paint on them matches the paint at the other locations. A fourth landmark in Washington -- Luther Place Memorial Church -- was also found with green paint last week, but police did not link that incident to the others. Jack Reiffer, the parish administrator at the church, said the paint was splattered on a statue of the 16th century Protestant reformer Martin Luther. White paint mixed with feces was also found splattered on the front of the church's organ, and up onto the organ pipes and the chairs where the choir sits. Some of the mixture also got on the floor. At the cathedral, in Washington's Northwest quadrant, the paint was discovered splattered on an organ console and casework inside the historic Bethlehem Chapel, in the building's lower level. A spokesman said the paint was wet when it was discovered. Paint was also found in the Children's Chapel, in the cathedral's nave. The cathedral is a popular tourist destination. Five miles south, on the National Mall, green paint was discovered on the statue outside the Smithsonian Institution Building, known widely as the Castle. Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian's chief spokeswoman, said the statue is of Joseph Henry, the first secretary of the federally administered group of museums. St. Thomas said that the paint appeared similar to that found on the Lincoln Memorial and that the U.S. Park Police, which manage the National Mall, were determining whether the paint was the same. It wasn't immediately clear when the paint discovered at the Smithsonian Castle was found. St. Thomas said security guards first noticed it on Sunday afternoon, while Park Police Sgt. Paul Brooks said it was first reported Friday. CNN's Pamela Brown, Athena Jones, Carol Cratty, Dan Merica and Jonathan Helman contributed to this report.","Police say they're arrested a 58-year-old woman in the National Cathedral incident .

"(CNN) -- One of the most watched cases in China in the last few decades reached a conclusion of sorts on August 20th as Gu Kailai was declared guilty of murder and sentenced to death with a two-year suspension, meaning an almost certain commutation. The one-day trial of Gu on August 9th was, quite literally, a spectacle: something meant to be watched. (But not recorded, apparently, except by approval, even pencils were confiscated from the pre-selected audience.) Gu, the wife of the fallen high-ranking Chinese politician Bo Xilai, had been charged in the death of Neil Heywood, a British businessman. Gu confessed to poisoning Heywood, allegedly because he threatened her son following a botched business deal. The case has caught the attention of many because of the prominent status of the defendant and its steamy mix of allegations of murder, corruption, and even sex. But does it tell us anything new or interesting about the Chinese legal system? I think not. China's legal system is heavily politicized. The Communist Party controls key appointments through a nontransparent process. Judges have no security of tenure and can be dismissed at any time. Courts must answer to local governments, who hold the purse strings and pay judges' salaries. The court president, typically an official who hears no cases, can effectively dictate the decision in any case, whatever the judges who heard the case might think. And while there's no doubt that in many cases politicians don't interfere -- who has the time? -- the system as a whole does not give courts and judges the resources to resist orders from senior politicians when they do come. Few doubt that those orders have come in the Gu case, in all likelihood from the summit of political power in China, the Standing Committee of the Communist Party's Political Bureau. Before his fall, Gu's husband seemed headed for the Standing Committee himself. This makes the case too politically important to be left to chance, that is, to the whims of a judge deciding on the basis of evidence presented in court. Certain questions must be avoided: What did Bo Xilai know and when? Can powerful politicians in China cover up a murder? As for Gu's sentence, that too couldn't be left to chance. Bo Xilai may be in disgrace, but he was still a high flyer before his descent. The post-Mao leadership has established a solid tradition of not killing losers in political fights, and it's in the interest of everyone to extend that protection at least as far as spouses. Gu's suspended death sentence was widely predicted and comes as no surprise at all; such sentences are virtually always commuted to life imprisonment after two years, and can ultimately be reduced down to as little as fifteen years following commutation. Timeline: Bo Xilai's fall from grace . Given all of this, most China-watchers assume that proceedings in this case have been tightly controlled to ensure that only the officially approved narrative emerges. They assume that the verdict was decided in Beijing before the opening gavel sounded, and that the proceedings were merely a performance for the benefit of the public, a kind of judicial Shakespeare-in-the-park, but without the drama. That's the conventional wisdom. And at times like this, it's the job of the think-outside-the-box expert to explain why the conventional wisdom is wrong. But it's not. In fact, the trial is as predictable as it is banal. If anything is surprising, it's the degree to which it utterly fails to upset our assumptions about how Chinese politics and the legal system work. A criminal trial, for example, is normally at the place of the crime or where the defendant lives. But Gu's trial took place in Hefei. We all know the reason: too many possible sympathizers in Chongqing. The decision to have it in Hefei was political, not legal. Gu seems to have tried to hire a lawyer experienced in defending anti-corruption cases, as is her right under Chinese law. But one account of the trial says the government vetoed her choice, and she had to be represented by a local lawyer with no known experience in criminal law. Chinese law generally requires trials to be public, and the official report of the proceedings ritualistically invoked the term ""public trial"" to describe the proceedings. But they were in no sense public: the audience was carefully selected. The real lesson in this case, then, is twofold. First, it offers us no reason to change our understanding of the Chinese legal system as directly subservient to politics when sufficiently powerful politicians choose to get involved. Second, it reflects the cynicism that seems so pervasive in Chinese society. Nobody I know, Chinese or foreign, with the remotest knowledge of the Chinese legal system thinks that anything of importance will be decided as a result of what went on at the Gu trial. Those who were waiting for a sign of fundamental change in the system will have to keep waiting. Editor's Note: This op-ed has been updated to reflect news of the verdict of Gu Kailai. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donald Clarke.","Gu Kailai, wife of the disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai, is charged with murder .

"(CNN) -- Charmaine Jackson can tell you what she ate on any date for the past five years. She can tell you how much she exercised, what kind of mood she was in, how much water she drank -- even if she watched television while mindlessly munching away. All she has to do is flip through the pages of her 14 journals. The reason she began her daily record keeping was simple -- she wanted to lose weight and keep it off. It may sound extreme, but it paid off. Since she began keeping journals, Jackson is half the person she used to be -- going from 260 to 130 pounds. ""(Journaling has) really helped me get an idea of what my behaviors are, what my patterns are, how I can make change for myself for good,"" she said. ""You wouldn't see it unless you look at it over time and you really get a chance to see this worked and why."" 7 weight loss myths (sort of) debunked . 'It made me be honest with myself' Jackson, 53, who lives in suburban Atlanta, said she didn't pay much attention to her gradual weight gain over the years. ""I really didn't see it was sort of a mindless eating,"" she said. Stress from work factored in, she said, and she often had a quick bite whenever she had time. ""I'd make dinner and then after everything was done ... I would be by myself for a little bit and I'd have the TV (on) and I would just want to wind down,"" Jackson said. That's when she would start munching on chips or crackers. ""I wouldn't even know how much I was eating. It just went on. ... I just couldn't stop myself."" Sorority girl drops 107 pounds . Her breaking point came when she was laid off from her marketing job in 2007, she said. ""That really made me say, 'OK, I gotta do something about my weight, now's the chance,' "" she said. Jackson did what many people do -- she joined a gym. However, she found exercise alone was not enough, and she soon turned to record keeping. Despite holding bachelor's and master's degrees in nutrition, she had not been keeping track of her food and beverage intake. ""I felt very ashamed to say, 'I have the background and the knowledge, but yet here I am at 260 pounds,' "" she said. ""I was like the hairdresser who doesn't have good hair."" Journaling, however, turned out to be a game changer for Jackson. ""That's when the weight started to come off because I had already started exercising a little bit and that sort of triggered the whole exercise, eating, trying to sleep more ... trying not to stay up late and watch TV and really trying to track my moods,"" she said. She was able to identify when she was mad or sad, and wanting to eat more. ""It was my truth serum,"" Jackson said. ""It made me be honest with myself."" Other factors, not just calories . ""(She) is great proof of the benefits of self-monitoring in the weight loss and management process,"" said Dr. Jessica Bartfield, a bariatrician at Loyola University Health System who sees both surgical and nonsurgical patients battling their weight. Team loses 400 pounds for Winter Games . ""The easy answer to weight management is calories in, calories out,"" Bartfield said. ""But there's actually a lot of other factors that affect how much you're eating."" Bartfield said other factors include a person's hydration, sleep duration, sleep patterns and emotions. She asks many patients to rate their hunger and thirst while they are eating. ""(Journaling) helps them recognize where they might be missing out and skipping meals, or going too long in between meals and therefore leading to overeating at subsequent meals,"" she said. ""For example, it's a very common pattern that people tend to skip breakfast. They don't eat until lunchtime, and then they may overeat at that meal or overeat at dinner."" Bartfield added, ""Once you start writing that down -- what you're eating and the timing of the food -- you begin to pick up on some of these patterns that can be changed."" Studies in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Journal of Preventive Medicine also support the benefits of journaling, although weight loss in both studies was modest. However, Bartfield said modest weight loss is ""underappreciated."" ""A lot of patients that I see come in with very high weight loss expectations and very few people say that their goal is only 5% to 10% of their body weight,"" she said. ""Actually, that amount of weight loss has been shown very clearly to have considerable health benefits, including preventing future disease, reducing current diseases that are associated with obesity and helping patients decrease the number of medications they're on."" She added, ""That's actually my first goal for all patients -- modest weight loss, or simply 5% to 10% -- and I think that every pound counts."" Many times, Bartfield said, journaling is ""the No. 1 goal we start working on"" with patients. And the year's best overall diet is ... 'Road map' to success . An alternative to pen-and-paper journaling could be an application on your smartphone, said Marisa Moore, registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Either way, Moore said she thinks of a journal as a ""personal road map"" to weight loss, healthier eating and behavior change. ""Regardless of whether you're eating something healthy or not, you're forced to think about it. When we look at mindful eating practices, it's about being aware,"" she said. ""Using a food journal helps you to become more aware of what you're doing."" For Jackson, mindful eating practices are a way of life. ""It's saying, 'I owe this to myself.' I need to be responsible for me and take care of me, and that's something I never did,"" she said. She has no plans to stop journaling but said she may soon begin record keeping online. ""Now it's part of my daily habits, like brushing my teeth,"" she said. Do you have a weight loss story to share?

"(CNN) -- Former teen idol David Cassidy faces a drunken driving charge after his arrest early Wednesday in Schodack, New York, police said. Cassidy, 63, was given breath and field sobriety tests after he failed to dim his car's headlights at a police checkpoint, according to the police report. Word of the arrest surfaced on Twitter, starting with early tweets from local TV reporter Jessica Layton. He was arrested when he blew a .10 in the Breathalyzer device, the report said. The legal blood alcohol limit is .08. The former star of the TV series ""The Partridge Family"" was released on $2,500 bail and ordered to appear in court on September 6, the police report said. Cassidy, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, entered a no contest plea as a first-time offender in February 2011 to a drunken driving charge that followed a November 2010 arrest in Florida. He was sentenced to a year's probation and his driver's license was suspended for six months for that conviction. He also attended a DUI school, paid a $500 fine and served 50 hours of community service. On the TV series, Cassidy played the eldest of five children of a widowed mother (Shirley Jones, who was Cassidy's real-life stepmother). The family, all musicians, traveled to gigs in a repainted school bus. When the show was canceled after four seasons, Cassidy launched his own pop music career, filling concert halls with screaming teenage girls attracted to such hits as ""I Think I Love You."" A more recent acting job was on the 2009 ABC Family sitcom ""Ruby & the Rockits,"" in which Cassidy played an aging former teen heartthrob. The show was canceled after one season.

Johnny Galecki, who plays Leonard Hofstadter, arrived in full ""Star Wars"" regalia, and the iconic physicist Stephen Hawking recorded a video message that featured him singing the show's theme song.

"(CNN) -- In Masrakh, an impoverished village in India's northeastern Bihar state -- scenes of trauma, confusion, intense grief. Here, at the site of the school meal poisoning incident that has claimed 23 young lives and imperiled 25 others, thousands of people mill around, stunned, hungry for information. They listen to the procession of politicians that streams into the village to pay respects and make promises. But they cannot offer what these people want most: answers as to how the government-mandated free meals, meant to nourish the community's children, could instead have cost them their lives. India's school program: Ambitious, but far from perfect . Four burnt out police vehicles fringe the side of the road, a sign of the simmering anger felt towards authorities over the tragedy. Investigators had previously flagged issues with food safety at schools in the state, with one report in April from India's Ministry of Human Resource Development noting that school food ""was kept in open and dirty ground."" A fresh grave has been dug in front of the ramshackle, solitary classroom where 120 of the village's children were enrolled -- an unambiguous sign of protest over the incident. There are many others buried nearby. Above all this, the wails of grieving families pierce the air. Sarita Devi is inconsolable as she mourns the loss of her five-year-old daughter, Dipu. The wife of a migrant worker, Devi says her daughter had not wanted to go to school that day, and laments the fact she had even given her a paisa -- a sub-unit of India's rupee -- to attend. ""Why isn't anyone bringing Dipu back?"" she cries. Mom anguishes over child poisoned by lunch: Why aren't you coming back? Like many here, she has words of anger for the school's principal, who authorities say has absconded together with her husband, and whom they are seeking to interview. Devi's grief eventually overpowers her, and her body goes limp. This is a poor village, in one of India's poorest states. Locals live in simple dwellings made of clay. The school is the heart of the community, meaning that scarcely a family here has not been affected. Even the school's cook, Manju Devi, lost children to the tragedy; her husband, Lal Babu Rai, told a reporter from CNN-IBN, CNN's sister network, that two had died after eating the tainted food, while another remains in hospital. The settlement's solitary water pump is where locals say they were first alerted to the commotion following Tuesday's regular midday school meal. School children had congregated there to wash their plates after the regular daily meal of rice and potatoes. On this occasion, however, they began vomiting and collapsing. The children were rushed to the local medical facility, but they could do nothing for them. They were transferred on to a larger hospital at Patna, Bihar's capital, some four hours' drive away. In Patna, despite the distance, the incident is being keenly felt. The city has been rocked by violent protests over the deaths, and at Patna state government school on Friday, many children said they had been instructed by their parents not to eat any school meals, due to fears of further contamination. They need not worry. Many NGOs who deliver the meals to the schools have stopped providing them to some schools, out of fears of a backlash. While answers on the tragedy remain scant, one thing remains clear: it will be some time before any sense of normalcy returns to Bihar.","Masrakh village in India's Bihar state is in mourning after deaths of 23 children .

"(CNN) -- Since the U.N. Millennium Development Goals were launched in 2000, the world has made tremendous gains in reducing new HIV infections and helping people with HIV to live longer and healthier lives. For a long time, efforts to ensure that a pregnant woman living with HIV would not pass the virus to her child -- during pregnancy, at childbirth, or during breastfeeding -- have lagged behind the promise of technology. But now we can say confidently that with the right efforts, we can reduce new HIV infections among children to zero, even within the short time remaining until the Millennium Development Goals are concluded at the end of 2015. During the upcoming meeting of leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, the world's governments, NGOs and the private sector should take an important step toward reaching the goal of zero new HIV infections among children. This can be achieved by deploying a new generation of community health workers (CHWs) who will not only help to fight AIDS but also bring other kinds of health care to the communities they are serving. UNAIDS, Columbia University's Earth Institute, many businesses and NGOs have joined forces with African governments in the 1 Million Community Health Workers Campaign to deploy this large number of CHWs across Africa by the end of 2015. Although we've known for more than a decade that transmission of HIV from a pregnant woman to her child can be stopped through appropriate interventions -- including timely access to antiretroviral medicines -- the practical challenges to eliminating new infections are substantial. Most women in low-income countries give birth at home, without medical assistance, and usually without the benefit of prenatal care. One key to overcoming these challenges is to ensure that trained health care professionals are on hand to provide prenatal and delivery support, even in the poorest villages. The Millennium Villages Project and UNAIDS are doing just that by building a network of health workers, supported with training, new technology, a supply chain of antiretrovirals and other key inputs, and professional supervision at the level of clinics and hospitals. Today, teams of trained health workers across the Millennium Villages complement the nurses and midwives in a structured health care system that is providing pregnant women with not only services to prevent HIV transmission, but comprehensive services including prenatal care, counseling for HIV-positive women, access to antiretrovirals and professional follow-up care for newborns. The telecoms industry is also playing a new and historic role. In the Millennium Villages system, the health workers are equipped with smartphones. With better technology, community health workers are now accessing real-time emergency guidance, making calls for ambulances in emergencies, maintaining digital health records for each household and more. With community-based care, the CHWs are able to expand services to reach more women and newborns. For example, in the Millennium Village of Sauri in Kenya, nearly all pregnant women are receiving HIV counseling and testing, compared with fewer than half in 2008. Children who do become infected with HIV are diagnosed earlier and given timely access to HIV treatment, care and support. The community health workers are also playing a growing role in identifying bottlenecks and implementing solutions by engaging decision makers from local to national levels. Challenges such as low acceptance of HIV counseling and testing, commodity stock-outs and infant feeding issues are being identified and addressed with local responses. Next week as heads of state and global leaders gather at the United Nations, UNAIDS, the Millennium Villages Project and partners in the telecoms industry and beyond will seize the opportunity to make a push for zero new HIV infections among children, and for the 1 Million CHWs in Africa who can help make the goal a reality. On September 28, we will also join 60,000 people on the Great Lawn of New York's Central Park for Global Citizen Festival -- along with many millions more watching from around the world -- to issue a global appeal for these historic objectives. We believe that the world will rise to the occasion.

"(CNN) -- During the summer, southeastern Utah's high desert is like a furnace where the wind whips hot air over a seemingly endless expanse of arid terrain. Particles of sand erode and are re-deposited in new areas, collapsing old formations and slowly building sedimentary rock that will hold up new ones. The flora and fauna that live amidst those gusts are some of Mother Nature's toughest and most resourceful creations, enduring months without a drop of rain and withstanding desert heat and sub-freezing temperatures. Arches National Park is home to this wildlife as well as the world's highest concentration of natural sandstone arches. From the largest, Landscape Arch, to the tallest, Double Arch South, the park's 119 square miles are one of the most unique places on earth. Park stats: The visitor count at Arches has steadily increased since 2004. The park drew more than one million guests last year and has averaged that many since 2008. The location: Arches National Park is located in southeast Utah, about five miles north of Moab. There are airports in Moab, Salt Lake City, about four hours away and Grand Junction, Colorado, about two hours away. If you go: Park admission is $10 per vehicle. Individual admission is $5. Admission is valid for seven days. Park passports are $25 and provide entry to Arches, Canyonlands National Park, Hovenweep National Monument and Natural Bridges National Monument. They are valid for one year. The visitor center is open every day except Christmas, but be sure to check the website as hours change according to the season. Meet our ranger: Kait Thomas, an interpretive ranger at Arches National Park, grew up in Monrovia, Indiana. When she was 11, her dad started taking her on annual vacations to national parks in the western United States. The experience had a profound effect on her, she says. ""I knew I wanted to move west,"" says Thomas, 25. ""I wanted to be a part of the beauty that you find in national parks."" But Thomas, 25, became a pre-law student when she moved to Salt Lake City for college. On the way back to school after a 2008 summer internship working for a political campaign, she had her ""Aha!"" moment, realizing she completed the dream to move west, but not the one to work for the national park service. ""I just waltzed in to Arches National Park visitor center and asked if they needed help,"" she says. At first, the answer was ""No, thanks."" But Thomas says a combination of her stubbornness and a supervisor's willingness to listen during a 45-minute impromptu meeting led to her volunteering for six weeks in 2008. In 2009, the supervisor invited her to become a seasonal ranger. In 2010 Thomas became a full-time ranger. ""It really is the first part of the country that I fell in love with,"" she says. ""There is something about the desert and how hostile, dramatic and colorful it is. You have this contrast of something that is incredibly harsh yet unbelievably delicate."" For a day trip don't miss: The Windows trail hike. Thomas says the area has the highest concentration of arches in the park, including five that range from 60 to 100 feet high. ""It's a nice summary of the park,"" she says. ""It's the most bang for the buck, if you will."" Favorite less-traveled spot: Hiking to Tower Arch from Klondike Bluff. Thomas says reaching Klondike Bluff requires driving on a dirt road that will not support RVs or buses. It's about 3.5 miles from Klondike Bluff to tower Arch, she says. ""It's a great place to escape all the hustle and bustle you find everywhere else in the park,"" she says. Favorite spot to view wildlife: Courthouse Wash. Thomas says hot summer temperatures make seeing wildlife difficult. But you can see mule deer, coyotes and bobcats at Courthouse Wash as well as big horn sheep near the visitor center from October through December. Most magical moment in the park: Having lunch in the shade of Wall Arch the day before it collapsed in August of 2008. Thomas said she was patrolling Devil's Garden Trail when the temperature hit 105, and she stopped at Wall Arch to rest and eat. The next day a group of tourists came into the visitor center and wanted to know why the trail was blocked. Thomas and other rangers went to investigate and discovered the arch had collapsed. ""I realized geology is always happening,"" she says. ""One sand of grain could have fallen and the whole thing pops and collapses. We don't have any answers as to when (the arches will fall) but that is why it is so special to be here now."" Funniest moment in the park: Discovering that five members of a NorteÃ±o band, dressed in full concert costume, had lugged their instruments three miles to Delicate Arch and began belting out tunes under its shade. (NorteÃ±o music generally comes from northern Mexico and Texas. It features an accordion that produces musical rhythms similar to polkas.) ""We informed them they needed a permit (to play inside the park),"" she says. Oddest moment at the park: An excited family asking her to identify 10 species of lizards they captured, put in a black box and had planned to take home. ""I identified all their lizards and promptly made them put them back,"" she says. It's illegal to remove wildlife from national parks. A ranger's request: Stay on the trails and off the arches. The land off the trails is home to biological earth crust which protects against erosion and takes decades to rejuvenate after being stepped on. The arches are all made of red sandstone, a mixture of quartz, feldspar and iron oxide. While they may look sturdy, they could collapse if you climb on them. Carry more water than you think you need. Thomas says heat-related illnesses are the No.1 medical issue at the park. She recommends you drink a minimum of one gallon of water per day and carry salty snacks to maintain electrolyte levels. Also, be sure to shake out your shoes before putting them on. That's because scorpions gravitate toward dark, cool spaces. If you see a rattlesnake on the trail, do not chase it. Thomas says the majority of rattlesnake bites that happen in the park are on peoples' hands. Another park she'd like to visit: Denali National Park in Alaska. ""I've never been to Alaska and I want to see really raw, big mountains,"" Thomas says. ""I'm always into the biggest and the best. I want to see something that is more primitive than anything else we have (here)."" What national park would you like to visit? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below.","The park is home to more than 2,000 sandstone arches .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of armed militants killed 13 bus passengers in Pakistan's militancy-hit Balochistan province during a pre-dawn attack Tuesday. More than 24 militants opened fire at two buses, forcing them to stop in Bolan district of Balochistan, police official Zubair Ahmed said. Ahmed said the militants took 13 of the passengers to the nearby mountains. Police later found the victims' bodies. ""They had killed them one by one,""Ahmed said. He said the dead passengers included two security personnel. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. In the past, Balochistan separatists had killed laborers and passengers in the same area. He said the buses were headed from the province's capital, Quetta, to the Punjab region when they were attacked. Militants strike oil tankers . Elsewhere in Balochistan province, armed militants dressed in police uniforms attacked two oil tankers Monday night. The tankers were carrying fuel for local security forces in the Mach area of Bolan district. Senior administration official Kashif Nabi said militants killed a security guard and injured another. The guards were protecting the oil tankers. Nabi said the attack partially damaged a tanker, and the attack was followed by a heavy exchange of gunfire between militants and security forces in the area.","Dozens of militants open fire on two buses, police say .

"(CNN) -- Yes --- Marissa Mayer posed for Vogue. Her skin is creamy, her hair perfect. She looks gorgeous. It's not surprising; it's Vogue. It's also not surprising that the conversation about Mayer's Vogue piece -- the first major profile she agreed to since becoming CEO of Yahoo -- has remained squarely focused on how she looks in the accompanying photograph. Most criticisms, my own included, have examined Mayer's role in this: At a time when women in the workplace desperately need role models, why did she allow herself to be depicted in a manner so far removed from most women's realities? On CNN.com, Pepper Schwartz writes that ""a significant number of women ... were less than thrilled at the idea of one of the few women of real power still needing the affirmation of a Vogue fashion shoot,"" and ""here's a woman who has made it to the top because of her brains, does she still need to self-validate by having a beautiful fashion gig?"" But what's so inexcusable about a woman wanting to look her best? How is it self-validating to let a respectable magazine profile you in the way they know how? Or is the issue more about the audacity of a powerful woman sitting for a portrait that might be -- gasp -- flattering? The truth is that we can't blame Mayer, or Vogue, for society's obsession with, and response to, appearance. Women, especially women who happen to be both beautiful and brilliant like Mayer, are very often reduced to, or at least measured by, their looks. This was a reality before Mayer's Vogue spread, and it will be a reality after. The debate over Mayer's culpability in agreeing to be sexed up for a fashion magazine implies that she has some power over the fact, some ability to change the truth, that looks matter, and that pretty people succeed more. Because they do, with or without the ""affirmation of a Vogue fashion shoot."" According to a 2007 paper from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, overweight and obese white women face a significant ""wage penalty."" According to research by Daniel Hamermesh, author of ""Beauty Pays: Why Attractive People are More Successful,"" the top one-third of attractive females earn about 10% more annually than those in the bottom sixth of the genetic pool. And in her groundbreaking 1999 book, ""Survival of the Prettiest,"" Harvard Medical School psychologist Nancy Etcoff argues that good-looking people get better jobs, are better paid, and have an easier time in life. The evidence is in: Evolutionarily speaking, pretty people win. Mayer's looks likely helped her get ahead in some manner throughout her career; as such, it's unreasonable to expect that she'd do anything but agree to play them up for a national audience. For women, who are faced with any number of disadvantages in the workplace, why not use what you can? That's not to say Mayer isn't brilliant or hardworking; it's not an either/or in business or in life. But it's unrealistic, and unfair, to expect that Mayer wouldn't sit for a photo that wasn't expected to turn out at least somewhat flattering. That's not self-validation, or even narcissism. It's nothing more than completely human. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Peggy Drexler: Talk of Marissa Mayer's Vogue piece focused on her appearance .

"(CNN) -- Why does the use of chemical weapons justify international retribution with military force, in a way that two years of brutal repression with tanks and planes does not? And where in international law is the legal ""cover"" for such action? If the Obama administration is planning for limited military strikes against Syria to hold the regime ""accountable"" -- in the words of senior officials -- for using chemical weapons, it is probably drafting some answers to those questions. The president put it like this in his CNN interview last week: ""If the U.S. goes in and attacks another country without a U.N. mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented, then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it, do we have the coalition to make it work?"" Forcibly intervening for humanitarian reasons, to protect innocents from appalling suffering, is a noble concept, one that would draw on the moral outrage felt around the world. The thrust of President Obama's argument has always been humanitarian: that using chemical weapons, which are horrendous and indiscriminate by nature, would cross a ""red line."" Who wants what after chemical weapons horror . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry amplified the argument Monday when he said, ""President Obama believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world's most heinous weapons against the world's most vulnerable people."" In other words, the ""strictly legal"" should not be allowed to cancel out a legitimate and necessary course of action, even if international law provides no clear support for intervention on humanitarian grounds. France, the UK, Turkey and Germany have all signaled support for such an approach. ""The international community must act should the use of such weapons be confirmed,"" says German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. But in this instance, the international community is likely to mean NATO, not the United Nations, and that would carry much less weight in international law. Missile strikes on Syria likely response to chemical attack . Pre-emptive force to protect U.S. allies . Ashley Deeks, who worked in the Legal Adviser's Office at the State Department for a decade, wrote on the Lawfare blog that the U.S. ""might believe that a Syrian use of chemical weapons is likely to affect neighboring (and friendly) states such as Turkey and Jordan,"" depending on where they were used. Daniel Bethlehem, who held a similar position at the UK Foreign Office, adds that the request by Turkey for Patriot missile batteries last year ""suggests the possibility of a collective self-defence rationale for military intervention to address such a threat."" This argument for ""anticipatory"" self-defense, to take out something before it is used against you or your allies, is gaining favor in light of the nuclear programs being developed by Iran and North Korea and the unpredictable nature of the global terrorist threat. After 9/11, the Bush administration fashioned a national security strategy that included and justified the use of pre-emptive force. ""We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the United States and our allies and friends,"" the 2002 document said. Obama hinted at this argument in an interview with CNN last week. ""When you start seeing chemical weapons used on a large scale ... that starts getting to some core national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region."" Intervening in Middle East turmoil: Mission impossible? Intervening in Kosovo . Some observers have invoked the precedent of NATO's 78 days of bombardment against Serbian forces in Kosovo and in Serbia in 1999. The alliance argued that as a regional grouping, it had the right to intervene in Kosovo to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and protect the stability of Serbia's neighbors. ""We cannot stand by and let the Serbs crack down again on the Kosovar Albanians,"" said then-U.S. State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin. ""We believe that is a substantial and legitimate grounds for action internationally."" Even so, U.S. and NATO officials, from then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright down, argued later that Kosovo should not be seen as a precedent. The U.S. State Department's legal adviser at the time, Michael Mathison, talked about a ""unique combination of a number of factors"" and insisted the U.S. and its allies did not see humanitarian intervention as the legal basis for the Kosovo campaign. In the case of Syria, neither the United Nations charter nor the Security Council is likely to offer much cover for intervention. The charter forbids the ""use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state"" but allows for the use of force in self-defense. Article 51 reads, in part: ""Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations."" This would be known -- in U.N. parlance -- as a Chapter VII resolution, and was the basis for intervention in the Korean War and after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. It was also used, more controversially, to sanction military intervention in Libya in 2011 as it appeared Benghazi was on the verge of a bloodbath. UN Security Council Resolution 1973 authorized member states ""to take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack"" in Libya. But it seems very unlikely that the United States and other like-minded governments could convince Russia and China that Chapter VII applies in the case of Syria. Both Moscow and Beijing were angered that the resolution that green-lit the intervention in Libya in 2011 -- enforcing a no-fly zone on humanitarian grounds -- fast became the fig leaf for a campaign to remove Moammar Gadhafi. They have no intention of issuing another carte blanche. 'Red line' debate: Are chemical weapons in Syria worse than attacks? Geneva Gas Protocol . Specifically on the use of chemical weapons, there is the 1925 Geneva Gas Protocol, drawn up after mustard and other asphyxiating gas attacks in the trenches during World War I. Syria is a party to the protocol, so it is bound not to use chemical weapons in war. Open to argument is whether ""war"" includes internal conflict, but there is a growing body of international law that suggests it does. The statute of the International Criminal Court recognizes conflicts ""that take place in the territory of a State when there is protracted armed conflict between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups."" And the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia held that ""there undisputedly emerged a general consensus in the international community on the principle that the use of (chemical) weapons is also prohibited in internal armed conflicts."" After two years of carnage in Syria, there is a lively debate under way about whether the use of chemical weapons is a game changer. As Max Fisher put it in The Washington Post in April, ""It's more than just Syria: it's about every war that comes after, about what kind of warfare the world is willing to allow, about preserving the small but crucial gains we've made over the last century in constraining warfare in its most terrible forms."" White House spokesman Jay Carney stressed ""this specific violation of international norms"" on Monday. Not everyone agrees. ""Why should the U.S. be willing to intervene if chemical weapons kill 1,000 civilians, but not if ordinary weapons kill tens of thousands?"" Kevin Jon Heller asked Tuesday on the blog Opinio Juris. Gingrich: Stay out of Syria's civil war . Selective U.S. intervention . And history shows the U.S. has been selective in intervening, or even condemning, previous use of chemical weapons. Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons not only against the Kurdish civilians of Halabja in 1988 but frequently as a weapon of war against Iranian troops. And the United States, according to a well-sourced article in ""Foreign Policy"" this week, was complicit in those attacks. ""The Iraqis never told us that they intended to use nerve gas. They didn't have to. We already knew,"" said Rick Francona, who was the U.S. military attache in Baghdad in 1988. Anxious that Iranian troops were about to make a strategic breakthrough, ""U.S. intelligence officials conveyed the location of the Iranian troops to Iraq, fully aware that Hussein's military would attack with chemical weapons, including sarin, a lethal nerve agent,"" wrote Shane Harris and Matthew Aid in ""Foreign Policy."" And they cite a top-secret document drawn up at the CIA at the time. ""If the Iraqis produce or acquire large new supplies of mustard agent, they almost certainly would use it against Iranian troops and towns near the border."" Finally, there is the U.S. Constitution, which holds that only Congress can declare war and only Congress can appropriate the funds to wage war. The last time such niceties were observed was for America's entrance into World War II. The 1973 War Powers Act requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of launching military action and bars U.S. armed forces from fighting for more than 60 days without congressional approval. That may be 58 days longer than any action against Syria. When the Libya campaign began, Obama simply informed Congress that it was ""to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and address the threat posed to international peace and security by the crisis in Libya."" An attempt by Rep. Denis Kucinich, D-Ohio, to invoke the War Powers Act went nowhere. When it comes to punishing the Syrian regime -- if it is proved to have used chemical weapons -- arguments over what is legal or legitimate recall a famous passage from ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" ""When I use a word,"" Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, ""it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less."" ""The question is,"" said Alice, ""whether you can make words mean so many different things.""","President has said that Syria's use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line""
Administration might be asking: What justifies military action, and where's legal cover for it?
International law provides no clear support for intervention on humanitarian grounds .
Syria is bound by the Geneva Gas Protocol, but does that cover internal conflict?"
"(CNN)  -- Hurricane Felicia weakened Friday as it headed toward Hawaii and may continue to wane, but forecasters have not discounted the threat of flooding on the island chain. Hurricane Felicia is expected to reach Hawaii by Monday and continue to weaken on its way. The storm was downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane as it moved west-northwest toward Hilo, Hawaii, at 13 mph (20 kmh). Felicia's maximum sustained winds slowed from 140 mph (220 kmh) Thursday to near 100 mph (185 kmh) as of 8 a.m. PT Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. Felicia is expected to weaken further as it moves over cooler waters, according to the hurricane center. Felicia could reach Hawaii by Monday, but by that time it may have weakened to a tropical depression or tropical storm, said meteorologist Derek Wroe at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu, Hawaii.  See hurricane ratings, what they mean, and how to keep safe » . Even if the storm does not hit Hawaii as a hurricane, it can still cause flooding damage, Wroe said. ""[Storms and depressions] bring a lot of moisture with them and the wind may not be as strong when it comes in with a depression, but a depression is sometimes just as capable as bringing in flooding as a tropical storm,"" Wroe said. Felicia is about 1,280 miles east (2,060 kilometers) of the Big Island, according to the weather service. Wroe expects the hurricane to continue westward after it strikes Hawaii, bringing rain to one or more of the islands for a day or part of a day as it moves along, he said. If the hurricane sweeps through each island, it could take a couple of days before Hawaii is in the clear, he said.","NEW: Hurricane Felicia, now Category 2,  likely to keep weakening .

"(CNN) -- The Georgia-Russia conflict has given the presidential candidates the chance to put their foreign policy credentials to the test. Sen. John McCain speaks about the situation in Georgia as he campaigns in Pennsylvania. With Sen. Barack Obama out of camera range for the most part, Sen. John McCain is jumping on the opportunity to make a distinction between himself and Obama on the issue. Obama is vacationing in Hawaii, but his campaign says he is being briefed on the situation and he made a statement Monday. McCain, who is hitting the trail in Pennsylvania, has been aggressively condemning Russia's actions. Tensions between Georgia and the breakaway republic of South Ossetia came to a head August 8 after Russia responded militarily to a Georgian offensive on South Ossetia. Georgia's parliament declared a ""state of war"" with Russia the next day. World powers Monday urged Russia to ""stand down,"" respect Georgia's sovereignty and allow the international community to intervene in the crisis. The efforts mark an attempt to prevent a war between Moscow and the former Soviet republic. South Ossetia is a pro-Russian enclave of Georgia that has sought independence for years, and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has supported the region's local government. With Obama largely out of the news cycle this week, McCain has used the political vacuum to polish his foreign policy credentials. ""Russian President [Dmitry] Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin must understand the severe, long-term negative consequences that their government's actions will have for Russia's relationship with the U.S. and Europe,"" he said Monday, the latest in his harsh words for Russia. He urged the U.N. Security Council to condemn the violence, even with the threat of a Russian veto. Russia's actions, he said, must be submitted to ""the court of world opinion."" Obama later Monday read a statement on camera in which he seemed to come closer to McCain's position, saying Russia's invasion was a ""turning point"" in its relationship with the West. ""Let me be clear: We seek a future of cooperative engagement with the Russian government, and friendship with the Russian people,"" Obama said. ""We want Russia to play its rightful role as a great nation -- but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century, not regression to the conflicts of the past."" When news broke of the outbreak of violence Friday, both candidates were quick to respond, but McCain was the only one to assign blame to Russia for the escalating hostilities.  Watch Obama condemn Russia » . ""Russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign Georgian territory,"" McCain said in a statement to reporters shortly after his campaign plane landed in Iowa. In a statement sent to reporters Friday, Obama called for an end to the violence, but stopped short of assigning blame, or making strong demands on Moscow. ""I strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in Georgia, and urge an immediate end to armed conflict,"" he said. ""Now is the time for Georgia and Russia to show restraint, and to avoid an escalation to full scale war. Georgia's territorial integrity must be respected. All sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in Georgia, and the United States, the United Nations Security Council, and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis."" On Saturday, both candidates spoke with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili. Obama toughened his talk, this time laying the blame on Russia.  Watch Obama express concern for Georgia » . ""I condemn Russia's aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire,"" he said. ""Russia must stop its bombing campaign, cease flights of Russian aircraft in Georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from Georgia."" Obama and McCain take markedly different approaches to foreign policy. McCain has talked about creating a new G-8, the group of the richest countries in the world, that would expel Russia. McCain said he wants to ensure that ""the Group of Eight highly industrialized states becomes again a club of leading market democracies."" Asked about McCain's proposal, Obama last month said ""it would be a mistake."" Obama said ""it is always in our interests to engage, to listen, to build alliances --- to understand what our interests are and to be fierce in protecting those interests."" McCain, a senator from Arizona, has tried to paint the senator from Illinois as naive on foreign policy and has faulted Obama for his willingness to talk with rogue leaders without preconditions. McCain is known for his pointed words toward Putin. He's told audiences that when he looks into Putin's eyes he ""sees three letters: KGB,"" referring to the former Soviet spy agency. McCain's latest offensive harkens back to Sen. Hillary Clinton's ""3 a.m."" ad. The former Democratic contender ran the ad during the primaries to suggest Obama was not up to the job when it comes to handling crises. The ad did not work for Clinton, but the McCain campaign thinks the issue may resonate more in the general election with voters concerned about security. CNN's Peter Hamby and Ed Henry contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama calls Russia's invasion ""turning point"" in relationship with West .

"(CNN) -- In August Facebook revealed that its new headquarters in California, designed by Frank Gehry, will be, according to company founder Mark Zuckerberg, ""the largest open floor plan in the world"". Over 3,000 people will work on moveable furniture in a space that stretches over 10 acres. But are open plan offices better suited to the machinations of architects and needs of a company rather than to employees? Open plan offices came out of a drastic rethinking of architecture, by mid-20th century proponents like Frank Lloyd Wright (who thought walls were ""fascist"") and Frank Duffy. In the 1960s, Robert Propst, a designer for Herman Miller, noticed people had their best ideas or did their best thinking when they left their desks. His Action Office furniture, released in 1968, introduced cubicles to the world, in an attempt to revitalize a landscape that Propst had described as ""the daily scene of unfulfilled intentions and failed effort."" Research by MIT professor Thomas Allen in 2006 discovered that people communicate the most with those in a 50 meter radius, and that complex topics are best discussed face to face. But there are problems with open plan offices. According to a study by Berkeley researchers conducted over a decade, most workers find ""speech privacy"" the biggest problem. As a result some suggest that rather than foster more useful conversations they may actually inhibit them. A 2000 study by Dana Johnson and Gary Evans suggested that the constant distraction of colleagues' noise dampens employees' motivation. Even Propst revised his initial thoughts on cubicles. In a 1998 he said ""crass people"" had managed to use his idea to ""create hellholes"". ""They make little bitty cubicles and stuff people in them. Barren, rat-hole places,"" he told Metropolis magazine. Yet just as it did for an expanding postwar workforce, today, adjustable workspaces make economic sense and account for much of their enduring popularity. ""You can put more people together in the same space and fill it up without separating walls,"" says Karsten Ifversen, architecture editor for Danish newspaper Politiken. He adds that open plan designs also allow more light into deep buildings, and are cheaper to heat. 10 technologies that will change your workplace . ""For employers, it's very easy to rearrange the workstations to account for changing needs. It is especially well suited for temporary types of work. You easily share information using an open space -- you get to know what's going on, if you're working on the same project,"" he says. ""The client likes to build them that way, and the architects like to draw them because you can get more dramatic spaces when you're operating with one big scale instead of having to make a lot of repetition of small spaces"". In some ways, an open plan makes an organization transparent to itself. You can see your colleagues, and they can see you. ""That is quite important, to feel some kind of unity,"" says Ifversen. ""You're part of something bigger than yourself when you're working in the open space."" However Ifversen believes that open plan offices suit managers better than employees, and suggests that the problem of noise spillage goes deeper than merely finding it difficult to concentrate. ""Most people feel stressed when they first move to an open space. You don't have a private sphere anymore, so you can't personalize your workdesk in the same way. You're deprived of your individuality."" Are cool offices the key to success? When employees moved into Unilever's new headquarters in Hamburg, Ifversen says, ""they had three psychologists working full time for them, just to accommodate the problems around the new office."" Ifversen notes that (not unlike Facebook's influence on society), open plan ""changes the balance between private and public"". ""It's okay to watch YouTube clips or read irrelevant pages out in public,"" he says. ""All these human inclinations, there's no need to hide them. We accept it."" But for other human inclinations -- such as the inclination to fight -- private space is still a necessity, says Ifversen. ""You have to have a room where you can go and have an argument without everybody listening in. It's a problem if a building can't accommodate that."" 8 ways to make your office life better . Like Propst, he believes workspaces should encourage creative thought, but he believes this is being addressed in a patronizing way -- ""they have all these entertaining rooms, with perhaps a playground."" A more important consideration is to make employees feel important, ""to somehow empower the employee so they feel that they are necessary for the product."" Ifversen believes an open plan office ""sends a signal that you are interchangeable"", and argues that, if employees don't have dedicated spaces they can personalize, they are more likely to feel that their job is temporary. ""I think that is kind of a sad development.""","Facebook plans to build world's largest open plan office .

"(CNN) -- Half a century ago, with the space race in full swing, the heated quest for interplanetary exploration between the Earth's superpowers gained a new, self-proclaimed, contender. ""We're going to Mars!"" audaciously declared Zambian schoolteacher Edward Makuka Nkoloso in a 1964 newspaper op-ed, revealing to the world his fanciful plans for his country to beat the United States and the Soviet Union in their fierce battle to conquer outer space. ""Our rocket crew is ready,"" continued Nkoloso, explaining that his aspiring troupe of space explorers had been gearing up for their interstellar journey in the headquarters of the academy he'd set up on the outskirts of Zambian capital Lusaka. From within what he called the ""Academy of Sciences and Space Technology,"" Nkoloso said, he'd been studying Mars through telescopes. He'd also been training his would-be astronauts by rolling them down a hill in oil drums, a technique aimed at getting his team acclimatized to the weightlessness experienced during space travel. Read this: Nigerian doctor takes to the skies . ""Specially trained spacegirl Matha Mwambwa, two cats (also specially trained) and a missionary will be launched in our first rocket,"" wrote Nkoloso, a grade-school science teacher and self-appointed director of the space academy. Unsurprisingly, the program, which was never taken seriously by the government of the newly independent Zambia, failed to take off; a $7 million grant Nkoloso said he'd requested from UNESCO never came, whilst the pregnancy of the 17-year-old spacegirl brought the proceedings to an end. ""The Afronauts"" Fast forward to 2010, when Spanish photographer Cristina De Middel was searching for ""unbelievable stories"" for a new personal project she was hoping to develop. Whilst scouring the depths of the internet, she stumbled on a website listing the 10 craziest experiments in history. ""The first one on the list was the Zambia space program,"" says De Middel who, after a decade of working as a news photojournalist, had decided to embark on a new career as a visual storyteller. Fascinated by Nkoloso's visionary and dreamy perspective on life, De Middel set about creating an imaginary documentation of his elusive endeavors some 50 years ago. The result is ""The Afronauts,"" an arresting photo book that has been shortlisted for this year's esteemed Deutsche Börse Photography Prize. In the self-published book, De Middel self-consciously conjures up the story of the unofficial space program piece by piece. She uses a series of cinematographic images, including staged depictions of discarded oil barrels, makeshift spaceships, elephant-hugging spacemen and flying cats, as well as vintage-looking maps, documents and newspapers cuttings. Throughout, facts and fiction are intertwined as part of an intriguing narrative which challenges viewers' perceptions about what's real and what's not. ""I was working in a very free way,"" says De Middel, sitting at the café of the Photographer's Gallery in London, where The Afronauts is being exhibited. ""I needed to add mystery; I needed to add this fascination for great things and work on the photographic language that would not state if it's true,"" adds De Middel, encouraging viewers to question the documentary value of photography. ""Otherwise, I would have ruined the game."" ""Big dreams"" Whilst playful, De Middel's dream-like images are not intended to make fun of Nkoloso's fantastical, yet high-flying, ambitions. Her speculative pictures exude a feeling of nostalgia and sympathy, celebrating the audacious and naive spirit of a past era where grandiose dreams were not limited by circumstances. ""I think that's the greatest characteristic we have as humans, that we can dream of becoming big,"" says De Middel. Read this: Artist's spectacular glasses . ""That is something common to all humanity,"" she adds. ""You don't have to be American and work for NASA to dream of going to the moon; you can be an African -- he [Nkoloso] was a school teacher and thought that could be done."" ""Honest approach"" Creating The Afronauts, which was sold out in just a few months, De Middel worked more as a movie director, trying to make the best of the resources around her. For models, she relied on social media and friends; for the astronauts' helmets, she used old domes of street lights; and for the flashy spacesuits, she employed the sewing talents of her grandmother. ""It was like a short, small and very modest movie production,"" says De Middel. ""But instead of producing a moving image, I just did stills."" Most of the images were shot in between different projects, in locations such as Spain, the Palestinian territories, Italy and Romania. Others were repurposed pictures from the photographer's archive. De Middel, who's never been to Zambia, acknowledges she's not ""an expert in Africa"" -- nor in space. This led her to go about the story with caution. ""I always kept in my mind that I don't know a lot about African history and I am approaching a subject that can be sensitive or can be offensive for some people,"" says De Middel. So far, she says, her work has received a great response from people in Africa. She's been contacted by Nigeria's space program and been invited to the continent to give talks, while her book is being shown in South Africa and Senegal. ""I would love to [take the exhibition to Lusaka as well],"" she says. If anything, De Middel says, the extraordinary tale of the forgotten Zambian space program presented a chance to talk about Africa from a different perspective. ""The only honest approach I could do to that story was documenting my cliché, and that's what I really wanted to do, because, in a way, I was raising awareness of the existence of that cliché and what we expect from Africa,"" she says.

""Not only because the story is positive, in terms of African people having dreams, but also evidencing what we expect from Africa in terms of aesthetics and behavior."" Today, nobody seems to know what happened to Nkoloso or his cast of wannabe space explorers. Yet Nkoloso's desire to dream the impossible has found a new, alternative, home inside De Middel's images, striking a chord with captivated audiences around the world. ""He had a fascination for the universe that we all share,"" says De Middel. ""Asking if we're alone, looking at the stars, making metaphysical questions. That is a universal feeling and it doesn't belong to the people who can actually have the technology to go to the moon; it's everywhere.""","In the mid-1960s, a Zambian school teacher wanted to send the first African to space .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian Foreign Ministry said Monday the country has chemical or biological weapons, but would never use them against its citizens -- only against foreign attackers. ""Any stocks of (weapons of mass destruction) or any unconventional weapon that the Syrian Arab Republic possesses would never be used against civilians or against the Syrian people during this crisis at any circumstance, no matter how the crisis would evolve,"" ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi told reporters. ""All the stocks of these weapons that the Syrian Arab Republic possesses are monitored and guarded by the Syrian army. These weapons are meant to be used only and strictly in the event of external aggression against the Syrian Arab Republic,"" he said Monday. The United States called for Syria to never use the weapons and keep them safely stored. ""I think we've been absolutely clear where we stand on this issue, which is that any possible use of these kinds of weapons will be completely unacceptable,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. ""Any talk about any use of any kind of a weapon like that in this situation is horrific and chilling. The Syrian regime has a responsibility to the world, has a responsibility first and foremost to its own citizens to protect and safeguard those weapons."" Makdissi's remarks come after months of international chatter about whether foreign countries should intervene militarily to try to end more than a year of bloodshed in Syria. Another 175 people were killed around the country Monday, 90 of them in and around Damascus, opposition groups reported. The dead included 25 people whose bodies were found in the Damascus neighborhood of al-Berzeh, the scene of heavy fighting between rebel forces and government troops, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. Another 24 bodies were found in the suburbs of the capital, the group said. The LCCC and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said several inmates were killed at a prison in Aleppo as guards tried to put down a days-old protest there. The LCC said nine prisoners were killed, while the London-based Syrian Observatory said 7 were killed and 16 wounded. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of violence because the government restricts access by foreign journalists. Meanwhile, the Arab League will offer Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ""a safe exit"" if he resigns quickly and leaves the country, a senior Arab League official said, marking the latest attempt to get Syria's longtime ruler to step down. The official provided no further details because the source is not authorized to speak to the media. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani did not discuss an exit plan when speaking with reporters after the Sunday meeting, but confirmed ""there is an agreement on the need for the swift resignation"" of al-Assad. ""We call on the opposition and the Free Syrian Army to form a government of national unity,"" Sheikh Hamad said. Despite the Arab League's proposal, the brutal violence has not let up. At least 30 people were killed Monday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. See images of the showdown in Syria . The Arab League would not be the first to offer an outlet for al-Assad. Tunisia -- the cradle of the Arab Spring uprisings and the first country last year to oust its longtime ruler -- offered asylum to the Syrian president in February in an attempt to spare further bloodshed. And the daughter of Qatar's emir has suggested exile in Doha, according to a cache of e-mails leaked to CNN earlier this year. If al-Assad were to leave, he would follow a series of longtime rulers in the region who have succumbed to popular revolts since last year, including former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, deposed Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who stepped down in a transfer-of-power deal. Rime Allaf, an associate fellow at the Chatham House in London, said she thinks Syrians opposed to al-Assad are split on the notion of a ""safe exit"" for the president. ""Some may want a way to save as many lives as possible, so if he leaves without prosecution, then so be it, as they think the matter of most urgency now is saving the Syrian people,"" said Allaf, a Syrian national. ""Others say it is impossible to let him leave. Not only would it let him get away with thousands of murders and the destruction of the country, but it also would give him a green light to keep on doing what's he's doing, knowing that when he decides to leave, he can leave."" Read more on preparing for al-Assad's exit . But Allaf said she thinks there is ""absolutely zero"" chance that the president will take up the Arab League's offer. ""I think Assad does not plan on ever accepting any possible plans for escaping or leaving,"" she said. ""I think he will keep on fighting, hoping the revolution will stop."" The Syrian government has long maintained that ""armed terrorist groups"" are fueling violence in the country. Responding to a question about clashes in Damascus, Makdissi said, ""We are in a state of self-defense."" But he later added, ""This is an exceptional matter. It will last a couple of days, and matters will return to normal."" On Monday, chaos ensued in cities across the country, opposition activists said. In Homs, two people were killed ""due to intense shelling by helicopters and rocket launchers, accompanied by intense clashes between the (rebel) Free Syrian Army and the regime army,"" the LCC said. The LCC reported fierce clashes for a second day in Aleppo, Syria's largest city and commercial hub. In a video posted online Sunday, the head of the rebel Free Syrian Army in Aleppo announced an operation ""to liberate the city of Aleppo from the rule of the Assad thugs, whose hands were blood-stained by heinous crimes against our people."" Brig. Gen. Abdel Jabbar Al-Obeidi also vowed to secure Aleppo and protect all minorities and sects, including the members of Alawite sect that the president belongs to. If rebels eventually gain control of Aleppo, it would mark a pivotal point in the Syrian crisis and deal a heavy blow to al-Assad's financial ties. The Syrian crisis started in March 2011, when a fierce government crackdown against protesters morphed into a nationwide uprising against the regime. Video: How does Assad survive in Syria? The United Nations estimates more than 10,000 people have been killed since the crisis began more than 16 months ago. But Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said the United Nations has not been giving out overall death toll numbers since December ""because it became impossible to verify the numbers in any meaningful way."" Opposition groups tracking deaths have issued higher tolls. The LCC, for example, estimates more than 16,000 people -- mostly civilians -- have died. In addition to the deaths, thousands of refugees have fled Syria into neighboring countries to escape the turmoil. The three border crossings between Iraq and Syria were opened Monday to Syrian refugees, an Iraqi government spokesman said. ""The border guards, police and border provinces were guided to provide all the needed support to the Syrian refugees,"" Ali al-Dabbagh said in a written statement.

"(CNN) -- A lawyer for Roger Clemens strongly denies the seven-time Cy Young Award winner used steroids to pump up his body and his pitching statistics. Roger Clemens has won seven Cy Young Awards pitching for several teams, including the New York Yankees. Clemens, considered a shoo-in for the Baseball Hall of Fame someday, was prominently featured in the report on performance-enhancing drugs that former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell released Thursday. ""Roger Clemens adamantly, vehemently, and whatever other adjectives can be used, denies that he has ever used steroids or ... improper substances,"" Clemens' attorney, Rusty Hardin, said Thursday. ""He is really, really concerned and upset that he has been named in this report. It's based on the allegations, apparently, of a trainer that he's had in the past. ... That's not a standard someone should be held out in public to have done something as serious as using steroids in baseball.""  Watch Hardin critique report » . The report says Brian McNamee, a former Toronto Blue Jays strength coach, testified that Clemens received injections of the steroid Winstrol in Clemens' Toronto, Ontario, apartment in 1998. McNamee ""injected Clemens approximately four times in the buttocks over a several-week period with needles that Clemens provided,"" the report said. It said Clemens' pitching improved during that time. ""During this period of improved performance, Clemens told McNamee that the steroids 'had a pretty good effect' on him,"" the report said. The report said McNamee also injected Clemens with testosterone and human growth hormone after Clemens moved to the New York Yankees in 2000. ""Roger has been repeatedly tested for these substances and he has never tested positive,"" Hardin said in a statement. ""There has never been one shred of tangible evidence that he ever used these substances and yet he is being slandered today."" Hardin told reporters that Clemens had not been given the opportunity to defend himself. ""It's not right to put somebody in a report with this kind of allegation and lack of proof, because there's nothing he can do to combat it,"" Hardin told reporters. ""He's not being charged with anything, he has just been smeared with something."" Hardin said his client was ""outraged that his name is included in the report based on the uncorroborated allegations of a troubled man threatened with criminal prosecution."" Mitchell said he did what Major League Baseball asked of him. ""I did what I was asked to do as fairly and as thoroughly and as accurately as I could,"" Mitchell said Friday on CNN's ""American Morning."" Mitchell said he had enough witness reports, checks and admissions to justify going public with players' names. ""I think it's quite wrong to say there's no concrete evidence,"" he told CNN. ""There's several hundred pages of evidence."" Mitchell said he invited everyone named in the report to meet with him before the report was issued, but almost all declined. Don Fehr, president of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said Thursday the union was not consulted. That ""left us no choice but to represent our members in this inquiry,"" he said, as any union would protect its members in the face of possible sanctions. He said the association did not tell players not to cooperate with the investigation, but advised them ""on the legal lay of the land"" and suggested they retain their own counsel. ""Many players are named. Their reputations have been adversely affected, probably forever, even if it turns out down the road that they should not have been,"" Fehr said. After a Cabinet meeting on Friday, President Bush -- former owner of the Texas Rangers -- weighed in on the Mitchell report. ""Like many fans, I've been troubled by the steroid allegations. I think it's best that we not jump to any conclusions on individual players,"" he said in the White House Rose Garden. ""Steroids have sullied the game, and players and the owners must take the Mitchell report seriously; I'm confident they will,"" Bush said. ""And my hope is that this report is a part of putting the 'steroid era' of baseball behind us."" He noted the influence that professional athletes have on young people. ""I urge those in the public spotlight, particularly athletes, to understand that when they violate their bodies they're sending a terrible signal to America's young."" In The New York Times, Hardin said innocent players would be smeared with the guilty. ""He has thrown a skunk into the jury box, and we will never be able to remove that smell,"" Hardin told The Times.

"(CNN) -- Gay rights advocates in South Africa hailed a judge's sentencing of four men to 18 years each in prison for brutally slaying a 19-year-old lesbian. Hatred fueled the 2006 stabbing and stoning of Zoliswa Nkonyana, who was targeted because of her sexual orientation, Magistrate Raadiya Whaten ruled. Four years' credit was given to Lubabolo Ntlabathi, Sicelo Mase, Luyanda Londzi and Mbulelo Damba, meaning they will spend 14 additional years behind bars. ""The sentence sent a strong message that hate crimes would not be tolerated,"" national prosecuting attorney spokesman Eric Ntabazalila told the South African Press Association. Gay rights advocates celebrated Wednesday's ruling. ""It was the first time discrimination based on sexual orientation was named as an aggravating factor in a South African criminal trial,"" the Triangle Project gay and lesbian rights group said in a written statement. Gay marriage is legal in South Africa, which was the first African nation to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries, based on rules left over from the British colonial era, when sodomy laws were introduced. Despite South Africa's anti-discrimination provisions, attacks based on sexual orientation persist, rights groups say. After interviews in six of South Africa's nine provinces last year, New York-based Human Rights Watch concluded that ""social attitudes towards homosexual, bisexual, and transgender people in South Africa have possibly hardened over the last two decades. The abuse they face on an everyday basis may be verbal, physical, or sexual -- and may even result in murder"" This week officials from another rights group said they hope this week's sentencing will set a precedent across Africa. ""We hope that this message is heard loud and clear across the rest of the continent, where homophobic discrimination is widespread and where homosexuality is a crime,"" the non-profit People Against Suffering, Oppression and Poverty said in a statement. CNN's Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","A judge rules that killers targeted Zoliswa Nkonyana because of her sexual orientation .

"(CNN) -- The 1980 cult-classic film ""The Shining"" could very well get a sequel now that Stephen King has published his long-awaited followup to the 1977 novel. ""Doctor Sleep"" picks up with Danny, the clairvoyant boy at the center of ""The Shining,"" as a middle-aged man still in possession of his disturbing psychic powers. King's agent says Warner Bros. owns the movie rights to the sequel, just as it did the original film directed by the late Stanley Kubrick. Our sources in Hollywood say the studio is in the very early stages of developing a possible sequel to the film. It will be a tough act to follow. Kubrick's adaptation of ""The Shining"" (which King reportedly never liked) continues to fascinate -- and terrify -- viewers more than three decades after it first hit theaters. This year alone has seen several examples of its persistent hold on the imagination including the release of ""Room 237,"" a documentary exploring claims by a variety of theorists that Kubrick deliberately inserted coded symbols and meanings into his film; a major exhibit on Kubrick at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art featuring a unique gallery devoted to ""The Shining""; and the public display of an elaborate recreation of ""The Shining"" by sculptor Howard Senft. One reason ""The Shining"" continues to hold power over audiences is that it rewards multiple viewings, says artist and set designer Patti Podesta. ""It has so many issues going on simultaneously that I think people find things in it over and over again,"" she said. 'The Shining' by the numbers . Podesta, who also designed the Kubrick exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, offers a number of reasons for the film's ongoing appeal. ""There are these really striking images: the blood flowing from the elevators,"" she said. ""Jack Nicholson (who plays Jack Torrance), a great performance by him, and the strange relationship between he and Shelley Duvall (who plays Wendy). It has this issue about couples going on (in it)."" A movie about couples -- that is only one of many ways to understand ""The Shining."" In fact, the movie may have produced more possible interpretations than any other film. ""Most movies work on two levels,"" said filmmaker Rodney Ascher. ""Just maybe 'The Shining' works on five."" Ascher directed the documentary ""Room 237,"" which explores the growing number of theories -- advanced by critics, historians and enthusiasts -- to explain what Kubrick ""really meant to say"" with ""The Shining."" These observers (obsessives, others call them) are convinced Kubrick inserted certain motifs and images into the film to direct the discerning eye towards the real theme of his work. Theory No. 1: ""The Shining"" is really about the extermination of the American Indian. Evidence: Dialogue not found in Stephen King's novel suggests that the Overlook Hotel was built over a Native American burial ground. Kubrick used Calumet baking powder cans, with their distinctive headdress logo, in the Overlook's larder. Theory No. 2: the Freudian interpretation. Danny and his father are in competition for Wendy's attention/affection. Jack wants to kill Danny; Danny ends up, in effect, killing his father. Evidence: In one scene, Wendy and Danny watch the movie ""Summer of '42,"" the story of a schoolboy in love with an older married woman. ""It's kind of a loaded scene for a little boy to be watching with his mom,"" Ascher noted. Theory No. 3: ""The Shining"" is Stanley Kubrick's apology for having faked the Apollo moon landing footage. Evidence: Danny wears a sweater emblazoned with an image of the Apollo 11 rocket. And Kubrick changed the pivotal Room 217 in the original novel to Room 237 in the movie. The moon, at certain points of its orbit, is 237,000 miles away from the Earth. Okay, this one is kind of out there, and it presupposes that the moon landing footage people watched in 1969 indeed was faked and that Kubrick created the phony footage at NASA's request. Theory No. 4: ""The Shining"" is really about the horrors of Nazi Germany, an interpretation advanced by historian Geoffrey Cocks, a professor at Albion College. Evidence: Jack Torrance types his magnum opus on a German-made Adler typewriter. ""I'm a German historian, and so I know that Adler means 'eagle' in German,"" Cocks said. ""I had some research on Kubrick and knew that he had a tendency in his films to refer to eagles as a symbol of state power, and so it seemed to me that this typewriter was significant. It was not a choice simply of having any old typewriter."" Cocks said Kubrick was extremely well-versed in the history of World War II and wanted to direct a film about the Holocaust but ultimately decided to tackle the subject indirectly through ""The Shining."" Another clue to that theme is the repeated visual reference to the number 42, Cocks said. ""The first time we see 42, it's on the sleeve of a jersey that Danny is wearing, and it's when he's having his first vision of the Overlook (Hotel), and that vision consists of ... the elevator doors slowly opening and oceans of blood slowly pouring out,"" Cocks said. The Overlook Hotel ""is associated with mighty and obscene power, and the other references to 42 in the film therefore arguably -- and I think convincingly -- constitute a pattern of reference to the year 1942, which was the deadliest year of the Holocaust."" Other observers have studied the film's slow dissolves frame by frame in a search for clues about what Kubrick intended to say. Another theorist played the film backward and forward simultaneously, superimposing the footage in an effort to detect hidden meanings. So what did Kubrick have to say by way of explaining ""The Shining""? Not much. ""He wasn't the kind of guy to talk about the themes or the symbolism in his movies,"" Ascher noted. Cocks added that Kubrick ""thought that if you simply told people what you were thinking or what they should think, that it wouldn't mean very much to them (anymore)."" Senft, a Denver-based sculptor who is such a ""Shining"" fan that he re-created the major characters out of silicone, discounts the elaborate theories meant to explain the film. ""I don't know if I buy all of them,"" Senft said. ""I think (Kubrick) might have been throwing some stuff in there to mess with us."" He instead takes the film at something closer to face value. ""To me, it's just like the best horror movie ever made,"" he said. ""Ever since I was 11 years old, when I (first) saw it, it's just something that's just kind of stuck with me. I can't turn it off when it's on. It's just mesmerizing."" Devotion like that means any sequel to the film will have an impossible time living up to the original, especially as Kubrick is unavailable to direct it. Cocks doubts a sequel could compare favorably to the original. ""I don't think we'll see a type of thoughtful and artistic production that Kubrick could have made,"" he said. ""He was among the greats among filmmakers, who ranks with (D.W.) Griffith, (Orson) Welles and (Charlie) Chaplin ... so, no, I don't have great optimism that the sequel will measure up in any way to Kubrick's 'The Shining.'

"(CNN) -- Finland has become the first country in the world to declare broadband Internet access a legal right. The move by Finland is aimed at bringing Web access to rural areas, where access has been limited. Starting in July, telecommunication companies in the northern European nation will be required to provide all 5.2 million citizens with Internet connection that runs at speeds of at least 1 megabit per second. The one-megabit mandate, however, is simply an intermediary step, said Laura Vilkkonen, the legislative counselor for the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The country is aiming for speeds that are 100 times faster -- 100 megabit per second -- for all by 2015. ""We think it's something you cannot live without in modern society. Like banking services or water or electricity, you need Internet connection,"" Vilkkonen said. Finland is one of the most wired in the world; about 95 percent of the population have some sort of Internet access, she said. But the law is designed to bring the Web to rural areas, where geographic challenges have limited access until now. ""Universal service is every citizen's subjective right,"" Vilkkonen said.   Should fast Internet access be everyone's legal right? It is a view shared by the United Nations, which is making a big push to deem Internet access a human right. In June, France's highest court declared such access a human right. But Finland goes a step further by legally mandating speed. On the other hand, the United States is the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote high-speed broadband, according to a study released in August by the Communications Workers of America, the country's largest media union. Forty-six percent of rural households do not subscribe to broadband, and usage varies based on income, the study found. In February, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission is expected to submit a national plan to Congress. The FCC says that expanding service will require subsidies and investment of as much as $350 billion -- much higher than the $7.2 billion President Barack Obama's economic stimulus package has set aside for the task.","Providers will need to supply connection speeds of at least 1 megabit per second .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Police barricaded Istanbul's main Taksim Square and used water cannons to disperse crowds on Saturday to prevent demonstrators from entering Gezi Park, the site of protests for more than a month. Interior Minister Muammer Guler said the government won't permit ""illegal"" demonstrations in the park. ""We will not and cannot permit demonstration or marches in those places,"" the minister said. ""Without it being a demonstration or a protest march, they can use Gezi Park as they please. We will not allow tents. ""Right now in Istanbul there is a search and a push for ways to have illegal gatherings. Our police is not permitting this,"" Guler said. Witnesses who spoke to CNN by phone reported use of water cannons and tear gas on Istiklal Street, one of the main arteries leading to Taksim Square. The 6th Administrative Court in Istanbul overruled some parts of the Taksim development project, including plans to rebuild old barracks in Gezi Park. Taksim Solidarity, an umbrella platform of activists and civil society groups, put out a call after ruling for people to gather in Gezi Park, which has not been open to the public since June 16. European Union, Turkey avoid rupture in relations . ""We are going to our park to deliver the court decision by hand, which cancels the project aimed to disidentify, depopulate and concretize Gezi Park, to the ones who shut the park down to the people,"" said Taksim Solidarity in a written statement. ""We are going to our park to open its doors to its real owners, so to everyone again."" ""They are in the smaller streets trying to prevent people from even reaching Istiklal,"" said Irem Koker, an eyewitness. CNN witnessed several men being detained by police. One demonstrators said ""this is a police state,"" as water cannons were being used to disperse the crowd. Some residents exploded in anger at the police barricades. ""This is the fourth entrance [to Taksim] that I've been stopped at. I have a 12-year-old child waiting for me,"" said a woman to a police officer blocking her way across what is normally one of the city's busiest transit hubs. She was dressed in the trenchcoat and headscarf popular among conservative Turkish Muslim women. ""Until now I used to pray for you,"" she told the police officer. ""Now that has all changed."" As clashes continued in streets and back alleys of Istanbul's historic Beyoglu district, Istanbul's governor, Huseyin Avni Mutlu, responded to an amateur video that went viral on Turkish social media Saturday night. The video showed men armed with a large round sword and a stick attacking pedestrians in Istanbul's Talimhane district, which is adjacent to Taksim Square. One of the men with a machete is seen in the video beating a woman once with the blade and then kicking her in the small of the back. The amateur video also showed several police officers physically trying to separate the two men from the people they were attacking. An eyewitness told CNN he and several other anti-government protesters took shelter in a building in Talimhane when they saw the men shown in the video attacking demonstrators. ""There were two guys in the middle of the street. We saw them from afar. They have these things that looked like swords, not knives but like rounded swords. They were running, swinging swords and kicking people,"" the eyewitness said, on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. ""I think they were out there to scare people. To give the message 'we're out here.' It wasn't like they were hiding the swords."" Mutlu said the suspected attackers had been detained by police. ""The two people with swords and sticks that were part of the events that took place after the illegal protest in Taksim have been detained and are being processed,"" Mutlu wrote on his official Twitter account. ""Our security officer was wounded while trying to apprehend the attacker armed with a sword who was seen in videos,"" Mutlu said. The Istanbul governor said that Gezi Park will open to the public Sunday, but that Taksim Solidarity's call for a demonstration is not legal and will not be permitted. ""It is not legal to gather in Taksim. I cannot let you gather where the law says you cannot,"" Mutlu told reporters on Saturday. ""We are not going to allow this illegal gathering. The police will make the necessary warnings,"" he said. After more than an hour of skirmishes between police and demonstrators, calm returned to Istiklal Street. The heavy police presence continued to block pedestrians from entering Taksim Square.","NEW: Video shows men using machete, stick .

Forty-four percent on Mediterranean diet needed diabetes medication, compared to 70 percent on low-fat diet. Now, new research says the Mediterranean diet may also be a winning solution for people with type 2 diabetes. Compared to people on a low-fat diet, those with type 2 diabetes who ate a Mediterranean diet lost more weight and went longer without blood-sugar-lowering medication, according to a study published this week in Annals of Internal Medicine. Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, affects more than 20 million people in the U.S. Researchers estimate that one in three children born this century will get diabetes at some point in their lives. Health.com: How I lost 100 pounds after a type 2 diabetes diagnosis . ""A Mediterranean diet isn't a magic diet, but it has a lot of features that we know are generally healthful,"" said Dr. Richard Hellman, an endocrinologist and clinical professor of medicine at the University of Missouri -- Kansas City School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. In the new study, 215 overweight people -- newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes -- were randomly assigned to either a low-fat diet or a low-carbohydrate Mediterranean diet. After four years, the researchers from Second University of Naples, in Italy, found that only 44 percent of the people who stuck to a Mediterranean diet needed blood-sugar-lowering medication, compared to 70 percent of people who followed the low-fat diet. Unlike people with type 1 diabetes, who need insulin injections to survive, those with type 2 can sometimes keep blood-sugar levels in the safe range with diet and exercise alone. Health.com: Getting a good night's sleep may lower your diabetes risk . However, if those methods stop working, they may need a pill or insulin injections to manage blood sugar. ""The people on the Mediterranean diet had better blood-sugar control because of the diet, and the trigger for diabetic drugs is when blood sugar is higher than you want it to be,"" explained Dr. Christine Laine, the editor of the journal. A Mediterranean diet includes vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, and healthy fats, such as olive oil. In the study, women on the diet were allowed 1,500 calories per day, and men were allowed 1,800 calories per day; no more than 50 percent of calories could come from carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are found in fruit, pasta, and other healthy (and unhealthy) foods, and are largely responsible for the rise in blood sugar after eating. People with type 2 diabetes can sometimes keep their blood sugar in a healthy range by watching their carbohydrate intake. Health.com: Why carbohydrates are so important in diabetes . Study subjects who ate a low-fat diet followed American Heart Association guidelines and consumed a diet rich in whole grains and low in fatty foods and sweets. Women were restricted to 1,500 calories, and men were allowed 1,800 calories; no more than 30 percent of calories could come from fat. Those on the Mediterranean diet lost 13.6 pounds after one year and maintained an 8.4-pound loss four years later. In comparison, the low-fat-diet group lost 9.2 pounds the first year and maintained a 7-pound loss at four years. Overall, the researchers aimed to meet three American Diabetes Association goals: keep blood pressure under control; lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL); and limit levels of hemoglobin A1C, a protein that's a measure of out-of-control blood sugar. People who have diabetes are at high risk of heart attacks and strokes, so it's important to keep an eye on all three factors. Health.com: 20 Meals that won't kill your cholesterol . Both diets helped people reach those goals, but more people on the Mediterranean diet reached their goals than those on the low-fat diet. Hellman said he is not surprised by the findings. After all, past studies have found that the Mediterranean diet can decrease the risk of heart attacks and strokes. However, he said this study provides ""new information about diabetes, and it's an important trial."" Health.com: 15 diabetes-friendly recipes . One limitation of the study is that the researchers who prescribed medication knew if a patient was on the low-fat or Mediterranean diet. Laine said she doesn't think this affected the results, but Hellman pointed out that a researcher who is more biased toward a specific diet may have a ""higher threshold"" of when to give medication. Regardless, Hellman said he would recommend the Mediterranean diet to his patients. ""If you had a choice, this would be the better choice,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Venezuela's president says right-wing opponents have unleashed a new weapon in their push to destabilize his government and demoralize his supporters: an imitation of Hugo Chavez's voice. An audio recording widely circulated on social media purports to be the late Venezuelan leader saying he's still alive. The recording comes nearly seven months after authorities announced Chavez's death from cancer and just a few months before municipal elections in the politically polarized South American country. President Nicolas Maduro said Saturday that the recording implying that Chavez has been kidnapped is fake, and he isn't taking it lightly. ""These people have no ethical limit, they have no moral limit, they have no scruples,"" Maduro said in televised remarks at a United Socialist Party of Venezuela event. The recording purports to be a message from Chavez to his brother. A voice that sounds like Chavez says he is recovering, that his death was a lie and that he is ""more alive than ever."" J.J. Rendon, a Miami-based political strategist who Maduro alleged was tied to the audio recording, fired back in a series of Twitter posts. ""All your insults are compliments to me! Do you like to please me? Keep attacking me,"" he wrote. ""I challenge that you -- beyond threats, lies and insults -- PROVE just one crime at least! You have no way to do that! Because there isn't any!"" Maduro became Venezuela's interim leader after Chavez's March 5 death and was sworn in as president after a narrow election victory in April. Maduro's remarks Saturday are the latest in a series of accusations alleging plots to destabilize his government or assassinate him. He has made at least 11 such accusations since the beginning of his presidency, CNN en EspaÃ±ol reported last week. Maduro canceled his plans to travel to New York and attend the U.N. General Assembly last week because of what he said were plots to physically harm him there. Gabriel Reyes, a Venezuela-based political analyst, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol last week that there could be another motivation behind the accusations. Both Chavez and former Cuban leader Fidel Castro often made such claims, he said. ""Maduro as a pupil of both of them cannot do anything other than using assassination as a sort of alternative distracting agenda,"" he said. Journalist Osmary Hernandez contributed to this report.","A recording purports to be Hugo Chavez saying he's still alive .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Two days after Russian and Iraqi officials announced a major weapons deal, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad stressed that the United States also has billions of dollars worth of military equipment deals with Iraq. ""We would note that the government of Iraq has consistently indicated a strong preference for the United States as its partner of choice for arms purposes,"" a U.S. Embassy spokesperson said in a written response to questions from CNN. On Tuesday, the Russian state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported a $4.2 billion deal to deliver attack helicopters and mobile air-defense systems to Iraq. One analyst told the news agency the deal was a clear sign that Iraq was starting to look beyond Washington for weapons. ""It's clear that America's influence on Iraq has been excessive,"" Ruslan Pukhov of the Center for Analysis of Strategy and Technologies told RIA Novosti. ""The Shiite government of this country is starting to conduct itself more independently of Washington, and more looking toward Iran."" Iraq has initiated 467 foreign military sales with the United States worth more than $12.3 billion, the U.S. Embassy said Thursday. But some Iraqi officials have complained that weapons deals with the United States are progressing slowly. ""We fully support efforts to purchase equipment to meet its legitimate defense needs and we are committed to working with them to fulfill these military equipment orders as quickly as possible,"" the embassy said. Word of the deals with Russia comes several weeks after U.S. Vice President Joe Biden asked Iraq for help in stopping weapons from reaching Syria. U.S. lawmakers travel to Baghdad as Iraq denies role in Syrian conflict . Biden stressed to the Iraqi prime minister ""the need to prevent any state from taking advantage of Iraq's territory or airspace to send weapons to Syria.""

"(CNN) -- Google's Nexus 4 made a splash last fall simply because it was well-built and inexpensive, and yet it didn't require a two-year contract with a wireless carrier. Now, it's even cheaper. The Nexus 4 now costs $200 for the 8 GB model and $250 for the 16 GB model--a $100 price reduction from before. Those prices aren't incredible if you're used to buying your phones through major wireless carriers at subsidized prices, but compared to most unlocked phones, the Nexus 4 is cheap. And it's a decent phone, running the latest version of Google's Android operating system. Buying the phone unlocked means you can bring it to certain wireless carriers in the United States and save a lot of money on service. For example, with T-Mobile you can pay as little as $50 per month if you bring your own phone. Or, you can get a SIM card from Straight Talk and pay $45 per month for service. An unlocked phone also allows you to travel overseas and take advantage of lower service prices from local carriers. The only major drawback to the Nexus 4 is that it doesn't support 4G LTE data speeds, which can sometimes rival the speeds of home Internet service. Most smartphones sold in the United States now support 4G LTE, so this is one area where the Nexus 4 seems seriously outdated. Still, at $200, the slower data speeds are more palatable, especially for new smartphone adopters that are willing to sacrifice performance for a lower monthly bill. Rumor has it that a new Nexus phone, dubbed the Nexus 5, is coming soon. It's unknown whether this phone will be as cheap as the Nexus 4 was when it launched last year. But with lower prices on the Nexus 4, Google seems to be girding itself for the arrival of a cheaper iPhone, supposedly called the ""iPhone 5C."" Like the Nexus 4, Apple's phone could be aimed at customers who want an unlocked, off-contract handset without spending gobs of cash.

"Denpasar, Bali (CNN) -- On a traffic-choked street in Bali's capital, Denpasar, Edo walks through his family's shop to an empty back room. Only there does he feel safe enough to explain why he's afraid. ""Well, it's because probably the killers are still out there,"" he says. The killers he refers to are those who Edo believes are responsible for the murder of his grandfather, one of between 500,000 and 1 million people estimated by human rights groups to have been killed by military death squads during anti-communist purges across Indonesia in 1965 and 1966. The mass killings were sparked by a failed coup on September 30, 1965 and the murder of a number of generals in the military. A major general in the army at the time, Suharto blamed the coup on communists, ousted President Sukarno -- the country's first post-independence leader -- and sanctioned the hunt for those responsible. After assuming the presidency in 1967, Suharto ruled Indonesia for 31 years until 1998. Many contend those targeted during the purges were not communists but ethnic Chinese, or anyone with left-wing views. Edo describes how his grandfather had been kidnapped from his home late one night, targeted he believes because of his work with a government organization set up to integrate ethnic Chinese and local Balinese. ""Everything broke down after that. The family business and their home was burned down, they lost everything and had to start from scratch,"" says Edo. ""I am pretty sure one uncle of mine knows who did it. (The murderers) are still alive and around and I still have my fear."" For thousands like Edo in Bali and across the rest of Indonesia, confronting that fear and addressing this brutal period in the country's history is something most have been unwilling or unable to do openly. Many worry that publicly dissenting from official versions of the events and coup -- ingrained through Suharto-era propaganda, like the 1984 film ""Treachery of G30S/PKI"" -- could lead to retribution from those connected to the killings. More often than not, killers and victims' families still live in the same communities. ""It's like the Nazis winning and then they are still in the government,"" says Edo. ""People live with fear, they are afraid to get involved."" However things are slowly changing. That Edo is now facing his fears in part comes from the impact of ""The Act of Killing,"" a new documentary by American director Joshua Oppenheimer. While books and other films have told some of the survivors' stories, Oppenheimer's film recounts for the first time the violence from the perpetrators' perspective. Captivating, powerful and at times bizarre, it follows the boastful but ultimately conflicted Anwar Congo, a low-level gangster turned executioner, as he reenacts how he and others murdered hundreds of people. As well as the moral and personal journey taken by Congo, the film also shows the links between the murderers, paramilitary groups and government officials. ""Rather than showing Indonesians something they don't already know, (the film) exposes something that they already know to be true and what they are afraid to address,"" says Oppenheimer, who spent around seven years making the film around the Sumatran city of Medan, with a largely local crew who had to be credited anonymously. ""(The survivors told me) we need a film that comes to Indonesia like the child in ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" saying that the king is naked ... everybody already knows it, but if it can be said so powerfully, so forcefully, so emotionally by the perpetrators themselves, then there will be no going back."" At two secret screenings last December and February, Edo showed the film to members of a local film club. Some were too afraid to even watch it, while others thought it could stir up new trouble. ""Some in the audience asked, 'Why are you opening up old wounds?' But the wounds are still open wide and people are still afraid,"" says Edo. Others, particularly the younger generation, have become emboldened by the film and the chance for greater openness, like Termana, a member of Komunitas Taman 65, a Bali-based group comprised of victims' family members. ""The Act of Killing gave us an opportunity to talk about the events,"" he says at group meeting just a few hundred meters from one of Bali's most popular tourist beaches. ""(The killings) happened here in Bali and show the dark side of the paradise island, but also the dark side of family life."" Termana's grandfather disappeared one night in early 1966 and was never seen again. Through slow and at time painful discussions with family members more is being learned about the difficult period. Termana admits he didn't know until recently that a village in western Bali is called ""Dark Field"" because it was where up to 600 people are believed have been slaughtered. The perpetrator says Roro, a fellow Komunitas Taman 65 group member, is believed to be the head of another village, who is known more openly for his charisma and dancing skills. Like Anwar Congo in Oppenheimer's film, Roro says the village leader was not shy to boast of his murderous exploits, believing that he carried out his violent acts with impunity and for the right reasons. However, since the film and the growing groundswell of discussion about the events it relates to, he has become less inclined to boast about his exploits, says Roro. Monday, September 30 is the anniversary of the 1965 coup and the date Oppenheimer has chosen to make the film available to everyone in Indonesia to watch online. He decided not to try for a general cinema release for the film, fearing that if it was banned and people watched it, it could legitimize more violence. ""Somehow I think that because Indonesia is moving on, the film is able to have its impact,"" he says. ""Ten years ago maybe too many people were actually involved, complicit with the military dictatorship and too invested in its power structures ... but now younger Indonesians are saying 'I want my country to function.'"" While welcomed by Komintas Taman 65, there are real fears widespread viewings of the film could stir anger and reprisals from younger members of survivors' families and a new conflict with paramilitary groups. ""I do worry that there may be a new conflict,"" says Tka, at the Komunitas Taman 65 meeting. ""After Suharto's 'New Order' collapsed we thought (the perpetrators) would be found guilty."" So far, official attempts to revisit the events of 1965 and 1966 have failed. While Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights published a report last year stating the anti-communist purge was a gross violation of human rights, it was not taken any further by the country's Attorney General. A draft bill for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission also failed in 2006. ""How do you establish the truth after all this time? asks Roro. ""Truth is hard.""","Anti-communist purges across Indonesia sparked by failed coup on September 30, 1965 .

"Washington (CNN) -- More U.S. Marines are fortifying security at the American Embassy in Nairobi following the deadly shopping mall attack there, CNN has learned. Two U.S. officials confirmed the move in Kenya, but declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The newly arrived Marines are part of a unit specially trained in enhanced security, including providing personal protection to senior American officials. That kind of assistance was recently added to tasks performed by the embassy guard program after the deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, last year. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the armed assault that, in part, focused attention on State Department security readiness and military response. The security step also follows a State Department travel advisory on Wednesday about potential terror threats in East Africa from al Qaeda and affiliated groups following the Westgate Mall attack and standoff that killed 67 people. Due to security concerns, the officials would not discuss the precise number of Marines added to the embassy since the shopping mall attack. While there is no specific threat against the embassy at this time, the Obama administration deemed it a ""high threat"" facility, the officials said. The United States has doubled the number of Marine guards at the Nairobi embassy in the past eight weeks. The force was first increased during a heightened state of alert during which the United States close nearly two dozen embassies worldwide due to a threat from al Qaeda in Yemen. Security was beefed up again prior to the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Separately on Thursday, Attorney General Eric Holder said there was no evidence so far to indicate that any Americans were involved in the Nairobi attack. Citing a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the situation and the latest security assessment, CNN reported on Wednesday that authorities want to know if any Americans were among the attackers as claimed by the Somali-based al-Shabaab terror group said to be behind it. Was 'White Widow' involved in mall attack? Kenyan authorities have said the attackers were from a number of countries, but have not confirmed that any Americans were involved. ""We don't have verifiable information that would indicate one way or the other way whether any Americans were involved,"" Holder said. ""That is one of the things that we are trying to do with our Kenyan colleagues - go through the forensic things, materials that we have, physical things to make that kind of determination."" United States knows so far that the attack that began on Saturday was carefully planned. FBI experts are assisting the Kenyans on a preliminary basis. They have specific expertise in analyzing explosives and fingerprints. ""FBI agents have been on the ground since right after the incident began. We have been flowing resources into Nairobi on a continuing basis. We have had conversations about this matter both here and at the White House,"" Holder said. American forensic investigators were granted access to mall alongside Kenyan officials on Thursday, CNN's Evan Perez reported. But U.S. law enforcement officials told Perez that there is an increasing concern that some of the perpetrators escaped alongside fleeing victims, making the effort to piece together who was responsible more difficult. The updated State Department travel caution on security threats and terror activities worldwide included the Kenya attack, saying al-Shabaab had ""taken credit"" for it. ""Al-Shabaab assassinations, suicide bombings, hostage taking, and indiscriminate attacks in civilian-populated areas are also frequent in Somalia,"" the advisory said. Holder added that there was no ""specific, credible evidence"" that al-Shabaab is planning anything domestically. ""I am not sure they have the capacity to do anything in the United States,"" he said, adding that the United States is taking the ""threat that they pose"" seriously. A U.S. official with access to the latest intelligence told CNN the State Department advisory was issued out of an ""abundance of caution."" But officials are concerned there could be other plots in the works.

"(CNN) -- The NSA broke privacy rules ""thousands of times each year"" since 2008, The Washington Post reported Thursday, citing an internal audit and other documents. Material was provided to the newspaper this summer by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. The audit found 2,776 incidents of ""unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications,"" the Post reported in its story. ""Most were unintended. Many involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure. The most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders,"" it said. The paper said most incidents involved unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the country. The audit was dated May 2012 and looked at the prior 12 months. The NSA responded to the Post's story, saying ""a variety of factors can cause the numbers of incidents to trend up or down from one quarter to the next."" Factors can include implementation of new procedures, technology or software changes and expanded access. ""The one constant across all of the quarters is a persistent, dedicated effort to identify incidents or risks of incidents at the earliest possible moment, implement mitigation measures wherever possible, and drive the numbers down,"" the agency said. The agency released a statement Thursday night defending its programs. ""NSA's foreign intelligence collection activities are continually audited and overseen internally and externally,"" it said. ""When NSA makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission, the agency reports the issue internally and to federal overseers -- and aggressively gets to the bottom of it."" Snowden stepped forward publicly in June to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. The agency also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, he said. He fled first to Hong Kong and then to Russia before Moscow granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the Obama administration to return him to the United States to face charges. He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. House on Wednesday narrowly defeated a proposal to sharply restrict the National Security Agency's phone surveillance program that was exposed by Edward Snowden. The Obama administration and House Speaker John Boehner, unlikely allies in the sharp partisan climate in Washington, joined forces to reject the limit offered as an amendment to a defense spending bill, 217-205. A coalition of libertarian, liberal and conservative lawmakers pushed for curbs on the blanket collection of those records, arguing that it was too broad and intrusive. Snowden, a former NSA contractor, revealed details of the bulk phone tracking effort and a companion e-mail collection initiative through leaks of classified information to media outlets last month. He has been charged with espionage. Since then, a number of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have been highly critical of the sweeping way in which the government applies telephone surveillance that is overseen by a secret court. They and privacy groups concluded the government had reached too far into the personal lives of Americans in the interests of national security. Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said during debate on the amendment that the NSA had exceeded its mandate. He said the measure would have halted surveillance of people not under direct investigation by authorities. ""The time has come to stop it,"" he said. But Rep. Tom Cotton said approval would have effectively killed the program, which he said has been found constitutional and approved by bipartisan majorities. ""Folks, we are at war,"" said Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and Iraq War veteran who urged his colleagues not to undermine the surveillance tool he said was critical for troops in the field in counterterrorism operations. Unusual alliances . The proposal forged alliances among bitter political rivals on Capitol Hill. It even prompted an unusual tactical move by the White House to weigh in on an amendment vote before debate, saying the proposal was hasty and blunt and would dismantle a counterterrorism tool. House Republican leaders tried several ways to stave off a vote, but agreed under pressure from many conservatives eager for public debate. A breakdown of the tally showed 134 Republicans voting with 83 Democrats to reject the measure offered by the Michigan odd couple of sophomore Republican Rep. Justin Amash and 25-term Democratic Rep John Conyers. Boehner, who as speaker rarely votes on the House floor, opposed it as did House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. But 94 Republicans and 111 Democrats supported it. Amash told reporters his amendment was ""about the American people versus the elites in Washington."" He maintained that NSA program represented ""a clear violation"" of Fourth Amendment protections regarding warrants. Amash said he was simply working to ensure the government was following the original intent of the Patriot Act, the anti-terror law that authorized increased government surveillance powers after 9/11. Top Republicans argued against the measure, with chairs of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Appropriations committees circulating a letter saying it would have ""unintended consequences for the intelligence and law enforcement communities."" National security pressure . National security officials personally appealed to House members, hoping to derail the vote. They have said phone and e-mail surveillance have helped thwart terror plots. President Barack Obama also has stressed that the NSA was not using the surveillance program to listen in on phone calls; that it only collected metadata, including numbers, times of calls and dates. James Clapper, the nation's top intelligence official, released a statement before the vote noting that he had joined others in opposing the measure. New York Democratic Rep Jerry Nadler, a critic of the original provisions on data collection in the Patriot Act, said he wasn't persuaded by the warnings from the administration. He voted for the amendment. ""I never dreamed it would ever be used for dragnet surveillance of every American phone call, even if only for metadata. And frankly that's way beyond what Congress intended,"" he said. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank often cited by Republicans, released an analysis that warned the amendment would ""increase the risks of terrorist attacks by limiting the scope of court-ordered foreign intelligence collection and thereby depriving the U.S. of valuable intelligence it currently collects."" But at a monthly forum sponsored by Heritage that features some of the House's most conservative members, that argument didn't sway many members. Eight of the nine lawmakers on the Wednesday panel, which included Amash, said they planned to vote for it. Rep Michele Bachmann, a leader of the tea party movement on Capitol Hill, broke with fellow conservative lawmakers, saying the NSA program collects phone records from telecommunications companies not individuals, so there is ""no expectation of privacy."" A member of the House Intelligence Committee, Bachmann warned that ""if we take this program and remove from the United States the distinct advantage we have versus any other country it would be those that would be seeking to achieve the goals of Islamic Jihad who will benefit from by putting the United States at risk."" The defense spending bill now moves to the Senate, but that chamber has not considered its version yet in committee or scheduled a floor vote. But in the Senate, there is little support for making major changes to the NSA program. Before the vote Nadler said even this amendment failed he and other opponents of the program would continue to press for changes. ""It simply will not be renewed when it expires in 2015. It's going to end - now or later. The only question is when and on what terms."" Court renews secret U.S. surveillance program .

"(CNN) -- I can't get the image of the bodies lying near the freezer at Westgate out of my mind, and recognizing two of the victims, their bodies splayed, their blood splashed against the stark white floor. There is a picture of an empty blue twin stroller, abandoned on the rooftop that I've walked on countless times. There are pictures we did not air on CNN because they were simply too gruesome.

Kenyans like us, are thinking of great escapes in ways we never did before. Wherever we are, what's the quickest route out? We are on edge on the streets, in our cars, and nervous in malls. I was at a clothes shop at the Sarit Center mall looking for a new shirt to buy before presenting the ""Westgate Attack Special,"" programme and something clattered to the floor. We all jumped in fear. Kenyans debate: Time to get troops out to Somalia? Friends and family are thinking twice about whether to go for dinner, lunch, run basic errands, and determine what could be safe and what is not. The national conversation has changed to security. Each passing day brings greater revelations about the terrorist plot and the government's response. Every Kenyan I have spoken to is angry, about intelligence failures, and operational failures. Kenyans are acutely aware gunmen from Westgate escaped and many say our government has not provided us with sufficient answers: How? Where? When? Why? Yet the coming together of all Kenyans has been powerful. The diverse community has pulled together -- all races, all tribes that are often source of tension in Nairobi. Our politicians, bitter rivals, have supported the president. In the short term Kenyans expect to take an economic blow with fewer tourists coming here, less investment, less confidence amid the threat of further attacks. For the long term, many point to 9/11 in New York or 7/7 in London and note how life went on, and those cities bounced back. Kenya is the economic powerhouse of east Africa, that won't change. Kenyans are resilient, that won't change. Kenya leads the region in creativity, media, free press, biotechnology, arts, music, literature, none of that will change. Kenya attracts investment opportunities around the world, that won't change.

"(CNN) -- The Australian victim of an alleged ""thrill killing"" in the United States was laid to rest in his hometown Wednesday, as an autopsy report revealed he was killed by a single shot to the back. Hundreds of mourners packed Melbourne's St Therese's Church Wednesday for the funeral of Christopher Lane, who was studying in the United States on a baseball scholarship when he was allegedly gunned down at random on August 16. The autopsy report, released Tuesday, showed Lane, a student at Oklahoma's East Central University, was killed by a single bullet that hit his back, penetrated both lungs, his aorta and pulmonary artery, and fractured two ribs. One of the three teens arrested over the 22-year-old's death allegedly told police in Duncan, Oklahoma, that they had decided to kill someone because they were bored. Opinion: Negligent parents, lawbreaking kids . Two of the teens -- James Edwards Jr., 15, and Chancey Luna, 16 -- have been charged as adults with first-degree murder over the shooting, while another, 17-year-old Michael Jones, is accused of being an accessory and driving a vehicle during the discharge of a weapon. The senselessness of the killing caused outrage in Australia and the U.S., with former Australian deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer calling for a boycott on travel to the U.S. in response, and President Barack Obama expressing his condolences to Lane's family. Opinion: Let's have the conversation about race . The case also prompted speculation the killing may have been racially-motivated, as one of the alleged shooters, who is black, had allegedly made online comments about disliking white people. District Attorney Jason Hicks said while the post appeared racial in character, there was insufficient evidence to pursue hate crime charges in the case. Opinion: When racial cliches drive murder stories . Lane's American girlfriend, Sarah Harper, was among the mourners at the funeral, having accompanied his body home to Australia on Saturday. She had attended a tribute game Sunday with Lane's family and friends at Melbourne's Essendon Baseball Club, where Lane had been a member.","Lane was killed by a single shot to the back, according to autopsy .

"(Mental Floss) -- What do you do when you've just hanged someone for murder, and then their ""victim"" pops up alive and healthy a few towns away? Justice went thataway for some people convicted of murders they didn't commit. 1. Not the Marion type . William Jackson Marion and Jack Cameron met at a Kansas boarding house in 1872. The two men became fast friends and traveling companions, using Cameron's team of horses to go from place-to-place to find work. Along their journey, the two made a brief stop in Beatrice, Nebraska to visit Marion's in-laws before moving on. After a few days, however, Marion returned solo, sporting clothes that belonged to Cameron and driving Cameron's horses. Then he left town again. Weeks later, the body of a man was discovered with three bullet holes in his head. He was also wearing the same outfit that Cameron had worn the day he left town. Marion immediately became the prime suspect and a manhunt began. After 10 years of searching, Marion was finally captured in Kansas. The trial and conviction of Jack Marion was seriously abbreviated. Marion's verdict was read after just one hour of deliberation, and he was hanged for his crime on March 25, 1887. Four years later, Jack Cameron reappeared looking for his old friend. Apparently, he had run to Mexico to avoid a shotgun wedding in Kansas, giving his horses and other possessions to Marion. Now he'd come back to reclaim them. The story does end on a (slightly) positive note: Thanks to the work of Marion's grandson, Elbert Marion, Nebraska governor Bob Kerrey granted Jack Marion a posthumous pardon in 1987, 100 years after his execution. Mental Floss: 11 notable presidential pardons . 2. The Brothers Boorn . In May of 1812, when Richard Colvin vanished, speculation amongst the townspeople of Manchester, Vermont, was that his brothers-in-law, Jesse and Stephen Boorn, were responsible. Without evidence of foul play, though, no charges were pressed. Seven years later, the Boorn Brothers' uncle had a dream in which Richard said he'd been killed and his body buried in an old cellar on the Boorn farm. Upon excavation of the cellar, a penknife and a button were found, both identified as Richard's. But the ""evidence"" still wasn't enough to charge the Boorn Brothers. Soon after, when a barn on the Boorn farm burned to the ground, many believed it was arson to cover more evidence. But, again, no charges were filed. Things finally came to a head, however, when a boy discovered bones under a tree near the Boorn home. While in custody, Jesse confessed that he and his brother had killed Richard. But before the trial began, a closer examination of the bones revealed they weren't even human, but those of an animal. The prosecution carried on, however, for they had the damning testimony of Silas Merrill, a forger, who was Jesse's cellmate. Merrill said Jesse had implicated himself, Stephen, and their father in Colvin's murder. His testimony mentioned the suspected locations of the crime -- the cellar, the barn, and the tree -- all fitting together in a neat little package. For his cooperation in the case, Silas was set free. As the evidence mounted, Stephen confessed as well, telling the same story as Silas, but without implicating his father. The Boorn Brothers were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1819. Jesse's sentence would later be commuted to life in prison, but Stephen was set to hang. Rather than sit idly by, Stephen placed an ad in different newspapers explaining his predicament. The ad included a description of Richard Colvin. Amazingly, the thing worked! Someone actually tracked Colvin down, who was alive and well in New Jersey. The Boorn Brothers were released from prison and petitioned for compensation from the state. But because they had both confessed to the crime, they received nothing but their freedom. The Boorn case became the first documented wrongful murder conviction in American history.

A few months later, a woman's body was found in a lake and Zhang's family identified it as their missing loved one. Her husband She Zaiyu was arrested for murder. For 10 days, She was reportedly denied sleep and received severe beatings until he finally confessed to the crime. Once in court, She said the confession had been coerced and that he was not guilty. He was sentenced to death in late 1994, but four years later his sentence was reduced to 15 years because the courts felt there wasn't sufficient evidence for the death penalty. Then, in March of 2005, Zhang Zaiyu resurfaced in Hubei. Mrs. Zaiyu claimed to have suffered from mental illness and had wandered away from her home in 1994. She wound up in Shandong Province, living there and even marrying another man. Her identity was confirmed through DNA testing and her first husband was released from prison 11 years after he had been convicted. He then sued the government and received 700,000 yuan (about $102,650) in compensation. But more importantly, She's case - and that of Teng Xingshan -- helped bring about changes to the Chinese judicial system in 2005. Now, capital punishment cases are the sole authority of the Supreme People's Court, which requires more oversight and investigation before executions are carried out. 4. The servant and the bloody shirt . On August 16, 1660, William Harrison left home in Campden, England, to do business in a nearby town. When he didn't return, his servant, John Perry, went to look for him. Perry found Harrison's shirt covered in blood, along with his hat, which had been slashed by a knife. Harrison, however, was nowhere to be found. Authorities immediately suspected Perry, and likely tortured him for answers. He confessed to a conspiracy involving himself, his mother, and his brother. According to his statement, Perry claimed that it was his brother who had actually killed Harrison while attempting to rob him. Despite the fact that all of Perry's relatives proclaimed their innocence, the entire family was convicted and hanged. Mrs. Perry, who'd also been accused of being a witch, was hanged first. Two years later, however, William Harrison returned to England claiming that he had been abducted, taken to Turkey, and sold into slavery. He escaped when his master died, and his return was publicly lauded. While Perry's trial didn't do John Perry (or his family) much good, it did have an impact on future cases. John Perry's story set a legal precedent in England - ""no body, no crime"" - that lasted for nearly 300 years. 5. The professional job . In April 1987, the dismembered body of a woman was dragged from the waters of the Mayang River in central Hunan Province. A young woman, Shi Xiaorong, had been declared missing shortly before the body was found, so police believed she was the victim. According to authorities, the dismemberment looked ""very professional"", so local butcher Teng Xinhshan became a prime suspect. It was speculated that Teng had sex with Shi and killed her when she tried to steal his money. Teng claimed he had never met Shi, but was found guilty and sentenced to death anyway. He was executed in 1989. Then, in 1993, Shi Xiaorong reappeared saying that she had been tricked and sold into marriage in March 1987. When Teng's relatives learned that Shi was still alive, they sued the judiciary. After the case was reopened, Shi testified that she had never even met Teng, and that he had obviously not killed her. Teng was posthumously exonerated in 2006. 6. Puppy love . In 1999, 14-year old Natasha Ryan vanished from her Queensland home. No body was ever found, and, after years of searching, her family presumed she was dead. Their fears were confirmed in 2002 when incarcerated serial killer, Leonard Fraser, was secretly recorded in his jail cell confessing that Natasha was one of his many victims. In the middle of Fraser's 2003 trial for the murder of four women, including Natasha Ryan, the authorities received a tip that Ryan had been living with her boyfriend, Scott Black, since her disappearance. They raided Black's house, which was less than a half-mile away from her parents' home, and found Natasha hiding in a wardrobe. The charges for Natasha's murder were dropped, though Fraser was sentenced to multiple consecutive life sentences for the other three murders. Mental Floss: 5 celebrity kidnapping plots . As for Natasha and her boyfriend, he was sentenced to one year in prison for perjury for claiming he didn't know Natasha's whereabouts. He was also fined $3000 and had to pay $16,740 of the costs accrued by police while searching for Natasha. Natasha only had to pay $1,000 fine for causing a false police investigation, though she sold her story to Australian tabloids for much, much more. The two married in 2008; both of Natasha's parents attended the ceremony. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com . Entire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.

"(CNN) -- Bo McCalebb, a 26-year old from New Orleans, makes for an unlikely Macedonian national hero. Until a year ago the basketball player had not even set foot in the small Balkan country, but since helping the national team to their biggest ever international sporting success last month, he's become one of Macedonia's favorite adopted sons. McCalebb was instrumental in Macedonia's fourth-place finish, their highest ever, at the EuroBasket championships in Lithuania. If not quite ""Bo the Great,"" he's since been given the moniker ""Borche McCalebbovski"" by wags in the local media, who quickly picked up on the unprecedented fervor the team's wins created across the country . ""The team was greeted in Skopje as if they had won the golden medal,"" remembers 32-year-old Mimoza Kasapi-Nuhiu, a resident of Macedonia's capital. ""Lots of people went out on the streets on a working day, singing, banging their drums and cheering like never before."" Were you there? Send in your photos and videos of Macedonia . Although not a sports fan, Kasapi-Nuhiu realized what an impact the international exposure had on the country's self image and the boost it gave the population. ""Macedonia was mentioned more times in a single basketball game on international TV than during its whole 20 years of existence since its independence,"" said Kasapi-Nuhiu. McCalebb's part in this unlikely national celebration began just a year ago. After graduating from the University of New Orleans, McCalebb was ignored by NBA teams and moved to Europe, playing for teams in Turkey, Serbia and now in Italy for Menssana Siena. It was while in Serbia in 2010 that he caught the attention of Dejan Lekic, the Secretary General of the Macedonian Basketball Federation. Each national team in Europe is allowed a naturalized player and Lekic saw McCalebb as a key addition to a team that had been steadily improving for six years. ""Usually you need to take a few months to check the personality, to check the qualities and character ... with Bo we were without worries,"" he said. ""A few times we went out for coffee and colas and we were soon laughing at jokes; he was Macedonian after two weeks already,"" added Lekic. McCalebb spends a month each year training with the Macedonian national squad and admits to only knowing ""the bad stuff"" when it comes to speaking the language. It was a surprise to get a call from Lekic, he admits, but unconcerned by any culture shock (or loss of U.S. citizenship) he also saw the chance to represent Macedonia as a way to boost his own career. ""I talked to a lot of older players and they said you can play longer with a (European) passport; I didn't even think about it, I just said yes."" For Lekic, Macedonia's adventure at EuroBasket was ""one magical story,"" but he is realistic when it comes to the future for the team that he says remains underfunded and lacks adequate government backing. ""It's very hard to work only with enthusiasm but without money. People think you just need a few balls, shoes and jerseys. Now is the time to either go forward or just survive year by year,"" he said. Qualification for next year's Olympic Games would be even better than this year's success, says Lekic, but the way in which the team's heroics brought about something like national unity was something more valuable than a boost to Macedonia's sporting profile. Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia relatively peacefully in 1991, but the country has been beset by internal tensions between Christian and Muslim ethnic groups. Country profile: Macedonia . In 2001 the country was racked by months of violence between extremist groups from the country's ethnic communities and the Macedonian military. ""I'm happy that during EuroBasket lots of congratulations came from ethic Albanians and Muslims,"" said Lekic. ""It makes me proud, because it's like we're making something forward in the development of unity of the country."" The basketball celebrations also gave Kasapi-Nuhiu reasons to be hopeful for a more harmonious Macedonia. ""The day when Macedonia was playing Russia for the bronze (medal) a friend of mine had posted on Facebook that he had heard his young Albanian neighbors cheering for the Macedonian team,"" said Kasapi-Nuhiu . ""I remember his Facebook status saying 'There is hope for this place after all ...'"" Staying out of politics, Lekic is determined to bring more success to the country by nurturing the best talent wherever it comes from -- McCalebb aside. ""It's time to stop the divisions; we are all Macedonians,"" he said. ""It's a question of when Albanian basketball players, or even a coach, play with the national team. It will be not because he is Albanian, but because he is good.""

"St. Paul, Minnesota (CNN) -- Food delivered to your gate at the touch of a screen? It sounds too good to be true, but it's happening at a handful or airports. About 7,000 Apple iPads are being installed at La Guardia Airport in New York, Toronto Pearson International in Ontario and Minneapolis-St. Paul International in the Twin Cities in a collaboration between airport food and beverage provider OTG Management and Delta Air Lines. In the Delta terminal at Minneapolis-St. Paul, iPads at seats in the gate areas will give airline customers up-to-the-minute flight updates, as well as free access to the Internet. Plus, fliers waiting for their flights can order food from a selection of new restaurants in the terminal and have it delivered to the gate. ""If I'm going to spend $10 on a beer, I'd rather do it on an iPad,"" said Michael Card, who was traveling recently through Minneapolis-St. Paul, ""because it's more fun, more exciting."" OTG Management has eliminated most of the chain restaurants and fast food options at the Minnesota airport in favor of restaurants with menus designed by chefs from the Twin Cities area. The same local concept is being applied at LaGuardia and Pearson airports. ""The goal behind this was to make travel better for travelers,"" OTG spokesman Sean Aziz said. ""You have to get to the airport earlier now with new (security) measures, so why not be able to get to your gate, have a fresh meal, a great glass of wine, the convenience of an iPad, charging your devices? It was really just to make the little things better."" When the project is completed late next year, Minneapolis-St. Paul airport's Terminal G will play host to 12 unique restaurants. Each will also have an iPad at every seat. IPads in the restaurants will offer color photos of each dish and will -- at least for the ordering aspect of your meal -- replace the need for a server. Hosts still play a role, OTG says, and servers will still see that you're taken carry of after they bring out your cooked order. OTG Chief Technology Officer Albert Lee had his own hesitations about installing the iPads. ""There was a lot of fear that this would somehow reduce the customer service experience,"" Lee said, ""but I think people appreciated the ability to order and feel in control of their environment. And I think they enjoyed having access to the internet."" Traveler Kurtis Zameck was waiting recently for his flight at Minneapolis-St. Paul and used the iPad to place an order. ""The first time I saw it, it was a little odd,"" Zameck said. ""But I think after you use it once or twice, it's pretty user-friendly."" And he didn't find that the service aspect of the experience suffered. Many travelers seemed pleased with the changes. Some said they liked the ability to check stocks or to stay up to speed on their flight departure, and parents said it was nice because pre-loaded games like tic-tac-toe and checkers gave their kids something to do. But not everyone shared those sentiments. One man who was hurrying to finish his food and catch his flight called it ""impersonal."" ""I prefer the personal touch. I like dealing with people, but the service was good,"" he added. Another passenger said the system was a little confusing at first. ""The first time I ordered a drink, it was a gin and tonic, and I didn't see the tonic, so I (accidentally) ordered a double gin. I had to actually go back to the bartender to get them to put tonic water in it. ... But once you get used to it, I think it's fine."" While OTG's iPads replace the need for servers to take the initial order back to the kitchen, Lee insists that it isn't eliminating restaurant jobs. They say they're merely ""changing how we deal with service."" ""Instead of waiters coming to take your order and going back and entering things (in the computer) ... we now have servers more geared toward our concierge experience."" And what about the security of the devices? Lee says the custom Web browser has been designed so that any personal data entered -- whether it be login info for Facebook or your online bank account -- is completely wiped clean with every press of the home button. ""We've designed this to take into account that you're still inside an airport,"" Lee said. ""We want you to feel comfortable. We want you to, in a lot of ways, forget that you're inside an airport. But you still have to board a flight, so we'll remind you about your flight."" You can check out the changes now at Minneapolis-St. Paul and LaGuardia. Pearson's iPads will debut in early 2013.","iPads at airport gates and restaurants allow fliers to order food electronically .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey grand jury handed down a 17-count indictment Thursday accusing a man and his female friend with shooting and killing the man's wife -- and also shooting the man himself, in what prosecutors say was an attempt to blame a murder on ""terrorists."" Kashif Parvaiz, 26, and Antoinette Stephen, 27, were indicted in Morris County Superior Court in the 2011 death of 27-year-old Nazish Norrani, Parvaiz's wife. The victim was shot to death, and Parvaiz was shot four times, as the couple pushed a stroller carrying their 3-year-old son during a nighttime walk. The child was unharmed. The killing occurred while the couple was visiting Norrani's family to celebrate the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Morris County Prosecutor Robert A. Bianchi said at a news conference shortly after the killing that the fact that Noorani, a Muslim, was killed during the holy month of Ramadan ""made this case especially compelling to us."" A release from the prosecutor's office said that while being treated for his wounds, which were not life-threatening, Parvaiz had described the shooters as three men who shouted ""slurs about terrorists"" at the couple before fleeing on foot. But within hours of the crime, investigators believed ""it was obvious"" the victim's husband was behind the attack, Bianchi said. Noorani had sent text messages to her brother describing escalating hostility and abuse in her marriage, the affidavit says, warning that ""someday u will find me dead but its cuz (sic) of kashi ... He wants to kill me."" And according to an affidavit filed in the case, Parvaiz subsequently told police he arranged for Stephen to kill his wife and wound him while the couple was out for a walk on August 16, 2011. The indictment also charges the pair with conspiracy and unlawful possession of a weapon in addition to child endangerment and child abuse because the 3-year-old had been in jeopardy. ""This case was extensively investigated with witnesses interviewed and significant evidence gathered in numerous states. We now look forward to presenting our proofs in court and again extend our sympathies to Nazish Noorani's family for such a tragic and senseless loss,"" Bianchi said Thursday. Attempts to reach the attorneys for Parvaiz and Stephen were unsuccessful Thursday. According to the prosecutor's office, if convicted, they could be sentenced to life without parole.","A Muslim woman was shot and killed in 2011 while she was walking with her spouse .

"(CNN) -- An international court in the Netherlands ruled Thursday to uphold the 50-year sentence handed down last year to Liberia's former president, Charles Taylor, after he was convicted of aiding war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone. The ruling by the appeals judges in the United Nations-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone in The Hague brings to an end a lengthy legal battle. Taylor, 65, was found guilty last year of supplying and encouraging rebels in Sierra Leone in a campaign of terror, involving murder, rape, sexual slavery, looting and the conscription of children younger than 15. He was also convicted of using Sierra Leone's diamond deposits to help fuel its civil war with arms and guns while enriching himself with what have commonly come to be known as ""blood diamonds."" Both the defense and prosecution lodged appeals after the court convicted the former president of all 11 counts against him, following a trial lasting nearly four years. Taylor's defense appealed the court's judgment and sentence on multiple grounds, arguing that the trial chamber had made mistakes in evaluating the evidence and in applying the law. But the appeals judges rejected those arguments, saying that the trial chamber had ""thoroughly evaluated the evidence for its credibility and reliability,"" and that its assessment of Taylor's criminal responsibility and liability was in accordance with international laws. The appeals judges also dismissed defense claims that Taylor was not given a fair trial. The defense also argued that the 50-year sentence handed down was ""manifestly unreasonable,"" while the prosecution had argued that it should be increased to 80 years to adequately reflect the gravity of his crimes. The appeals judges dismissed both claims, saying the sentence was fair and reasonable. Rights group Amnesty International welcomed the ruling, saying it sent a clear message to leaders around the world. ""The Court's landmark ruling underlines that no one is above the law,"" said Stephanie Barbour, head of Amnesty International's Centre for International Justice in The Hague. ""The conviction of those responsible for crimes committed during Sierra Leone's conflict has brought some measure of justice for the tens of thousands of victims. The conviction of Charles Taylor must pave the way for further prosecutions."" Role in atrocities . Taylor was the first former head of state to be convicted of war crimes since the Nuremberg trials that followed World War II. The trial chamber heard that rebels from the Revolutionary United Front, which the former president backed, committed horrendous crimes against Sierra Leone civilians, including children. Some were enslaved to mine the diamonds used to fund the rebels' fight. The presiding trial judge described Taylor as responsible for ""aiding and abetting as well as planning some of the most heinous and brutal crimes recorded in human history."" But Taylor said during his sentencing hearing in May 2012 that his role in the conflict was much different than represented. ""I pushed the peace process hard, contrary to how I have been portrayed in this court,"" he said. A pivotal figure in Liberian politics for decades, he became president in 1997 and was forced out of office under international pressure in 2003. He fled to Nigeria, where border guards arrested him three years later as he was attempting to cross into Chad. The United Nations and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up the special tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities. The court was moved to the Netherlands from Sierra Leone, where emotions about the civil war still run high. Opinion: Do war crimes trials really help victims?

"(CNN) -- Carnival Cruise Lines will fly all passengers on one of its cruises back to Florida after the ship suffered a generator failure while docked in the Caribbean. The experience on the Carnival Dream became something of a nightmare for some passengers Wednesday when power went off, some toilets stopped working, and no one was allowed to get off the vessel even though the ship was docked at Philipsburg, St. Maarten, in the eastern Caribbean. Although power had been restored and facilities were functioning again, the ship still couldn't leave port. Cruise passengers received a letter from the captain, according to a passenger who e-mailed a photo of the correspondence to CNN. Captain Massimo Marino told passengers they will be booked on flights to Orlando or another destination. Passengers with cars at Port Canaveral will be bused from Orlando to the facility about an hour away. The letter also offers passengers a three-day refund and a half-price cruise in the future. The captain said passengers could ""enjoy another day in beautiful St. Maarten"" or stay onboard for a ""full schedule"" of activities. ""We sincerely apologize for the disappointment this unexpected change has caused and regret we were unable to provide you with the fun and memorable cruise vacation we had in store for you,"" he wrote. In a written statement, Carnival said the ship's emergency diesel generator failed. The ship's next voyage was canceled, the cruise line said. Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen said Thursday that 4,300 guests were aboard the Dream along with about 1,300 crew members. Carnival's website puts the ship's capacity at 3,646 passengers, but that's based on only two people per cabin, and some cabins hold more, Gulliksen explained. There are also three- and four-person cabins aboard. Kris Anderson, a passenger on the ship and reporter for CNN affiliate WREG, said Thursday that passengers have been told they will be allowed off the ship to enjoy the island while flight arrangements are made. On Tuesday, Carnival announced it was conducting ""a comprehensive review"" of all of its 23 ships after a fire last month that crippled one of its ships in the Gulf of Mexico, leaving passengers stranded for days while the vessel was towed back to land. Carnival President and CEO Gerry Cahill said the probe will focus on the prevention, detection and suppression of fires, engine room redundancies, and what additional hotel facilities might be provided and might run off the emergency generators. His comments, posted on Carnival's website, were made at an annual cruise industry conference in Miami. 'Human waste all over the floor' After the problems began Wednesday, CNN was contacted by passengers describing the conditions. Gregg Stark, who is traveling with his wife and two young children, told CNN: ""There's human waste all over the floor in some of the bathrooms and they're overflowing -- and in the state rooms. The elevators have not been working. They've been turning them on and off, on and off."" An announcement over the ship's public address system said the crew was trying to fix the problem and was working on the generators, according to Stark. A few hours later, another announcement was made, saying the problem was worse than originally believed. ""We are not allowed off of the boat despite the fact that we have no way to use the restrooms onboard,"" Jonathan Evans of Reidsville, North Carolina, said in an e-mail early Thursday. ""The cruise director is giving passengers very limited information and tons of empty promises. What was supposed to take an hour has turned into 7-plus hours."" But Thursday afternoon, Carnival told CNN that based on conversations with the ship's management team, a look at service logs ""and extensive physical monitoring of all public areas, including restrooms, throughout the night, we can confirm that only one public restroom was taken offline for cleaning based on toilet overflow and there was a total of one request for cleaning of a guest cabin bathroom. ""Aside from that there have no reports of issues on board with overflowing toilets or sewage. The toilet system had periodic interruptions yesterday evening and was fully restored at approximately 12:30 a.m. this morning."" Five things we've learned about cruising . The Coast Guard was notified by Carnival that the Dream was experiencing generator issues. Carnival has not requested assistance from the Coast Guard, which has no jurisdiction in the ship's current location, Coast Guard Petty Officer Jon-Paul Rios told CNN. U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Ryan Doss said Carnival's original decision to keep passengers onboard was ""for accountability purposes. The last thing we want to do is have someone get left behind in St. Maarten by accident."" The Dream, based in Port Canaveral, Florida, was on a seven-day cruise. The ship, which is 1,000 feet long -- about the length of three football fields -- sailed from Port Canaveral on Saturday. It was scheduled to leave St. Maarten around 5 p.m. ET Wednesday.

Last month, an engine room fire left the Carnival Triumph crippled and adrift in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 4,200 people aboard. That scheduled four-day cruise stretched into eight days as tugs pulled the vessel into port in Alabama. Food was scarce, and passengers sweltered in the heat with no air conditioning. People aboard also reported overflowing toilets and human waste running down the walls in some parts of the ship. A class action lawsuit was filed against Carnival Corporation in the aftermath. Crippled cruise ship returns; passengers happy to be back . The Triumph is still undergoing repair at a shipyard in Mobile, Alabama, Carnival spokeswoman Joyce Oliva told CNN Thursday. ""We are now focused on the lessons we can learn from the incident and also what additional operational redundancies might be available,"" Cahill said at the cruise industry conference this week. Another ship, the Carnival Splendor, had a fire in 2010 due to ""a catastrophic failure of a diesel generator,"" Cahill noted. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, the chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, sent a letter Wednesday to Micky Arison, the chief executive officer of Carnival Corporation. ""The Coast Guard has responded to a string of 90 marine casualty incidents with passengers onboard Carnival ships in the last five years,"" the West Virginia Democrat wrote. ""It seems that Carnival has failed to take any meaningful course of corrective action after these continual incidents. This needs to change."" Rockefeller said the cost to the taxpayers for the Carnival Triumph incident was almost $780,000. Cahill said last week that the comprehensive review of the fleet ""is our highest priority."" He also emphasized that the vast majority of the time, cruises experience no such problems. Anderson said when he booked the cruise tickets for his family, some friends ribbed him about choosing Carnival, given what had happened with the Triumph. ""I said, 'What are the odds of it happening to two ships in such a short period of time?'"" he told CNN Thursday. ""Look what happened now."" How Carnival can clean up the PR mess .

"(CNN) -- Who say's crime doesn't pay? Boston's most infamous criminal, convicted mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger, generated well over $25 million in racketeering proceeds throughout his criminal career, according to paperwork filed in federal court. Bulger's criminal escapades spanned more than two decades while he doubled as an informant for the FBI in Boston. The notorious mobster began building capital off his criminal empire around 1972 and continued until around 2000, 5 years after he went on the lam after being tipped off by his rogue FBI informant to a pending indictment. A federal jury convicted Bulger in August on 31 counts of racketeering, extortion, and money laundering and ultimately ruled that Bulger participated in the murder of 11 people. He will be sentenced on November 13. The evidence presented at trial established that ""the proceeds from the Defendant's racketeering conspiracy totaled millions upon millions upon millions of dollars,"" according to the federal prosecutors' ""motion of forfeiture"" released on Friday. The motion breaks down Bulger's spoils that were spelled out in testimony from gangsters, former associates, drug dealers, convicted felons, and extortion victims during more than 41 days of trial this summer. David William Lindholm, a marijuana smuggler, testified he barely survived high-stakes a Russian-roulette-style drama when Bulger ordered one of his associates to fire a bullet past his head. Bulger then ordered his associate to load the chamber with one bullet. ""A bullet was put in the chamber it was spun and pointed at my head,"" said Lindholm. He lived to testify that Bulger extorted $250,000 from him. Business entrepreneur Michael Solimando testified that Bulger put a gun to his gut, and threatened to kill his family. Solimondo, 64, described how at one meeting Bulger took a machine gun and ""shoved it underneath the table, pointed at my stomach and my groin,"" and how he was forced to pay Bulger $400,000. The ways of 'Whitey' Another witness, real estate developer Richard Buccheri, used two fingers to mimic the a gun barrel as he described how Bulger ""takes a shotgun off the table and sticks it in my mouth. Then he took it out, punched me in the shoulder and said, 'Richard you're a stand-up guy. I'm not going to kill you.'"" But then, Buccheri said, Bulger ""puts a 45 to my head"" and demands $200,000 in 30 days, ""threatening to kill me and my family."" Convicted drug dealers testified that Bulger collected ""rent"" from criminal operatives, a crime tax that had to be paid to do drug business in South Boston during the Bulger era. In 2011, Bulger was found hiding out in Santa Monica, California, with his girlfriend -- and with nearly $822,000 in cash, 30 guns, some loaded, and an assortment of knives and a Taser. Before his conviction came down, Bulger waived his right to a forfeiture hearing. The government has moved to seize Bulger's personal assets that they say stemmed from a life of gambling and drug dealing, including jewelry, electronics, art, furniture, clothing and other items found in the Santa Monica apartment. For now, Bulger is allowed to keep a National Hockey League Stanley Cup ring that he claims was given to him as a gift, according to paperwork.","During decades as a mob boss, 'Whitey' Bulger generated well over $25 million, feds say .

"Greenville, South Carolina (CNN) -- Lauren Zanardelli and Graham Foster are the kind of customers the government needs to make Obamacare work. The chefs own and operate a bright orange hipster magnet called the Neue Southern Food Truck. The farm-to-table vehicle stands out in Greenville, South Carolina, even among the new gastropubs that dot the city's charming Main Street. Today Zanardelli and Foster are zooming around their rented kitchen on the edge of town, preparing deep-fried Brussels sprouts, Ramen with seaweed and pumpkin sweet rolls. They won't have time after their 12-hour work day to explore the new health insurance marketplaces that opened this morning, but they look forward to seeing what Obamacare can offer them. And that's good news for health care insurance companies. Young and fit people like Zanardelli, 31, and Foster, 28, have to buy into the system to support the law's mandate that all people must have health insurance next year. Under Obamacare, companies can no longer deny policies to people with pre-existing conditions, and some 48 million Americans are uninsured, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau figures. What insurance companies will save on medical costs for the healthier population will help pay for the older, sicker people who are entering into the insurance market for the first time. But because they're young -- and don't foresee getting sick any time soon -- some Millennials may decide to skip insurance and risk paying a fine. Zanardelli and Foster have health insurance now, but it's pricey and ""it covers nothing,"" Zanardelli said. She hasn't been to the doctor in years and shells out about $200 a month. Her policy doesn't cover prescriptions either. ""If it's not generic, I can't afford it."" She says her family warned her about this when she left her teaching job in Charlotte to follow her passion for cooking. ""One of the first things my parents said was that I was really going to miss that good health insurance, and they were right. I'm healthy, but I really do,"" Zaradelli said. ""Ultimately, though, it's worth it. ... This doesn't feel like work to me. I love what I do. New insurance will make this even better."" The owners of Neue Southern met in 2011 when they enrolled in the culinary arts program at Johnson and Wales University in Charlotte. The two chose to move to South Carolina after working under well-known chefs in New York. The foodie fast lane, they decided, wasn't for them. When they scanned the country for opportunities, the food trucks in their East Village neighborhood inspired them. Why not bring a slice of the East Village to Greenville, where Foster got his first taste of cooking in the kitchen of his German-born grandmother? They were true foodie pioneers. Zanardelli says the people of Greenville welcomed their European take on old Southern favorites, but when it comes to health insurance they may have been better off somewhere else. South Carolina ranks near the bottom in the nation when it comes to access to care and health outcomes, according to the latest edition of America's Health Rankings. While Obamacare is federal legislation, the Supreme Court ruled that states could decide how they would handle the implementation. Leaders in South Carolina have been downright antagonistic to the legislation. ""Just because the Supreme Court says something is constitutional doesn't make it constitutional,"" one South Carolina state senator, who introduced an anti-Obamacare bill this year, told the Spartanburg Herald-Journal. The senator's bill failed, as did others -- one of which would actually have made it a crime for a state or federal official to implement any provision of Obamacare -- but the state did successfully refuse to expand Medicaid. It has not set up its own health care marketplace. Obamacare exchanges 101: What you need to know . ""We don't talk politics around here because there goes half our client base, either way,"" Foster said while mixing the base for the Ramen. ""But politics aside... we need something better than what we have."" For the more than 726,000 people in South Carolina without insurance there are parts of the federal legislation that will help them. Many will be able to buy policies through the federal health insurance marketplaces. And many, such as the chefs of Neue Southern, will be eligible for tax breaks and subsidies to help them pay for any policies bought through these marketplaces. The policies themselves will also be much more comprehensive. All health insurance plans will now have to cover preventative health care and at least nine other kinds of care, including hospitalization, outpatient care, emergency services, mental health and substance abuse care, maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs, lab tests, rehab, and pediatric care. Premiums will vary depending on the depth of coverage. Out-of-pocket costs for an individual are capped at $6,350. Infographic: Obamacare insurance rates . When Zanardelli and Foster do get a break from work they say they will shop around and figure out which policy best fits their needs. Health care coverage could come in handy right now for Foster. He struggled with a double ear infection for weeks. A doctor at the local urgent care center told him ear drops would cost him $130; he paid to avoid permanent damage to his ears. Now he has a sinus infection. Unfortunately, even if he were to buy insurance through the exchanges today, the policies won't kick in until January. Not having insurance, they say, is not an option -- even if the fine would be a lot cheaper than the least expensive policy option. ""I think of this as an investment in our future health care,"" Zanardelli said. ""Most of the younger people we hear object to Obamacare are looking at the present and how it affects them now. We are relatively healthy, but in a few decades we will likely need medical attention."" ""We feel optimistic it will be something that can work better for us health wise and be affordable,"" she continued. ""That would be a beautiful thing.""","Insurance companies will save money on young to help pay for older, sicker population .

"(CNN) -- Western powers on Thursday were debating using military power against Syria's government to counter a chemical weapons attack in Damascus' suburbs last week. On Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama said there's no doubt that Syria launched chemical weapons attacks against its own people. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime has blamed the August 21 attack on rebels. Most recent: . -- The United States may have to take unilateral action against Syria after British lawmakers voted down a proposal for military action, a senior U.S. official said. -- British Prime Minister David Cameron was dealt a blow Thursday in his push for a strong response, including possible military action, against Syria after the House of Commons rejected the measure. -- The vote, 285-to-272, came just minutes after members of Parliament voted down a Labour Party motion calling for additional time for U.N. weapons inspectors to gather evidence over whether al-Assad's forces used chemical weapons in suburban Damascus. -- A closed-door meeting of the U.N. Security Council ended with no agreement on a resolution to address the crisis in Syria, a Western diplomat told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh on condition of anonymity. ""It was clear there was no meeting of minds, and no agreement on the text. It is clear that our approaches are very different and we are taking stock (of the next steps),"" the diplomat said. -- Members of the Security Council expect U.N. weapons inspectors to brief Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon shortly after they depart Syria on Saturday. Ban, in turn, will swiftly brief the Security Council on the findings, the diplomat said. Previously reported: . -- Cameron opened the emergency session of the House of Commons on Syria Thursday by saying the debate is about ""how to respond to one of most abhorrent uses of chemical weapons in a century"" -- not about regime change or invasion. -- Cameron told the House of Commons that the UK government would not act without first hearing from U.N. weapons inspectors, giving the United Nations a chance to weigh in and Parliament to have a vote. -- But ultimately, failing to act would give al-Assad a signal that he could use such weapons ""with impunity, Cameron said. -- The British government on Thursday published a summary of its intelligence assessment on Syria's alleged chemical weapons use, arguing that at least 350 people died in an attack in the Damascus area on August 21, and that there is no plausible culprit other than the Syrian government. It is ""highly likely"" that the Syrian government was behind the attack, the report said. -- The British government also published its legal reasoning for a strike on Syria Thursday, saying that it would be justified on humanitarian grounds. -- ""The use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime is a serious crime of international concern, as a breach of the customary international law prohibition on use of chemical weapons, and amounts to a war crime and a crime against humanity,"" the UK government's statement read. ""However, the legal basis for military action would be humanitarian intervention; the aim is to relieve humanitarian suffering by deterring or disrupting the further use of chemical weapons."" -- British members of parliament received an open letter from the Syrian government Thursday, urging them not to take any military action against Syria, the press office for House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said. -- The Syrian letter to British lawmakers compares the current situation to the march to war against Iraq a decade ago, and riffing on Shakespeare, saying: ""If you bomb us, shall we not bleed?"" It also says an attack on Syria would be illegal, and ""would automatically strengthen our common enemy, al Qaeda and its affiliates."" Chemical weapons in Syria: How did we get here? -- Al-Assad vowed Thursday to defend against any Western military attack. ""The threats of launching an aggression against Syria will increase its commitments,"" and ""Syria will defend itself against any aggression,"" he said, according to Syrian state TV. -- U.N. inspectors entered the eastern part of the Ghouta region outside Damascus on Thursday, Syrian activists said. The Ghouta area was hit by the August 21 attack, activists say. -- Al-Assad's claim that rebels were behind the August 21 chemical attack is impossible, Obama said on ""PBS NewsHour"" Wednesday. ""We do not believe that, given the delivery systems, using rockets, that the opposition could have carried out these attacks,"" Obama said. ""We have concluded that the Syrian government in fact carried these out. And if that's so, then there need to be international consequences."" -- Former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who along with President George W. Bush helped send the U.S. military into action in Iraq and Afghanistan, told the Fox Business Network on Wednesday that the White House has yet to justify potential strikes in Syria.","NEW: The United States may have to take unilateral action against Syria, says an official .

"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Did Wal-Mart's Mexican subsidiary pay bribes, in 2005 and earlier, to the Mexican officials who grant permits for stores like Wal-Mart? And did Wal-Mart cover up these actions for several years, after an internal investigation discovered the bribes, before finally reporting the internal investigation to the Department of Justice and the SEC last December? The answer, according to recent news accounts, is yes. This could mean that Wal-Mart violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, adopted in 1977, which forbids U.S. companies from paying bribes to foreign officials. If Wal-Mart violated the law, U.S. officials should prosecute. No one should be above the law, whether the law is sensible or not. Yet the public and policymakers should also consider whether the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is good policy. And despite good intentions -- particularly, the goal of reducing corruption -- it is not. The act is difficult to enforce on a consistent basis, since companies that wish to pay bribes can circumvent the law in numerous ways, mainly with minimal risk of exposure. So, most violations go undetected. The act therefore hurts companies that break the law clumsily and get caught, thereby creating a competitive advantage for companies that break the law cleverly and get away with it. The most likely outcome is therefore that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has minimal impact on bribes but enriches the least honest companies. And if the act deters bribes by U.S. companies operating abroad, that is even worse. The reason is that the threat of prosecution under the act discourages U.S. companies from doing business abroad in the first place. This holds especially with respect to poor countries where corruption -- pay to play -- is endemic. Thus foreign investment, along with the higher wages and increased competition this investment promotes, is less likely to occur in these countries, condemning their citizens to ongoing poverty. The act is also harmful, especially when it reduces bribes, because much bribery is an attempt to get around laws that make little sense in the first place. Such laws include barriers to entry, union protections that make firing or plant closures all but impossible, and excessive environmental, health and safety regulation. These policies have good intentions, but they are frequently so onerous that their main effect is to discourage economic growth, which is critical for alleviating poverty. These policies are a key cause of corruption; it is impossible to do business in some countries without paying bribes that limit the impact of costly regulations. The Wal-Mart example is a perfect illustration of this dynamic. Mexico has a messy permitting process for allowing companies like Wal-Mart to open new stores. This permitting barrier is bad for Mexicans because it reduces the number of new Wal-Marts or slows their opening. Mexicans therefore pay higher prices for the wide array of inexpensive goods sold by Wal-Mart. If these negatives were not enough, the act harms U.S. companies relative to those from other countries that do not face something like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Other countries have adopted similar laws in recent years, but enforcement is often weak. Corruption is a huge problem in many countries, especially the developing world. Much of the corruption, however, arises from excessive government that hurts economic productivity and creates the incentive to pay bribes. The best solution is to scale back these aspects of government. Since that is not always possible, however, it is better to allow companies from the United States and other rich countries to pay the bribes that diminish the negative impact of excessive government. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Miron.","Jeffrey Miron: Wal-Mart is facing allegations it covered up a bribery scandal .

"(CNN) -- Rather than getting the relaxing vacation they paid for, more than 3,000 passengers on Carnival Triumph have endured five days stranded in the Gulf of Mexico, smelling backed-up toilets and watching sewage slosh on deck. ""A floating petri dish"" is how one passenger, a doctor, put it. As tugboats bring the ship to Mobile, Alabama, on Thursday, many on board might be considering what to do next. Could Carnival passengers sue the cruise line? They could, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said, but whether the claim has merit will depend on the paperwork they signed when they purchased their ticket. Negligent infliction of emotional distress would be the main justification for a suit, said Jason R. Margulies, an experienced maritime lawyer based in Miami. Tensions are high on board. There was the stress inflicted by the fire in the engine room, which began the mess, a scary experience for sure. Apart from the uncomfortable situation with bad smells, there is a risk of health problems because of poor sanitation. And passengers have reported minor fights. All of this is justification for going to court, Margulies said. But it isn't that simple. Five things we've learned about cruising . What can make suing a cruise line complicated? Carnival has a prohibition on class-action suits in its tickets, information that wouldn't be obvious to passengers who didn't read the fine print when they bought tickets. U.S. courts have said that ship owners and operators cannot put that language on tickets. But Carnival, though headquartered in Miami, is incorporated outside the United States, partly in Panama and Great Britain, experts say. Carnival Triumph is a Bahamian-flagged vessel, so the Bahamas Maritime Authority is the primary investigative agency. Why did the rescue take five days? What else is detailed on the ticket? Carnival's ticket contract says the cruise line is not ""liable to the passenger for damages for emotional distress, mental suffering/anguish or psychological injury of any kind under any circumstances, except when such damages were caused by the negligence of Carnival and resulted from the same passenger sustaining actual physical injury, or having been at risk of actual physical injury."" While no physical injuries have been reported, if a passenger contracted a significant disease such as hepatitis from unsanitary conditions aboard on the ship, maritime trial attorney John H. Hickey believes, physical injury could be argued. ""I think that a case can be made that everyone on that ship is at risk of actual physical injury,"" he said. Opinion: What cruise lines don't want you to know . What else should a passenger consider? Would it take a long time to see a resolution after filing suit? It would be incredibly expensive for a lone plaintiff to sue. And no matter how a suit is brought, it would probably take two years for it to wind through court, Margulies said. But it could still be done. Consider the case of Costa Concordia, the cruise liner that ran aground off Italy in January 2011. Thirty-two people were killed. Many people from different countries sued the owners of the Concordia with varying results. In at least one example, the cruise liner reportedly offered to pay 11,000 euros to each of 235 French nationals affected. Is there another remedy? Could passengers be compensated by their travel insurance? Jason Clampet of travel site Skift.com said that's unlikely. ""Insurance really doesn't cover this sort of thing. Their trip wasn't interrupted, and they aren't incurring extra expenses ... so they can't be compensated that way,"" he said. Opinion: How Carnival can clean up the PR mess . What does a passenger have to weigh before moving forward? ""In the real world, a big company like Carnival is going to want to try to make these passengers as happy as possible as quickly as possible,"" Toobin said. The cruise line said it would give each passenger $500, a free flight home and a full refund for the trip and for most expenses on board, as well as a credit for another cruise. ""Do these people want to take what Carnival is offering and get on with their lives,"" Toobin asked, ""or do they want to get into a long legal struggle that may not yield the results they want?""

"(CNN) -- Elmore Leonard -- the award-winning mystery writer whose snappy dialogue, misfit characters and laconic sense of humor produced such popular works as ""Get Shorty,"" ""Hombre,"" ""Fifty-Two Pickup"" and ""Out of Sight"" -- has died, according to his literary agent, Jeffrey Posternak. He was 87. The cause of death was not given, but Leonard had suffered a stroke two weeks ago. According to his website, the author died at his home in Bloomfield Village, Michigan. Leonard's succinct writing style -- he favored brief exchanges of dialogue leavened with wit and a keen sense of person and place -- made him a favorite of Hollywood, which turned several Leonard novels and stories into films and TV programs. (The newest Leonard adaptation, the film ""Life of Crime,"" based on his novel ""The Switch,"" will premiere at the Toronto Film Festival next month.) He was also incredibly prolific. At the time of his death, he was at work on his 46th novel. Grit on wry: A dinner with Elmore and Peter Leonard . His style went down easy but could be hard to imitate. The writers on the TV show ""Justified,"" based on a Leonard character, wore wristbands with the initials ""WWED"" stamped on them, for ""What Would Elmore Do?"" Informed of this, he described it as ""flattering."" ""I have a picture of all them and they're at their desk and they all have a different book of mine and each one is reading to get my sound,"" he told CNN last year. ""That's very flattering, I'll tell you."" Leonard was born in New Orleans but raised in Michigan, where his father worked for General Motors. After college, Leonard went to work for a local advertising agency, where he spent his days writing copy about cars and trucks. His nights, however, were devoted to his own work: mainly westerns in the 1950s. Two of his stories, ""Three-Ten to Yuma"" and ""The Captives,"" were turned into movies. But Leonard kept his advertising job until 1961, rising at 5 a.m. to write before heading off to work. Despite his output -- and more movies, including ""Hombre"" with Paul Newman -- he said he didn't find his style until reading George V. Higgins' classic 1970 crime novel, ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle."" Higgins' book, which was turned into a 1973 movie, was almost all dialogue, much of it profane. ""I read it and I changed my style somewhat,"" he told CNN. ""Just somewhat. I started to use expletives where they belonged. I started to open my scenes with dialogue. Higgins set me free."" He also spent time with Detroit homicide detectives, where he continued to hone his ear. Leonard made his mark on film . All this came just in time. He'd written one crime novel, ""The Big Bounce,"" in 1966. Despite Leonard's bona fides, it was rejected 84 times and didn't see the light of day until being made into a 1969 movie. The new style gave his books new life -- and new fans. When the movies wanted crime stories with offbeat characters and settings, they knew to turn to Leonard. ""Get Shorty"" was made into a 1995 film starring John Travolta and Gene Hackman; ""Rum Punch,"" a 1992 novel, was turned into Quentin Tarantino's 1997 film ""Jackie Brown."" ""Out of Sight,"" which was made into a 1999 Steven Soderbergh film, helped rejuvenate George Clooney's movie career. In Leonard's stories, characters move from scene to scene, cracking wise while they do stupid, violent things. He thinks most crooks are dumb, and that dumb is funny. He likes a good caper and the violence seems to be almost incidental, more like an occupational hazard. The plots feature clever twists; the narrative style is so spare it reads like haiku. The simple beauty of it all can put a bullet through your heart. He created some of popular fiction's most memorable tough guys: trigger-happy federal marshal Raylan Givens, streetwise Hollywood wannabe Chili Palmer and smooth talking bank robber Jack Foley. A look inside Leonard's 45th novel, 'Raylan' In recent years, literary types took notice. Last year, the National Book Foundation awarded Leonard the 2012 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in recognition of his fiction. ""For over five decades, Leonard's westerns, crime novels, serialized novels, and stories have enthralled generations of readers,"" the foundation said in a statement. Leonard also received an Edgar Grand Master honor from the Mystery Writers of America and a Peabody Award, among other distinctions. But to Leonard, writing was just what he did. ""I don't have a trade,"" he told CNN. ""I don't teach or anything. I just love to make up characters and gradually build up a story around them."" For example, he said, the ""Out of Sight"" character Karen Sisco, later the lead of a TV series, was inspired by a newspaper photograph of a shotgun-toting Miami marshal. He also worked hard. Writing is rewriting, the old saying goes, and Leonard -- who wrote first drafts by hand -- would do three pages to get ""one clean, typed page with every word in place."" The key, he said, was to know when to stop. Wise advice from the man who wrote a book called ""10 Rules of Writing."" ""I don't want it to sound like writing,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Many are speculating whether an all-woman jury is a benefit or detriment to George Zimmerman, who stands accused in a Florida court for murdering Trayvon Martin. Women jurors are a recent phenomenon in U.S. history. In the 1960s, numerous states still prohibited women jurors. The thinking was that women's place was in the home, not in the jury box. Women's jury service wasn't placed on equal footing with men's until a 1975 U.S. Supreme Court decision (Taylor v. Louisiana). An earlier Florida case vividly illustrates this history. In the late 1950s, Gwendolyn Hoyt stood trial for murdering her husband with a baseball bat. Hoyt's guilt was determined by an all-male jury because at the time women in Florida had to volunteer for jury duty, while men were required to serve. Few questioned whether a female defendant tried by a jury of men confronted a ""jury of her peers."" Hoyt and her attorneys, however, did pose the question and appealed the guilty verdict all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that the all-male jury denied her due process. One of Hoyt's attorneys noted that when she asked her male acquaintances whether a man tried by an all-female jury would receive a fair trial, they answered with a resounding ""no!"" The 1961 Supreme Court ruling in the Hoyt case upheld a state's right to define women's jury service differently than men's. The court ruled that ""woman is still regarded as the center of home and family"" and for this reason a woman can ""be relieved from the civic duty of jury service."" Times certainly do change. The 1975 Taylor decision overturned Hoyt, and women were able to participate equally in the democratic act of deciding community justice. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled that peremptory challenges could no longer be based on a prospective juror's sex. That is, lawyers could no longer dismiss women (or men) from a jury panel because of their sex. Women have clearly broken the glass ceiling in the courtroom. But the public's attention to the all-female jury in the George Zimmerman case shows that we are not yet gender blind when it comes to the justice system. Many people ask right away -- how will these women weigh the evidence, deliberate and affect the outcome of the trial? The answer is likely to be that the all-female jury will have little or no effect on the ultimate decision in this case. Research shows that no one juror trait, including gender, is an accurate indicator of how a juror will vote. Rather -- and savvy trial lawyers know this -- the best predictor of whether a juror will side with the prosecution or defense is a mix of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, political ideology, personality, attitudes, and so on. Jury selection experts understand as well how the complex mix is closely tied to the specific issues at stake in a particular trial. Jury composition alone rarely shapes the verdict in a trial. For example, a 2007 review of the scholarship on jury selection reported that the backgrounds and attitudes of jurors predict less than 15% of verdicts. Women are now full citizens when it comes to jury service. If a man is being tried by an all-woman jury, he is likely being tried by a jury of his peers. The gender makeup of the jury is not likely to be pivotal in determining the verdict in the Zimmerman trial. The evidence is what matters in the outcome. But our public attention to the fact of an all-female jury shows that we are still conditioned to think in gendered ways. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Holly McCammon.","An all-female jury will hear the George Zimmerman case in Florida .

"(CNN) -- A Steubenville, Ohio, teenager was classified as a sex offender on Friday, six months after he and a fellow high school football player were convicted of raping a drunk 16-year-old girl, a court official said. Judge Thomas Lipps on Friday classified Ma'lik Richmond as a tier II sex offender, Jefferson County, Ohio, juvenile court administrator Joe Colabella said. This is the same status -- between a less restrictive tier I and a more serious tier III -- that Trenton Mays, who was convicted in the same case, received in June. Under his new classification, Richmond is required to report to his local sheriff's office every six months for the next 20 years. In March, Richmond and Mays -- who were 16 and 17, respectively, at the time -- were convicted after a trial that divided the football-crazed Rust Belt town of Steubenville. Two teens found guilty in Steubenville rape case . Lurid text messages, social media posts, as well as cell phone pictures and videos helped raise the national profile of the case, which revolved around Richmond and Mays' actions during a series of end-of-summer parties in August 2012. It attracted the attention of bloggers, who questioned everything from the behavior of the football team to the integrity of the investigation. At the heart of the case was the question of whether the victim, who testified she remembered little, was too drunk to understand what was happening to her and to consent. Defense attorneys questioned the victim's credibility, as well as whether media coverage of the case tainted testimony. Prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter agreed the girl was ""substantially impaired,"" before adding, ""The things that made her an imperfect witness -- that she doesn't remember a lot -- made her, in every sense of the word, a perfect victim."" Lipps, a visiting juvenile judge from another Ohio county, ultimately made the verdict in the case, which was not tried before a jury. Richmond was sentenced to a minimum of one year in a juvenile correctional facility. Mays, who was additionally found guilty of disseminating a nude photo of a minor, got two years. The Department of Youth Services will rule whether the two boys will be detained even longer than those prescribed sentences, Lipps said, adding it will depend on their behavior and rehabilitation.

"(CNN) -- There's no shortage of promising features expected in the next iPhone: A brand-new iOS 7 operating system, a better camera and processor, and possibly even a fingerprint sensor for added security. But the latest rumor is the most eye-catching. The next iPhone could also come in gold. Well, a classy gold-toned hue, anyway. According to recent reports in AllThingsD and iMore, Apple's next iPhone will likely be available with a white face and gold-colored back and edges. So far, iPhones have only come in silver, black and white, plus an array of colorful ""bumper"" options following the disclosure of its iPhone 4 antenna problems. The new color was described to AllThingsD as an ""elegant"" gold tone -- ""think champagne, not ingot,"" the source said. If these reports are true, once-rebellious Apple may be further embracing its products' status as symbols of wealth. Selling a gold-colored iPhone could be popular in countries like China and India, where Apple and Google are fighting it out to be the dominant player in their still-booming smartphone markets. India and China account for 60% of the global gold jewelry market, and the demand is growing, according to a recent report from the World Gold Council. ""Gold is a popular choice in many markets, particularly in Asia where Apple has a stated goal of growth, so this seems to be a natural move,"" said Massimiliano Pogliani, CEO of luxury phone company Vertu, in an e-mail to CNN. ""Gold is a colour that is always in demand, whether for jewellery, watches or fashion. It is therefore a natural extension to Apple's colour palette and something that perhaps nods to the premium end of the mobile phone market where Vertu is,"" he added. ""Gold in colour falls short of using gold as a material, though."" Gold phones have been used to show power and wealth long before they became mobile or even cordless. In 1930, Pope Pius XI received a solid gold rotary telephone inlaid with mother-of-pearl as a gift from the United States. A U.S. telecom company later presented Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista with a gold-plated telephone, an event fictionalized in ""The Godfather: Part II."" Although many professionals in the United States seem to now own one, the sleek-looking iPhone remains an expensive status symbol in many places. The demand has created a market for counterfeit iPhones, and there are entire fake Apple Stores in China. Manufacturers have struggled over the past two decades to make luxury phones a must-have for people who want to flaunt their wealth. Nokia started its Vertu line in 1998, producing an array of phones slathered in precious metals and diamonds. The company's most expensive offering was a $334,000 gold and black feature phone framed by a diamond, ruby and emerald snake. Pogliani says Vertu customers are typically ""affluent, outward-looking global citizens"" and entrepreneurs. The company's single biggest market is China. Instead of building a phone from scratch, luxury retailer Stuart Hughes takes existing BlackBerrys and iPhones and creates new casings for them fashioned from gold, titanium and diamonds. A Chinese businessman commissioned a $15 million phone from Hughes. The resulting iPhone 5 is solid gold with 600 diamonds, plus a 26-carat black diamond for the home button. But phones are not watches or sports cars. The technology ages fast, and the devices get supplanted by faster, smarter models every year. These speedy development cycles mean the big spenders who coughed up thousands for blinged-out phones five years ago are stuck with devices that look good making phone calls but can't connect to the Internet. So a gold-colored iPhone could be a nice option for people who want to own the latest model and still stand out. ""It seems Apple [is] doing an anodized finish, which can look like real gold but unpolished like jewelry,"" said Hughes, the luxury gadget maker, in an interview. ""I think if the Apple rumors are true, a gold phone will be beautiful. And that's coming from me, who has made a massive run of them over the years.""","Apple's next iPhone could be available for the first time in a gold color .
It is already possible to get a real gold iPhone for about $35,000 .
Gold phones may be an attempt to appeal customers in India and China .

"(CNN) -- A man who roasted his pet dog to enjoy as a meal with his family and friends escaped prosecution after authorities in New Zealand determined the animal was killed humanely. Auckland SPCA officers found the charred body of a Staffordshire terrier cooking in this barbecue pit. ""We were in a dilemma at seeing something we were fairly upset about -- but being in a position of being able to do absolutely nothing about it,"" said Garth Halliday, of the Auckland Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, on Monday. The SPCA -- which investigates acts of animal cruelty and presses charges -- responded to the house in Mangere, south of Auckland. There, officers found the charred body of a Staffordshire terrier cooking in a barbecue pit.  Watch why owner made decision » . ""They had had the dog for a while, but the man told us his wife was getting tired of the dog. He was becoming a pest,"" Halliday said. ""They decided to get rid of him. But instead of bringing him to the SPCA -- which we recommend -- they decided to have a meal, and cook and eat him."" The family is from Tonga where eating a dog is not uncommon, Halliday said. ""He didn't think he was doing anything wrong,"" he said. Is eating dog meat acceptable? Sound Off below . The incident occurred in February. For the next few months, the SPCA looked into whether the man ought to be charged for the killing. Over the weekend, the organization decided it couldn't because the animal had been killed humanely. The man, Halliday said, struck the dog in the head with a hammer, rendering it unconscious. He then slit its throat. ""That is the normal way -- if one can use that word -- that animals are killed all over the world,"" Halliday said. And under New Zealand's Animal Welfare Act, it is legal to kill an animal if it is slaughtered swiftly and painlessly. Dr Malakai Koloamatangi, a Tongan cultural expert from the University of Canterbury, told CNN affiliate TVNZ that dog meat is a delicacy enjoyed mostly by young men in his homeland. Still, the case infuriated and repulsed many New Zealanders. ""It's appalling,"" said Gracie Williams of Auckland. ""As an animal lover, I am sickened. The law needs to be changed."" Auckland Mayor John Banks, an animal rights activist, told reporters that rather than a new law, what is needed is better education of local customs. In the end, the SPCA closed the case without charges. ""We talked to the people. We told them that although it's not against the law, it is against the general culture of the country to actually kill and eat your own pet dog,"" Halliday said.","Man had roasted his pet dog to enjoy as a meal with his family and friends .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG Live lawyers rested their defense case in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial, setting the scene for closing arguments to be delivered in a Los Angeles courtroom starting Monday. ""We're in the 9th inning,"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos told jurors Wednesday afternoon, the 81st day of testimony in the trial to decide if Jackson's last concert promoter is liable in the singer's death. Katherine Jackson and grandchildren Prince, Paris and Blanket contend AEG Live executives negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Murray, who is set to be freed from jail next month, did not testify in the five-month-long trial because he indicated he would invoke his constitutional right to refuse to answer questions while his appeal is pending for his criminal conviction. While the trial has been held in a small courtroom with seating limited to just 60 by the fire marshal, the judge decided Wednesday that the three days of closing arguments will be delivered in a larger courtroom that can seat hundreds. Lawyers for Jackson's mother and three children will call two more witnesses before resting their rebuttal case Thursday. Dr. Allan Metzger, who treated Jackson for nearly three decades, is set to take the stand Thursday morning. Jackson's pain was real, doctor testifies . AEG Live lawyers played video of Metzger's deposition testimony as their last witness Wednesday, but Jackson lawyers say they want to ask him questions not covered when the deposition was recorded last year. Metzger said in his deposition that Jackson would ""doctor shop"" and that he kept details of treatments by other physicians a secret. ""Michael would never tell me what he was doing,"" he said. AEG Live lawyers contend Jackson's secrecy about his drug use made it impossible for its executives to know that Dr. Murray posed a danger to the singer as he prepared for his comeback concerts. Murray told investigators that he gave Jackson infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol almost every night for the last two months of his life to treat his insomnia. The coroner ruled Jackson's June 25, 2009, death was caused by a propofol overdose. ""Michael would seek out avenues of sleep helpers and that's another aspect of his secrecy,"" Metzger testified. ""I never did know what he did when he wasn't in L.A."" Jackson was ""secretive about medicine, secretive about procedures, secretive about all kinds of stuff, which was part of his mystique,"" he said. Metzger described a phone call from Jackson on February 26, 2009, four months before his death. It was a month after he signed a contract with AEG Live to do his ""This Is It"" comeback tour that would debut in London in July. ""It was more of an anxiety call, about his health and how he was going to deal with all the 30 or 50 shows,"" Metzger said. ""I don't think at that time he knew how many shows it would be."" Jackson was ""fearful because this is it and he needed to do a lot of perfectionizing,"" Metzger said. ""He wanted it to be something that had never been done before and it had to be great, so he had a lot of pressure from himself."" Jackson ""wanted to redeem Michael Jackson"" and ""go out with a flash,"" he said. The pop icon was ""still terribly hurt"" about the child molestation trial that ended in his acquittal four years earlier, he said. Odd twist in trial . ""He was one of the most recognized names in the world and he wanted it to stay that way,"" Metzger testified. Jackson's biggest worry was ""that he was going to have a hell of a time sleeping and what are we going to do."" He had a long history of not being able to sleep between shows on a tour, he said. Metzger visited Jackson at his Los Angeles home on April 18, 2009 -- two months before his death -- to discuss ""his profound sleep disorder,"" the doctor said. The doctor said he suggested they find a sleep expert in London, where his first 50 shows were scheduled, who would use ""safe modalities for sleep."" Metzger conferred with other doctors in Los Angeles, hoping for recommendations to help Jackson. ""I batted zero,"" he testified. ""Nobody had any specific people for me to call."" Jackson told Metzger he wanted someone to give him intravenous medicine that would put him to sleep. ""I can't sleep without something special,"" he told him. Propofol is infused intravenously. ""I told him it was dangerous and potentially life threatening,"" Metzger said. He warned Jackson that it should only be used in a hospital because he could overdose, have an allergic reaction in a hotel, be given a wrong medication or develop an infection. ""It just isn't the right thing to do,"" he said he told Jackson. A nurse who tried to help Jackson find sleep with vitamin infusions testified last month that Jackson became convinced that propofol was the only cure for his insomnia. Cherilyn Lee said Jackson asked her on April 19, 2009 -- a day after his meeting with Metzger -- to find an anesthesiologist who could put him to sleep him with propofol. Lee, like Metzger, refused the request, warning him it was unsafe. She testified that she told Jackson that any doctor who would give him propofol at home didn't care about him and was just doing it for the money. Jackson lawyers contend it was around the same time that Dr. Murray agreed to take to job. Just over two weeks later -- on May 6 -- an AEG Live executive wrote in an e-mail saying that it was a ""done deal"" that Murray was being hired for $150,000 a month to serve as Jackson's full-time physician. Jackson lawyers began their rebuttal case Wednesday afternoon by calling Los Angeles Police Detective Scott Smith, who testified that he concluded Murray's motive in Jackson's homicide was the $150,000 monthly salary he was to get from AEG Live. Jackson's fatal search for sleep . ""Information was obtained that revealed that Dr. Murray financially was in ruins, was losing his house in Las Vegas, had a lien against his pool, was arrears in child support for multiple children to multiple women,"" Smith said. ""Financially, he was just a mess."" Jackson lawyers argue that AEG Live executives created a conflict of interest with the structure of their agreement with Murray, which provided that he could be fired if the concerts were delayed or canceled. He was too dependent upon the pay to refuse to administer the risky propofol infusions which Jackson was convinced he needed to prepare for the tour, they argue. The key reason Jackson lawyers called Smith was to refute a statement made by Kathy Jorrie, the lawyer who helped negotiate and write the contract between AEG Live and Murray. Smith, who interviewed Jorrie during his investigation of Murray, wrote in his report that she told him that the London concerts were ""only the beginning, that Michael Jackson was going to do a world tour that was to last two to three years."" Jorrie testified last month that she never told police there was a planned world tour. ""If Detective Smith were to come in here and say you made that statement he would be lying?"" Jackson lawyer Brian Panish asked Jorrie. ""He would be mistaken,"" Jorrie replied. In court Wednesday, Smith testified that ""she did state that there was going to be a world tour that would last two to three years."" He said it was reflected in his handwritten notes, as well as the typewritten summary of his interview with the lawyer for AEG Live. Evidence that AEG Live and Jackson intended to take his tour around the world is important if the jury decides the company should pay damages in the singer's death. An entertainment expert hired by the Jacksons estimated he would have earned $1.6 billion if he had not died -- mostly from that world tour. It represents lost income that jurors could order AEG Live to pay the family in damages. Jackson lawyers said they may show jurors previously unseen raw video of Jackson's last rehearsals after they call Dr. Metzger to the witness stand Thursday. They said they expect to rest their case at the end of the day. Judge Palazuelos will read several hours of jury instructions on Friday, guidance intended to help jurors find their way through a complicated case that could take weeks to deliberate.

"(CNN) -- Danish driver Allan Simonsen died in a high-speed crash at the famous Le Mans 24 Hour endurance race, organizers said Saturday. Simonsen, 34, one of the most experienced sports car drivers in the world, was competing for Aston Martin in the GTE-Am class. He was at the wheel -- less than 10 minutes into the race -- when his car left the circuit on the Tertre Rouge corner and crashed heavily into the safety barriers. Simonsen was immediately treated at the scene before being taken to the circuit's medical center where he died shortly afterwards, officials said. ""The Automobile Club de l'Ouest wishes to express its great sadness following this incident, and extends its deepest condolences to the family and those close to Allan Simonsen,"" read a statement. Simonsen was competing for the seventh time in the Le Mans 24-race and his teammates were fellow Danes Christoffer Nygaard and Kristian Poulsen. The trio had won their class in the season opener for the World Endurance Championship at Silverstone and claimed pole position for Le Mans in their category in qualifying earlier this week. After the accident, the race was halted for an hour before resuming with Simonsen's Aston Martin teammates -- they have five entries -- still racing despite the tragedy. ""At the specific request of his family, the team will continue to participate in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in tribute to Allan,"" read a statement on the official Aston Martin Racing website.

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis ignited a firestorm on the Internet with a few words about gay and lesbian people that seemed to suggest a new church position on homosexuality. I say ""seemed to"" because it would only appear new to someone who was unfamiliar with the old position. Speaking to a gang of reporters bringing up the rear of his plane on the way home from his quotific visit to Rio de Janeiro, the pope was asked about his recent reference to a ""gay lobby"" among the curial staff in Rome. That phrase is already the source of some confusion. The pope responded that although a ""gay lobby,"" as in an inter-curial pressure group -- for or against more acceptance of gay Catholics, who can say? -- might be an issue, he did not have a problem with men and women who are homosexual. ""If they accept the Lord and have good will, who am I to judge them? They shouldn't be marginalized. The tendency (to homosexuality) is not the problem ... they're our brothers."" What we learned about Pope Francis in Brazil . Speaking about homosexuality so frankly was remarkable in and of itself, but nothing the pope said deviated from current Catholic catechism. Although it regards homosexual acts as ""intrinsically disordered,"" church teaching demands that gay and lesbian people be accepted with ""respect, compassion, and sensitivity."" ""Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided,"" reads the catechism. ""These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition."" The catechism is a little more nuanced, and less unsightly, than the standard ""hate the sin, love the sinner"" platitude, but it doesn't say much more and it's far less than most lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Catholics would like to hear from their church. Pope Francis was merely reiterating this teaching in his wonderfully straightforward, cut-through-the-gobbledygook manner. That's not to say that his remarks don't suggest a different emphasis in the church's tone and pastoral approach to gay and lesbian Catholics that will surely be welcome. Francis places the emphasis first on solidarity (""they're our brothers"") and refers to the redemption and mercy all of us require and are capable of achieving. And as a practical ecclesiastical matter, his comments also argue that the ""duty"" to discourage the vocations of men with ""deep-seated homosexual tendencies"" may be en route to the ""don't ask, don't tell"" historical rag and bone shop. Other groups of disaffected Catholics can also take heart from the pope's unfiltered comments on the plane. He suggested that his cardinal action squad of curial reformers will also be looking at the way the church has treated Catholics who, for whatever reason, could not annul their marriages. Divorced and remarried Catholics have long been cut off from the sacramental and communal life of the church. Francis clearly wants to find a way to bring them home. Opinion: What the pope left out about women . Women can also be hopeful that Francis hears their lamentations regarding how they have been cut off from leadership roles in the church. Although he suggested that he had little inclination to return to the issue of women's ordination, he said the church still has far to go in developing a real theology that explains the importance of women in the church. What that means practically speaking remains to be seen. Let's hope that what does not become lost as his comments on homosexuality are parsed, turned over and otherwise manhandled by the media in the coming days, is the pope's keen attention during his World Youth Day visit to issues of economic injustice and the importance of political and social dialogue. Asked why he did not spend so much time on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage while in Rio, he said the church's teaching on such matters are already clear. This pope may be interested in moving at least rhetorically away from cultural stalemates and on to other issues that have also long been a preoccupation of the church: fighting poverty and human deprivation, creating political and economic opportunity, the just and sustainable stewardship of creation. In Rio he spoke frequently on social justice and alleviating poverty, asking all to give of their talents to respond to the world's aching needs in a country where those needs and inequities are obvious. In Rio, Francis expressed his hope for a ""culture of encounter,"" as he described it. That's an encounter across gay and straight lines, political and class lines, self-drawn lines between secularists and the faithful, borders between the haves and have-nots. As important as his off-the-cuff comments on the plane were -- and might turn out to be in the future -- his message of solidarity and his call to action on social injustice and economic inequality had a just claim to its share of the bandwidth on Twitter this week. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin Clarke.","Kevin Clarke: Pope Francis' remarks about gays aren't a new position on homosexuality .
Clarke: His talking frankly was startling, but calling for compassion for gays is not new .
Clarke: The church may change its tone and approach to gay and lesbian Catholics, however .
But pope's call in Rio for action on social injustice and poverty was equally important, he says ."
"(CNN) -- The Facebook photo, grainy and blurred, shows a boy in his Cub Scout uniform standing in the sun on the side of the road, his right arm in a stiff salute as cars pass by in Woodlawn, Virginia. The caption tells the rest of the story. Nine-year-old Lane Snow salutes the two-mile funeral procession Thursday for Virginia State Police Trooper Andrew Fox. The trooper, a graduate of Virginia Tech, was run over and killed while directing traffic at the state fair earlier this month. When the photo landed in Virginia Tech police Lt. George Jackson's inbox, he knew it would be a hit. Jackson manages the social media accounts for the college police department and posted the photo Friday in two places on the department's Facebook page. He asked fans to share the photo ""and see how many likes we can get for this young Boy Scout and his tribute to Trooper Fox!"" The first day, the image of Lane Snow's salute received 15,000 shares. The next day it had 45,000. By Tuesday it had been shared more than 68,000 times and growing, reaching an estimated 4 million people, according to Facebook's own analytics, Jackson told CNN. He had no explanation for the numbers of shares except to say the comments reveal a community who supported Snow's character. Lane Snow didn't know trooper Fox, but he told local station WDBJ7 he did it because ""I was sorry that Andrew Fox died."" Snow's parents told the station he came up with the idea to dress in uniform and salute the procession on his own. Everyone who saw it was touched, including Fox's widow, who saw Snow saluting as her car passed, WDBJ reported. It was a pure and touching gesture, Jackson said. In an interview with CNN, Jackson said he wanted to bring awareness and attention to the state police and Fox's family as a measure of support. ""I just remembered how it felt to have lost an officer. The community rallied around us,"" Jackson said. At Snow's Cub Scout meeting Monday night, 10 officers from various agencies -- some of whom knew Fox personally -- showed up to thank Snow in person, said Cub Master Darrell Lineberry. Lane Snow told the local station that he wants to be a policeman when he grows up, ""just like Andrew Fox.""","Photo of cub scout saluting funeral procession goes viral on Facebook; over 68,000 shares .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Three weeks ago, a man behaving strangely in a city subway station in Hong Kong attracted the attention of police, fearing he may be a terrorist plotting a train attack. When police searched him, they found he was engaged in terror of another kind -- a camera rigged into the sole of his shoe carried pictures into a hard drive strapped to his thigh, according to local press reports. The suspect was a video voyeur, rigged to take shots up women's skirts. ""We saw the man walking suspiciously and weirdly,"" Bowen Leung Yiu-kwong, a senior inspector at the police's railway district, told the South China Morning Post. ""He was later seen stalking a woman with his leg lifted up."" Hong Kong police have arrested 38 people for ""up-skirt"" photo taking on the city's Mass Transit Railway, or MTR, during the first half of this year. While that's down slightly from the 41 arrested during the same period last year, the incident shows how sexual predators are using technology to become more creative in their criminal activity. ""Some offenders [commit] 'photo under skirt' crimes by attempting to hide their activities by concealing pinhole cameras inside bags, newspapers, and even shoes which they then activate by way of connecting hand operated leads in their pockets,"" a press officer from the Hong Kong Police Department told CNN. Professor Karen Joe Laidler, director of the Center for Criminology at the University of Hong Kong, says these criminals are not opportunists, such as criminals who grope women on crowded trains; rather, they are executing planned attacks. ""The culprits of this type of crime do tend to plan, are creative in their efforts and are generally repeat offenders. There are many websites containing pictures of this type of material, some faked but some real so there is obviously a demand for those types of images,"" she said. Depending on what crime offenders taking ""up-skirt"" photos are convicted of, loitering or disorder in public places, they face a maximum fine of either HK$10,000 ($1,283) or HK$5,000 ($642) and a prison sentence of six months or one year, respectively. Indecent assault such as groping, on the other hand, carries a sentence of 10 years in prison. Official Police Department statistics show that in the first half of 2011 there were 68 reported cases of indecent assault on the MTR, compared with 72 during the same time period in 2010. ""Police deploy a combination of both uniform and plainclothes officers in the railway system in order to provide a high profile overt visual deterrence as well as a covert presence designed to catch offenders in the act, particularly during the busy rush hour periods,"" a police press officer said. Police say most indecent assault and ""up-skirt"" photos taken on the MTR occur in train compartments and on escalators during rush hour. Dr. Laidler noted that ""the crowded conditions, the anonymity and ease of escape are all factors"" that makes this environment attractive to predators. In order to deal with the problem of sexual assaults on public transportation, many cities have implemented train compartments reserved for female passengers only. Some public transit systems in Japan began offering ""women-only"" train cars a decade ago to ""prevent groping and other problematic behavior,"" and to create a sense of safety, according to the Tokyo Metro website. Seoul is implementing a similar system in the near future in response to a 77% increase in sexual crimes between 2009 and 2010, according to the Korea Herald. Other countries, like Indonesia, Mexico, Egypt and Brazil have also introduced some form of segregated public transportation to deal with harassment. In January Hong Kong's Legislative Council debated the issue of introducing female-only subways cars to the city. The Hong Kong Women Development Association continues to actively campaign for female-only passenger cars. But Amy Yeung, Executive Secretary of the Association for the Advancement of Feminism, doubted the effectiveness of segregated passenger cars saying their existence may lead to women who ride in non-segregated cars to be blamed if they are harassed. ""In countries who have [female only subway cars], there are not enough cars, especially during the rush hour. Females are forced to ride in the normal cars. If they are harassed people say, 'Why didn't you use the special car?'"" she said.","Sexual predators are using technology to become more creative in their criminal activity .

"(CNN) -- When Lydia Ko swung to victory at the Canadian Women's Open Sunday, she became the youngest-ever winner in LPGA Tour history. Currently the world's top-ranked female amateur golfer, Ko, 15, also became the tour's fifth-ever amateur champion -- its first since 1969. The glove she wore during her final round will become part of the World Golf Hall of Fame's collection. ""I was most impressed with just her demeanor,"" fellow player Stacey Lewis told reporters in quotes carried by LPGA.com. Lewis is ranked second in the Women's World Golf Rankings. ""I mean you would have never known that it was the final round of an LPGA event. She played like she had been there before."" Ko's success followed triumphs earlier this year at the U.S. Women's Amateur in Ohio and the New South Wales open at the Australian LPGA.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has told Manchester United's Wayne Rooney to decide where his future lies after the England striker starred in a goalless draw between the two teams on Monday. Chelsea have seen two bids rejected by United for Rooney, who has been the subject of almost constant speculation throughout the transfer window. When asked in his post-match press conference whether he wanted Rooney to publicly make his intentions clear, Mourinho responded: ""Yes, I would."" Rooney started for United in David Moyes' first competitive match at Old Trafford since replacing Alex Ferguson as manager. Moyes is adamant Rooney will remain in Manchester, but it did not stop Mourinho saying last week that Chelsea would return with a third bid for the former Everton player. Rooney, 27, joined United in 2004 and he is the fourth highest goalscorer in the club's history, having found the net 197 times in 404 appearances. Mourinho intimated he had been alerted to Rooney's desire to leave United and now he has called on the player to conclude the issue once and for all. ""I think the person that started the story has to finish the story,"" continued the former Inter Milan and Real Madrid coach. ""A club like us, a manager like me, the people that work in the club with me, we are not silly to try to get a player from a big club, a big club that doesn't sell what they don't want to sell. ""We are not silly to try something if somebody didn't start [it]."" Blog: Can Moyes meet United challenge? ""Do you want me to tell you what for me is the most important thing?"" Mourinho continued. ""It is that he played very well. ""He was a real professional, playing for his club, playing for the club that pays him. He tried to win, tried to score. He was fantastic. ""After that he wants to leave? He has to say. Or he decided now he doesn't want to leave any more. His problem. But I praise him because he was fantastic, he played a fantastic match in difficult circumstances."" The draw leaves Chelsea top of the English Premier League with two wins and a draw from their opening three matches. Defending champions United have four points, a win and a draw, from their opening two matches.","Jose Mourinho tells Manchester United's Wayne Rooney to decide where his future lies .

"(CNN) -- She grew up in grinding poverty, losing both her parents at a tender age but 14-year-old whizz-kid Maud Chifamba has defied adversity and hardship to break academic records. Against all odds, the extremely bright teenager has written history as last week she became the youngest ever university student in Zimbabwe -- as well as the whole of southern Africa, according to education officials. Maud, who was born on November 19, 1997, has just started her studies toward a Bachelor of Accountancy Honors Degree at the University of Zimbabwe, the country's oldest and most esteemed educational institution. Her intellectual prowess and hard work have earned her a four-year scholarship of nearly $10,000 after she excelled at last year's Advanced Level exams. Now, one week into her new life at the university, softly-spoken Maud already feels settled. ""I'm really enjoying it,"" she says with striking modesty. ""It's better than what I expected. I'm just enjoying all the lectures."" Read related: 'The future of Zimbabwe is bright' But before deservedly claiming a spot inside the university's vast lecture halls, finding herself amongst much older students, Zimbabwe's wunderkind had to overcome tremendous financial and social challenges. Born to a poor family in the Hunters resettlement community in Chegutu, central Zimbabwe, Maud lost her father when she was just five years old. Her mother also passed away last year. Her two brothers, who are general workers at a farm, were unable to pay the fees required to keep her at formal school so Maud started studying vigorously at home all by herself. Armed with determination, Maud put all her efforts into studying, embarking on a disciplined reading routine that lasted for several hours each day. ""I studied very hard,"" she remembers. ""For the biggest part of the day and even into the night,"" adds Maud. Maud says the death of her parents made her realize that she would have to take her destiny into her own hands. ""It really motivated me to work harder because there was no one to take care of me except myself in the future,"" says Maud. ""That was ... a motivator for me to have something to do with my life."" Gifted with natural intelligence, Maud's promising future was apparent from an early age. Her remarkable aptitude impressed her primary school teachers who decided to move her up from Grade 3 to Grade 6. Aged nine, she took her final primary school examinations, where she obtained top marks for all of her subjects. Lacking financial support to undertake her high school education, Maud studied on her own and completed her Ordinary Level in just two years after skipping two forms. Read: How 'Afropreneurs' will shape Africa's future . Her hard work paid off last December when she scored 12 points at her A-Level exams, an astonishing feat that earned the 14-year-old girl a place at the Harare-based University of Zimbabwe. ""It's phenomenal, especially if you consider that for her A-Levels she was not in formal school,"" says Gershem Pasi, the commissioner general of the Zimbabwean Revenue Authority, the body that's now sponsoring Maud's university education. ""She was just reading by herself at home and her brothers only managed to pay the examination fee."" Munyaradzi Madambi, dean of students at the University of Zimbabwe, describes Maud as a ""very warm and polite young woman,"" whose intelligence and maturity shines through. ""(She is) confident, efficacious and unique in the sense that you don't normally expect this position among kids from underprivileged backgrounds,"" he says. Madambi says the university is committed to helping its wonder student develop into a balanced individual while fulfilling her dreams. ""We are making sure that she grows up to be a well-moulded, mature adult but of course without really suffocating her or putting her under any pressure,"" he says. Zimbabwe has an adult literacy rate of 92%, which is one of the highest in Africa, according to UNICEF. Madambi says people in the country have an ""incredible and insatiable appetite for education."" ""Normally those that come from underprivileged backgrounds, their desire is really to work hard and excel and of course Maud is an exceptional case in terms of intellectual prowess,"" he says. Maud is now on course to conquer even greater heights, becoming Zimbabwe's youngest ever accountant when she graduates in four years time. ""My dream job is to become an accountant,"" she says.

"(CNN) -- As we store more and more of our personal lives on smartphones, mobile security is becoming increasingly crucial. A password offers some protection, but it may not deter a serious hacker. For users of Apple devices, more help might be on the way. According to several reports, the next version of Apple's mobile operating system suggests future iPhones will have biometric scanners that read fingerprints. A user could register his or her prints with the device, then place a thumb on the home button to unlock the phone. Fingerprint verification could also add an extra layer of security when making mobile payments, for example. A biometric sensor has been a rumored feature on the next iPhone for months. But the rumors got a boost when a beta version of iOS 7 was released Monday night to Apple developers. At least one developer found a folder called ""BiometricKitUI"" containing lines of code that made numerous references to ""fingerprint,"" according to reports by 9to5Mac, Extreme Tech and other blogs. ""You can then unlock your phone by putting your thumb on the home button. No longer will friends and family be able to pick up and peruse your phone -- no longer will you have to key in your passcode every time you want to do something,"" wrote Sebastian Anthony for Extreme Tech. Of course, many blogs trade in feverish rumors about Apple products that later prove unfounded, and there's no proof that such a feature will show up on the next iPhone, expected to be launched this fall. Next Media Animation, the Taiwan-based production company that turns news stories into animated clips, has weighed in on the fingerprint scanner, suggesting it won't appear on iPhones until 2014. Observers expect the as-yet-unnamed phone (iPhone 5S?) to have a faster processor, better battery life and an improved camera, possibly with a slow-motion video function. Apple also has been experimenting with larger screens for the iPhone and iPad.","Future iPhones and iPads might have biometric scanners that read fingerprints .

"(CNN) -- Dorothy Cooper is a 96-year-old African-American resident of Chattanooga, Tennessee. She was born in a small town in northern Georgia before women could vote and when Jim Crow laws mandated racial segregation. Her life has spanned nearly a century of progress: The 19th Amendment extended suffrage to women, the Civil Rights movement led to the dismantling of segregation laws, and the Voting Rights Act outlawed overt racial discrimination in elections. Mrs. Cooper has always honored this past by voting. In 70 years, she has missed only one election, in 1960, because a move made her miss the registration deadline. Despite living through an era when African-Americans were routinely turned away from the ballot box -- and worse -- Mrs. Cooper said she ""never had any problems"" exercising her rights. Even before the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. Until now. Last week Tennessee effectively prohibited her from voting because of the state's new photo ID requirement. In 2011, Republicans in Tennessee passed a law requiring all voters to show current, government-issued photo identification before voting in person. Mrs. Cooper has a Social Security card and a photo ID issued by the Chattanooga Police Department for seniors in her housing complex. When she went to the Tennessee Driver Service Center to obtain a new photo ID before the next election, she came prepared. She had her rent receipt, a copy of her lease, voter registration card and birth certificate. But under the new Republican law, this still wasn't good enough. Tennessee refused to issue Mrs. Cooper a photo ID because the last name on her birth certificate is different from her married name, the name she uses now. But she has no marriage certificate, so she cannot clear up the discrepancy to Tennessee's satisfaction. And so she cannot enter a voting booth and have her vote counted. In support of photo ID laws, Republicans have argued that everyone has a photo ID -- a claim that Mrs. Cooper's story squarely disproves. Mrs. Cooper has proved her identity beyond a shadow of a doubt, and it's still not enough. Under this new Republican regime, her voting rights are entirely dependent on bureaucratic whims and one missing piece of paper. If only the GOP cared as much about the Constitution, Mrs. Cooper wouldn't have suffered this injustice and would continue to enjoy her fundamental right to vote. Mrs. Cooper's experience is shocking, but because of an unprecedented wave of GOP legislation restricting ballot access across the country, this is not an isolated incident. In 2011, Republicans have pushed through photo ID mandates, reductions of early voting and restrictions on voter registration. These measures disproportionately harm communities of color, young voters, poor voters and voters with disabilities. And all too often, they harm the elderly. Throughout the United States, 18% of people age 65 and over -- more than 6 million Americans -- lack a current government-issued photo ID. In Wisconsin, which also passed a strict photo ID measure, there have been numerous reports of elderly citizens waiting hours to obtain an ID for voting. Republicans have disingenuously claimed that photo ID laws are necessary to prevent election fraud, but state and federal laws already do that. Many states have effectively addressed the Republicans' concerns with alternative methods of affirming one's identify, such as signing an affidavit attesting that you are eligible to vote. Nevertheless, Republican legislators across the country are needlessly pursuing photo ID laws, at the risk of disenfranchising millions of eligible Americans. In Pennsylvania, where Republicans are currently pushing a photo ID mandate, new legislation could prevent 340,000 older Pennsylvanians from voting -- more than the total population of Pittsburgh. If this is how Republicans thank the Greatest Generation, elderly veterans and amazing women like Dorothy Cooper, I sure hope they don't try to take care of me when I'm older. Mrs. Cooper has always displayed a remarkable commitment to our democracy. It is time that we do same. This weekend, we dedicate a national memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. We may have thought that restrictions on the right to vote were behind us. But in 2011, Republican leaders are more interested in protecting themselves from defeat than protecting a citizen's right to vote. As Mrs. Cooper's experience shows us, photo ID mandates simply don't work -- unless, of course, your goal is to prevent eligible Americans from voting. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: 96-year-old Tennessee woman lacks papers required for new voter ID law .

"(CNN) -- Alex Rodriguez is taking his quest to get back on the diamond into his own hands. A representative for Rodriguez said he got a second opinion on a recent quadriceps injury, and the doctor who analyzed the MRI says Rodriguez is healthy enough to return to the field. Michael Gross of The Sports Medicine Institute at Hackensack University, who was hired by Rodriguez, says he does not see an injury. On Wednesday evening, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said he heard through media reports that Gross had not examined Rodriguez and said it is the Yankees' desire to have Rodriguez return to the lineup as soon as possible. In a written statement, Cashman said, ""As early as Friday, July 12, when I suggested to Alex that we move his rehab from Tampa to Triple-A Scranton (at Buffalo), Alex complained for the first time of 'tightness' in his quad and therefore refused to consent to the transfer of his assignment. Again, last Sunday, Alex advised that he had stiffness in his quad and should not play on Sunday or Monday. We sent Alex to New York-Presbyterian Hospital for an MRI which evidenced a grade 1 strain."" Cashman said the Yankees will re-evaluate Rodriguez in Tampa on Thursday. Rodriguez has said he hoped that after hip surgery in January he would be able to resume playing for the Yankees on July 22, after he completed a rehabilitation stint in the minors. But the Yankees physician diagnosed a strained quadriceps this week based on an MRI. Rodriguez could be sidelined for at least a week and could be ordered to start a new 20-day rehabilitation. On Thursday, Rodriguez released a statement calling the back-and-forth ""crossed signals."" ""I think the Yanks and I crossed signals. I don't want any more mix ups. I'm excited and ready to play and help this team win a championship,"" the statement said. ""I feel great and I'm ready and want to be in the lineup Friday night. Enough doctors, let's play."" Rodriguez gave Gross permission to speak to the media. Gross said he can't be sure Rodriguez doesn't have an injury but said he didn't see anything on the MRI. A source close to Rodriguez told CNN that Rodriguez believes the Yankees are trying to find a way to release him and not pay the $114 million they owe on his contract. Meanwhile, Rodriguez, who has been accused of using performance-enhancing drugs, awaits word from Major League Baseball as to whether he will be suspended from the sport and, if so, for how long. Some media reports have said the punishment could be enough to end his career. Rodriguez turns 38 on Saturday and is still owed $28 million this year. He reported to the Yankees' spring training facility in Tampa on Wednesday and, according to sources, he believes he is healthy enough to get back to work.","Alex Rodriguez hires doctor who says he is healthy enough to play .

"Yosemite National Park, California (CNN) -- They look like cumulus clouds rolling through the park -- puffy and white. But they are more sinister than that. The clouds are from a huge wildfire in northern California, which is threatening Yosemite. The Yosemite Conservancy says the Rim Fire has consumed tens of thousands of acres in the park, but it has so far had little or no direct impact on Yosemite Valley, a popular spot for tourists and home to many of the famous cliffs and waterfalls in the park. Firefighters hope to keep it that way. Yosemite fire: Blaze spreads to national park . ""This is going to be a tough fire. It's going to continue for a few more weeks,"" said Tom Tidwell, chief of the U.S. Forest Service. Crews are doing their best, but just a spark or two could send the inferno raging. These are scary times for the folks of Tuolumne, a picturesque community threatened by the blaze. ""It is dangerous for them right now,"" Cal Fire Division Chief Mike Ramirez said. ""When you're on a ridge like this and the fire is below you, that is a recipe for disaster."" Tuolumne is on the northern edge of the Rim Fire, a monster of a wildfire that has charred more than 192,000 acres. It's the seventh-largest blaze in California history, requiring the efforts of more than 4,500 personnel. The blaze was 30% contained as of evening Wednesday. Although humidity was relatively high for the area at roughly 24%, Ramirez said fire crews were concerned that thunderstorms could create erratic wind patterns that might complicate firefighting efforts. In Tuolomne, Laura Murphy was poised to evacuate. ""To be this close is to be scared,"" said Murphy, a wildlife rehabilitator who lives in the threatened town with her husband. ""But we're ready; we're packed; we've already moved the animals."" Despite the threat, the fire is fascinating. ""We will leave when we have to, but it's amazing to watch,"" Murphy said. A threat to the Bay Area water supply . Nearby Yosemite Valley and its iconic attractions, including the El Capitan rock formation, currently are safe, miles from the Rim Fire's reach. However, the blaze was on the edge of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, which serves 2.6 million customers in the San Francisco Bay Area. The fire is wrapping around the south side of the reservoir and extends about 3/4 of a mile past O'Shaughnessy Dam to the south and east. Firefighters are at Hetch Hetchy protecting critical facilities, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission said Wednesday. Water quality remains unchanged, despite ash that has fallen on the 459-square-mile reservoir, because the water is drawn from a depth of 260 feet, the commission said. The city was already transferring 275 million gallons of water daily from Hetch Hetchy to other reservoirs because Hetch Hetchy is full, but as a precaution, the city increased that amount by 27 million gallons, a Tuesday statement said. The commission said it was confident the Rim Fire would not affect the reservoir: ""Due to the rocky, granite terrain and limited brush along the perimeter of the reservoir, there is little risk for direct water quality impacts."" The fire could threaten the area's hydroelectric generators, which provide much of San Francisco's electricity. Because of the approaching flames, officials shut down the generators, and the city -- more than 120 miles to the west -- temporarily is getting power from elsewhere. ""All of San Francisco's municipal electric customers continue to be fully supplied; there will be no interruption in electric service,"" the commission said. More evacuations possible . The Tuolumne County Sheriff's Office, meanwhile, issued evacuation advisories for Tuolumne and nearby Ponderosa Hill, said InciWeb, a federal website that collects information from agencies like the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. It was not clear how many residents were covered by the evacuation advisory. Evacuations also remained in place for areas south of Highway 120 (including Scotts Ridge), north of Old Yosemite Road and along the Highway 108 corridor between Tuolumne City and Pinecrest. Authorities say the Rim Fire started on August 17. The cause is under investigation. ""There's a lot of concern, and there's a lot of work to be done,"" U.S. Forest Service spokesman Lee Bentley said. Firefighters were able to build fire lines in several locations Tuesday. The forecast is also looking favorable as daytime highs sink into the 70s over the Labor Day weekend, a break from the temperatures in the high 80s firefighters were facing Wednesday. ""Access and difficult terrain remain concerns for crews and equipment,"" said an incident report. ""Rapid fire growth and extreme fire behavior are hampering suppression efforts."" As many as 20 helicopters and air tankers were aiding the efforts. A top priority is stopping the fire from spreading farther in Yosemite National Park. The Merced and Tuolumne giant sequoia groves, while not in imminent danger, were closed as firefighters conduct preventative measures to protect the majestic trees. Yosemite, with hundreds of campground sites and lodging units, had nearly 4 million visitors last year, the National Park Service said. The park typically has 15,000 visitors on a busy summer weekend. About 4,500 structures, many of them vacation homes, were under threat, InciWeb said. The fire has cost more than $39 million to date. Thirty-one residences and 80 outbuildings have been destroyed. Wildfire threatens 90-year-old cabin . What you need to know about wildfires . CNN's Eliott C.

"(CNN) -- Fadi Ghandour is CEO of Aramex International, one of the leading logistics and transportation companies in the Middle East and south Asia. He founded Aramex in 1982 and 15 years later it went onto become the first company from the Arab world to go public on the U.S. Nasdaq stock exchange. In 2002, Ghandour, in collaboration with private equity firm Abraaj, took the company private. Today Aramex is a public company again, trading on the Dubai Financial Market. Between 2003 to 2005, he was the Middle East and North Africa area chairman of the Young Presidents' Organization. And he continues to be actively involved in community socio-economic development and NGO work in the region. CNN's Schams Elwazer talks to Ghandour, one of the leading entrepreneurs in the region, on the importance of developing an entrepreneurial spirit. Schams Elwazer: Aramex is now about 25 years old. You were among the first entrepreneurs, especially when it comes to service-based industries, in the region. How pressing a need is there to develop entrepreneurship in the region? Fadi Ghandour: I think it's extremely pressing. I think it's extremely important that entrepreneurs are nurtured in the region. They need to be looked after and they need to be taught now to be entrepreneurs, the new students. The youth of the Arab world needs to understand that entrepreneurship is the way to get out of the stifling job market that is being looked at today. Because historically the Arab world, the region, had been a place where most people look for governments to employ them. This means very little innovation, very little space for creating news jobs. And in today's world, governments are unable to employ. They don't want to employ. If we are going to hire the hundred million people that are going to come into the job market in the coming 20 years, we're going to have to tell them that they're going to have to create their own businesses. SE: What changes have you seen in the Arab business climate since you've started? FG: You can think of the Arab world pre-9/11 and post-9/11 as far as the business climate. Post 9/11, which is a blessing, because suddenly the Arab world decided to invest in the Arab world. Arab capital decided to look for opportunities within the Arab world and decided to take risks on the Arab world. And the boom that you see in the region is a direct result of the Arab world finally being convinced that the opportunities are here and not anywhere else. And that's what makes a big difference. That's what's making Dubai at the end of the day; that's what's making Jordan; Egypt in terms of the new business boom that is happening. And at the same time there is, I think, a talent and brain regain in the region. This is new. We've gotten a lot of experienced Western-educated, or Western-employed talented people. They want to come back here and that is because the business opportunity is here. And the biggest loss of the Arab world was to have lost its brain. I see a very strong trend of people coming back. SE: Is that changing the face of business in the region? FG: Absolutely. It's changing the face of business in the region because you're bringing habits of modern economies, of developed economies into economies that are developing. It's not that we don't have our own capabilities, but we need a lot of help. We need people to come back and tell us what is happening outside of our region: how big companies have made it; how big governments outside of our region have made it. SE: And that's partially what you benefited from listing on the Nasdaq and being the first and only Arab company to list on the Nasdaq. You did develop, learn and bring back with you these Western standards of best practices. FG: Absolutely. When talking about Western management practices, I need to be careful. But the reality is that modern management is a Western concept. What I did when I went public on Nasdaq is say that companies from the region can make it over there. It is doable. SE: Was there increased pressure from the market and from shareholders to constantly deliver quarter-on-quarter? Did you want to take more long-term strategic decisions that maybe wouldn't immediately show high turnover? FG: Sure. The entrepreneurial spirit may have been a little bit stifled when we were on Nasdaq because of the pressure of quarter-to-quarter. But we're also a public company today and we still continue to live quarter-to-quarter but maybe with less pressure because the research community on public companies is not as pressurizing as the community in the West. But I wouldn't make it that big an issue. But being part of a private equity firm for three years, a lot of entrepreneurship was pushed because private equity by nature pushes you to grow and pushes you to take risks. If a shareholder wants you to take risks, then you are going to take risks. When you are public, shareholders are much more conservative than when you are private. SE: When you began you really started as a niche business supporting global players. Now you've become a very significant player regionally and you've expanded to other markets as well, such as in south Asia. How can you and will you be able to compete with the big boys like DHL and FedEx in mature markets? FG: Sure, we think we have the product, the services and quality of global standard. The brand is not recognized, but the brand can be built. We are patient people. We've been able to build what we have in 25 years, competing with the giants in our traditional markets. We're competing in India for instance. India is a massive market that has all the big boys in it and we have a respectable share of the international express market. So we're also taking those habits and our presence into not only south Asia but into southeast Asia. We're going to build a Chinese company and we're looking at acquiring a company in the US. We've also, as you know, acquired a company in Ireland that has a European base. SE: And what do you think is really the key change that needs to take place in the region in the coming years in order to create a more vibrant, viable regional economy? FG: I think the region needs to decide what it's going to do with the extra cash that it has. If we continue to invest in real-estate then I'm worried. If we're not going to invest in our people, if we're not going to invest in our youth, if we're not going to change the way we invest in our youth, we're going to be in trouble. That is the single biggest challenge that the Arab world has. It is what we are teaching our students, our youth, the people that are going to come into the economy in the coming 20 years. Are we going to teach them skills that will allow them to create their own jobs, that will allow them to become entrepreneurs, that will allow them to become business people, to become innovators, to become creators? Or are we going to continue to think that the traditional way of making money is the only way? We need to move from the hard asset mentality to the soft mentality of investment. And this is a long-term investment and this is a window of opportunity that has opened for us. The blessing of the oil price needs to be continuously looked at as a blessing in investing in the youth. It will be a curse if we don't take advantage of that extra cash and invest it in the future by investing in people.

"(CNN) -- One of three malnourished men found earlier this month in the garage of a Houston home has died, police said Tuesday. He and the other men told police they'd been held captive before they were discovered July 19. William Merle Greenawalt, 79, was pronounced dead six days later, Houston police said in a statement, which did not detail a cause of his death. The two other men, ages 59 and 64, who were allegedly held captive have been released from hospitals to the care of the state's Adult Protective Services. Walter Renard Jones, 31 -- a grandson of the home's owner -- has been charged with injury to the elderly by act and injury to the elderly by omission, according to Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva. The charges came after officers responded to a call at a modest single-story Houston home and found three men ""living without any level of care,"" police said. ""The three men claimed to have been misled by the suspect (Jones) into residing at the home in exchange for food and shelter,"" police added. ""All three men claimed the suspect used force and coercion to keep them there for the purpose of monetary gain."" Investigators were looking into whether the men had been forced to hand over their government aid, including disability, Social Security and veterans checks. At least some of the alleged captives were believed to be homeless. ""What the men initially told us was they were lured there with the promise of cigarettes and food,"" Silva said earlier this month. The men told the officers that they had been held for varying lengths of time. One man told them it felt like 10 years, but Silva said earlier this month, ""Whether it goes into years or not is unknown.""

"London (CNN) -- For years the practice by television companies during the 1960s of erasing videotapes containing original episodes of classic shows has frustrated fans. But every so often, a long-lost treasure is found in an attic or at the back of a garage to revive their faith. Now it's the turn of devotees of the time-travelling alien adventure TV show ""Doctor Who,"" who were on Monday enthusing on Twitter about the discovery of two episodes that were believed to have been wiped long ago. Tapes of the two BBC shows, ""Galaxy 4 part three"" starring William Hartnell and ""The Underwater Menace part two"" with Patrick Troughton, were bought at a school fete by former TV engineer Terry Burnett in the 1980s. He kept them at home for many years, and was only recently alerted to the fact that the BBC did not own them. The footage was shown at the British Film Institute's annual ""Missing Believed Wiped"" event at the National Film Theatre in London hosted by actor Mark Gatiss. He said: ""Christmas has come early for Doctor Who fans everywhere,"" according to the Radio Times. ""It's always wonderful when a missing episode turns up but it's been years since the last one so to have two is just brilliant. Add to that a proper bit of action from the legendary Chumblies (and the horrifying Rills!) plus the utterly mesmeric Patrick Troughton on great form. Well, what more could we all ask for?"" On Twitter, fans were similarly euphoric about the rediscovered episodes, which date from the mid-60s. JP LeBreton said: ""Recovering lost Dr Who eps that broadcast 47 years ago and bounced off stuff in deep space: coolest thing possible."" Broadcasters started to record TV programs for transmission in the late 1950s, but because videotape was so expensive, they were wiped clean for reuse afterwards. Because of this more than 100 episodes of ""Doctor Who"" from the 1960s were lost. The latest discoveries are the first complete episodes to be rediscovered since 2004.

"(CNN) -- Wander into any gaming forum thread, chat room or multiplayer-action communications, and you quickly discover that gamers can be an insensitive lot. But there are also instances where the hardcore, win-at-all-costs trash talking goes silent and they band together to do good. Such was the case recently when players and game developers turned heartbreak over the death of a young compatriot into cash to fight cancer. ""MechWarrior Online"" is a game that lets players control powerful war machines (""Mechs"") and fight each other for dominance on the battlefield. The game is still in beta testing and plans to launch in mid-September but boasts more than 1.1 million registered pilots. Five-year-old Sarah Marie Alida Parries of Vancouver, British Columbia, was one of them. She would pilot her favorite style of Mech -- called a Jenner -- with her father, Jon, and often dominated her much-older opponents. Then, in May, she lost her battle with inoperable brain cancer. The courage and energy she displayed along the way inspired Infinite Games Publishing and Piranha Games, the makers of ""MechWarrior,"" to honor her in a unique way. A customized war machine called ""Sarah's Jenner"" is now available in the game for $10. And all proceeds from its sale go to the Canadian Cancer Society. ""Sarah's passion for 'Mechs' and her battle with cancer had a profound impact on everyone at Piranha,"" said Russ Bullock, president of Piranha Games, in a news release. ""She was an inspiration, with her passion and energy for the game and our hearts and deepest condolences go out to her family. ""The outpouring of heartfelt sympathy from the MechWarrior community and the support and encouragement we've received to develop this unique 'Mech' has been nothing short of incredible."" Sarah's family worked with the team to make Sarah's Mech a possibility. The Jenner was her favorite chassis ""because she liked to move fast, lock on and liked using night vision,"" according to her father. But it's personalized with an exterior design that includes images of a pony, rainbow, teddy bear and pink peace symbol. Players can get the new Mech until August 20. Proceeds from the sale are being kept in a running tally on a special page on the MechWarrior website. As of Friday, more than $54,000 had been raised. The organizers say non-players interested in contributing should reach out to their local cancer societies.","Sarah Parries, 5, was avid ""MechWarrior Online"" player before her death in May .

"(CNN) -- Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig will retire when his current term ends January 24, 2015, Major League Baseball said Thursday. Selig said that ""it remains my great privilege to serve the game I have loved throughout my life."" ""Baseball is the greatest game ever invented, and I look forward to continuing its extraordinary growth and addressing several significant issues during the remainder of my term,"" he said in a statement. Selig, 79, has been full-time commissioner since 1998 after six years as the interim boss. Before that, he owned the Milwaukee Brewers after moving the Seattle Pilots in 1970. The game changed significantly during Selig's tenure as commissioner. Interleague play was instituted, teams that exceeded a salary threshold were penalized and the money shared with other teams, and the postseason was revamped several times to include division series and the Wild Card playoff contest. Umpires can now also use instant replay to review certain plays. MLB also grew. Two teams -- the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Tampa Bay Rays -- joined. The Montreal Expos moved to Washington and became the Nationals. Other teams switched divisions and the Brewers changed leagues. There were low points, too, including MLB canceling the World Series in 1994 after a players' strike, and a long investigation into the use of performing-enhancing drugs in baseball that culminated in a 2007 report that led to congressional hearings.","Bud Selig was owner of the Milwaukee Brewers when he became interim commissioner .

"(CNN) -- Alex Rodriguez is the rare athlete who transcends the sport in which he is considered one of the greatest players of all time. It hasn't been easy. There have been glamour moments: the baseball superstar dated Madonna, Kate Hudson and Cameron Diaz, among others. Handsome, rich and dapper, ""A-Rod"" is considered a man-about-town. The tabloids loved it all and once renamed him ""Stray-Rod."" The larger-than-life behavior cost him his marriage, by which he had two children, in 2008. On the diamond, the slugger's performance has been exceptional, though he has been recovering from off-season hip surgery and, more recently, a tight quadricep this year. Rodriguez, MLB negotiating suspension, ESPN says . His long list of accomplishments makes him a living legend still in the game, and fans flock to the field just to see the great Alexander Rodriguez at bat one more time. The New York Yankee third baseman is a three-time American League MVP, 14-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove. He owns one World Series ring, with the Yankees in 2009. The baseball records have been sullied, however, by his prior admission of using banned substances in the early 2000s and by newer allegations this past year of having used performance-enhancing drugs. Those scandals take on bigger meaning because of Rodriguez's unique mark in baseball: He has the largest contract ever in American sports, at $275 million over 10 years, signed with the Yankees in 2007. His detractors call it the worst deal ever because of Rodriguez's health and playing lapses as well as his roguery, including when he flirted with two blond female fans sitting near the Yankees dugout in playoff game in October. The team was swept in the American League Championship Series. War of words between A-Rod and Yankees . This season is supposed to begin the last great hurrah for Rodriguez, the early verses of a swan song. Even he acknowledged it. He just turned 38 on July 27, and he was recovering from his second hip surgery since 2009 -- ""definitely the hardest surgery I've had to overcome,"" he told CNN. Rodriguez is poised to surpass major milestones: 3,000 hits, 2,000 RBIs and 2,000 runs. He now has 647 homers, and while he admitted he hasn't been the long-ball hitter he used to be, maybe a couple of more seasons could put him at the 700 mark. He recently expressed the urgency of the moment. Performance enhancing drugs in sports . ""Look, there's no hiding it. I'm not a spring chicken anymore. I'm not 28. I'm going to be 38 here in July. But I do think I can contribute,"" Rodriguez said last month. ""I think I can be a force in the middle lineup, a big right-handed bat for our team, but I'm at a different stage of my career. Is it realistic to go out and hit 40, 50 home runs? I don't think so. But can I go out and have nights like I did last night and do that several times a week? I think so."" Rodriguez was referring to his home run in a minor league game in mid-July, where he was testing his surgically repaired hip. His return date to the Yankees lineup has been a cipher all season. The injury didn't help him in a bigger controversy about his health: Rodriguez was accused of having ties with the now-shuttered Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in south Florida and taking performance enhancing drugs. Judge: MLB can sue Florida clinic . Rodriguez has denied the accusation. The stakes are intensified because it's not the first time he has faced issues about doping. In 2009, he admitted to using ""a banned substance"" over three years when he was playing for the Texas Rangers beginning in 2001. Media reports said the drug was steroids, and pundits relabeled him ""A-Roid."" The admission -- along with the recent allegations -- could alter his legacy: Some sport analysts say Rodriguez may struggle, once he retires, in the Hall of Fame voting selection process. In whatever way history may judge him, there's no denying how Rodriguez has made much of his life. His was a rags-to-riches story: He was born in New York City to Dominican Republic immigrant parents. His father was a shoe salesman and a catcher in Dominican pro baseball. His mother held two jobs, as a waitress and secretary. Opinion: The worst sports contract ever . His parents moved him and their two other children to the Dominican Republic when Alex was 4. The family then moved to the Miami area when Alex was 8. Later, his parents divorced, but not before Alex learned some baseball from his father. His mother sent him to a Christian private school, where he became well-groomed, well-mannered and a high school athlete who excelled at just about every sport. By 18, at 6-foot-3 and 195 pounds, he was playing for the Seattle Mariners at shortstop. Much bigger than the typical shortstop, he helped redefine the position. He won many awards and honors at Seattle, then at the Texas Rangers, and finally at the Yankees, who signed him in 2004. As he became wealthy, he donated millions to charity, including for facilities and scholarships benefiting youngsters in the Boys & Girls Clubs of Miami-Dade in south Florida. Rodriguez never forgot that he spent a lot of time at the Miami club as a boy of divorced parents. Rodriguez talks with CNN .","Alex Rodriguez, 38, is the son of Dominican Republican immigrant parents .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of green card applicants will no longer ""age out"" and have to go to the back of the line if they turn 21 during the protracted U.S. immigration process, an appeals court has ruled in a defeat for the federal government. Wednesday's narrow 6-5 decision, from the San Francisco-based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, reverses earlier court rulings. The decision affects ""tens of thousands of families"" -- specifically, the unmarried sons and daughters of those who waited for years as a parent sought a visa in the United States -- said Carl Shusterman, a lawyer representing the victors in the case. ""After 10 years and a lawsuit that's gone on for years, these families are finally going to be back together,"" Shusterman said. The ruling applies to those who were under 21 when their families came to the United States after being sponsored by a relative who is a U.S. citizen. Subsequently, their father or mother applied for a visa, at which time their children could be in line to receive a ""derivative visa."" Such visas are available only to spouses and unmarried children under 21. So what happens when, as they are waiting for their status to be resolved -- often for years -- these children become 21 and older? The federal government argued that, once those in the former group ""age out,"" they should start again in a new phase in the process, with no credit for the time they waited originally for the derivative visa. This has been the case for years. People applying for green cards often wait through administrative delays for their petitions to be processed, as well as often longer periods waiting for one of a limited number of visas to become available. The current wait time for those seeking a green card in the F2B category -- for unmarried sons or daughters of a lawful permanent resident -- for Mexico, for instance, is about 20 years, according to this month's Visa Bulletin published by the U.S. State Department. Congress stepped into the fray in 2002 with the passage of the Child Status Protection Act. Among other provisions, it stated that ""the alien's petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition."" In other words, people don't lose their place in line after they turn 21. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has contended in court that this legislation was unclear about to whom this language applies -- contending, for instance, that it is relevant for some groups but not those unmarried children who had been in line for derivative visas. Furthermore, the agency argued that changing the equation will unfairly affect those already waiting for a limited number of visas, by effectively skipping ahead of them (and making them wait longer). The judges' majority opinion, however, states that Congress' intent in passing the Child Status Protection Act was ""to extend automatic conversion and priority date retention to all family-sponsored derivative beneficiaries."" Furthermore, they find complaints that changes will produce unnecessary and unreasonable problems for the Citizenship and Immigration Services are not valid. ""The plain language of the CSPA is not impracticable,"" the judges said. ""It is the agency's task to resolve ... complications, not the courts."" The Department of Justice did not respond immediately Thursday when asked for comment on the case. Shusterman speculated another recent federal court decision out of Texas that followed much the same reasoning as Wednesday's ruling may have had ""a tremendous"" impact in the 9th Circuit's reversal. ""I'm thrilled. We've been fighting this for three or four years and not winning,"" Shusterman said. In other cases, he contends, the federal government ""always credits for the time you stood in line."" But not all agreed with Wednesday's ruling. Dan Stein, the president for the Federation for American Immigrant Reform, contends that if Congress ""had wanted indefinite eligibility regardless of age, they would have raised the overall number of visas in the category to prevent further increases in the backlog."" ""The court is substituting its judgment for that of expert administrative agencies, making the system even more dysfunctional,"" Stein said in a statement to CNN. ""Immigration is a civil benefit, and either you are under 21 or you are not.""","9th Circuit Court of Appeals, by a 6-5 vote, reverses an earlier immigration ruling .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. Job seekers need to be ready to deal with the perception that they are overqualified. Sherry Shealy Martschink, 57, is a former state legislator, state senator and worker's compensation commissioner for South Carolina. She's a recent law school graduate and has experience in journalism, marketing and education. For the past few years during her job search, she's been told -- in not so many words -- that she's overqualified. ""Sometimes the opposition is in the tone of voice rather than the actual wording of the questions and comments,"" Martschink said. ""An employer may say something like, 'We are hoping to find someone who will make a career here' or 'Why would you want this job after doing such-and-such?' Another type of question has to do with whether I could be a team player after being in such leadership positions."" How does Martschink respond to such opposition? Plain and simple: . ""If I weren't willing to do the work, I wouldn't be applying for the job,"" she said. Geoff Tucker, who has a college degree and six years experience in his field, has faced opposition more than once during his job search. In one interview, the hiring manager started with, ""We both know you're overqualified,"" and went on to say she wanted to do a ""gut check "" to determine if Tucker would be OK with the tasks he'd be handing. ""In other words, she wanted to see if I was OK with being versatile to the point of helping clean around the office and refill the toilet paper in the bathroom,"" Tucker said. ""I affirmed that I do not have an issue with doing tasks that maybe I haven't had to do in a while. I am not that egocentric and I don't regard these tasks as below me."" Many job seekers wonder how being qualified can be a bad thing, but it's a Catch 22 that many job seekers face today. They can't get hired for positions relevant to their experience so they apply for jobs at lower levels. The problem is that they can't get hired for those positions, either, because they're overqualified. ""Employers are in the cat-bird seat,"" said Kathryn Sollman, co-founder and managing partner of the Women at Work Network. ""The high volume of job seekers makes it possible for employers to hold out for their ideal candidates. You're not an ideal candidate if you have held a more senior position in the past; employers assume you will leave as soon as you find something at your normal level."" What's the deal? Assuming you'll jump ship when the economy turns around is only one of the many objections employers have to hiring overqualified candidates. For one thing, many job seekers assume that their high credentials automatically mean they are skilled for a more junior job. But, Sollman said, just because a position is less senior than the one you previously held does not mean that you have the appropriate skills to succeed in that role. ""Take an administrative position, for example. Many mid- to senior-level job seekers haven't done anything remotely administrative for years,"" she said. Right or wrong, other assumptions hiring managers might have about hiring overqualified candidates include: . • You'll be bored and unmotivated . • The salary will be too low for you . • You'll be unhappy . • You'll leave the minute something better comes along . • You could possibly steal his/her job . • You won't be able to step down from a leadership role . Hiring managers only take overqualified candidates seriously if they are convincing about a valid reason they want to take a more junior-level job, Sollman said. The best reason is saying you have decided that you don't want to work crazy schedules and are interested in a better work/life balance, she said. If that's the truth and you're truly not looking over your shoulder for a senior-level job, employers will consider you for a more junior job. Tucker says the doubt he gets from hiring managers regarding his experience is unfair. ""They should consider my above-par qualifications as a way to gain additional capabilities on their staff and team. I will bring just as much passion to this role as I would any other,"" he said. ""I would not apply for a job if it weren't a fit for me. It's about the work I'm doing and the contributions I'm making that matter."" If you're being told you're overqualified during your job search, here are seven ways to convince your interviewer otherwise: . 1. Admit that you're worried, too Tell the hiring manager that you are also concerned that it might not be a fit, suggests Duncan Mathison, co-author of ""The Truth about the Hidden Job Market."" Promise that if at any point during the hiring process you feel the job appears too low or not one where you will bring the full engagement needed to excel in the position, you will withdraw your candidacy. Your willingness to walk away tells them you are motivated if you stay in the game. 2. Take salary off the table Make it clear that you're flexible about salary and that your previous earnings are not relevant to your current job search. ""Tell the hiring manager that you work for both green dollars and personal satisfaction dollars,"" Sollman says. ""Lately you've had a deficit in personal satisfaction dollars and you want a chance to try something new."" 3. Put the issue out there Ask the interviewer if he or she sees any positives or negatives to your candidacy based on your higher qualifications. Get the issue on the table so it can be addressed, Mathison suggests. 4. Use your accomplishments ""Tell the hiring manager that you're proud of your accomplishments and you have proven to yourself that you can perform at a more senior level,"" Sollman said. ""Now you're not interested in chasing titles and promotion. You want to make a contribution at a compelling company."" 5. Distance yourself from your higher qualifications Be empathetic to those parts of the hiring manager's jobs -- indicate that you have a clearer understanding of what a manager needs from their people. ""For example, say you were a manager and are applying to an individual contributor job,"" Mathison said. ""Tell the hiring manager that you are looking for a job that would give you more hands-on technical work and give you a break from the people management and corporate politics."" 6. You want to learn If you've held more senior positions at a different kind of company or in a different industry, tell the hiring manager that the best way to really learn about a new industry is from the bottom up, Sollman says. 7. Make a commitment ""Tell the employer that you know that job hopping is a major 'don't' in the business world. Say that barring unforeseen circumstances, you are ready to make at least a two-year commitment to the company,"" Sollman suggests. Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009. All rights reserved.

Lawson and her children moved out of their family home and she hasn't spoken to him since. ""I feel that I have clearly been a disappointment to Nigella during the last year or so, and I am disappointed that she was advised to make no public comment to explain that I abhor violence of any kind against women, and have never abused her physically in any way,"" Saatchi wrote in the statement.

"(CNN) -- The family of a woman whose naked and bound body was found hanging in a Southern California mansion two years ago has filed a federal lawsuit accusing three people of plotting her death. The San Diego County medical examiner ruled that Rebecca Zahau committed suicide, but a lawsuit filed Friday by her mother and sister contends she was the victim of a murder plot devised by her millionaire boyfriend's brother, ex-wife and the ex-wife's twin sister. Zahau's boyfriend, Jonah Shacknai, owned the Coronado, California, vacation home where she was found dead on July 13, 2011. His 6-year-old son, Max, suffered a fall in the same home two days earlier and died in a hospital on July 16, 2011. The lawsuit filed by the dead woman's mother, Pari Zahau, and sister, Mary Zahau-Loehner, does not detail the alleged plot, but it contends each defendant ""participated in some manner in the planning, implementation, execution and subsequent concealment of the scheme to murder Rebecca Zahau."" The defendants named are Adam Shacknai of Memphis, Tennessee; Dina Shacknai of Phoenix, Arizona; and Nina Romano from Stockton, California. Dina Shacknai is the mother of Max, the boy who died from the fall. ""Defendants intentionally, willfully, wantonly and maliciously threatened to cause immediate physical harm to Rebecca by threatening to stalk, attack, choke, gag, bound, and hang her at the premises,"" the complaint said. Efforts by CNN to reach the defendants or their lawyers for comment were unsuccessful Sunday. After Zahau's death was ruled a suicide and San Diego County officials refused to pursue criminal charges, Jonah Shacknai asked the California attorney general's office to investigate his son's fatal fall and his girlfriend's hanging. He said he hoped a state inquiry would bring a ""dignified resolution for everyone who has been touched by the horrible events of this summer."" The attorney general cited the ""state's scarce resources"" in a letter declining to investigate, but Zahau's family hired their own investigators to challenge the findings that she committed suicide. A renowned forensic pathologist hired by the family said four bruises found on the top of her head indicate trauma not readily explained by the hanging. He said in September 2011 that it was just one of several reasons he wouldn't have ruled the death a suicide. Authorities first went to the home, in the San Diego suburb of Coronado, on July 11 after getting a call from Zahau's 13-year-old sister reporting that Max had fallen down the stairs and was not breathing, Coronado police Cmdr. Mike Lawton said. Zahau, her sister and the boy were the only ones in the residence at the time of the incident. Police arrived within two minutes, followed a minute later by firefighters who, after finding the boy unconscious on the floor, ""began lifesaving measures immediately,"" Lawton said. But despite extensive medical treatment, Max Shacknai died five days later. The medical examiner ruled the boy's death an accident. On July 13, authorities got another 911 call from the home. This time, it was Adam Shacknai, Jonah Shacknai's brother, reporting that he found Zahau hanging, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said. Adam Shacknai, who was staying in a guest house that morning, told investigators that he climbed onto a table and cut the body loose before investigators arrived, authorities said. Gore said investigators were comfortable with the brother's account. Jonah Shacknai, a lawyer and the founder and CEO of Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp., was at a children's hospital or a Ronald McDonald House from the time when investigators believe the suicide happened to the time Zahau's body was reported, San Diego sheriff's Lt. Larry Nesbit said. The autopsy concluded that Zahau was ""alive when she went over the (second-floor) balcony"" with a T-shirt wrapped around her neck, the medical examiner said. There was no evidence of a struggle or a sexual assault, or that she was rendered unconscious or incapacitated, adding that ""her feet were dirty, consistent with standing on the dirty balcony,"" he said. Though investigators don't know the order of events, they believe she removed her clothing, painted a message, cut a rope into sections, secured the long portion to a bed, bound her feet, placed the rope and the shirt around her neck, fashioned wrist bindings, secured her hands in the binding behind her back, moved to the balcony, leaned over the rail and fell, San Diego County sheriff's Sgt. Dave Nemeth said. Nemeth said one person told investigators that in January, Zahau had ""lost weight, seemed stressed, was not sleeping well and was not exercising, which was abnormal for her."" Other interviewees indicated that ""Rebecca was distraught over Max's injury,"" Nemeth said. But Zahau family attorney Anne Bremner had previously said that one of Zahau's sisters, who talked to her the night before her death, said Zahau ""was completely fine"" and didn't feel guilty about Max Shacknai's fall. ""My sister never had a psychiatric problem, never (had) been on psychiatric medication and never had attempted suicide, let alone ever talked about harming herself,"" Mary Zahau said in an interview weeks after her sister's death.","The San Diego County medical examiner ruled Rebecca Zahau's death a suicide .

"(CNN) -- It's been a rough month for chickens. Not that there's ever an especially good month when your only job on this planet is to sit around, get fat and occasionally pop out eggs. It's kind of like living your entire life as a ""Honey Boo Boo"" cast member. But with a shred of dignity. This particular rough month actually started trending two weeks ago when, early in the morning on July 9, a truck carrying more than 5,000 chickens overturned in downtown Salem, Oregon. Sadly, many of the poor little cluckers died. Others, perhaps stunned from the crash, just wandered aimlessly about the streets, suddenly free from captivity. Which must've been remarkably weird. ""Gertrude, is this heaven?"" ""No. It's Salem."" The story quickly found its way around the Interwebs because, really, it has all the makings of must-see news. Was there a big crash? Yes. Was there negligence involved? Possibly. Did hundreds of live animals on a roadway have to be rounded up by humans. Abso-freakin-lutely! It was gold. But just when the Salem truck story seemed to go away -- as oddball stories eventually do -- it magically came roaring back. All thanks to PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). In response to the crash, the organization proposed a 5Â½-foot-tall, 250-pound statue of a giant bloody chicken on crutches, memorializing the hundreds that perished in the crash. PETA hoped it could stand at the intersection near where the accident happened to alert livestock truckers to be extra careful and to remind motorists that ""chickens are among the most abused animals on the planet."" PETA spokeswoman Shakira Croce added that ""the best way to prevent crashes like this is to go vegan so that chickens don't have to make the trip to the slaughterhouse in the first place."" Personally, I love the idea. Mind you, not because of my politics -- when it comes to such matters, I have no opinion. But I do love absurd landmarks. And every city needs something delightfully wackadoo. Like a big chicken. Oddly enough, we actually have a big chicken right here in Atlanta's northern suburb of Marietta. We call it ... the Big Chicken. The huge structure stands 56 feet high, rising into the air from a KFC. So, in a sense, it, too, is a monument to dead chickens. Dead chickens coated with 11 herbs and spices. The best part about Marietta's Big Chicken is that people actually use it as a directional landmark. ""Make a left at the Big Chicken. Go one block up.

This is a real excerpt from a 2009 article in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: . ""A Marietta police officer involved in a two-car accident Saturday afternoon is fine, according to police officials. The incident occurred around 3:25 p.m. at Cobb Parkway and Roswell Road in front of the Big Chicken."" Naturally, if you didn't know about the landmark, reading this would blow your mind. ""That must've been one crazy-ass chicken."" Unfortunately, PETA's Bloody Chicken of Salem statue was officially shot down this week by the Oregon Department of Transportation. Kevin Hottman, a city traffic engineer, noted that it's a congested area and the statue ""would be a distraction and possibly a hazard."" So, now, chickens in Salem will just have to live in constant fear of another roadside tragedy while they're on their way to get slaughtered. And speaking of chicken slaughter, there was another story that started trending this week. It was about an Arizona woman who found a chicken foot in a package of breast meat from Safeway. The disgusted shopper tweeted, ""Hey, @Safeway, does this look like 'chicken breast' to you? I'm vomiting."" Despite the Internet chastising the woman for overreacting, Safeway nevertheless confirmed that the chicken foot was real and issued a statement saying, ""While the part does not pose a health risk, we are investigating how it became packaged in with our product."" And then the ghost of the chicken issued its own statement: . ""I'm incredibly sorry that my severed foot somehow ended up in the same package as my severed breast. I know that must've been unsettling. PS: My head is in a landfill."" Yep. It's been a rough month for chickens.

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State John Kerry got the money shot he wanted on Tuesday -- the chief negotiators for Israel and the Palestinians framed by his lanky embrace as they shook hands to launch ""sustained, continuous and substantive"" talks on a long-sought Middle East peace treaty. Now the question is whether the negotiations expected to last nine months will bring an even more historic image, with President Barack Obama bringing together Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to sign a final-status agreement that creates a sovereign Palestinian state in what is now part of Israel. The Middle East dispute, perhaps the world's most intractable in the past six decades, entered a new phase with Kerry's announcement that the first direct talks in three years would proceed in earnest in the next two weeks in either Israel or the Palestinian territories. Flanked by Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat, Kerry said ""all core issues"" toward achieving a two-state solution would be on the table. ""Our objective will be to achieve a final status agreement over the course of the next nine months,"" he said. Acknowledging the obstacles from years of hostility and mistrust, Kerry said the process would be difficult but that he believed an agreement could be achieved. ""When somebody tells you that Israelis and Palestinians cannot find common ground or address the issues that divide them, don't believe them,"" Kerry said, adding: ""While I understand the skepticism, I don't share it and I don't think we have time for it."" Major obstacles that date back decades in the Middle East conflict include established Jewish settlements in territory claimed by the Palestinians, the status of Palestinian refugees seeking to return to the region, and control of Jerusalem, particularly its Muslim holy sites. Opinion: John Kerry's bold push for peace . Kerry has pushed to resume negotiations in order to stave off a showdown over the Israel-Palestinian question at the U.N. General Assembly in September. His efforts, including multiple meetings in the region with each side in recent months, sought to assure the Israelis that their security concerns would be addressed while convincing Palestinians that an agreement was in their best long-term interest. ""I think that everyone involved here believes that we cannot pass along to another generation the responsibility of ending a conflict that is in our power to resolve in our time,"" Kerry said. ""They should not be expected to bear that burden and we should not leave it to them. They should not be expected to bear the pain of continued conflict or perpetual war."" On Tuesday, President Barack Obama held a 30-minute meeting with the negotiators in which he ""underscored that while the parties have much work to do in the days and months ahead, the United States stands ready to support them in their efforts to achieve peace,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. Both sides face opposition to the negotiations from their people, with hardliners calling the concept of negotiations an unacceptable climate of concession. In comments after Kerry's announcement, Livni and Erakat expressed gratitude for his efforts to get the talks going. Erakat cited both Kerry and Obama ""for your relentless efforts and unwavering commitment to achieve a just and lasting peace between Palestinians and Israel."" ""Palestinians have suffered enough and no one benefits more from a lasting peace than Palestinians,"" he said, expressing delight that all core issues were on the table. It was time for Palestinians to have a sovereign state, he added. Livni praised Kerry ""for not giving up,"" adding that ""we are hopeful but we cannot be naÃ¯ve."" ""We all know that it's not going to be easy. It's going to be hard, with ups and downs,"" she said, calling for the new talks to be ""a spark of hope, even if small, to emerge out of cynicism and pessimism."" To help set up the revived talks, Netanyahu prodded the Israeli government into approving the release of 104 Palestinian prisoners -- a move that flies in the face of popular sentiment in Israel. Some observers called the prisoner release to be done in stages a possible sign of a new negotiating environment. Another sign of a different atmosphere was Kerry's declaration that both sides agreed to negotiate in private. The United States will be a facilitator and a senior State Department official called it an ""indispensable role."" But the talks are direct negotiations between the two sides. ""The only announcement you will hear about meetings it's the one that I just made, and I will be the only one by agreement authorized to comment publicly on the talks in consultation obviously with the parties."" he said. ""That means that no one should consider any reports, articles or even rumors reliable unless they come directly from me and I guarantee you they won't."" Aaron David Miller of the Woodrow Wilson International Center, a Middle East specialist, said such ""radio silence"" was unprecedented for Middle East negotiations in his memory. ""It's a mark of real seriousness on one hand and respect for Kerry on the other,"" Miller told CNN. Amanpour: Barriers to Israel peace less now, says President Carter . Opponents of the peace talks insist that divisions remain too deep to overcome. Dating back to the creation of Israel in 1947, the Middle East conflict has spawned a tortuous peace process that yielded iconic images but no satisfactory solution. One of the most famous photos was the 1993 shot of President Bill Clinton looking on as Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat shook hands over an agreement intended to bring a full peace treaty by 1999. Rabin was assassinated two years later later by a Jewish law student who said he wanted to halt the peace process. Livni referred to the failure of previous peace efforts in her comments Tuesday, saying ""it's not our intention to argue about the past, but to create solutions and make decisions about the future."" The newest round of talks began Monday night with an Iftar dinner to break the fast in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, then continued Tuesday morning with negotiators also meeting with Obama before joining Kerry for the announcement that took place an hour later than scheduled. Livni and attorney Isaac Molho, an aide to Netanyahu, represented Israel while Erakat and Fatah official Mohammad Shtayyeh spoke for the Palestinians. Former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk also took part as the U.S. envoy to the talks. Opinion: Americans, stay open to both sides in Mideast talks .

"(CNN) -- The list of defendants whose cases could be affected by the alleged drug tampering of a former Massachusetts chemist has now grown to over 40,000, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick's administration said Tuesday. The chemist, Annie Dookhan, 34, already is facing a total of 27 counts including obstruction of justice, mishandling of drug evidence and lying about holding a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts. Dookhan worked as a state chemist testing drug evidence submitted by law enforcement agencies from 2003 until March 2012, when she resigned, according to the Massachusetts attorney general's office. The attorney general's office began a criminal investigation in July 2012, after Massachusetts State Police were tipped off by Dookhan's co-workers who alleged her work might be unreliable. The investigation revealed that Dookhan allegedly tampered with evidence by altering substances in vials that were being tested at the state lab, allegedly to cover up the practice of routinely ""dry labbing"" samples. ""Dry labbing"" is a term used for merely visually identifying samples instead of performing the required chemical test. Authorities arrested Dookhan at her home in Franklin, Massachusetts last September, but she was released on $10,000 cash bail with conditions, according to the state attorney general's office. Dookhan has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Former Massachusetts chemist faces even more charges . After ordering that the lab where she worked be shut down in August 2012, while the investigation was ongoing, Patrick created a special counsel to expedite the identification of individuals whose cases involved evidence potentially mishandled by Dookhan. Initially Patrick's administration estimated 34,000 defendants possibly had been affected, but that estimation rose to 37,500 after attorney David Meier joined Patrick's special counsel in September. The increase came as no surprise to Patrick's administration, because there was always an assumption that more information would lead to more discoveries, said Heather Johnson, a spokeswoman for the administration. Since January, approximately 2,500 more names have been identified, bringing the total number of individuals potentially affected to 40,323, which Meier has recorded in a ""master list."" While some of these added names are in fact new, the majority is not; rather, most are newly identified co-defendants of cases that were already on the list, Johnson said. 2012: Chemist in Boston lab scandal handled 50,000 drug samples . The ""master list"" is an inventory of names of each person whose drug samples were associated in some way with testing done by Dookhan at the drug laboratory, and it is the product of a nearly year-long review and an electronic analysis of over three million lab documents, Patrick's administration said. According to Suffolk District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Rene Algarin, 240 defendants whose cases are potentially affected have been released in Suffolk County until the investigation surrounding Dookhan's alleged evidence tampering is concluded. But the case against Dookhan is complicated by the fact that she faces indictments in seven different Massachusetts counties -- Suffolk, Plymouth, Middlesex, Norfolk, Essex, Bristol and Barnstable -- because she had previously testified in various trials in her former official capacity as a chemist. Bridget Morton Middleton, assistant district attorney for Plymouth County, said it's not just simply coming up with a list of names of defendants. It's a much more labor-intensive process that each of the seven counties must undergo to determine whether a defendant's sentence should be put on hold. In some cases, for instance, Dookhan was not the primary chemist in a trial and was only agreeing with what another chemist had confirmed, Middleton said. At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Meier said he plans to sit down with representatives from the bar associations, district attorneys, prosecutors and chief justices of the various courts to present the material he has gathered. Meier, however, made it clear several times that it is not -- and was never -- his role to assess these documents, but rather to ""get the information into the hands of the appropriate people, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges, so that fundamental fairness and justice can be done in the court rooms."" Dookhan's attorney, Nicholas Gordon, could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Dookhan's next court date is set for October 11 in Suffolk Superior Court .","Annie Dookhan was a state chemist in Massachusetts for nine years .
Her work involved drug testing and evidenc handling .
She was arrested last year and charged with mishandling drug evidence .

"(CNN) -- One of the Web's basic tenets is that small contributions from lots of people can amount to something powerful in the aggregate. Fans of the Japanese band Sour contributed images to a music video. Now, a growing group of writers, musicians, visual artists and videographers is turning this Wikipedia-era philosophy into online collaborative art. Twitter users are banding together to write an opera for London's Royal Opera House. Bands like My Morning Jacket and Sour, out of Japan, are turning to fans to help film their music videos. Programmers are pulling quotes from online social networks to make automated poems. More than 50,000 animators are divvying up work on an upcoming animated film called ""Live Music,"" and amateur videographers are re-filming ""Star Wars"" in 15-second bites. This crowd-sourced creativity online is putting a new twist on traditional ideas of artistic ownership, online communication and art production. ""What's exciting is that it's being tested out by a lot of people who have access to [the technology],"" said Mary Jane Jacob, executive director of exhibitions at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. ""I think that we're in a great communal workshop."" In recent months, the collaborative projects have been showing the professionalism it takes to get noticed amid the clutter of content on the Internet, said Ze Frank, an online personality who orchestrated several early online art projects. Sign up for a CNN art project . Frank said people have been making collaborative online art ""since the beginning of the Web."" But much of it wasn't worth looking at. Some collaborative books proved to be too much work for even herds of people to tackle. Efforts to create massive drawings with thousands of contributors sometimes ended up looking like random scribbles, for example. But for some reason -- either because people are getting savvier with cameras or because the projects are getting more visibility -- things are starting to click, Frank said. Even if some of the latest collaborative efforts fail to produce masterworks, the real value is the process, he said. ""Even if the [Twitter-written] opera ends up sucking as a performance, the value may have already been played out in the theater of the creation of it,"" he said. Many of the projects aim to hit on universal themes. ""The little elements that aren't synchronized"" in the group art projects remind people that our differences are what make us interesting, said Matt Maloney, associate dean of the school of film and digital media at the Savannah College of Art and Design, referring to this music video, which features fans of the Japanese band Sour. ""The backgrounds change, the people move differently, the quality and temperature of the photography varies from component to component,"" he said. ""If that phenomenon didn't exist, if we were all the same and we were all uniform, this type of collaboration"" would not be powerful. Jacob, of the Art Institute of Chicago, said the projects speak to how people yearn to communicate and to be heard in these hyperconnected, digital times. ""It lets you ... meet other people,"" she said. ""We're not talking eHarmony, but all these things, they're interesting and they are of the moment. When people want to use [communication technologies] in a creative way, that's really exciting."" The online art collaborations grow out of a parlor-game tradition called ""exquisite corpse,"" she said. Around 1920, famous surrealist artists gathered to draw portraits in pieces. They folded up large sheets of paper so that each artist could see only the edges of what had already been drawn. The pictures made sense only after the paper was unfolded. The online versions of this concept take the idea further because they involve people all over the world who often know nothing of each other, she said. For example, Darren Solomon's site, inbflat.net, features 20 YouTube videos of musicians, many of whom don't know each other, playing various melodies in the key of B flat. Visitors to the site can play the tunes in any order or combination they choose, meaning that each user in a sense becomes part of the artwork, Solomon said. Solomon, who once played bass with Ray Charles and now writes music for TV ads, said the ""In B Flat"" project shows that ""the world can come together and we all speak that [musical] language."" ""Something about it is very hopeful,"" he said. One key to the project's success, he said, is that it takes relatively little effort for musicians to send in Web-quality videos of themselves playing a short melody in a certain key. ""They're happy to start picking up a video camera and start shooting or they're happy to pick up an instrument and start playing,"" he said. Solomon finds that idea so compelling that he's participated in other projects. With his two sons, ages 7 and 11, he shot three of the 15-second clips of the user-generated ""Star Wars"" that will be stitched together by the site Star Wars Uncut. In one of the videos, he and the boys act out a scene with puppets. In another, his sons wear hooded sweatshirts and fight with light sabers in a New Jersey tunnel. In some cases, people don't even know they're making contributions to online art. Andrei Gheorghe, a Web developer in Romania, created the ""Longest Poem in the World"" by aggregating public Twitter posts and arranging them in rhyming couplets. Computers add 10 to 20 lines to the poem each minute, he said. Gheorghe said he doesn't consider his work art. ""It was just a random idea that popped up and I played with it. And it is what it is,"" he said. Art professors said deciding what is and isn't art is a complicated process. In some ways, these collaborative projects are fine art, they said. In other ways they're like games or means of communication. Like all good art, these projects are trying to ""stand convention on its ear,"" said Maloney, from the Savannah College of Art and Design. ""That's going to keep happening,"" he said. ""So as soon as we finally nail this down you'll have another group of talented artists that are going to say, 'Well, I'm going to do something completely different.'""","Large groups of people are creating collaborative art projects online .
