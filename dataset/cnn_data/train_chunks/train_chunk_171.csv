"(CNN) -- All eyes were on triple world champion Sebastian Vettel during practice ahead of the Chinese Grand Prix, with the German back behind the wheel for the first time since ignoring team orders to clinch victory in Malaysia. The Red Bull driver was left frustrated at the Shanghai International Circuit, struggling for pace as he registered the 10th quickest lap time. World championship leader Vettel was one and a half seconds off the leading time set by Ferrari's Felipe Massa and insisted improvements were needed ahead of qualifying on Saturday. ""Today was a tricky day for us,"" the 25-year-old told the sport's official website. ""I struggled a bit this afternoon and the gap to the guys at the top is a little bit bigger than I'd like. ""There are two or three things that we need to work on and then we should be in a better shape for tomorrow. ""I think we know what we need to do. It looks like the soft tyre is the one for qualifying, but it seems that we won't see that many stints on the soft tyre during the race."" Webber, who was upset by Vettel's decision to overtake him last month despite being instructed by Red Bull to hold position, performed better than his colleague, clocking the fifth fastest time of the day. For Massa it continues a bright start to 2013 which has seen him outperform his double world champion teammate Fernando Alonso. ""Today, I immediately had a good feeling in the car,"" explained Brazil's Massa, who is four points ahead of Alonso in fifth position in the drivers' standings. ""I feel confident and hope that the whole weekend can keep moving in this direction."" Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen, winner of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix set the second fastest time. The 2007 world champion was satisfied with the performance of his Renault car and is optimistic ahead of the weekend. ""If you look at the lap time it looks to have been a pretty okay day,"" said the Finn. ""For sure, there are things we have to improve and you never know what will happen tomorrow, but it's a reasonable start to the weekend. ""We can definitely improve. We have some pace to come from the car in the usual areas with setup. ""My quick lap today could have been better, so there's some more pace to come even if we don't improve the car, but hopefully we do.""","Sebastian Vettel 10th fastest in practice ahead of Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix .

"New York (Financial Times) -- Christie's has become the first international fine art auction house to receive a licence to operate independently in mainland China, giving it an edge in the race among dealers and auctioneers to unlock the potential of the Chinese market. The 247-year-old auction house, with sale rooms in London, Paris, New York and Hong Kong, announced on Tuesday that it plans to hold auctions in Shanghai starting this autumn. Christie's opened an office in Shanghai in 1994 and has held auctions with local firm Forever. ""The market for arts and objects in China has grown exponentially over the past decade. There are more new buyers coming into play in China than any other market in the world,"" Steven Murphy, Christie's chief executive, told the Financial Times. ""To be in mainland China and serve those clients directly . . . has been a dream of ours for quite some time."" In the past five years, the Chinese art market ranked as the fastest-growing in the world, as well as the most important emerging market in terms of the size of its domestic sales, according to a report by TEFAF Maastricht. After briefly overtaking the US as the largest market in the world in 2011 with 30 per cent market share, China slipped to the number two slot in 2012 behind the US with 25 per cent market share following a slowdown in growth. Rival Sotheby's this week closed its five days of sales in wine, jewellery, Asian and Chinese art, ceramics and watches, which were watched closely following slow economic growth in 2012 and a crackdown on extravagant spending by officials. An imperial bowl broke a world record for Chinese Kangxi ceramics, selling for $9.5m. Christie's said that the number of clients from mainland China bidding at its global auctions has doubled since 2008. ""The demand still is there because the number of clients being served is increasing. That is why we wanted to be in China with a home for Christie's, to serve those clients entering the market,"" Mr Murphy said. The agreement restricts Christie's from selling cultural relics, which predate 1911, such as valuable classical paintings and antiques. Christie's ignited controversy in China with the attempted sale in 2009 of two bronze sculptures of animal heads from the Old Summer Palace in Beijing that were part of the late Yves Saint-Laurent's collection. Mr Murphy said the incident did not enter the discussion. Both Christie's and Sotheby's have operated out of Hong Kong for several years, where a large portion of the items are sold to mainland Chinese collectors. In mainland China, Sotheby's has a deal with GeHua to conduct sales in the country. Christie's total sales in Asia were $715.1m in 2012. The granting of a licence to Christie's signals a determination in China to continue to open up to international businesses. This week, Xi Jinping, China's president, promised to protect global companies' interests amid concerns about discriminatory policies that hurt their operations in China.

"(CNN) -- They produced the ""Miracle of Medinah"" but Europe's golfers face an almighty challenge to amaze at Augusta. Not since Jose Maria Olazabal triumphed for the second time 14 years ago has anyone from across the Atlantic managed to get their hands on that green jacket. In fact, Europe's record in the tournament has been abject in recent years with Lee Westwood the only man to have secured a runner-up finish since the turn of the century. When the late, great, Seve Ballesteros became the first European to win the tournament back in 1980, it paved the way for the likes of Olazabal, three-time champion Nick Faldo, Sandy Lyle, Ian Woosnam and double winner Bernhard Langer to go on and dominate. Europe recorded eight wins between 1988 and 1999 and seven out of nine between Lyle's success and Faldo's third title in 1996. But with no success since 1999, the pressure is on Europe's stars to stand up and finally end the drought. ""Does it surprise me? Nothing surprises me in golf anymore,"" former World No.1 Luke Donald told reporters. ""I think since I've been a professional, I feel like the fields have gotten a lot stronger, a lot deeper. You're seeing anyone on a given week has a chance to win. ""This game is a very mental game and it's almost those who are the least fragile players that have a chance."" England's Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter believes Europe's top players simply haven't been good enough while the likes of Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson have won five titles between them. ""We just haven't performed very well. Simple,"" Poulter told reporters. ""We haven't performed well enough and I think the guys are disappointed, to be honest. ""One of the guys would have expected to have come through by now. ""What's the reason for that? I don't know. Tiger (Woods) has taken a few, Phil (Mickelson) has taken a few. They are pretty good those two."" Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy and England's Justin Rose are ranked two and three in the world, while Donald sits fourth on the ladder. But they will have to be at the peak of their powers to end Europe's bid for a famous green jacket with the likes of Woods and Mickelson the men to beat once again. One man who believes this is his best chance of winning at Augusta is Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter. The 37-year-old was a stand out star during Europe's incredible fightback, but he says recreating that kind of form in an individual event is incredibly difficult. ""You've got two sets of fans (at the Ryder Cup) and here you've got fans that are wishing 92 players play well,"" he told reporters . ""It's very difficult to get that same atmosphere, recreate it. It just won't happen. But what will happen is on Sunday afternoon, when you're coming down the stretch, you will be feeling the same kind of emotions. ""The crowds might not be quite as loud, but they will be respectful of good golf shots and obviously the birdies that happen here on a Sunday. ""So I think there will be some good vibes hopefully going through me with nine holes to play and hopefully I can pull upon those Ryder Cup moments to bring me through."" While Europe has struggled, its troubles pales into insignificance compared to those of Australia. Greg Norman's meltdown in 1996 where he contrived to throw away a six-shot lead on the final day still hurts, while the ghosts of near misses in 1986 and 1987 still haunt Australian golf. Adam Scott remains its best hope having finished second two years ago and the 32-year-old is desperate to break the jinx. ""It's going to happen one day. We say it but it's up to one of us to make it happen,"" Scott told reporters. ""I've certainly developed a real level of comfort with the golf course in the last three years, so I say that (an Australian will win the Masters) quietly confident that I believe I can make it happen one of these years."" Scott has demons of his own to exorcise after losing out in dramatic fashion at last year's British Open whee he ended his final round with four consecutive bogeys. But Scott is adamant he has learned from the experience and is ready to go for it at Augusta. He added: ""When I got in position to win again, that's when it was gut-check time as a player, to not let it become a thing... that you struggle to close out a golf tournament. ""I don't dwell on it at all. I just take the positives. It was great for me to play so well for so long. You need a little bit of winner's luck. ""Everyone who wins a tournament has it, but it's not something you can make happen. I guess it just happens and when it's meant to be, it's meant to be. ""That stuff, you can't control, but I think the golfing gods sort all that kind of stuff out.""","Europe aiming to end 14-year drought at The Masters .

"(CNN) -- Defending champions Manchester City salvaged a large chunk of pride when beating runaway Premier League leaders -- and city rivals -- Manchester United 2-1 to register consecutive wins at Old Trafford for the first time in 41 years. The game was played on the day that former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher died at the age of 87, with Premier League officials choosing not to hold a minute's silence in her honor. After a difficult season in which they failed to build upon their first title since 1968, City will treasure a victory, with strikes from James Milner and Sergio Aguero either side of a Vincent Kompany own goal, that will make coach Roberto Mancini sleep a little easier. ""I think we showed we don't deserve to stay 15 points behind,"" the Italian told Sky Sports after the game. ""They have had more consistency in this championship because they won more games. ""Instead we lost points when we probably deserved to win. We showed we deserved to stay closer to the title but it is finished."" The Italian had claimed before the game that United were no better than his side, even if he did concede that they will deserve their title when it arrives, and will feel that the win justified his comments. However, he may still have to appease some fans after saying that his failure to land his top five transfer targets before the season - including United's very own Robin van Persie, Chelsea's Eden Hazard, Javi Martinez (Bayern Munich), Lazio's Daniele De Rossi and Daniel Agger of Liverpool - had cost his team its chance of glory this year. The defeat means that the earliest United, whose lead at the top was reduced to 12 points by second-placed City, can wrap up the title is Monday 22 April, when Alex Ferguson's men host Aston Villa. Having been crushed 6-1 at home by their long-standing rivals last season, United had been expected to not only avenge that humiliation but also confirm with a convincing display that the balance of power had definitively shifted back in their favor. Prior to the game, former United defender Gary Neville had told United Review media that City's handsome derby victory and dramatic title had led to erroneous claims in the media. ""Reports of [a power shift] misunderstood Manchester United,"" said the former full back. ""Here is a manager and players who don't understand phrases like 'power shift'. They just make them more determined to ram such phrases back down people's throats."" Disregarding Monday night's disappointment, United -- who can no longer break the 100-point barrier -- certainly have shown an emphatic desire to reclaim a title they have already won 19 times. In fact, there is a direct parallel with two other major European leagues where traditionally dominant powers have rebounded from league failures to reclaim the title in convincing fashion. On Saturday, Bayern Munich -- who were pipped to the German championship by Borussia Dortmund last year -- beat Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 to mark the earliest clinching of the league title in Bundesliga history, 20 points clear with six games still left to play. In Spain, Real Madrid hit the magical 100-point mark when beating great rivals Barcelona to the 2011-2012 title -- a failure which has focused the latter to such extent that they lead La Liga by 13 points with eight rounds left. With Montpellier way off the pace in the French league, the only one of the top five European leagues where the champion looks set to defend their trophy is in Italy, where Juventus boast a nine-point lead with seven games to go. Monday night's anticipated Rome derby was overshadowed by pre-match violence, with two Roma supporters stabbed -- an incident which prompted Rome's mayor to make a public appeal for calm. On the pitch, Brazilian Hernanes gave Lazio an early lead prior to missing a penalty in the second half, with Roma legend Francesco Totti making no mistake from 12 yards when handed a spot-kick of his own. Despite the dismissal of Lazio's Giuseppe Bavia with 21 minutes to go, seventh-placed Roma could not find a winner that would have moved them above their city rivals into fifth place in Serie A. Reflecting on a calmer derby in England, victorious Manchester City captain Kompany feels that his side's victory could play a pivotal role in the race for next season's English championship. ""A derby is always a special game for us and to be able to win is massive,"" said the Belgian. ""I do believe the way we finish this season will have an impact on how we do next season. ""This is a good win to have under our belt and we will take it into the next season.""","Manchester City win 2-1 at home of great rivals after goals from James Milner and Sergio Aguero .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The parent company of Apple's biggest parts supplier, Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, had a 19.2% drop in revenue during the first quarter as iPhone orders slowed down faster than expected. Hon Hai reported first quarter 2013 revenue of nearly $27 billion, down from $33.4 billion during the same period last year, according to company reports. Hon Hai's share price fell 0.25% by mid-day trading Thursday. The company's share price has fallen nearly 9% year-to-date. Richard Lai, Editor-in-chief for Engadget China, says that increased competition in the smartphone market suggests an overreliance on Apple behind Foxconn woes. ""If you go along the streets now, a lot of people are holding a Samsung device more than an Apple device. Many people are getting bored with the iPhone look or frustrated with the iPhone's battery life. On the other hand, Samsung has been offering better battery life and bigger screens."" In 2012, Samsung toppled Apple as the world's largest smartphone maker. According to IDC, Samsung held 29% global market share in the fourth quarter of 2012; Apple trailed at number two with 21.8%. As for Hon Hai's sales slump, Lai points out the company has other businesses that may not be doing well. ""In China, they have Cybermart, a chain of retail stores that sells electronics. Hon Hai also sells an HDTV, under the Radio Shack brand,"" Lai said. ""But until Hon Hai releases its next earnings report we won't be able to know...about where they've failed.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Charlie Sheen advises people to stay away from crack cocaine ""unless you can manage it socially,"" which he told a radio interviewer Monday he could. Sheen, who has been undergoing substance abuse rehab treatments at home, said he is currently ""peeing clean,"" and the producers of his hit sitcom should take advantage of it while they can. The actor spoke glibly to the syndicated ""The Dan Patrick Show"" Monday morning on a variety of subjects, from drug and alcohol use to baseball. ""I healed really quickly, but I also unravel really quickly, so get me right now guys,"" Sheen said. ""Get me right now."" During the interview, the actor said ""it's hard to say"" how long he's been clean, saying he doesn't use the term ""'sober' anymore, I'm not in AA, I don't believe in it."" Dr. Drew Pinsky, a California-based addiction specialist, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that Sheen's rationalization of his substance abuse issues are an example of what he called ""stinking thinking."" ""Here he's had these horrific consequences, and he thinks he's on the right path,"" said Pinsky, who has an MTV reality series on celebrity addiction and will helm his own HLN show starting this spring. ""As a physician, I can tell that this is going to have a very, very unhappy ending."" CBS placed ""Two and a Half Men"" on ""production hiatus"" after the actor began rehab treatments in the wake of an emergency hospital visit last week. Sheen said in Monday's interview that he was surprised by what he called a ""forced hiatus."" ""I went back to work and you know, I was banging on the door stage door like, 'Hello! Where's everybody?' I don't know what happened, I guess they're closed,"" he said. Shooting is scheduled to resume at the end of February, Sheen's representative told CNN earlier this month. ""I believe August of 2014 at this pace, I don't know,"" Sheen joked Monday. ""It's supposed to be like the 28th or the 29th. That's what it is, it's the 29th of the nonleap year."" CBS and Warner Bros Television, which produces the show, declined to comment on Sheen's statements. Sheen issued a written statement just two weeks ago thanking the network executives for their support. ""I have a lot of work to do to be able to return the support I have received from so many people,"" Sheen said in a statement. ""Like Errol Flynn, who had to put down his sword on occasion, I just want to say, 'thank you.' "" While Sheen doesn't like to use the term ""sober,"" he said Monday, ""It's off and on, you know.""

Sheen was ""very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain"" on the morning of January 27, according to a 911 call from a doctor who had just talked to the actor. Porn actress Kacey Jordan has told media outlets that a two-day party preceded Sheen's collapse. Paramedics went to Sheen's Los Angeles home and then took him by ambulance to a hospital, where he spent several hours. While his representative blamed a hernia for Sheen's pain, he later announced the actor is undergoing rehab at home.","NEW: Dr. Drew Pinsky predicts a ""very, very unhappy ending"" for Sheen .

"Seoul (CNN) -- Amid the war of words and escalating threats emanating from north of the border, for many in South Korea the focus has been on the annual cherry blossom season. For South Koreans, the arrival of spring guarantees a few things, even in times when headlines echo the threats of conflict: hard-core hikers out in droves, fresh produce in the markets and trees up and down the peninsula blossoming into great swaths of soft pinks and yellows. Springtime is famed as cherry blossom season and greatly anticipated in a number of cities and towns across South Korea. Most notable among celebration cities is Jinhae, located a short bus ride outside of Busan along the southeast coast. Here, the annual Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival commemorates the season's ephemeral beauty. An estimated 340,000 cherry trees line Jinhae's streets, rivers and train tracks, and dot surrounding mountainsides. More than one million South Korean and international visitors attend the festival each year. The festival originated in 1952 and added the Naval Port Festival to its celebrations in 1963. Honoring Admiral Yi Sun-Shin, famous for guiding victories against the Japanese during the Joseon Dynasty, the naval festival marks the only time during the year when Jinhae's Republic of Korea Naval Academy campus and Naval Museum are open to visitors. A full-sized replica of the 16th-century turtle ships used by the Admiral are among the displays. Cherry blossom fans commonly seek photo ops of train tracks beneath a canopy of pink flowers, and around Yeojwa stream and promenade, which is lined with blossoming trees and canola flowers. The latter location was made famous in scenes from the Korean drama ""Romance,"" and has become a hot spot for couples taking photos. As with most festivals in South Korea, the Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival can be crowded. Cheap, abundant, varied and delicious, festival food carts supply a delicious selection of all things fried, grilled and glutinous. Barbecue chicken on a stick, sausage, grilled squid and octopus, corn on the cob and tteokbokki (rice cakes in spicy sauce) are available for only a few thousand won (a few dollars). More adventurous is beondaegi (boiled silkworm larvae). A reliable sit-down option at any local restaurant, dolsot bibimbap is a mixture of rice and vegetables topped with an egg and spicy sauce served in a hot stone bowl. It's one of the most satisfying and popular meals around, and goes great with local makgeolli (Korean rice wine). For visitors, the Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival makes a memorable day trip. Direct trains and buses travel to Jinhae from Seoul and Busan. Direct buses from other locations can be limited, though buses connecting through other cities are plentiful. From Changwon, for instance, the local 151 city bus serves Jinhae and travels directly to key festival sites. Thanks to its southern location, Jinhae's cherry blossoms peak earlier than most in South Korea. The blossoms are expected to end this week. If you miss the blooms here you might be able to catch them a little further north.

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda is claiming responsibility for the destruction of a Syrian Army convoy in western Iraq last week that killed some 48 Syrians and nine Iraqi soldiers. The militant group released a statement on jihadist forums Monday. The group claims it intercepted the convoy while the Syrian troops were on their way to camps secretly provided by the Iraqi government. The militants said everyone in the convoy was killed. The attack has raised concerns that Syria's civil war could spill over into Iraq. ""From the beginning, we have warned that some militant groups want to move the conflict in Syria to Iraq,"" Ali al-Mussawi, an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, said last week. ""Militant groups are very active on the border areas between Iraq and Syria."" Al-Mussawi said that many of the Syrians killed in the ambush had earlier received medical treatment in Iraq. They were wounded during a battle at the Yaarabiya-Rabia border crossing. The point is called Rabia in Iraq; Yaarabiya in Syria. Dozens of Syrian soldiers and officials took refuge in Iraq by surrendering to that country's army on March 1 after rebels took over the Yaarabiya post, Iraqi security officials said. They added that the convoy had been headed from Rabia to the al-Waleed border crossing in Iraq's Anbar province when it was attacked. The United Nations has estimated that about 70,000 people have been killed in Syria's civil war, which began roughly two years ago.","The Al Qaeda claim appears on jihadist forums .

"(CNN) -- Colorado authorities on Thursday arrested a man wanted in connection with the March shooting death of state prison chief Tom Clements. Thomas Guolee -- referred to as a ""person of interest in the Tom Clements murder investigation"" -- was taken into custody ""on an active felony arrest warrant by local authorities in Colorado Springs"" around 5:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET), the El Paso, Colorado, County Sheriff's Office said. Two hours later, he was being held on ""a no bond hold for violation of parole"" at the El Paso County Sheriff's Office Criminal Justice Center. Law enforcement authorities in El Paso County and Colorado Springs did not immediately respond to requests Thursday night from CNN for more information, including on how Guolee was arrested and what the arrest warrant was for. A search of the Colorado Department of Corrections' website indicated that Guolee is 31 and had been on parole. Authorities have said they suspect Evan Ebel shot Clements outside his Colorado home. Ebel died two days later in a shootout with authorities in Texas. Another man, James Lohr, was arrested in the same case earlier this month, also in Colorado Springs. He and Guolee were both associated with Ebel in the days before Clements' death, a source close to the investigation said. Police have described Lohr and Guolee as associates of the white supremacist 211 Crew gang, a group that included Ebel. Investigators have said they were looking into whether Ebel might have conspired with other inmates to kill Clements. Clements was widely recognized for cracking down on prison gangs, including the 211 Crew. Ebel -- who had been convicted for an armed robbery and punching a prison guard -- was released early on parole because of a clerical error. He also is suspected in the killing of part-time pizza deliveryman Nathan Leon shortly before Clements was shot dead.","Thomas Guolee, 31, is taken into custody in Colorado Springs, a sheriff's office says .

"(CNN) -- A Philippine clan leader's bizarre attempt to revive the territorial claims of a defunct Islamic sultanate on the island of Borneo appears to be falling apart. With his followers engaged in a deadly game of cat and mouse with Malaysian security forces in the villages and palm oil plantations of northeastern Borneo, the self-proclaimed Sultan of Sulu is calling for a cease-fire after the U.N. secretary-general urged an end to the violence. But Malaysia promptly rejected the proposal and said its security forces had killed more than 30 of the Filipino fighters on Thursday. Between 100 and 300 men from the southern Philippines came ashore in the area, in the Malaysian state of Sabah, about three weeks ago, claiming to be the Royal Army of the Sultanate of Sulu, a former kingdom in the region whose power has faded. Jamalul Kiram III, one of the clan leaders claiming to be the rightful sultan, says he sent the men, some of whom are armed, to Sabah to reassert the sultanate's sovereignty over the area. But their arrival in the coastal district of Lahad Datu caused alarm and embarrassment in Malaysia, which still pays a token fee each year to the sultanate for the lease of Sabah. While scrambling to explain how so many armed intruders had managed to slip through the maritime border that separates Sabah from the nearby southern Philippine islands, Malaysian security forces tried to persuade the clansmen to return home peacefully. But those efforts -- supported by the Philippine government, which is pursuing a peace initiative with Muslim rebels in its restive southern islands -- failed as clashes in Sabah late last week left about 28 people dead, including several Malaysian police officers. A Malaysian offensive . Malaysian authorities responded by launching an offensive using fighter jets, mortar shells and ground troops on Tuesday. They followed that up with what they called a ""mopping up"" operation, going house to house in the area, searching for the Filipino fighters. But Kiram's spokesman, Abraham Idjirani, said Wednesday that the Malaysian attack had missed its target, striking an area that the Filipino clansmen had already vacated. He claimed the group hadn't suffered casualties. A day later, Idjirani made the call for a cease-fire on behalf of Kiram, saying the clan was responding to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's plea for the fighting to stop. But Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Kuala Lumpur won't consider any request for a cease-fire as long as the armed intruders in Sabah refuse to lay down weapons unconditionally, the official news agency Bernama reported Thursday. Later on, Ismail Omar, the head of the Malaysian Police, said security forces had killed 32 ""militants"" in Sabah on Thursday, including one they believed had the rank of general, according to Bernama. The task of the Malaysian security forces in hunting down the clan members has been made more complicated by the strong ethnic ties between many of the people in Sabah and the southern Philippines. Many of the sultanate's followers are believed to have friends and family living in the area. Malaysian police have admitted that the Filipinos are blending in with the local population. In a statement Wednesday, Ban's office said the U.N. secretary-general ""urges an end to the violence and encourages dialogue among all the parties for a peaceful resolution of the situation."" Ban also expressed concern about the effects of the fighting on the civilian population in the area, including migrants. People and goods regularly go back and forth across the porous sea border between Sabah and the southern Philippines. Eroded power . Established in the 15th century, the Sultanate of Sulu became an Islamic power center in the southern Philippines that at one point claimed sovereignty over Sabah. But the encroachment of Western colonial powers, followed by the emergence of the Philippines and Malaysia as independent nation states, steadily eroded the sultanate's influence. Sulu is now a province within the Republic of the Philippines. But the historical connection still fuels tensions between Malaysia and the Philippines, with Manila retaining a ""dormant claim"" to Sabah through the Sultanate of Sulu, according to the CIA World Factbook. The Philippines claims much of the eastern part of Sabah, which was leased to the British North Borneo Company in 1878 by the Sultanate of Sulu. In 1963, Britain transferred Sabah to Malaysia, a move that the sultanate claimed was a breach of the 1878 deal.

"(CNN) -- South Korea accused North Korea Wednesday of carrying out a wave of cyberattacks that paralyzed the networks of major South Korean banks and broadcasters last month. An official investigation found that many of the malignant codes employed in the attacks were similar to ones used by the North previously, said Lee Seung-won, an official at the South Korean science ministry. Although some observers said at the time of the computer crashes that they suspected North Korean involvement, this is the first time that Seoul has formally pointed the finger at Pyongyang. The allegations coincide with a tense situation on the Korean Peninsula, with the North making repeated threats of war. South Korean and U.S. officials have warned that a North Korean missile test could take place at any moment. North Korea's war of words escalates: A timeline of the crisis . South Korea believes North Korea had spent at least eight months preparing for the cyberattacks, which also affected hundreds of individual citizens' computers and websites that cover North Korea, Lee said at a news briefing Wednesday. There didn't appear to be any immediate reaction on North Korean state-run media to the South Korean accusations. The main hacking attack took place on March 20, hitting more than 48,000 computers at the South Korean banks and broadcasters, authorities said. It infected the companies' computer networks with a malicious program, or malware, that slowed or shut down systems. The South's investigation found evidence including IP addresses and other elements used in the cyberattacks that it said proved North Korean responsibility. The hackers routed the attacks through more 10 different countries, Lee said. South Korea has accused the North of similar hacking attacks before, including incidents in 2010 and 2012 that also targeted banks and media organizations. Pyongyang has rejected the allegations.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. military cleared the F-35 fighter jet to fly again after the fleet of jets were temporarily grounded. The jets, that are designed for use by the Navy, Air Force and Marines, were grounded on February 21 due to a crack in an engine component that was discovered during a routine inspection in California, the Pentagon said.

"(CNN) -- Last week, a federal judge issued a decision lifting the age and point-of-sale restrictions on emergency contraception, citing solid scientific and medical research showing that it is safe and effective in preventing unintended pregnancy. This is great news for all women because these restrictions created confusion and barriers, and when unprotected sex has occurred, time is a crucial factor. Emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy for up to five days after intercourse, but the sooner it's used the more effective it is. That's why women's health providers and activists lobbied to make emergency contraception available without a prescription Ã¢â¬â to reduce delays. And because emergency contraception is safe, making it over-the-counter was a big step in creating better access to birth control. Clearing up confusion about what emergency contraception is and how it works has been more challenging. It's a fact that emergency contraception is birth control. The reality is, pregnancy doesn't happen right after sex. It can take up to six days for the sperm and egg to meet after intercourse. That's why it's possible to prevent pregnancy even after the fact. Emergency contraception postpones ovulation, which prevents sperm from coming in contact with and fertilizing an egg. Pregnancy can't happen if there is no egg to join with sperm. In contrast, the so-called ""abortion pill,"" mifepristone, works by blocking the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. So there's a big difference between emergency contraception and nonsurgical abortion. There was much talk last week about the implications of lifting the age restrictions. Some of it was motivated by safety concerns, which is a good and natural question to ask about any medication. It's a fact that doctors have been prescribing emergency birth control since the 1960s, and there have been no reports of serious complications. More to the point, studies have repeatedly shown that emergency contraception is safe for use by women of all ages, including teens. Another concern among some is that access to emergency contraception will increase the rates of unprotected sex, especially among teens. There is no evidence to support this. It's a fact that rates of unprotected sex do not increase when there is more access to emergency contraception. Research also indicates that teens understand how to use emergency contraception and that it is not intended for ongoing, regular use. The bottom line is that the use of reliable birth control is the best way to prevent an unintended pregnancy, but the fact is that unprotected sex does occur and sometimes birth control methods do fail. A condom could break, a woman could forget to take a pill, or nonconsensual sex could occur. That's why when a woman fears she might become pregnant after her contraceptive has failed or she has had unprotected sex, she needs fast access to emergency contraception, not delays at the pharmacy counter. Lifting these restrictions will allow emergency contraception to be stocked on store shelves, making it more accessible to everyone. It will provide a safe, effective way to prevent pregnancy and reduce the need for abortion . That's why last week's ruling is so important Ã¢â¬â it's based on good science and good sense. And that's a fact. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Deborah Nucatola.","Deborah Nucatola: Judge lifts age and sale restrictions on emergency contraception .
It's boon for young women, she says; time a crucial factor in preventing unwanted pregnancy .

"(WIRED) -- You want it. You want it desperately. You want it desperately, but you don't even know what it is. Such is consumer desire for 4G data connectivity in mobile handsets. Call it proof positive that the phone carriers' marketing efforts have paid off -- this despite slow 4G infrastructure roll-outs, and actual 4G data rates that fall far, far below the promise of the 4G spec. In-Stat, a market research firm, recently announced that 75% of more than 1,200 surveyed consumers listed 4G as one of the features that an ""ideal"" phone would include. The survey also found that most consumers don't know which carrier offers the fastest 4G speeds -- immediately begging the question, ""Would a consumer even recognize a 4G connection if it hit him or her in face?"" 4G is definitely a relevant smartphone feature. But the disparity between consumer knowledge and consumer desire is troubling, and may stem from the way that 4G technology is being advertised. 4G networks are currently underdeveloped, but carriers have been strongly pushing their networks nonetheless. And although carriers are marketing their 4G networks and 4G handset offerings nationwide, the actual availability of 4G services varies widely. For example, AT&T's brand-new LTE network is only available in five urban markets (though the carrier does plan to cover 80% of the populace by 2013). Verizon's LTE network, which currently features the fastest network speeds in the U.S., covers 88 markets. It's a large number, yes, but Verizon's LTE network is available to just 110 of the nation's estimated 307 million people. That's around 33% of the U.S. population, a far cry from the reported 75% who crave a 4G device. CNET has compiled a useful chart of U.S. markets that are supported by at least one 4G provider. Coverage looks substantial at first glance, but for those in more rural areas -- or even metropolitan locales like San Francisco, which suffers extremely spotty coverage -- reliable 4G access is still a few years away. And spotty coverage isn't the only factor contributing to consumer confusion. Get this: A significant portion of people who own a 3G device mistakenly think they have 4G hardware. A July survey by Retrevo found that an astonishing 34% of iPhone 4 owners thought they had a 4G phone. These customers were probably confused by their iPhone's ""4Ã¢â¬Â³ designation, as well as the fact that the official definition of 4G is a moving target, and Apple has claimed ""4G-like"" speeds. But iPhone owners aren't alone in their misconceptions. In that same Retrevo survey, a quarter of BlackBerry owners thought they had a 4G phone, when at the time of the study, there was no 4G BlackBerry handset yet available! ""To be quite frank, there is no definition for what 4G is,"" Gartner analyst Michael King says. ""Most LTE networks are pretty new, and there's not much to compare it to."" This leads to even more confusion, particularly regarding what levels of speed users should be expecting from 4G service (which we'll get into soon). Regardless, carriers have successfully managed to brand the term ""4G"" into our brains through successful advertising techniques. ""The industry has done a great job of associating 4G with the things a customer wants to do, but haven't been able to accomplish with 3G,"" iSuppli analyst Francis Sideco says. Those things include real-time gaming, streaming video and the ability to make video calls. ""Marketing has focused on what you can do with it, rather than on technology for the sake of technology,"" Sideco says. This approach stands in stark contrast to the confused messaging of 3G rollout campaigns, circa 2008. Back then, carriers touted improved data speeds, but many consumers didn't understand what those data rates could be used for -- completely understandable considering the relatively small installed base of smartphones in that quaint era of feature phones. But that was 2008. Today, a boatload of 4G phones are now available, with new ones popping up with increasing frequency. This morning, AT&T announced its first two LTE handsets, the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket and HTC Vivid. The HTC Vivid has a 4.5-inch, 540 x 960 display and a dual-core 1.2 GHz Snapdragon processor. The Skyrocket is AT&T's version of the popular Galaxy S II, which has a 4.5-inch, 480 x 800 Super AMOLED Plus display, and a 1.5 GHz Exynos chip. Both run Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and will be available Nov. 6. With consumers clamoring for 4G handsets, carriers must be able to follow through with their 4G promises -- and that means improving on two key 3G performance pain points: throughput and latency. Throughput is the spec everyone usually talks about. Measured in bits per second (or megabits per second in the case of 4G), this spec describes just how much data can be sent through a carrier's network in a fixed time period -- that is, a second. This number refers to pure network speed -- and everyone wants speedier data service, hence everyone's preoccupation with throughput. Latency, meanwhile, describes the time delay between when a mobile device ""pings"" a network and when that network actually responds. High-latency networks cause a host of problems -- most significantly, streaming video that stutters along in fits and starts. When network latency is low, however, real-time applications like video chat really begin to sing. Bottom line: Even if you've got the fastest throughput imaginable, high latency levels will prevent you from enjoying video calls and and other types of streaming video. Current 4G throughput speeds -- whether you're talking about LTE, WiMax or the not-quite-4G HSPA+ -- are definitely slower than what could be theoretically accomplished, but Sideco says that will always be the case. The theoretical speeds of 21 Mbps for HSPA+ and 70 Mbps for LTE could only be achieved in absolutely ideal conditions (for example, if you're standing right next to a cellphone tower, or you're the only one using the network). But that's OK, as carriers aren't even saying they can achieve these spec-topping speeds. On Sprint's WiMax network, you're promised 3- to 6-Mbps download speeds; on Verizon's LTE, 5- to 12-Mbps download speeds; and with HSPA+, 5- to 10-Mbps download speeds (AT&T specifies 6 Mbps). All of these real-world numbers fall far short of 4G's theoretical benchmarks. But don't stress out. As long as consumers know what they're really getting, they can make the informed decision to upgrade to a 4G phone and network. Or not.

"(CNN) -- Driver's licenses and other state benefits are at the heart of a new battle in the national immigration debate. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer fired the opening salvo last week, on the same day that federal authorities began accepting applications for a program aimed at helping tens of thousands of young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children. Brewer ordered officials in her state not to provide driver's licenses or any other benefits to immigrants granted ""deferred status"" under the new federal program, which allows accepted applicants to remain in the United States and work without fear of deportation for at least two years. Undocumented immigrants take chance of a lifetime . ""A lot of these issues are in uncharted waters. In this particular area, which is how do you treat people that are deferred action, there's very little legal precedent to go by,"" said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute's office at the New York University School of Law. ""States are making their own judgments."" That means the actual benefits recipients see could depend on where they live. Governors in Nebraska and Texas have already followed Brewer's lead. ""The state of Nebraska will continue its practice of not issuing driver's licenses, welfare benefits or other public benefits to illegal immigrants unless specifically authorized by Nebraska statute,"" Gov. Dave Heineman said Friday. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has said that the federal immigration ""directive does not undermine or change our state laws,"" writing in a letter to the state's attorney general that the federal guidelines ""confer absolutely no legal status whatsoever"" on any immigrant who qualifies. But California is moving toward granting licenses to the influx of undocumented immigrants expected to take advantage of the federal policy, as is Oregon. ""We're still trying to sort out what this new limbo category means for states,"" said Ann Morse, program director of the Immigrant Policy Project at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Under the new policy, people younger than 30 who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military, can get a two-year deferral from deportation and apply for work permits. A memo outlining the Obama administration's policy states that the program does not grant legal status. But it does provide for a work permit and, presumably, the benefits that come with it. The policy doesn't grant ""legal status,"" but does give ""legal presence,"" Morse said. State authorities, she said, are struggling to answer a key question: ""What do these two terms mean, and how do they intersect?"" Undocumented immigrants line up for relief from deportation . For Brewer, Heineman and Perry, the two don't intersect. ""If lawful status is required to receive a benefit, an individual will need to seek lawful status, not deferred action,"" Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said. So if undocumented immigrants in their states couldn't get licenses before, they can't get them now, since the legal status of the immigrants has not changed, their argument goes. In some states, a work visa could be enough to establish legal presence and receive a driver's license, said Ian Grossman, vice president of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. The topic has been coming up for many state officials, he said. ""They're definitely talking about it. The consensus is that well, we have our rules of who's eligible for a license,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, it's a state-issued document, and the state has the authority to determine who is eligible for that document."" But in every state, the statutes determining those rules are different. ""It's too early to qualify or really predict what the impact may or may not be,"" he said. Even in some states that have passed strong anti-illegal immigration laws, such as Georgia, driver's licenses may be available to undocumented immigrants who qualify under the new policy. Under current Georgia law, people with deferred status can get a license, and that's what the state will do unless it gets different orders, said Susan Sports, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Driver Services. ""We're waiting for direction,"" she said. The situation could be even more complicated when it comes to university tuition. Policies in different states vary, from barring undocumented immigrants from enrolling at all, to granting them in-state tuition. In Georgia, the tuition rules are not mandated by law, but by university regents, said Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney in Atlanta. Once these new young immigrants are able to get Social Security numbers and driver's licenses, they may qualify for more benefits, he said. 5 things to know about the big change in immigration policy . States such as Arizona cannot discriminate against the new deferred action holders, and will eventually have to relent, Kuck argued. Immigration lawyers are aware of the driver's license issue, but are more focused right now on helping immigrants apply to the deferred action program, said Carlina Tapia-Ruano, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. ""Once applicants are approved, we will then as a group turn our attention to how to resolve this problem,"" the Chicago-based immigration attorney said. ""Our concern (now) is not can you get a driver's license. Our concern is how can we get you qualified to get a work permit."" But battle lines are already being drawn in the latest war between the states and the federal government on immigration legislation, said Chishti of the Migration Policy Institute. ""States that have chosen to be welcoming towards immigrants will embrace this program through their state policies, and states that have been somewhat restrictive toward immigration and immigrants will see this as a new occasion to restrict state benefits from these programs,"" he said. U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesman Peter Boogaard said that the agency ""doesn't comment on state specific matters."" Faces of hope line up for two more years in the U.S. But he noted, in a written statement, that the department's deferred action program ""is only a temporary measure."" ""Congress must still act to provide a permanent solution to fix the broken immigration system,"" he said. ""Until Congress acts, DHS is dedicated to implementing smart, effective reforms to the immigration system that allow it to focus its resources on common sense enforcement priorities, including criminals and other public safety threats."" In her executive order last week, Brewer said giving deferred action recipients ""improper access"" to state and local benefits would ""have significant and lasting impacts on the Arizona budget, its health care system and additional public benefits that Arizona taxpayers fund."" Critics have slammed the Arizona governor's approach. ""Brewer is distorting federal law and inaccurately interpreting state law,"" Alessandra Soler, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, said in a statement. ""This order conflicts with state and federal law, because people who are granted deferred action will, in fact, have authorized presence in the United States."" Governors in Arizona, Nebraska and Texas are ""shooting their economies right in the foot,"" said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum. ""If this political grandstanding is successful, what will happen is that job creators won't be able to drive to the small business they want to start, and this new class of taxpayers will be kept from contributing to their states,"" said Noorani. ""At the state level, we're going to watch this very closely."" Chishti, of the Migration Policy Institute, said the battle could end up in the halls of state legislatures -- or at the U.S. Supreme Court.

"Washington (CNN) -- As the United States negotiated with countries around the world to find new homes for the remaining detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Kuwait's minister of interior had a solution for the four Kuwaiti citizens left in the prison. ""You picked them up in Afghanistan; you should drop them off in Afghanistan,"" Shaikh Jaber Al-Khalid Al-Sabah is quoted as saying, ""in the middle of the war zone,"" where the detainees could be killed in combat. The 2009 cable titled ""The Interior Minister's remedy for terrorists: Let them die,"" is among the diplomatic documents posted online by WikiLeaks. In it, Al-Sabah is quoted as expressing concerns about his country's ability to hold the Guantanamo detainees. ""You know better than I that we cannot deal with these people. I can't detain them,"" said Al-Sabah. ""If I take their passports, they will sue to get them. I can talk to you into next week about building a rehabilitation center, but it won't happen. ... They are rotten and the best thing to do is get rid of them."" The cable reflects the difficult position the Kuwaiti government was in regarding the detainees and its problems in ""apprehending and detaining terror financiers and facilitators under Kuwait's current legal and political framework."" Facing pressure to ""bring their boys home,"" as the cable puts it, Kuwait's inability to keep the suspected terrorists in custody was a difficult and embarrassing issue, as exemplified by the case of Mohammed al-Bathali. Al-Bathali, a self-confessed jihadi recruiter and terror financier, had been sentenced to serve three to five years for ""'inciting jihad' against a friend state."" But he was released on bond. In a different cable from the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh there is a discussion regarding the recidivism rate of Guantanamo detainees returned to Saudi Arabia who then passed through the country's rehabilitation program. Of the 119 detainees who went through the program, the cable reports, the overall rate of recidivism was 8 to 10 percent, according to the 2009 cable. ""The real story of the Saudi rehabilitation program is one of success: at least 90 percent of its graduates appear to have given up jihad and reintegrated into Saudi society,"" the cable says. ""The recidivists are the exception, not the rule."" The cable does acknowledge however, that it was more difficult to rehabilitate former Guantanamo detainees than others. In another creative solution for the detainees, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah proposed to implant a Bluetooth-like device into former Guantanamo detainees to track their movements. During a March 22, 2009, meeting between U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor John Brennan and King Abdullah, the king suggested an ""electronic chip"" be implanted in the detainees to allow for tracking their movements as is done with Saudi horses and falcons. According to the cable, Brennan deflected the idea, saying, ""horses don't have good lawyers,"" pointing out that such a proposal would face legal hurdles in the United States. The relocation of 17 Chinese Muslim Uyghurs detained at Guantanamo Bay also was a thorny issue for the United States, according to the WikiLeaks cables. Attempts to find new homes for those detainees was met with resistance because of fear of retribution from China. At one point, Germany considered accepting seven of the Uyghurs. But the government was ""subsequently warned by China of 'a heavy burden on bilateral relations'"" between Germany and China if the Germans accepted the detainees. According to one cable, German Chancellery Security and Foreign Policy Advisor Christoph Heusgen said relocation of the Uyghurs ""would be 'too difficult,' but Germany could probably accept '2-3 others' from Guantanamo. The document also summarized Heusgen as saying, ""if Germany were to take any [Uyghurs], it would be best to do so in combination with other European countries to prevent China from focusing its opposition on any one country."" In another cable, this one from the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, the Chinese ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, Zhang Yannian, is quoted as calling America's refusal to relocate the detainees to China a ""slap in the face."" The missive quotes Zhang as saying, ""Releasing 17 from Guantanamo is an unfriendly act toward us."" ""He then went on at length about what a 'slap in the face' it was to China that the Uyghur detainees were not going to be returned to their homeland but instead shipped to Germany, where reportedly they had already been granted refugee status,"" the cable says. It goes on to say that Zhang ""did imply that the Guantanamo situation had made China look for ways to hit back at the U.S."" The 17 Uyghurs were eventually relocated to Palau, Bermuda, Albania and Switzerland.","A cable posted on WikiLeaks quotes a Kuwaiti official on Guantanamo detainees .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea reached their third semifinal under Rafa Benitez, and their 18th in the Roman Abramovich era, despite losing the second leg of their Europa League quarterfinal to Rubin Kazan 3-2. Thanks to their 3-1 victory in the first leg though, the Blues stay on course to add the continent's second tier title to the Champions League crown they so famously won last May. Swiftly after the match, Benitez's thoughts immediately turned to Sunday's FA Cup semifinal clash with Manchester City at Wembley. The Spaniard, whose Stamford Bridge tenure has been fraught with tension given his difficult relationship with Chelsea fans, knows he has already taken charge of one semifinal with the Blues -- one which ended in disappointing League Cup defeat to Swansea. ""It doesn't too matter too much [about the result],"" Benitez told ESPN television after the match in Moscow. ""There were circumstances such as the pitch, so it was a professional job and I was pleased with the players' effort. ""We are pleased to get through, but a little disappointed because we could have done a little better in defense, but the main thing was to progress. ""We have to manage both games in the Europa League and FA Cup. Some of them will not play on Sunday but we can carry on in different competitions, which is good for the squad."" The success capped a triumphant return to the artificial surface of the Luzhniki Stadium, where Chelsea lost the 2008 Champions League final to Manchester United, after Rubin Kazan were forced to play away from home given concerns over the state of their stadium. Chelsea will discover their opponents in the last four on Friday, when European body UEFA conducts the draw for both the Europa League and Champions League. Thursday proved a mixed night for English clubs, with Newcastle United exiting at the hands of Benfica, with the Portuguese side tipped by many to win the competition, while Tottenham Hotspur were knocked out by Basel. Playing at home and trailing 3-1 from the first leg, the Magpies made a late breakthrough through Papiss Cisse and had a shot at glory only for substitute Hatem Ben Arfa to fire over with time running out. In stoppage time, Eduardo Salvio finished off a slick counterattack to ensure the Eagles progressed and stamped their authority on the 4-2 aggregate scoreline. Swiss side Basel, meanwhile, held their nerve to win a penalty shootout 4-1 after the tie had ended 4-4 on aggregate, with Spurs holding the home side to a 2-2 draw. After Jan Vertonghen was sent off late on for the visitors, Spurs seemed to believe a shootout was their best chance of victory - but Basel were flawless from 12 yards and reached their first European semifinal in the 120th year of the club's existence. A similar fate befell Fenerbahce, who took a 2-0 lead to a deserted Olympic Stadium in Rome, where they faced a Lazio side playing behind closed doors as punishment for their supporters' poor record on racism. The home side struggled to find a breakthrough until Senad Lulic scored on the hour mark but shortly after, Caner Erkin equalized to mark an historic chapter for a Turkish club founded in 1907.","Chelsea reach second straight European semi despite losing 3-2 in Russia to Rubin Kazan .

"(CNN) -- Accused of being too soft on racism in the past, European football's governing body UEFA has vowed to crack down hard on offenders -- with 10-match bans for players and officials found guilty. This year both UEFA and world governing body FIFA have come under pressure following AC Milan forward Kevin-Prince Boateng's decision to walk off the field in a match against Italian fourth tier side Pro Patria in January after suffering racist abuse from the crowd. ""It's still a scourge on the game,"" UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino told the Soccerex event, where leading football officials are meeting, in Manchester, England. ""We have to have sanctions. ""What we are proposing is that if a player or official is found guilty then they will be suspended for 10 matches."" With several racist incidents making headlines in the past calendar year, UEFA is also prepared to punish supporters' racist behavior by closing sections of football grounds -- or, if need be, all of the stadium -- in cases of persistent fan abuse. ""If supporters are found guilty then there will be a partial closure of the stadium,"" added Infantino. ""This means the section where the offense took place will be closed. If there is a second offense by the club's supporters there will be full closure with a minimum $65,400 fine."" However, Infantino said UEFA would not be taking any action against Malaga despite the furious reaction of club owner and the Spanish club's coach in the wake of their team's European Champions League defeat in Germany on Tuesday. Sheikh Abdullah Al-Thani, angered by two late goals his team conceded in the 3-2 defeat by Borussia Dortmund -- one of which appeared to be offside -- said on Twitter that the club's quarterfinal exit was ""injustice and racism."" Coach Manuel Pellegrini added: ""The third goal was an offside goal and there were all kinds of elbows and punches."" But Infantino said: ""UEFA is not taking any action against any club from that point of view. I can understand that when you lose a match in the 93rd minute, emotions come up and you say things you don't really think."" UEFA will vote on its new racism proposals in London in May and if they are passed, the ruling could apply to all UEFA competitions from as early as July. Europe's governing body has also asked its member associations to apply this new anti-racist strategy to their own domestic competitions, with the plans going to a vote of the UEFA congress in May. Football's soul . Turning to the ""cancer"" of match-fixing, as Infantino put it, UEFA's general secretary characterized the problem as one that affected mainly ""lower division"" football despite concerns it is taking place in top matches. In February Rob Wainwright, director of European law enforcement agency Europol, revealed the crime fighting organization believed the highest levels of the game were no longer safe from match-fixing. A total of 380 games in Europe -- including World Cup and European Championship qualifiers -- were deemed suspicious by Europol, with 425 match and club officials and criminals involved from 15 different countries. ""We knew about these (Europol) cases before,"" said Infantino. ""We had already taken sanctions against these cases before, our associations had already taken sanctions and banned players and officials. ""We are monitoring 32,000 matches across 365 days a year every year."" ""Looking at the figures, we can see that some 0.7 % of matches, mainly in lower divisions, present some irregularities, not necessarily match-fixing. ""The result of matches is the soul of football, and we cannot allow anyone to attack the soul of football."" But Infantino acknowledged that UEFA could not tackle the problem match-fixing on its own and that a more co-ordinated approach was needed. ""We need the help of governments and law-enforcement agencies, because there is no way we can start looking into bank accounts or tapping phones. We need the authorities to help us. ""What is behind match-fixing is not to fix the match, why would you fix a match in the third division in Switzerland? ""It's because there is organized crime behind this, and organized crime is financing drugs and prostitution. ""That is why the authorities have to intervene and have to help us.""","UEFA wants 10-match bans for players and officials found guilty of racist behavior .
""It's still a scourge on the game,"" said UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong police on Thursday charged two ferry captains with manslaughter following a fatal ferry collision last year that left 39 people dead -- the city's worst maritime disaster in decades. The two men, who were not named but whose ages were given as 54 and 56, were arrested last year along with five other crew members in connection with the collision off Lamma Island near Hong Kong on the night of October 1, 2012. The collision involved a passenger ferry traveling from Hong Kong Island to Lamma Island and a vessel owned by the Hong Kong Electric Company, which was carrying company employees and their families to watch a scheduled fireworks display. Survivors described how the collision upended one of the vessels, flinging passengers into the water. Rescuers picked up 123 survivors but at least 92 passengers were injured in the incident. Passengers on board the ferries said how they had only moments to escape. ""First it was up to here and then here. The water rose so quickly,"" one woman, who declined to be named, told CNN affiliate i-Cable at the time. ""We thought we were going to die for sure."" According to the Hong Kong Fire Services Department, which led the rescue, the vessel began to sink quickly after the impact. It said low visibility and many obstacles on board made work difficult for rescuers. The narrow sea lanes leading into Hong Kong's main deepwater harbor are some of the busiest in Asia, with giant commercial freighters, ocean liners, passenger ferries and private boats of all sizes sharing the waters. Hong Kong is home to more than 200 outlying Islands, including Lamma. Hong Kong Island is on the south side of Victoria harbor, with Kowloon forming its northern shore. North of Kowloon lie the New Territories, which stretch all the way to mainland China. The collision was Hong Kong's most lethal maritime accident since 1971, when 88 people died after the ferry Fat Shan capsized between Hong Kong and Macau during a typhoon. The five crew members also arrested over the incident are due to answer bail in mid-April. READ MORE: World's 'most delightful commute' hit by ferry disaster .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Gabby Giffords remembers facing her assailant at his sentencing. ""Beady eyes,"" she said of Jared Loughner, who shot the former Arizona congresswoman in the head with a 9mm Glock pistol. Six people died and 13 were injured that day when the deranged gunman opened fire in front of a Tucson supermarket. At the sentencing last November, Giffords sat stoically -- staring Loughner down -- as her husband, Mark Kelly, spoke to the court. ""Well, yes, he had some interesting expressions on his face,"" said Kelly. ""And she did not look away."" ""Beady eyes,"" Giffords repeated. In an exclusive, wide-ranging interview with CNN, Giffords and Kelly understand they are now in the center of the heated debate over gun control and background checks, while still struggling to rebuild their lives after that day in January 2011, when their lives changed forever. Old self, new challenges . What is most shocking about Giffords now is how much she looks like her old self. Her golden locks are back; so is the sparkle in her eyes and her broad smile. Gone is the short hair and thin frame we saw at the beginning of her recovery. Yet she knows she will never be the same. ""Stronger. Stronger, better, tougher. Stronger, better, tougher."" That's how Giffords describes herself. Giffords makes that declaration with determination and gusto. But it still takes a considerable amount of energy and concentration to articulate that, or anything else. 'Yes, it's tough': For Giffords, a wounded life has a new purpose . Being with Giffords, it is obvious that she understands and absorbs everything around her. She follows conversation, reacts, engages and offers unsolicited ideas -- usually in the form of a single word or gesture that makes clear what she means. As a result of her gunshot wound, Giffords suffers from a condition called aphasia, and that it is ""very difficult for her,"" said Kelly. Aphasia is an impairment to language-related functions, such as speaking, writing, listening and reading. At times, even simple words are a struggle, like when she tries to explain how she spends her days. ""Occupational therapy, yogurt,"" said Giffords. Kelly, a former astronaut, patiently and quietly corrects her, saying ""yoga."" ""Yoga, yoga,"" Giffords repeats, offering a playful smile to signal she gets how funny it was that she said ""yogurt"" instead of ""yoga."" Gabby and Mark: The new 'Bradys' of gun control . The right-handed Giffords still has no use of that hand and that arm is paralyzed. She generally wears a sling to keep it from flopping around. Her right leg is also paralyzed. She wears a large brace and literally drags her right leg with her good, left leg to walk. Still, she walks remarkably well. But she doesn't see very well. ""Not great at all,"" is how she described her vision. Giffords has limited sight in both eyes with no peripheral vision to the right. In the same house as a family . For Kelly and Giffords, this is the new normal -- a life together that neither could have ever imagined when they first got together. She was a bright young political rising star and he was with NASA. Kelly said it is ""different in a lot of good ways."" The biggest difference? For the first time, they actually live in the same house, in the same city, in the same state. Before Giffords was shot, she jetted between her home in Tucson and work in Washington, while Kelly lived and worked in Texas, home of Johnson Space Center. They had a commuter marriage, which didn't allow them much time together. Now, they are together all the time, living in a ranch-style home they bought last summer. Another difference? Before Giffords was shot, she had a rocky relationship with Kelly's two teenage daughters from a previous marriage. ""Yes, changed,"" says Giffords. ""Yes, a lot better,"" echoes Kelly. ""They've, well, they've also grown up a little bit, too. And, you know, as a family, we've evolved because of ... you know, because of what happened,"" said Kelly. ""So it's brought us all closer together,"" said Kelly. And, as parents, for Giffords and Kelly, thoughts return to her shooter, Loughner. ""So sad. Mentally ill,"" Giffords added. Newly-released court documents reveal that Loughner's parents suspected something was wrong - that he heard voices and exhibited other alarming behavior. ""As a parent, you know you can empathize with somebody who went thru that ... where their kid did this horrific thing. At the same time, you know, there were indications of his mental illness. You know, the school knew about it. His parents knew about it. And he didn't have -- didn't seem to have a lot of options for good treatment,"" said Kelly. In the past two years, Giffords and Kelly have not heard from Loughner's parents. Would they want to? ""Um, not really,"" said Giffords. Giffords suffered yet another tragedy a few months ago. Her father Spencer -- with whom she had a special bond -- died suddenly. He taught her a lot about humor, strength and responsibility, handing her the keys to his tire business when she was just 26. Giffords' grit and determination also comes from her mother, Gloria -- a force of nature. She is an artist whose home is in the middle of the desert, miles from civilization. Off-roading with Gabby . You have to go off-road to get there. There are so many desert rocks that on the way home, Kelly got a flat tire in the pitch black night. Giffords, the daughter of a tire salesman and expert tire changer in her own right, got out of the car to help. Giffords bond with mother, who sat by her hospital bed for countless hours and still plays a central role in her long road to recovery, is tighter than ever. And there may be a sliver of hope for Giffords, now 42, to have a child of her own. When she was shot, she was trying to get pregnant with fertility treatments. They still have two frozen embryos. But given Giffords injuries, they'd likely have to use a surrogate. ""I don't know,"" said Giffords, looking over at Kelly for his response. ""We -- you know, we talk about it. We talk about it. We haven't made a decision,"" said Kelly. Asked whether she is ever resentful about what happened to her, Giffords replied: . ""No. No."" ""Move ahead. Move ahead,"" she said. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","Gabby Giffords, shot in the head two years ago, recalls facing her shooter, Jared Loughner .

"London (CNN) -- All former U.S. presidents, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and a raft of global dignitaries are invited to the funeral next Wednesday of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Downing Street said Thursday. The guest list also includes representatives of the Reagan family, Nelson Mandela's family and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, alongside sitting British Prime Minister David Cameron. Any members of Thatcher's Cabinet who are still alive and members of the current UK Cabinet, as well as opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband, will also be asked to attend, Cameron's office said. Among those expected to come are F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid-era president of South Africa, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and one of his predecessors, Brian Mulroney. Buckingham Palace has already confirmed that Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, will be present. With full military honors, the funeral will rival those given to Diana, Princess of Wales and the Queen Mother. More than 2,000 invitations -- color-coded to indicate where the guests are to sit -- are being sent out, Cameron's office said. They are due to be mailed Friday. Details of the very formal dress code will be sent out with the invitations. St. Paul's Cathedral holds 2,300 people and is expected to be full on the day, Cameron's office said. Some friends of Thatcher have already said they will be absent. Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is not planning to attend for health reasons, Vladimir Polyakov at the Gorbachev Foundation in Moscow told CNN. Nancy Reagan, the widow of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, Thatcher's great political friend and ally, is also unable to attend, a spokeswoman said. ""Mrs. Reagan is heartbroken over Baroness Thatcher's death and would really like to be there in person to pay her respects. Unfortunately, she is no longer able to make that kind of a trip so will not be attending the funeral,"" she said. Nancy Reagan has asked Fred Ryan, chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and a longtime personal friend, to represent her at the service. Downing Street confirmed that the Argentine ambassador to London had been invited, as have other envoys, in line with protocol. No other Argentine representatives have been invited, however, meaning President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner will not be there. Fernandez has stepped up her rhetoric in recent months over the disputed Falkland Islands, known to Argentines as Las Malvinas. Thatcher waged a short, sharp war with Argentina over the Falklands in 1982 after Argentine forces invaded. The islands, which raise their own taxes but rely on the United Kingdom for defense and foreign policy, have been under British rule since 1833. Thatcher, who led the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 and was prime minister for 11 years, died of a stroke Monday at age 87. A towering figure in postwar British and global politics, she is remembered in the world for her Cold War-era friendships with Reagan and Gorbachev, as well as her role in shaping Britain's place in Europe and her leadership during the Falklands War. She was on the wrong side of history when it came to South Africa, however, having opposed economic sanctions against the apartheid regime and described Mandela's Africa National Congress as a terrorist organization. Mandela and de Klerk jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for their efforts to end apartheid. Security concerns . Back at home, Thatcher was a highly polarizing figure in British politics. Police are stepping up security ahead of the funeral, amid concerns that protesters angered by Thatcher's actions in office may take to the streets. Many Britons blame her for creating soaring unemployment, when she reduced or eliminated many government subsidies to businesses and took on unions. Her battle with striking coal miners won her few friends in mining communities in northern England and Wales. But supporters believe the tough reforms she pushed through transformed the British economy and gave many working people new freedoms. London's Metropolitan Police, the City of London Police, who cover the city's financial district, and the British Transport Police are working together ""to ensure that events that day pass off safely,"" a statement said. Police officers will be deployed along the route, with other mobile groups ready to be deployed to any outbreaks of trouble, the Met Police said. The force has urged anyone planning protests to let police know ahead of time. ""There has been much speculation about what levels of protest may take place. I would ask anyone who wishes to demonstrate then, or in the coming days, to come and talk to us,"" Commander Christine Jones said. ""The right to protest is one that must be upheld. However, we will work to do that whilst balancing the rights of those who wish to pay their respects and those who wish to travel about London as usual."" Police will implement a range of security measures in line with the current threat level, Jones said. London's Evening Standard newspaper reported Wednesday that anarchists are planning to stage a mass ""party"" Saturday in Trafalgar Square to celebrate Thatcher's death. Ian Bone, founder of the Class War group, is quoted by the newspaper as saying thousands of anti-Thatcher protesters will gather from across the country for the event. They'll include miners and steel workers scarred by her battle with the unions, he said. Trafalgar Square, in the heart of London, was the scene of violent rioting in 1990 against a hugely unpopular tax brought in by Thatcher. The so-called poll tax was levied on community residents rather than property. A post on what appears to be Bone's blog also calls on people to attend the ""Class War Party"" in Trafalgar Square. ""Best night out since the poll tax riot,"" it promises. READ MORE: Thatcher's legacy in focus as UK plans funeral . READ MORE: UK lawmakers pay tribute to former PM Margaret Thatcher .

"(CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is ordering that more than 1,000 Boeing 737 jets be inspected for a problem which could cause pilots to lose control of the aircraft. According to the FAA, the inspections will focus on pins which attach the horizontal stabilizers to the fuselage. They were prompted by reports that a coating used to protect the pins from wear and corrosion was applied incorrectly. The FAA says premature failure of the pins could cause reduced structural integrity of the horizontal stabilizer to fuselage attachment, resulting in loss of control of the airplane. The part number of each pin must be checked and pins with certain part numbers must be replaced with new, improved attach pins. The order, called an Airworthiness Directive, is effective May 20 and applies to Boeing 737 series 600, 700, 700-C, 800, 900 and 900-ER aircraft. The inspections are not expected to affect airline schedules. The aircraft included in the directive are relatively new, entering service in 1998 or later.","FAA says a problem with attach pins could cause pilots to lose control of aircraft .

"(CNN) -- ""No ma'am ... I will not register my weapons."" These passionate words from a former Marine sparked an insatiable conversation on CNN.com. Since Joshua Boston posted an open letter to U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, dismissing stricter gun control, on CNN iReport, his commentary has received more than 1 million views, almost 30,000 comments and even a response from Feinstein's office. But one response stood out from the rest -- a reaction from another former Marine addressed directly to Boston. Nicolas DiOrio called Boston's letter an ""embarrassment to those who've served."" The two views on gun control were as different as the photos adorning the letters, Boston wielding a firearm and DiOrio pointing a video camera. Prompted by the firestorm of discussion the two have sparked, we interviewed both men with the same set of questions to further explain their opposing views on gun control. Read their responses and judge their arguments for yourself: . 1. What do you think our founding fathers meant by the right ""to keep and bear arms"" mentioned in the Second Amendment? Boston: They had just fought a war against a government that had overstepped its boundaries. You can only come to the conclusion that they put it there for us to have the same ability to do that in the future should the need arise. They use the terms people, militia and arms specifically. They differentiate between the United States, the states and the people elsewhere. I think they use the term arms because they mean any weapons that we might have to bear in such a situation. DiOrio: I think that because we had a much smaller military at the time, it was more of an allowance that people could have weapons or muskets to raise a militia to defend the country from outside invasion. But in today's world, we have a much larger military and the weapons that are available are much more dangerous than the weapons of that time. I would think that the founding fathers would not make as broad of an allowance of individual possession of firearms if they knew what the state of firearms was today. 2. What if a new bill about banning assault weapons passes, say Sen. Dianne Feinstein's bill? What would it mean for America? Boston: It's going to open a door that we, or our descendants, are going to deplore. It's saying it's OK to take away guns away based on the actions of a few. The next time somebody goes up the tower at the University of Texas Austin shooting people with a deer rifle, it will show our willingness to give away hunting rifles. And after the next Virginia Tech, handguns are going to be taken away. These shootings have happened before; they just don't have the same emotional weight as this shooting had. DiOrio: I don't think it would really harm gun owners as they think it would. They would still have access to all sorts of hunting weapons and rifles. The bill only seeks to ban assault weapons. Unless we had a bill like the one passed in Australia in 1996, a retroactive ban, we would still have all these weapons out there. Unless such a ban is instituted, it will probably not be as effective as we hope. Nevertheless, I do support any step taken in limiting assault weapons. 3. What's the biggest misconception that you think people have about your stance on guns? Boston: There's a few of them. They think I'm paranoid. I'm not. I just learned early on that you have to expect the worst while hoping for the best. Expecting that the best is going to happen when hard times show up you won't be prepared and you will fail. People assume because I own guns that I'm not educated or that I don't know how to think for myself. I own guns because I'm educated to the dangers and the reality of the world that we live in. I accept the reality that we live in and I don't accept that the police will always be there for me. I own guns because I'm very much attached to reality. DiOrio: I think, based on what I've read, people just have the perception that I think that gun owners are evil or don't care about gun violence. I realize that's not true, but I just think that people are very eager to talk about their rights but not always so eager to talk about collective responsibility and safety. Also, I want to set straight that I don't think Josh Boston is a disgrace at all. I just think that his letter could have been more sensitive to the issues. I respect him and his service; I wasn't trying to personally attack him. 4. What should the U.S. do to keep guns out of the wrong hands (like criminals)? Boston: Criminals are going to do what they want to do. We have to accept that. We can make all the laws that we want, but it's not going to stop [people] from breaking them. We have laws to prevent that from happening. Just as keeping drugs out of peoples' hands doesn't solve the drug war, gun control is not going to keep guns out of peoples' hands. The majority of crime is committed with illegally acquired weapons in the first place. What we can do is remove the restriction levels for law-abiding citizens who want to defend themselves. This idea of a gun-free zone has never stopped a shooting. People never walk up to a school and say, 'This is a gun-free zone, so I'm going to go shoot somewhere else.' It's never happened. DiOrio: We need to enforce background checks, not just at commercial retailers but also at gun shows. We need to limit the sale of dangerous weapons to people who have no record of criminal history. We need to perhaps consider enacting some kind of mental screening or wellness testing before people are allowed to purchase weapons as well. It might offend people because it would infringe upon their rights, but we need to consider if that would outweigh the benefits brought to society by not allowing weapons to go into the hands of the mentally ill. 5. Why were there so many mass shootings in 2012 (Aurora, Colorado, Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and Newtown, Connecticut)? What do you think is to blame? Boston: Humanity. We as a species have faults and we still have wars with each other. I can still hear atrocities happening around the globe. ... It's not because of a simple object that propels a projectile. It's because of us. We refuse to look at the root of the issue because it scares us. We give into fear and play to our emotions and we move to outlaw something that is not a cause, but just a means. I'm not a psychiatrist. I couldn't tell you why there are so many. There's a deeper problem here. These kinds of things, and not just mass shootings, happen all over the globe; it's not a problem specific to America. DiOrio: Based upon just what I've read on the shootings, it appears that at least a couple of them are mentally disturbed in some way and they had access to these weapons. When the Assault Weapons Ban expired, people were allowed to purchase them again. When the mentally ill have access to them, it's inevitable that these tragedies are going to happen. It's very sad to me that not even Aurora took us to these discussions. It took the murder of 20 children before we were again willing to look at our gun laws and wonder whether or not we should make changes. Who do you think had the better answers, Boston or DiOrio?

"(CNN) -- The mother of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will meet with Ecuadorian authorities Monday to urge them to grant her son asylum. Christine Assange, who arrived in the capital city Quito on Saturday, told reporters she will appeal to Ecuador's stance on human rights during her meeting. ""Surely, the president and his staff will make the best decision,"" Christine Assange said, according to a report in the state-run El Ciudadano website. Her son has been holed up inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since applying for political asylum on June 19. He is seeking to avoid being sent to Sweden over claims of rape and sexual molestation and said he fears if he is extradited there, Swedish authorities could hand him over to the United States. If her son is sent to the United States, he ""could expect a sentence of death or many years in prison with torture as they are doing now with Bradley Manning,"" Christine Assange said, according to the El Ciudadano report. ""If they did that to a U.S. citizen, they would have fewer qualms about doing it to a foreigner."" Manning is a U.S. Army intelligence analyst suspected of leaking hundreds of thousands of classified military and State Department documents while serving in Iraq. Many of those documents ended up on the WikiLeaks website. He is being held on charges of aiding the enemy, wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or records, among others. He could go to prison for life if convicted. Ecuador has said it is weighing Julian Assange's asylum request and will make the decision on its own, in its own time. 'Syria File' unlikely to affect Assange embassy standoff . ""Ecuador will make its own, independent decision,"" President Rafael Correa said in an interview to a local television station earlier this month. ""The case is under review."" Correa noted that capital punishment exists in the United States for a ""political crime,"" and that fact could be sufficient grounds to grant Julian Assange asylum. Correa also stressed he is not afraid of international repercussions that might stem from whatever decision Ecuador makes. ""We have to see whether everything that's being done in the case of Julian Assange is compatible with ... the constitution and our view of human rights, political rights and due process,"" the president said. Julian Assange was arrested in Britain in 2010 because Swedish authorities wanted to question him about the sexual molestation and rape allegations, which he denies. His bail conditions included staying every night at the home of a supporter outside London. UK police say he violated his bail by staying at the embassy. After he entered it, they served him with notice to turn himself in -- an order he ignored, marking a further violation. Diplomatic protocol prevents police from entering the embassy to arrest him. Christine Assange said Saturday her son was being treated well at the embassy. ""I am grateful for the facilities Ecuador offered to my son in London,"" she said. Two women have accused Julian Assange of sexually assaulting them in August 2010, when he was visiting Sweden in connection with a WikiLeaks release of internal U.S. military documents. He was arrested in Britain that December and has been fighting extradition since, saying the allegations are retribution for his organization's disclosure of American secrets. Susan Benn of the Julian Assange defense fund has said the United States had empaneled a grand jury in its goal to press charges against the WikiLeaks founder. Turning himself in to British authorities would start a process that would end with Julian Assange being extradited to the United States, Benn said. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has published about 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables, causing embarrassment to the government and others. It also has published hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Julian Assange sought refuge at the embassy five days after the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom dismissed a bid to reopen his appeal of the decision to send him to Sweden, his last option in British courts. British officials have met with Ecuadorian authorities, but no information has been released about those meetings. See yourself as another Assange? Good luck .","""Surely the president and his staff will make the best decision,"" she says .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran confirmed Tuesday the arrest of three American hikers who crossed into the country from neighboring Iraq and said they have been charged with ""illegal entry,"" a semi-official news agency reported. Sarah Shourd, like the other two hikers, is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley. The three were arrested in the western Iranian city of Marivan, Iraj Hassanzadeh, deputy governor of Kurdistan province, told the Fars News Agency. Earlier, Swiss diplomats in Iran and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had urged Iran to provide information on the hikers. ""Obviously, we are concerned,"" Clinton said. ""We want this matter brought to a resolution as soon as possible, and we call on the Iranian government to help us determine the whereabouts of the three missing Americans and return them as quickly as possible."" The three American friends -- seasoned travelers who are former students at the University of California, Berkeley -- had been hiking along with a fourth companion through parts of Iraq's Kurdistan region last week. On Friday, the three apparently crossed the unmarked border with Iran and were detained. The fourth companion had stayed behind at a hotel in Sulaimaniya, Iraq. Peshrow Ahmed, spokesman for the security manager of Sulaimaniya, said the three had been in contact with their companion until about 1:30 p.m. Friday when they reported they were ""surrounded by Iranian soldiers."" No further communication was received.  Watch the sequence of events leading to the trio's detention Â» . The Web site of Iran's Arabic-language Al-alam TV, however, reported that an Iranian security source said the three Americans infiltrated into Iran's Kurdistan province after being warned that they were close to the border. A fourth person from the group went back to Iraq, said the channel, which is linked to the country's Revolutionary Guards. Officials at the Swiss Embassy -- which represents the U.S. interests in Iran because Washington and Tehran do not have formal relations -- said they had spoken to Iranian officials. The Swiss ambassador was expected to seek consular access to them, U.S. State Department officials said. Kurdish officials identified the detained hikers Sunday as Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Joshua Fattal. The fourth hiker, Shon Meckfessel, stayed behind in Sulaimaniya, officials said. The University of California, Berkeley, confirmed Monday that Bauer, 27, Shourd, 30, and Fattal, 27, were former students there, and that Meckfessel took a summer course in Arabic at the university in 2007. Meckfessel is a graduate student at the University of Washington. ""My husband and I are eager for the best welfare and conditions for our son, Josh, and for the other two companions he's with,"" Laura Fattal of Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, told CNN Radio. ""And that is our only concern, his welfare and the best conditions for him."" Fattal graduated from Berkeley in 2004 with a bachelor's degree in environmental economics and policy, the university said. He shared his friends' love of travel and learning, and was described as ""fiercely intellectual"" by his friend, Chris Foraker, who spoke to CNN affiliate KVAL-TV in Eugene, Oregon. Bauer, a 2007 honors graduate in peace and conflict studies, is a journalist fluent in Arabic working in North Africa and the Middle East, according to the Berkeley statement. He recently produced stories on Iraq and Syria for the San Francisco, California-based New American Media, and won a top prize at the university in 2007 for his photos of the devastation in Sudan's Darfur region, the school said. Sandy Close, executive director of the nonprofit Pacific News Service, described Bauer -- a photographer whose material occasionally has been posted on her Web site -- as a ""gifted linguist and photographer with a wanderlust for travel and a student of Arab cultures. He's a remarkably talented guy."" In a profile listed on a travel Web site, Shourd, a 2003 graduate with an English degree, described herself as a ""teacher-activist-writer from California currently based in the Middle East."" The Berkeley statement called her an ""aspiring journalist"" who reported a story this year on the Golan Heights. Meckfessel was identified by his grandmother, who told CNN that he stayed behind because he felt sick. Meckfessel has met with an American consular official, said the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ""My grandson has asked me not to talk to the media,"" said Irene Meckfessel of Carmichael, California, before hanging up. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro, Arwa Damon, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Susan Candiotti and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","One of three U.S. hikers is freelance journalist .

"(CNN) -- A BBC journalist who got into North Korea by using a group of students from a top British university as camouflage is facing accusations that he recklessly endangered their safety and damaged the school's reputation. BBC reporter John Sweeney posed as a student from the London School of Economics and Political Science, or LSE, on a visit to the secretive nation last month, during which he filmed footage for the broadcaster's prime-time current affairs show ""Panorama."" He traveled with his wife and a cameraman. Officials and student representatives from the LSE say Sweeney didn't fully explain the situation to the students he was traveling with in advance, saying only that ""a journalist"" would join the trip. In doing so, they say, he put the students at risk and jeopardized future visits by the school's academics to North Korea and other politically sensitive countries. ""The students were not given enough information to enable informed consent, yet were given enough to put them in serious danger if the subterfuge had been uncovered prior to their departure from North Korea,"" the LSE said in a statement. The authoritarian North Korean regime tightly controls who enters its territory, with journalists from the international news media, including CNN, often refused entry. Authorities significantly restrict the movements of those who are allowed in. And the penalties for those who break the rules can be severe. In 2009, two American journalists reporting from the border between North Korea and China were arrested and received heavy prison sentences. They were released later that year after former President Bill Clinton flew to North Korea and met with top officials there. The LSE students and the BBC journalists all returned safely from their trip last month, but some of the students then complained about what Sweeney had done, said Alex Peters-Day, the secretary-general of the LSE's students union. ""I think it's absolutely disgraceful that he put students in that position,"" she said Sunday in an interview with the BBC. ""It's incredibly reckless."" According to Peters-Day, the students ""were lied to, they weren't able to give their consent."" But Sweeney and the BBC say the students on the trip were aware of the risks involved. ""All of them were told twice that a journalist was coming,"" he said in a separate interview with the BBC. ""I was that journalist, I used my own name."" A BBC spokesman said in a statement cited by the broadcaster that ""the students were all explicitly warned about the potential risks of travelling to North Korea with the journalist as part of their group. This included a warning about the risk of arrest and detention and that they might not be allowed to return to North Korea in the future."" Sweeney did, however, admit that he falsely claimed to be a PhD student at the LSE in his application to enter North Korea. ""We go in and we tell a lie to the North Koreans, and I believe that's journalistically fine and proper,"" he said, acknowledging that the North Korean government is now ""very angry"" about what happened. The LSE said that the BBC journalists had used a university society to set up the controversial trip. ""This was not an official LSE trip,"" Craig Calhoun, the director of the LSE, said on his Twitter account. ""Non-students & BBC organized it, used the society to recruit some students, & passed it off."" The Grimshaw Club, the student society of the school's international relations department, said a former LSE student had told it about the trip, and as a result it had advertised it on its mailing list and Facebook page as an opportunity ""that may be of interest to our members."" ""There was no institutional involvement on our part whatsoever and the trip participants were aware of that,"" the club said. As a result of the situation, the LSE said it had asked the BBC to withdraw the ""Panorama"" TV program, scheduled to be broadcast Monday, and to make a full apology -- a request the BBC has so far refused. ""LSE is fully supportive of the principle of investigative journalism in the public interest, and applauds the work of journalists in dangerous parts of the world,"" the university said. ""We cannot, however, condone the use of our name, or the use of our students, as cover for such activities."" In his interview with the BBC, Sweeney said the majority of the students who were on the trip supported the ""Panorama"" program that he and his team had produced. But Calhoun said the program ""seems to have found no new information and only shown what North Korea wants tourists to see."" He also said that ""producers of 'Panorama' seem not to have learned any lessons from recent BBC scandals,"" an apparent reference to the BBC's handling of abuses police say were carried out on the corporation's premises by the late TV presenter and radio host Jimmy Savile. That scandal has cost several top BBC officials their jobs, including former Director-General George Entwistle.","A BBC reporter posed as a student to get into North Korea .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China's president has vowed to continue the economic reforms that have transformed the once poverty-riddled nation into an industrial powerhouse. Deng Xiaoping envisioned a modern, prosperous China. Speaking on the 30th anniversary of China's decision to open itself up to the outside world, President Hu Jintao told a crowd of 6,000 at Beijing's Great Hall of the People: ""Standing still and regressing will lead only to a dead end."" Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was the architect of the economic reform movement, which was to set the country on a radical new course when the first policies were approved on December 18, 1978. ""Reform and opening up are the fundamental causes of all the achievements and progress we have made,"" Hu said, according to state-run media. He said Deng's vision three decades ago was ""completely correct."" Over the past 30 years, China has maintained an average annual growth rate of 9.8 percent -- triple the world average, China's Xinhua news agency reported.  Watch as China marks 30 years of reform Â» . The Chinese gross domestic product soared from 360 billion yuan ($53 billion) in 1978 to 24.95 trillion yuan ($3.7 trillion) in 2007, making China the world's fourth-largest economy, according to Xinhua. However, Hu warned the Chinese people not to grow complacent, especially in the midst of the global economic crisis. He said China must continue to concentrate on economic development and diversification. ""We must adhere to the correct direction of reform and opening up so as to build a system that is full of vigor, highly efficient, more open and has a favorable environment for scientific development,"" he said.","Deng Xiaoping was the architect of the economic reform movement in 1978 .

"Paris (CNN) -- In politics, a week may feel like an eternity. Exactly a week ago, French President Francois Hollande suffered a momentous blow, the first real shock of his presidency. His recently dismissed Budget Minister, Jerome Cahuzac, a former hair implant surgeon-turned-socialist, confessed on his blog that he had been lying for the last four months and that he had, in fact, a hidden Swiss bank account which the French inland revenue services never knew about. In other words, the man in charge of tackling tax evasion was admitting to being a fraudster. Not only this, but he had lied outright in parliament, in front of the nation's representatives. To utter lies in Parliament may not constitute a crime (unlike in the USA, there is no such thing as perjury in France), however, the French were shocked to discover that a minister had had the nerve to deny the truth in the Republic's most symbolic and sacred of places. A few hours later, Hollande pre-recorded a message to his fellow countrymen. He would take immediate measures, he said, to restore the country's confidence in its political class and, no, he knew nothing of his Budget minister's wrongdoings. From left to right, everyone in France was reeling from the news. Polls suggested that 65% of the French wanted Parliament to be dissolved and new elections to take place, others that 60% of the French people wanted, at the very least, a cabinet reshuffle or change of government. While Hollande had to leave for an official two-day visit to Morocco, his Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that anyone found guilty of tax-dodging would be banned from holding public office. The opposition immediately accused Pierre Moscovici, the economy minister to whom Cahuzac reported, of acting too slowly, and too late. Mediapart, the news website which broke the story over Cahuzac's Swiss account last November, asserted that Moscovici had effectively tried to shield his colleague. The atmosphere became toxic; rumours started circulating about other potential tax fraudsters serving in government. Daily newspaper Liberation was this week heavily criticised for making allegations without giving any evidence. Today, its editor apologised and recognized his mistake. In another televised message -- the second within a week -- Hollande gave his ministers until Monday April 15 to reveal their personal assets; parliament is to consider a bill making such disclosures compulsory for the entire political class. Until now, France and Slovenia were the only two countries to have opted out from this measure of financial transparency, already implemented at a European level. President Hollande also announced that he was creating a new agency to fight financial fraud, and appointing a special prosecutor to deal with financial crime. He said banks would now be forced to detail all their activities in tax havens, with the publication of all their international affiliates and subsidiaries, country by country. A few discordant voices from Nicolas Sarkozy's right-wing UMP party complained that revealing private assets amounted to ""voyeurism"" and ""hypocrisy"". Resorting to irony, Jean-Marie le Pen of the far-right Front National declared on national radio: ""My Swiss bank account was always known to the French tax revenue and I wear pants made in France"". However, the mood of the public in France is very much in favor of a moralization of public life and Hollande's measures have been received with guarded optimism. It is indeed not the first time a French president has promised to crush immorality in politics. ""L'Affaire Cahuzac"" has struck French consciences as deeply as Dominique Strauss-Kahn's sex scandal in 2011. Tax evasion, a national sport in France till the 1980s and a massive crackdown by then Prime Minister Raymond Barre, was thought, in the main, to be a thing of the past. But suddenly it has made a come-back at the most sensitive of times. France has 3 million unemployed people and faces deep economic problems, including a loss of competitiveness. Could Hollande's government fall over this sleaze scandal? It could if more tax evasion revelations affecting members of the government were to come out but it probably won't if it acts swiftly and Cahuzac remains the only black sheep on the horizon. The question now is, will Hollande take advantage of ""L'affaire"" to form a new government with a new prime minister? Significantly, centrist FranÃÂ§ois Bayrou, whose last-minute decision to back FranÃÂ§ois Hollande was a crucial factor in Hollande's presidential election victory, and who has campaigned for years to clean up French political life, made a public statement and declared himself ready to serve. Having reached a new low in the popularity polls, with only 27% of the French supporting him, President Hollande may be tempted to look for a new Prime Minister with a strong image of integrity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Agnes Poirier.","France's ex-budget minister reveals hidden Swiss bank account, sparking outrage .

"(CNN) -- Former champion Angel Cabrera and America's Brandt Snedeker are tied for the lead after the third round of the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club. The 2009 champion from Argentina and Snedeker, who tied for third at Augusta in 2008, both shot three-under par rounds of 69 to finish on seven under par, one shot ahead of Australia's Adam Scott, who also shot 69 on Saturday. After a steady 16 holes, overnight leader Jason Day finished with two bogeys to slip back into a tie for fourth alongside another Australian Marc Leishman (72) with America's Matt Kuchar one shot further back after posting a 69 earlier in the day. Despite not having a spectacular day on the course, Tiger Woods still managed to grab the majority of the headlines. The world No.1 finished on three-under par, four shots off the lead, but began his day not knowing whether he'd be competing at all over the weekend following a rule violation at the par five 15th during Friday's second round. Speculation mounted on Saturday morning that Woods might be disqualified for taking a drop in the wrong place after his ball had ricocheted off the flagstick on 15th green and back into the water hazard at the front. But having sought an explanation from Woods, the Augusta National rules committee, who described him as ""very forthright"" and ""honest,"" concluded that the four-time Masters champion should incur a two-stroke penalty. Woods ended up shooting a round of 70 and wasn't firing on all cylinders but is now well placed to mount a challenge in Sunday's final round. ""I hit it all right today. I missed a few putts here and there. I had a few opportunities to shoot a lower score but the finish was huge - the last three saves certainly kept me in the ball game,"" Woods said. Woods is tied for seventh place with South Africa's Tim Clark whose five-under par round of 67 was the best of the day. America's Jim Furyk, Ricky Fowler and Steve Stricker are currently tied for ninth at two-under par alongside England's Lee Westwood and two-time champion, Germany's Bernhard Langer. China's teenage star Guan Tianlang battled his way to five-over par 77 to leave the 14-year-old amateur nine-over par for the tournament. Guan's third round was two strokes better than Rory McIlroy, who played his way out of contention with a disastrous round of 79. The Northern Irishman's round fell apart at the 11th where his approach found the water. He walked off having carded a triple-bogey seven. His ball also found water at the 15th which contributed two more dropped shots before bogeying the 16th to leave McIlroy five over for the tournament. Defending champion Bubba Watson posted a two-under par round of 70 -- his best round of the week -- to leave him in a tie for 28th on two-over par.","Angel Cabrera and Brandt Snedeker are joint leaders of the Masters after three rounds .

"(CNN) -- Q: Sgt. Robert Bales has been accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians. He served three tours in Iraq before this and his lawyer says he may have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or a traumatic brain injury. What's the link between violence and those disorders? A: Psychiatrists understand some types of aberrant behavior pretty well and can do things to help resolve it. But, unfortunately, in other instances -- and often the most interesting ones -- we can only mumble generalities that require no special expertise and that offer no hope for a diagnosis or treatment. Take the case of U.S. Army Sgt. Robert Bales, accused of massacring 16 Afghan men, women and children while they slept unprotected in their village. The first thing a psychiatrist would want to know is whether the person who committed such a heinous act was psychotic at that time, meaning out of touch with agreed-upon human reality. Did he perform the killings as a result of deeply held false beliefs or in response to hearing voices commanding him to act? If yes, then although the tragedy remains, the psychiatric mystery is solved. But at this point, although Bales has reportedly told his lawyer he remembers nothing about the night of the massacre, there is no evidence he was psychotic immediately before the killing spree. Nor do we have any evidence at this point that the killings were motivated by some larger political purpose, which might also explain, but certainly not justify, them. So why would someone who had appeared normal to everyone around him suddenly commit such a hideous act? Army reviewing PTSD evaluation program . Much has been made in the media about the fact that Bales was on his fourth deployment. Moreover, he had suffered mild traumatic brain injury in Iraq. Traumatic brain injury can cause a wide range of mental difficulties, from poor decision making and memory to increases in impulsive behavior, irritability, depression and personality change. So how likely is it that Bales' traumatic brain injury explains the accusation that he massacred 16 Afghan villagers? The answer is: not very likely. Why? Consider, as alternative possible explanation, mania. Mania is often characterized by the sudden onset of bizarre, agitated behavior in public and it is not necessarily related to traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury almost never causes otherwise solid citizens to ruthlessly massacre men, women and children. Thousands upon thousands of people develop severe manic episodes every year. Thousands upon thousands of service men and women have been multiply deployed and have suffered various levels of traumatic brain injury, and yet there is only one Bales. That is why it doesn't fit very well. Mass murder is just about as rare in people with brain damage as in people without brain damage. Note that I said ""just about."" In fact, organic brain damage can be a cause of mass violence. Probably the most classic example of this in American history was the case of Charles Whitman, who went on a shooting spree from atop the University of Texas tower that resulted in the death of 16 people. Although he was under multiple stressors at the time of the incident, he was found to have a brain tumor in the ""rage area"" of his brain (i.e. the amygdala) upon autopsy. In the case of Bales, if he is guilty of the massacre, his actions may eventually be found to be related to a clearly causative organic factor. But my clinical experience tells me not to bet on this. It happens, but pretty rarely. When people behave in unexpected ways for no good reason, it often turns out that when the full story of their lives is understood, the behavior no longer appears as unexpected. That which is neither clearly linked to either a medical or psychiatric illness is very likely intertwined in a person's longstanding personality. So, I suspect that if 100 psychiatrists were told that a previously normal service person massacred 16 civilians and was neither medically impaired nor psychotic, the majority of them would immediately suspect that the person in question might not have been as normal across his life as initial reports suggested. In fact, as more comes out about Bales this appears to be the case. It now appears that he was involved in fraudulent business dealings. What makes the case so strange, however, are the multiple contrasting reports of his remarkably caring and selfless behavior on numerous occasions and his status as something of a small town hero. I seem to end many of my CNNhealth pieces with some type of comment about how unsatisfying our current level of psychiatric understanding is. This pieces, alas, is no different in this regard. Frankly, at this point nothing in Bales' actions makes psychiatric sense. On the other hand, how many highly admired, hard-working, patriotic, caring small-town heroes are embroiled in financial fraud or may have other dark behaviors in their backgrounds? Maybe the fact that Bales himself may not make sense is the best place for us to start in our understanding of the horrible events in Afghanistan.","A lawyer for Sgt. Robert Bales says the soldier may have been suffering from TBI, PTSD .

"Augusta, Georgia (CNN) -- Golfers worldwide generally know Augusta, Georgia, for one thing: the Masters, and the Augusta National course on which the fabled tournament is played each April. The course is arguably the most famous in the world -- and certainly the most exclusive. There are no public tours. It's heavily walled off from public view. In fact, you could drive past the course without knowing it. Only the main gate has a small sign that simply reads ""Augusta National Golf Club: Members Only"" (the last two words in large, bold print). Widely considered the toughest ticket in sports, this year's Masters tournament -- and the practice rounds -- are sold out. And the lucky souls who are able to get their hands on a Masters badge are often willing to shell out thousands of dollars for the privilege. So, what's the average golf lover to do? There's little chance of getting into this year's event (unless you're willing to pay a premium). But golf or history lovers can still make a pilgrimage to Augusta -- about a two-hour drive east of Atlanta -- to check out all the other things the city has to offer and be as close as possible to one of the greatest golf tournaments, and courses, in the world. Here are the highlights: . Fine art . Augusta is the second-largest city in Georgia, so it shouldn't come as a shock that they have an impressive art museum. The Morris Museum of Art offers a rare and large (5,000 pieces) collection of work from pre-Civil War itinerant portraitists, Southern impressionists and the works of current and self-taught artists, all of whom depict the American South. It is the first, though not the only, major museum in the country to devote its collection to Southern regional art. One example is Lamar Dodd's ""From This Earth,"" a modern painting of slaves working in cotton fields. The ground is tinged with red as skeletal figures hunch over their work, a strong wind blowing their white, drapelike clothes. Like many of the museum's pieces, it strikes a chord. The museum also hosts special exhibits and events. During the Masters, golf fans can view the ""Fore! Images of Golf in Art"" exhibition, on display until April 15. The show includes a LeRoy Neiman portrait of four-time Masters champ Tiger Woods and even a painting of Bill Murray's character from ""Caddyshack."" Famous Augustans . James Brown, the ""Godfather of Soul,"" was raised in Augusta. Today you can visit the former radio station where, as a little boy, Brown delighted crowds with his dance moves. Take a photo of his statue in downtown Augusta near James Brown Boulevard or catch a concert at the James Brown Arena (formerly the Augusta-Richmond County Civic Center and renamed in 2006 to honor Brown). And be sure to see one of the most comprehensive James Brown exhibits in the world at the Augusta Museum of History. It features the icon's outfits, family photographs, gold and platinum records, and tributes to his music, including an emotionally moving video of the Godfather performing ""It's a Man's World"" in Italy with opera star Luciano Pavarotti not long before their deaths. President Woodrow Wilson also called Augusta home. He moved to the town as a little boy when his father became the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, across the street from the family's house. As an adult, Wilson returned to his boyhood home to reminisce about his fondly remembered childhood. Today the home has been meticulously restored to how it looked when the 28th president of the United States etched his name in the window pane (which you can still see). Tours of the home (now a National Historic Landmark that has been designated an official ""Save America's Treasures"" site) are offered Tuesday through Saturday. Other famous people who hail from Augusta include actress Thelma ""Butterfly"" McQueen, who played Prissy in ""Gone With the Wind,"" actor Laurence Fishburne, soprano Jessye Norman and Frank Yerby, the famous poet and author. Golf . Even though you can't tee off on the Augusta National, Augusta has nearly a dozen public courses within 10 minutes of downtown -- some with ties to golf legends. For example, Forest Hills Golf Club is an 18-hole golf course where the likes of Bobby Jones and Phil Mickelson competed (not against each other, of course) in tournaments. You can book tee times online. The city is also home to the Augusta State University golf teams -- last year the men's team successfully defended their 2010 NCAA Division I National Title. The Riverwalk . Augusta lies along the Savannah River, which separates Georgia from South Carolina, and the city has made it a priority to highlight that asset. Their Riverwalk, which began construction in 1986 to help revitalize the downtown area, is now an impressive stretch of red-brick walkways ideal for strolling, jogging or attending one of the many events hosted at the Jessye Norman Amphitheater. It's flanked by hundreds of trees and landscaped with flowers that set off the blue waters of the river. History . Beyond the James Brown display, there are two golf-themed exhibits at the Augusta Museum of History. One of them has an official Masters' green jacket on display, given to the museum's director by Augusta National. There's no word on who wore it; all that's known is it's a 39 long. Other exhibits e include the evolution of golf equipment, the biographies of golf greats who changed the sport, and the courses that made Augusta a golf destination. The rest of the museum is worth a look, too. Dining . Augusta, like many Southern cities, has plenty of food options. The oldest restaurant in town is Luigi's, an authentic Italian joint great for a family outing. Golf fans will appreciate their collection of Master's badges. Interested in gourmet tacos? Get 'em at Rooster's Beak. And you'll want to splurge on Frog Hollow, the new gastropub in town that serves up some seriously good eats. With its farm-to-table feel, you can expect to find fresh and inventive food. Who knows -- you may even see a pro golfer sitting at a table somewhere in town. Just don't expect to see the Augusta National Golf Course without a badge. If your appetite for the famous course has merely been whetted, try scoring practice round or daily tickets for next year to see the exclusive club firsthand. Apply for a chance at access starting May 1. Once inside you can enjoy $1.50 pimento cheese sandwiches and $2 beers. Seriously.","Augusta National Golf Course is off limits without membership or a pricey badge .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. military's ""don't ask-don't tell"" policy could be overturned in the first year of President-elect Barack Obama's administration, according to the lead sponsor of a bill that would repeal the law. A bill that would repeal the U.S. military's ""don't ask-don't tell"" policy has 149 co-sponsors in the House. Obama has pledged to lift the ban on gays serving openly in the U.S. military. A spokesman for Obama's transition office would not comment for this story, but two months ago, Obama suggested he would move cautiously, telling the Philadelphia Gay News he would first get the military on board. ""Although I have consistently said I would repeal 'don't ask-don't tell,' I believe that the way to do it is to make sure that we are working through processes, getting the Joint Chiefs of Staff clear in terms of what our priorities are going to be,"" Obama told the newspaper. Instituted in 1993, the policy ended the military's practice of asking potential service members if they are gay, but requires the dismissal of openly gay service members. A bill to replace the law with a policy that would allow gays to openly serve has 149 co-sponsors in the U.S. House, including Ellen Tauscher, D-California. Tauscher said that with a new administration, the timing is right to try to pass the bill. ""The key here is to get bills that pass the House and the Senate, that we can get to President-elect Obama to sign, and I think that we can do that, certainly, the first year of the administration,"" Tauscher told CNN. Gay rights advocates say it's important for Obama to avoid the approach used by the Clinton administration. President Clinton initially promised to repeal the military's then-complete ban on gays with an executive order. But the plan roiled Pentagon brass -- including then-Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell -- and provoked a fierce backlash from conservatives in Congress. Congress stripped Clinton of his power to change the policy and forced him to accept the ""don't ask-don't tell"" compromise -- a law that can be repealed only by Congress. But after 15 years and four wars, attitudes in the Pentagon -- and among the public -- have changed. A Washington Post/ABC News poll this summer found 75 percent of Americans support allowing gays to serve openly, compared to only 45 percent in 1993. Retired Adm. Charles Larson, the former head of the Naval Academy, heads a list of more than 100 retired U.S. military leaders who have signed a statement calling for an end the policy, according to the Palm Center at the University of California-Santa Barbara. The think tank has studied issues involving gays in the military for the past decade. CNN's Laurie Ure contributed to this report.","Bill would allow gays to openly serve in the U.S. military .

"(CNN) -- Augusta National Golf Club opened its exclusive membership to women Monday for the first time in its 80-year history. Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina businesswoman Darla Moore will become the first women to join the Augusta, Georgia, club, Chairman Billy Payne said Monday in a statement. ""These accomplished women share our passion for the game of golf and both are well known and respected by our membership,"" Payne said. The issue of its formerly all-male membership has long dogged the private club and has at times threatened to overshadow the Masters Tournament, among golf's most prestigious events. Celebration, surprise, humor after Augusta National admits first women . Women's rights activist Martha Burk put the issue in the spotlight in 2003, when she led a protest against the club and worked to put pressure on corporate leaders to withdraw their support for the organization and the Masters. On Monday, she declared victory. ""My first reaction was, we won -- and we did,"" Burk said. ""By we, I mean the women's movement and women in the United States, particularly those in business."" She said continued pressure from women's groups and corporate interests forced the club's hand. Activists over the last decade ""facilitated a couple of sex discrimination suits against corporations whose CEOs are (Augusta National) members,"" Burk said, but she did not name any corporations or individuals. Burk also pointed to the April controversy over the club's failure to admit IBM CEO Virginia Rometty, as it has past IBM leaders. Sponsoring the Masters usually guarantees membership to a company's officers. But Rometty had been ineligible because she is female. ""We gave them a pretty big black eye in April when they dissed Ginny Rometty and did not allow her in the club as they had all of the males preceding her as CEOs of IBM. And I think they knew they could not sustain it,"" she said. At the time, White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama believed women should be admitted to the club. Payne declined to comment on the issue then, and is not talking about it now outside of the statement issued by the club, according to club spokesman Steven Ethun. In that statement, Payne said the decision marked a ""significant and positive time"" for Augusta National. PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem lauded the decision. ""At a time when women represent one of the fastest growing segments in both playing and following the game of golf, this sends a positive and inclusive message for our sport,"" Finchem said in a statement. He was far from alone in applauding Augusta National's decision. Mitt Romney -- the Republican party's presumptive presidential nominee who, in April, had said that he'd admit women if he were in charge of the club -- offered congratulations on Twitter to both his friend Rice and Augusta National. And Nancy Lieberman, a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee who played parts of two seasons in a men's professional league, likewise cheered the move. ""Congrts breaking thru #equality,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Slowly but surely lots of crumbs ad up to a cake,"" wrote another women's sports pioneer, Billie Jean King. Obama ""welcomes the development"" as well, Carney said Monday. ""He thinks it was too long in coming, but obviously believes it was the right thing to do,"" the White House spokesman told reporters. The choice of Rice and Moore will ensure that women admitted to Augusta will be equals to their male counterparts, Burk said. ""They have chosen two groundbreaking women, two very prominent women, who are clearly equal in stature to the other members who are, of course, all male,"" Burk said. ""I think it would have been a mistake to choose a lower-profile woman and basically make that statement that, yes, we're letting women in but they're not really going to be equal with the men."" Rice served under President George W. Bush as the first female national security adviser and the first African-American woman to hold the post of secretary of state. She also was on President George H.W. Bush's National Security Council staff and was a special assistant to the director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1986. Membership is the latest honor for trailblazer Rice . She grew up in humble beginnings in segregated Birmingham, Alabama, and rose to prominence in academia and international diplomacy. She has been on the faculty of Stanford University since 1981, has authored two best-selling books and is a member of various boards and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and has been awarded 10 honorary doctorates. Rice, who is also an accomplished pianist, said in a statement released through Augusta that she is ""delighted and honored"" to join the club. ""I have long admired the important role Augusta National has played in the traditions and history of golf,"" she said. Moore is the vice president of Rainwater Inc., the investment firm founded by her husband, Richard Rainwater. Fortune magazine once named her among the top 50 women in business, and the University of South Carolina's business school is named in her honor. Augusta National admits one of 'toughest' women in business . She is also chairwoman of the Palmetto Institute, a nonprofit that says it is dedicated to producing ""dramatic and sustained growth in the creation, distribution and retention of wealth for every person in South Carolina."" Moore said she is ""extremely grateful for this privilege."" ""I am fortunate to have many friends who are members at Augusta National, so to be asked to join them as a member represents a very happy and important occasion in my life,"" she said. Burk's protests against the club's policies made Augusta the focus of national attention beginning in 2002, when she wrote letters challenging the male-only membership policy at the club. The club's chairman at the time, Hootie Johnson, responded that admitting women as members would not be done ""at the point of a bayonet."" The next year, Burk organized protests to coincide with the Masters, which drew widespread attention. The uproar led Augusta National to decide not to have advertising for the CBS broadcast of the Masters in 2003 and 2004. In 2006, Burk was among a group of Exxon shareholders who accused the company of violating its discrimination policies by supporting the golf tournament. On Monday, the syndicated newspaper columnist and co-founder of Center for Advancement of Public Policy women's equity advocacy group said she hopes Augusta National's decision ""cracks open that glass ceiling just a little bit further"" for American businesswomen. At the same time, Burk called the development ""just one small step."" ""(Corporations) need to be working toward parity in the halls of power; Augusta National is just one,"" she said. ""It's an important one symbolically, but we have a long way to go.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales will be charged with 17 counts of murder and six counts of assault and attempted murder related to a March 11 shooting spree in Afghanistan, a senior U.S. official said Thursday. The charges are expected to be announced Friday. The official could not explain why the count is now 17, when 16 have been reported killed in the incident. Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne, told CNN that he did not respond to leaks and that he would not comment before seeing the charges against his client. Even then, he said, ""There's probably not much to say."" Still, Browne predicted the case -- whenever it comes to trial -- is going to be ""extremely difficult"" for the prosecution. ""They have no murder scene, no forensics,"" the lawyer said Thursday night from outside his Seattle office. ""I'm going to make them prove every claim."" Military law experts acknowledge proving the case may be hard, especially given that there are no autopsies to help prove the cause of death -- in large part because those killed were buried quickly, in accordance with Islamic tradition -- and witnesses may not willingly fly from Afghanistan to the United States to testify. U.S. officials have alleged that Bales carried out the killings alone in two neighboring villages in the Panjwai district of Kandahar province, in southern Afghanistan. Bales was flown out of Afghanistan last week and is being held at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. 2 kids die in Kandahar suicide bombing . Afghans are insisting that the suspect be returned to Afghanistan to face trial, with villagers and lawmakers questioning the U.S. military's account of what happened. But a military official said in Afghanistan on Sunday that Bales will be tried in the United States. The rampage has strained already tense U.S.-Afghan relations and intensified a debate about whether to pull American troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has demanded that troops withdraw from villages in his nation and return to their bases, saying relations between the two countries were ""at the end of their rope."" On Wednesday, Afghanistan's foreign minister called for a ""swift and transparent investigation"" into the killings of 16 men, women and children. But CNN legal contributor and defense attorney Paul Callan told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that the case against the lone suspect in their deaths, Bales, may be largely circumstantial. ""There were admissions allegedly made by Sgt. Bales to some of his fellow soldiers, in which he claimed at least that he wasn't shooting women and children, (and rather) was shooting men of military age,"" Callan said. ""Now, that would be an admission by him that would link him to the crime scene. If they then link his gun to the specific victims, then they easily make a connection and they can prove their case."" Callan said he believed prosecutors would seek the death penalty against Bales,""because this is one of the biggest alleged massacres in memory."" ""You have the diplomatic and political problems that are being caused by this crime,"" Callan said. ""Afghan citizens will be looking, saying, 'Is the U.S. seeking justice in this case?' "" But he said that even if prosecutors won a death sentence, it would be unlikely that Bales would face execution for years, perhaps decades. The accused soldier spoke Wednesday night with his wife, their second such conversation since the attack, Browne said. The couple have two young children together. Accounts from the military, Bales' family, friends and neighbors paint a portrait of a man who remained committed to serving his country despite wounds he received during three previous combat tours to Iraq -- including a traumatic brain injury suffered during a vehicle accident there. But Michael Breen, a former Army captain, told CNN that the speculation about whether his injuries or a possible, undiagnosed case of post-traumatic stress disorder contributed to Bales' actions was unfair to other veterans. ""Sgt. Bales has been through a lot as a soldier. Many of us have,"" Breen said. ""That is certainly no explanation or excuse for the gross violation of his code of honor, to say the least, and the horrific crimes that he committed."" CNN's Miguel Marquez and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","NEW: The lack of autopsies and possible lack of witnesses may hinder the prosecution .

"(CNN) -- The attorney representing the U.S. soldier suspected in the Afghanistan massacre of 16 villagers, including nine children, is a flamboyant, pugnacious trial lawyer who doesn't shy from the hardest of hard-core cases. As commanding in physical stature as he is in the courtroom, the 6 1/2-foot-tall John Henry Browne has defended serial killer Ted Bundy, who confessed to more than 30 murders before he was executed in Florida in 1989. The Seattle attorney also defended Benjamin Ng, convicted for his 1983 role in 13 murders in the Wah Mee massacre, described then as Washington state's worst mass killing. On a less grisly scale, Browne recently represented the so-called ""Barefoot Bandit"" -- Colton Harris-Moore -- the iPod-loving and occasionally barefoot 20-year-old man who gained a cult status among the Facebook generation for a string of audacious thefts and burglaries. He has pleaded guilty to federal and state charges. Now, Browne returns to his element, drawing international cameras as an attorney defending a suspect in one of mankind's most heinous offenses -- an alleged war atrocity. The suspect is Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, a military source and a senior defense official told CNN. Browne said his client, whom he wouldn't name, was expected to arrive in the United States Friday evening, in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Even without any formal military charges being filed in the Afghanistan mass killings, Browne is demonstrating his prowess as a confident provocateur -- his trademark mien -- by publicly formulating before news cameras possible defenses for the soldier. His office receptionist said Friday that Browne is now receiving media requests from ""all over the world."" Browne's willingness to openly advance defense strategies, however, has already drawn criticism from legal experts, especially those in military justice. Browne has suggested that the soldier, who had earlier suffered a concussion in Iraq, could have been suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome, and Browne wondered why the military deployed the soldier to Afghanistan. In criticizing the military for repeated war deployments of weary soldiers, he even singled out one military base in Washington state for ""not treating those illnesses,"" referring to PTSD. ""There's been a big problem with soldiers who have been previously deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan, with concussive head injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder,"" Browne said. ""We do know he had a concussive head injury. We know he was injured in his leg severely, and I am somewhat confused to why they would send him back to Afghanistan,"" he said. In another CNN interview, Browne momentarily suggested that he may put the war itself on trial -- if his client is ever charged in military court. Browne has tried more than 250 cases since graduating from American University School of Law in 1971. ""You know, I'm old enough to remember the My Lai massacre in Vietnam and how that hastened the end of that war. Maybe a tragic incident such as this will get people to rethink the war in general,"" Browne said. Then he added: ""I certainly don't want to put the war on trial, but I think that people should start thinking more about why we're there and how long we're going to stay there."" When pressed in a CNN interview about putting the war on trial, Browne stated: ""We'll see."" Thomas Kenniff, an attorney who represented soldiers in military court in Iraq in 2005, took exception with Browne's comments. ""With all due respect, I think it's ill advised,"" Kenniff told CNN. ""You don't want to say anything at this point where you'll over-commit"" to a defense. ""Maybe alcohol is going to play a big part in this case as part of establishing a defense, as part of establishing a contributing factor to (post-traumatic stress) or the command environment in theater that condoned these sort of excesses that may have contributed to this tragic offense,"" he said. Browne said he was asked by the soldier's family to represent him. He said he had reservations about taking on the case, given security concerns. In describing his client, Browne painted a picture of a decorated career soldier who joined the military after the 2001 terrorist attacks and had spent his Army life at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington. Browne called him a devoted husband and father to his two young children who never made any derogatory remarks about Muslims or Afghans. Browne said he was offended by media reports that marital discord played a role in the events that unfolded in Kandahar province villages near the small combat outpost where the soldier was stationed. He said those reports were ""nonsense."" He said he did not know whether alcohol may have been involved, which investigators are looking into, but imagined that stress was a factor. ""For God's sake, who is not going to be under stress in Afghanistan in a small camp where there is 20 people in the middle of nowhere?"" Browne asked. He also said that, the day before the slayings, another soldier on that base had his leg shot off in front of the suspect. ""That affected the whole base,"" Browne said. Charges against his client could come within weeks in what Browne called more of a political case than a legal one. ""This is an international event, and it's a very touchy event for our government and for other governments,"" he said. ""It's not just a normal criminal case that we deal with, and we understand that. We understand our government's concern about it, and we certainly understand the concern of Afghanistan and its people. This (is) a pretty huge case from the standpoint of ramifications."" The soldier is accused of leaving the remote outpost of Camp Belambay on foot early Sunday and heading to neighboring villages in the Panjwai district of Kandahar province. In the villages, a U.S. soldier opened fire, killing nine children, three women and four men, witnesses and Afghan authorities said. The U.S. military has not confirmed the number of casualties. The soldier's family has been moved to Lewis-McChord because of safety concerns, Browne said. Browne also confirmed reports that the soldier could face the death penalty. ""There is a discussion of the death penalty, understandably, I think, in this situation, which makes us very nervous,"" he said. ""It's certainly not off the table at this point. Our hope is that maybe it will be. ""We don't know anything about (his) state of mind. We don't know anything about the facts of the case, and whether they can prove what he's accused of,"" Browne said. In a 1998 profile of Browne, the Seattle Times described the high-profile attorney as ""a blend of charm and arrogance, spirituality and bravado"" and ""a gifted storyteller who can be glib and funny or somber and dramatic"" who has a ""combative style and robust ego."" A Washington state Supreme Court justice once remarked that Browne needed to be spanked, the newspaper reported. Browne's home at the time featured Far Eastern motifs, built in Japanese style with Buddhist prayer stones. He meditated and read the poetry of Mevlana Jalaluddin Rumi, a 13th-century spiritual writer. ""People take their freedom for granted,"" Browne told the newspaper in 1998. ""They don't teach civics anymore. They don't realize how delicate the system is. It is a simple equation: The more power you give to government, the less power you give to individuals.""

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Just days after the U.S. military formally handed authority of Baghdad's ""Green Zone"" over to the Iraqis, the new American Embassy opened in Baghdad. The American flag is raised at Monday's dedication ceremony for the new U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Situated on the banks of the Tigris river, one mile south of Saddam Hussein's Republican Palace -- U.S. headquarters in Baghdad since 2003 -- the new embassy opened early Monday afternoon in a closely controlled ceremony that included Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker, and Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte. ""The return of the Republican Palace to the government of Iraq last Thursday and the raising of the flag over a new embassy four days later are potent symbols of this record of achievement,"" Negroponte said during his opening ceremony speech Monday. The new U.S. Embassy covers 104 acres and is the largest in the world, housing 1,200 U.S. diplomats, soldiers, and government staff from 14 federal agencies, according to a U.S. State Department news release. ""As our military presence ramps down, many other aspects of our relationship are going to ramp up,"" Crocker told CNN on Monday. The original price tag on the 27-building complex was $592 million, but a congressional report from 2007 -- citing State Department documents -- indicated the cost could end up $144 million higher. Meanwhile, two Iraqis were killed and at least 31 injured in a series of bombings across Baghdad on Monday, an Interior Ministry official told CNN. There were at least five separate attacks in the Iraqi capital, with one, the roadside bombing of an Iraqi police patrol, resulting in the death of two people. Three police officers and three civilians were also wounded in the attack, which took place near Shaab stadium in eastern Baghdad at about 1:15 p.m. local time. In other incidents, 12 people were wounded in two improvised explosive device blasts in the Karrada district of central Baghdad; five people were injured when a bomb in a parked car exploded in the Abu Dcheer neighborhood of southern Baghdad; four people were injured when an IED exploded in Nidhal Street, central Baghdad; and four people were injured when an IED exploded on Palestine Street, eastern Baghdad.

"(CNN) -- He is accused of killing innocent civilians, including women and children, in their homes in two Afghan villages. The accusations are met with bewilderment from a number of those who know U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, who bears the scars from wounds he received in three previous tours in Iraq. His friends and family say he remained passionately committed to serving his country and cared deeply for others. ""Regardless of what happened, Bobby has been changed forever,"" said Bob Durham, who knew Bales when he was growing up in Ohio. ""If the Bobby that I knew ever gets well, comes back to it, and realizes what has happened, and realizes that children and women were killed, I don't think he can live with it. He'll never be the same. He's such a great person ... that crushes me."" Retired general: Incident could speed disengagement . And in a statement released Monday afternoon, Bales' wife, Karilyn, said what has been reported so far ""is completely out of character of the man I know and admire."" ""Please respect me when I say I cannot shed any light on what happened that night, so please do not ask,"" she said. ""I, too, want to know what happened. I want to know how this could be."" Karilyn Bales extended the family's condolences to the people of the Afghan villages where the killings took place, ""especially to the parents, brothers, sisters and grandparents of the children who perished."" ""I know that all good people around the world, regardless of nationality, religion or political values, join me in grieving that such a terrible thing could happen,"" she said. ""The victims and their families are all in my prayers, as is my husband who I love very much."" Bales, who is in his late 30s, is accused of leaving a remote U.S. combat post on foot before dawn on March 11 and gunning down Afghans in their homes. In all, 16 villagers were killed, nine of them children. Bales has not been formally charged, though the military has made a determination of probable cause. He met Monday with his defense attorney, John Henry Browne of Seattle, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where the Army staff sergeant was taken on Friday. Villagers describe horror of slaughter . The deaths have outraged Afghans and strained already tense relations between the two nations. They also shocked those who know and love Bales, including his wife and two children. ""Sgt. Bales' family is stunned in the face of this tragedy, but they stand behind the man they know as a devoted husband, father and dedicated member of the armed services,"" attorney Emma Scanlan said Saturday in a statement. Bales grew up and attended school in Norwood, a Cincinnati suburb of about 19,000 residents. As a teenager, Durham recalled, Bales helped care for Durham's severely disabled son. Bales, a popular football player, never hesitated to take the younger boy along wherever he was headed, Durham said. ""I love the guy,"" he said. ""He's a part of my family. I've known him since the day he was born."" After Bales was graduated from Norwood High School in 1991, he played football while attending the College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati, according to two family friends. Records indicate he lived at multiple addresses in the Columbus area in the ensuing years. Bales began working as a broker, passing his general securities representative exam in 1996 and the uniform securities agent state law exam the following year. But a customer dispute in 2000 resulted in a big loss. According to a BrokerCheck report from the Financial industry Regulatory Authority, he was accused of making unauthorized trades; failure to provide competent and professional services; breach of contractual and legal duties; unsuitability; misrepresentations and omission of material fact and breach of fiduciary duty. Arbitration found in 2003 that he had engaged in fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, unauthorized trading, unsuitable investments and churning. The latter occurs when a broker engages in frequent buying and selling in a customer's account primarily to generate commissions. He was ordered to pay claimant $637,000 as compensatory damages plus interest and $637,000 as punitive damages. Bales was not solely responsible for repaying the money. A company and another individual were held jointly responsible. Bales joined the Army two months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and in September 2002 was assigned to Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, the military has said. Also in 2002, public records show he had a brush with the law, facing a criminal assault charge in a Tacoma court. He pleaded not guilty. Bales completed anger management treatment and the case was dismissed the following year, court records show. The victim was not named in the records, and no details about the case were immediately available. Tacoma Police Officer Naveed Benjamin said the incident took place at a Tacoma casino. He first deployed to Iraq in 2003, then again in 2006, serving 15 consecutive months as part of then-President George W. Bush's ""surge"" of 20,000 additional troops. During that second tour, Browne has said, Bales was wounded and underwent the amputation of part of his foot. An Army account recalled a 2007 incident in Iraq, when an operation to recover a helicopter shot down near Najaf turned into more of a humanitarian mission to help wounded civilians. According to the account, Bales -- then serving as a team leader -- said he was ""proud"" and that his unit ""discriminated between the bad guys and the noncombatants and then afterward we ended up helping the people that three or four hours before were trying to kill us."" ""I think that's the real difference between being an American as opposed to being a bad guy, someone who puts his family in harm's way like that,"" said Bales in the account, published online in February 2009. He deployed to Iraq a third time between 2009 and 2010, according to the military. He suffered a traumatic brain injury when his vehicle flipped after striking a roadside bomb, his attorney said. The Army summary lists multiple decorations for Bales, including three Army ""good conduct"" medals. Bales' family was ""not happy"" about his fourth deployment, this time to Afghanistan, his attorney has said. ""He was told that he was not going to be redeployed,"" Brown said. Taliban demand trial in Afghanistan . They were also disappointed that he was not promoted to sergeant first class, according to blog posts written by his wife a year ago and published Friday by the Tacoma News-Tribune. ""It is very disappointing after all of the work Bob has done and all the sacrifices he has made for his love of his country, family and friends,"" Karilyn Bales wrote. ""I am sad and disappointed too, but I am also relieved, we can finally move on to the next phase of our lives."" The family was preparing to move last year, hoping to be stationed in Germany, Italy, Hawaii, Kentucky -- which, Karilyn Bales noted, would be ""near Bob's family"" -- or Georgia, ""to be a sniper teacher,"" she wrote of her husband, according to the newspaper. However, records show the family was under financial pressure and was forced to put their Lake Tapps, Washington, home on the market last week for $229,000 -- less than the $280,000 they purchased it for in 2006. Moving vans were outside the home on Monday. The Baleses were ""happy"" and ""normal,"" according to neighbor Cassie Holland. ""We would go over there for birthday parties and they would come to my kids' birthday parties,"" she said. ""I would describe (Bales) as super fun to hang around with, kind of the life of the party kind of guy. Super loving, great with his kids. I don't see how this has happened."" Before buying the home, the family owned a townhouse in a modest, middle-class neighborhood in Auburn, Washington, about 30 minutes from the military base. Tim Burgess, whose townhouse shared a wall with the Baleses, said Bales was ""a really good guy (who) just wanted to serve."" ""I know he just wanted to go back and serve overseas, that was his goal,"" he said, adding the two had not spoken in about five years. After the family moved out, there were occasional renters in the townhouse, said Robert Baggett, president of the Riverpark Homeowners Association. Several years ago, the townhouse went into foreclosure. The family also did not pay their homeowners' association fees for ""at least three or four years,"" he said. ""We don't know what happened,"" Baggett said of the Baleses and their Auburn property, which Sunday had a notice posted on its door that read ""Do Not Occupy.""

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Is it time to start carrying two mobile phones? With the launch of a new no-frills handset, at least one manufacturer is hoping more people might soon be relying on multiple mobiles. Unveiling its cheapest ever mobile phone, a $20 handset with a 35-hour battery, Nokia said the device's extraordinary staying power could make it popular as a backup for when our main handsets run out of juice or prove too bulky to carry around. As he touted the Nokia 105 at this week's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, an annual showcase for the newest hand-held gadgets, the company's chief executive Stephen Elop suggested that the time has come for some of us to be using two phones. While some might balk at the idea of filling their pockets with yet more technology, the enduring popularity of some existing low-priced models suggests Elop could be right. Modern mobiles might be capable of all sorts of trickery, but thanks to power-hungry screens and processors, many are incapable of staying switched on for long, despite the aid of various apps designed to wring out every last drop of battery power. Not so Nokia's 105. Although this barebones device offers none of the internet connectivity of most modern phones, it will be able to sit on standby for more than a month between charges. The handset, which also features a dust and splash-proof keypad and an FM radio, has been primarily launched as a low-end phone that would appeal to customers in the developing world who may have infrequent access to electricity. Nokia hopes that by focusing on budget as well as top end users it can reclaim ground from rivals such as Apple, Samsung and ZTE who have in recent years undermined the Finnish multinational's previously dominant position. Elop, Nokia's chief executive, told CNN his company hoped other budget models such as the Lumia 520, which includes top-end features such as internet and email access and a camera but a lower-end price of about $180, would help it corner this market. Nokia isn't alone in targeting this sector. Earlier this month Microsoft announced a partnership with Chinese manufacturer Huawei to create a sub-$150 smartphone specifically aimed at developing markets in Africa. But elsewhere in the world, Elop said his cheapest device would appeal as either a failsafe that users can turn to when their smarter handsets are struck dumb by power outage or as a novelty stand-in for costlier, bigger devices. ""For some people it is their first mobile phone in an emerging economy for example,"" he said. ""For others it might be the device they toss into the glove box of the car as a backup device or maybe something retro chic that they might carry with them to a party and slip into a clutch instead of their larger smartphone."" Of course, Nokia's 105 isn't the only no-frills handset on the market. Many manufacturers continue to produce phones that retail so cheaply that some are treated as disposable. Over the past three years, Alcatel's OT-209, for instance, has sold in steady numbers to users lured by pre-paid package deals that cost just a few dollars a month. But none of these boast the 35-day battery life that would make them suitable for an always-on emergency standby. Elop is no stranger to multiple mobiles, admitting to CNN that up to 15 devices usually accompany him on his travels, although these are usually consigned to his luggage. ""Normally in my pockets I have four or five,"" he said, adding that his array of handsets usually included rival models that he carried around to keep tabs on Nokia's opposition. But he declined to reveal the contents of his pockets to CNN on the grounds that at least one of the devices could be a Nokia prototype that needed to stay under wraps.","Nokia chief exec suggests its customers will use $20 mobile as a backup .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- As the U.S. military pursues charges against the Army sergeant accused of killing Afghan civilians in what commanders say was a freelance rampage, a new question has arisen: Who was victim No. 17? Staff Sgt. Robert Bales has been charged with 17 counts of murder ""with premeditation"" in the March 11 slayings in the Panjwai district of Afghanistan's Kandahar Province. But Afghan authorities have said there were 16 people killed in the Panjwai killings. Sunday, two Afghan provincial council members said the United States has paid the victims' families a total of $860,000 -- $10,000 for each of the six wounded survivors, and $50,000 apiece for the 16 dead. Afghan government officials in Kabul have said they have no record of another death. A U.S. official confirmed that a payment had been made on Saturday -- but the official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation, said he could not comment on the figure involved. The discrepancy has persisted since Friday, when the charge sheet on Bales listed four women among 17 victims, while initial U.S. and Afghan reports listed three women among 16 dead. A NATO spokesman, Col. Gary Kolb, said Friday only that investigators assigned to the case felt they had evidence to charge Bales with 17 counts of murder. Authorities say Bales left his remote outpost before dawn on March 11 and went house-to-house, gunning down villagers in two villages near the U.S. base. They have said that he acted alone, leaving the outpost in the dead of night and turning himself in to his comrades when he returned. The American official who handed over the money to the families said the payments were not compensation, but the U.S. government offering to help the victims and their families, Kandahar provincial council member Haji Nyamat Khan said. But Kolb said the money was compensation for the families. It was not immediately clear if the word used to describe the payment had legal significance in Afghanistan, where ""blood money"" can replace a trial or punishment of a killer. Afghans are insisting that Bales be returned to Afghanistan to face trial, with villagers and lawmakers questioning the U.S. military's account of what happened. But a military official in Afghanistan has said that Bales will be tried in the United States. Khan, the local official, said the money was paid in Afghan currency and handed over in Kandahar city. He did not name the American official involved in the meeting. While the identity of the 17th victim remained unknown Sunday, a U.S. official did disclose a new detail of the case Sunday. The official, who would not speak on the record because the investigation is ongoing, told CNN that investigators now believe Bales committed the shootings during two separate trips out of the American compound. ""We believe the shooter went to one village, came back and went to a second village,"" the official said, based on factors including interviews and the overall investigation. Bales could face the death penalty if convicted of any of the murder counts against him. He is being held at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, after being flown out of Afghanistan a few days after the killings. It is not clear whether he will now face a military procedure known as an Article 32 hearing, at which military authorities would determine whether to proceed with charges against him, or whether he will go before a group of experts to determine whether his mental health may be a factor in his defense. If and when the case comes to trial, Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne, said, it is going to be ""extremely difficult"" for the prosecution. ""They have no murder scene, no forensics,"" the lawyer said Thursday night outside his Seattle office. ""I'm going to make them prove every claim."" Military law experts acknowledge that proving the case may be difficult, especially given that there are no autopsies to help prove the cause of death -- in part because those killed were buried quickly, in accordance with Islamic tradition -- and difficulty in getting witnesses to testify. But Gary Solis, a former U.S. Marine Corps lawyer and current Georgetown professor, told CNN that any bullet rounds recovered from the scene could be matched with Bales' weapon -- assuming it was ""immediately seized"" -- which would serve as ""powerful evidence for the government."" The dead have been identified as Mohammad Dawood Abdullah, Khudaidad Mohmmad Jama, Nazar Mohammad Taj Mohammad, Payendo, Robina, Sahtarina Sultan Mohammad, Zuhra Abdul Hameed, Nazia Doost Mohammad, Mosooma Mohammad Wazir, Farida Mohammad Wazir, Palwasha Mohammad Wazir, Nabia Mohammad Wazir, Asmatullah Mohammad Wazir, Faizullah Mohammad Wazir, Esa Mohammad Mohammad Husain, and Akhtar Mohammad Murad Ali.

"(CNN) -- It's been one year since Fort Bragg soldier Kelli Bordeaux went missing, and there's now a reward being offered for information that could help authorities solve the mystery, according to police in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The military is offering $25,000 for information that could help explain what happened to Pfc. Bordeaux, Detective Jeff Locklear told CNN on Monday. Last April, police and the military searched an area near a Fayetteville bar where Bordeaux was last seen and last used her cell phone, authorities then told CNN. Read last year's story about Bordeaux . The 23-year-old soldier left the Froggy Bottoms bar early on a Saturday, police told CNN then. She had been drinking and was given a ride home by a bar employee, according to a U.S. Army official who spoke on condition of anonymity at the time of that story. At some point, the Army official said, Bordeaux sent two text messages. One said, ""got home safely."" The official did not know who the text was sent to or the contents of the second text message. Last April, Fayetteville Police Chief Tom Bergamine said that Bordeaux was described as a ""very good soldier, not the type of person that would come up AWOL or missing."" The Army official told CNN that police searched Bordeaux's apartment and vehicle, but the official did not know where the vehicle was found. Bordeaux was reported missing on April 16 of last year when she failed to report for duty, the official said. Bordeaux's older sister, Olivia Cox, told reporters last April that it was out of character for her to miss work. Bordeaux's mother, Johnna Henson, said she had been told by police that an individual gave her daughter a ride to the bar, where Bordeaux sang karaoke.","A Fayetteville, North Carolina, police detective says military is offering a $25,000 reward .

"Lamma Island, Hong Kong (CNN) -- When my neighbor Jane Wilbor got on a Lamma ferry Tuesday, she did something she'd never done before with her three young children: She put on life preservers. ""I wanted to show them how to get one out and put one on,"" said Wilbor, whose three children -- Louie, 10, James, 9, and 7-year-old Eddie -- are playmates with my son 4-year-old son, Jonah, in Pak Kok, a small village of a few dozen families on Lamma Island, one of hundreds of islands that make up Hong Kong. Our village was awoken by the sound of helicopters Monday night, as searchlights trained on the sea until the sunlight broke the next morning on a capsized boat just a few hundred meters offshore. The ferry collision that left at least 38 dead -- including five children --is not an abstraction for those who live on Lamma, but a tragedy that puts the spotlight on an elemental part of our lives and the economic livelihood of Hong Kong: The busy waterways and the boats that connect the city. The fortunes of Hong Kong were built on its deep-water ports, and its seas are still among the hardest working waters in the world. The city had the third highest container ship traffic in the world in 2008, according to the American Association of Port Authorities. About 135,600 passengers take local ferry services daily across Victoria Harbor from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon and outlying islands such as Lantau, Cheung Chau, Peng Chau and Lamma, government records say. It's common for the ferries to stop and pivot around cargo-carrying behemoths that churn through the East Lamma Channel, buffeting the ferry with big waves before we continue on our way. As a daily commuter it's now a wonder to me that tragedies like Monday's collision don't happen more often given the volume of traffic. Hong Kong seas are like ""Grand Central Terminal at rush hour ... it's an extremely complicated harbor,"" retired marine accident investigator Don Sheetz told CNN. Lamma life . ""The ferry from Hong Kong to Lamma must be one of the most delightful commuter runs in the world,"" a 2000 New York Times piece on tourist spots in Hong Kong reads. The roughly 5,000 residents of Lamma -- about one third of them expatriates, according to the government -- are drawn to the largely rural island for the peaceful counterpoint it offers to working among the skyscrapers in this bustling city of 7 million. There are no cars and no residences higher than three stories on the island. We prefer birdsong at dawn rather than jackhammers, and charting our life according to the ferry schedule is the price we pay (that, and the occasional exotic pest, such as the Chinese cobra that found its way into my home two years ago). But life on Lamma Island is defined by the ferries. About two-thirds of the island departs each day on ferries to attend school and work, according to government statistics. The ferries create a strange familiarity, people I think of as ""ferry phantoms"" -- strangers whose faces you know only from sharing the Lamma ferries -- and yet when your paths cross in the city, your instinct is to wave hello. The ferries are a great equalizer: I once shared a ferry ride with Lamma Island's most famous son, Chow Yun Fat, the star of movie blockbuster ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" who grew up on the island and frequently comes back for charity events. No matter your wealth, job or status, the ferry is your only ride here. So the degrees of separation from the tragedy are few to Lamma residents. The ships involved are known to us. There isn't a resident of Yung Shue Wan, the largest town on this island, who hasn't ridden the Sea Smooth, the catamaran vessel operated by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Ferry Holdings. The Lamma IV, the ship that sank, was a common sight among the vessels that take workers daily to the Hong Kong Electric power plant on the island. Inside a few hours, a parent from my son's preschool had posted a second-hand account on Facebook describing ""a sudden crash"" and water flushing through a ""big hole"" in the boat. ""There was panic,"" the message said. My friend and bandmate Chris Head was on the Sea Smooth when it hit, throwing him to the floor. The boat listed as it took on water and when he looked out, he said the prow of the Lamma IV moved up into the air ""like the Titanic."" More: Survivors recount chaos, horror of ferry collision . Questions remain . The questions we have are the same as many, asking how it happened and grumblings about whether the ferry companies are doing enough to protect our safety. When my neighbor, Jane, gave her children a life jacket demonstration, she was admonished by the ferry staff, she said. The crews of both boats have since been arrested and Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung has promised a thorough investigation. But for the families on Lamma, the unease continues. My 4-year-old son is asking about the ferry crash, and on Tuesday implored me not to get onto the boat to go to work. This morning, as the families of Pak Kok gathered at the ferry pier at 6:50 a.m. local time for the commute to work and school, eyes kept moving to the spot offshore where yesterday the wreck of the Lamma IV stood dramatically out of the water. Today it's gone. But for us, the memory of the 38 souls who lost their lives will be forever etched on that patch of sea -- a reminder of the daily trust we place in the hands of those who carry us across the water, and the horrible consequences when that trust is misplaced.","The tragic boat collision that killed 38 people has rocked the island community of Lamma .

"Rome (CNN) -- The Catholic cardinals gathered in Rome voted Friday to begin the secret election, or conclave, to elect a new pope next Tuesday afternoon, the Vatican said. The 115 cardinal-electors taking part in the conclave will enter the closed-door process after a morning Mass, the Vatican said. Only cardinals younger than 80 are eligible to vote. Selecting a pope: A digital interactive . The cardinals voted Friday morning to accept the letters of explanation of two cardinal-electors who are eligible to vote for the next pope but will not attend the conclave: Keith O'Brien of Scotland and Julius Riyadi Darmaatmadja of Indonesia. Darmaatmadja cited health reasons, and O'Brien cited personal reasons. Abuse victims' group names preferred picks for new pope . O'Brien resigned in scandal last week after allegations that he made sexual advances toward young men studying to be priests. He apologized in a statement Sunday, saying, ""There have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal."" Since Monday, the cardinals have been uniting for what are known as General Congregations, a series of meetings in which they discuss the issues facing the church. These include how to tackle the issue of child sex abuse by priests and a scandal over leaks from the Vatican last year that revealed claims of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy. Opinion: How to pick a new pope . 'Move our church forward' Some cardinals took to the Internet to make comments before Friday afternoon's meeting that set the conclave date. Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, viewed as one of about a dozen leading candidates to become pope, used Twitter to ask for prayers. ""Your continued prayers help us discern God's will. To move our Church forward,"" wrote Turkson, who if elected would become the first African pontiff since Pope Gelasius I died more than 1,500 years ago. Another leading candidate, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, told the people of his archdiocese in a blog post Friday that he misses New York and is sorry he won't be there on St. Patrick's Day. ""Heartfelt thanks for your prayers! We need them! We feel them! Keep them up!"" Dolan wrote. Cardinal Roger Mahony, the retired archbishop of Los Angeles, also asked for prayers before Friday evening's meeting. ""I hope we vote this evening to set the starting date for the Conclave; preceded by the Mass to Elect a new Pope. Prayers, please!!"" he posted to Twitter. Electronic shield . The chimney used to send up the smoke signals that announce whether or not a new pope has been elected could be raised over the Sistine Chapel on Friday, said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman. The voting takes place inside the chapel, beneath the ornate ceiling painted by Michelangelo. Opinion: What the next pope will face . The building was closed to tourists Tuesday and will remain so for the foreseeable future, the Vatican said. Work is well under way to transform it for the conclave. The cardinals have sworn an oath of secrecy. Nonetheless, the Vatican is taking no chances. An electronic shield will be put up around the conclave to prevent the use of mobile phones and other devices that might allow communication with the outside world. What Africans want from the next pope . However, Lombardi denied a report in the Italian media that the cardinals will be searched as they go in and out of the conclave. Among the things the cardinals have to do is draw lots for which rooms they get at the Casa Santa Marta, the hotel within the walls of Vatican City where they stay during the conclave. The hotel also contains a suite where the newly elected pope will live for a few weeks before moving to the papal apartments. The apartments were placed under seal after Benedict XVI left last week and must be renovated before the new pope can take up residence, the Vatican said.

"Tokyo (Financial Times) -- Japan has posted its narrowest trade deficit for nine months, helped by a big rise in the value of shipments to the US, which has toppled China as Japan's number one export destination. Provisional figures released on Thursday by Japan's finance ministry showed that overall exports rose 1.1 per cent in March from a year earlier to Y6.3tn ($64bn), while imports -- boosted by fuel to replace idled nuclear capacity -- were up 5.5 per cent to Y6.6tn. The resulting Y362bn deficit was the smallest since a small surplus recorded last June, on an unadjusted basis. Figures for the full fiscal year to the end of March, also published on Thursday, showed that Japan's exports to China fell 9 per cent to Y11.3tn, while exports to the US rose 10 per cent to Y11.4tn. The data suggest Japan's revival under a new prime minister will rely more on the outlook in the US than in China, which helped Japan's export-dependent economy through the difficult post-Lehman period. Trade between Asia's two largest economies has been knocked by the slowdown in China and also by the effects of a diplomatic dispute between Tokyo and Beijing over a chain of islands in the East China Sea. Meanwhile, data for March showed a revival in big-ticket orders from the US. Shipments of transport equipment and machinery accounted for 2.1 and 3.3 percentage points of the 7 per cent year-on-year increase, respectively. The US surrendered its position as Japan's top destination for exports early in 2009, following China's aggressive fiscal stimulus amid the global financial crisis. Monthly shipments to the US have exceeded those to China since then, but mainly during January and February, when trade patterns are distorted by New-Year holidays in China. Japan's overall trade deficit stood at Y8.2tn for the fiscal year ended in March, the widest since records began. The nation's trade balance slipped into deficit in March 2011, following the huge earthquake that ruptured supply chains and triggered the closure of almost all of Japan's nuclear reactors. The Y922bn deficit recorded in March, on a seasonally-adjusted basis, was the 25th in a row since then.

"(Financial Times) -- Gold prices have suffered their sharpest fall since the 1980s, heightening fears among investors that the precious metal's decade-long bull run has ended. Spot gold prices tumbled by more than $100 an ounce, or 8.7 per cent, in a few hours on Monday amid a rout in metals markets, while silver fell 11 per cent. Faltering European demand and weaker than expected Chinese economic data depressed oil prices, pushing Brent crude down by 3 per cent to $100.02 a barrel, a nine-month low. The S&P 500 recorded its worst session in six months, closing 2.3 per cent lower as energy and materials companies tumbled. Gold's drop since Friday to a two-year low of $1,355.80 a troy ounce is the sharpest two-day tumble since 1983, when the last gold bull market was unravelling. ""This has really tested people's resolve,"" said David Rose, global head of metals trading at HSBC. ""People who have said they want to be long are asking 'How much do we really want gold to be part of our portfolios?'"" Gold has enjoyed a stellar run over the past decade. Prices surged more than sevenfold since 2001 to an all-time high of $1,920 a troy ounce in 2011, as investors turned to the metal as a haven from turmoil in the rest of the financial world. But as fears over the eurozone debt crisis recede and investors bet on a recovery in the US, sentiment towards gold has suffered. Credit Suisse, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale and Goldman Sachs have all called the end of the bull market in recent months. ""This is a market that has only got one thing on its mind: get me out [of gold],"" said David Govett, head of precious metals at brokerage Marex Spectron. The collapse in prices will hurt investors with large gold holdings such as John Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made billions betting against the US housing market during the financial crisis. In addition to Mr Paulson's $3.1bn holding of shares in a gold exchange traded fund, at the end of last year Mr Paulson's hedge funds controlled shares in at least nine gold miners worth almost $1.1bn at current prices, according to regulatory filings. More than half of that is in one stock, AngloGold Ashanti, where Paulson & Co is the largest holder with a 7.35 per cent stake. AngloGold Ashanti shares have dropped 39.5 per cent so far this year. John Reade, Paulson & Co partner and gold strategist, said that the fund had not changed its long-term thesis on gold, arguing that quantitative easing by the world's central banks would ultimately lead to higher inflation: ""Federal governments have been printing money at an unprecedented rate creating demand for gold as an alternative currency. It is this expectation of global paper currency debasement which makes gold an attractive long-term investment."" More than half Paulson & Co assets are denominated in gold including the great majority of Mr Paulson's own fortune, according to people familiar with the firm. Bill Gross of Pimco, the world's largest bond fund manager, in February described gold as a ""decent hedge"" ""OK, so I made a bad call,"" he admitted in a tweet on Monday, but added that he ""would still buy gold here"". In a New Year letter to investors, David Einhorn listed gold as one of his Greenlight fund's top five holdings along with stock in Apple, Cigna, General Motors and Vodafone. ""We took some lumps as gold declined,"" he admitted in the letter. But Mr Einhorn has also been bearish on the yen since 2010, a position that started to work in the fourth quarter last year and has been one of the most successful hedge fund trades this year. The Tudor hedge fund has been betting against the gold price this year, according to people familiar with the situation. Tudor declined to comment. Nonetheless, traders said that investors had lost patience with arguments that higher inflation is inevitable. ""QE is not inflating the world economies like governments have hoped,"" said Mr Rose at HSBC. ""Commodities that have had inflation priced into them for a long time are struggling."" Traders added that Cyprus' decision last week to sell a portion of its gold reserves as part of a bail-out deal had dealt a sharp blow to confidence in the market, arousing fears that other eurozone countries with much larger gold reserves could follow suit.

"(CNN) -- I served in the armed forces for 25 years, but until January 8, 2011, I didn't think about guns or gun violence that much. I had other things to think about -- my children, traveling between Houston and Tucson and Washington to see my wife, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, and of course, flying the space shuttle. Like lots of people, every time there was a mass shooting, with lots of news coverage, I watched, but I wasn't aware of the statistics and of how gun violence permeates our country. Then Gabby was shot and six of her constituents were murdered during a ""Congress on Your Corner"" event in Tucson, Arizona. During her long and ongoing recovery, I started paying a lot more attention. I'm a numbers guy, a statistics guy -- and what I've learned has shocked me. Almost 100 people a day die from a gun, 33 are murdered. We've got 20 times the murder rate of similar countries. I've watched the globe spin past below me from the window of the space shuttle. And so my perspective has changed. I see this epidemic of gun violence as a crisis, because I know that every statistic is a citizen --- someone like my wife, or Hadiya Pendleton's mom, Cleopatra, who says simply about her daughter, murdered senselessly in Chicago, ""a piece of my heart is gone."" And, excuse the reference, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that while this issue is complicated, there are things we can do -- now, together -- that will reduce violence. Like background checks. Right now, we have two systems. Some people, like me, when we buy a gun, we go through a background check. It takes about five minutes -- trust me, I'm not known to be a patient guy, and it didn't take more than a few minutes when I bought a rifle this past November. Ninety-one percent of background checks are completed instantaneously, and they don't lead to a government database. And they work. I passed my background check and got my gun, and since 1994, more than 2 million folks -- among them, criminals and dangerously mentally ill people -- failed their background checks. But we don't know which of those millions just got in their car and drove to a gun show, or home to their computer to go on the Internet -- both places where anyone can buy a gun without a background check. That doesn't make sense. It's like saying, hey, criminals, to board the plane, either go through a metal detector and be checked against the terrorist watch list, or, if you prefer, walk right down that red carpet and take a seat, no search necessary. Which would you choose? That's why Gabby and I are so determined to get a universal background check in place. It's simple, it's not a Republican or a Democratic issue, and it closes a clear loophole that puts our kids and our communities at risk, and it does it in a way that respects the Second Amendment rights of people like me. We aren't naive in thinking that expanded background checks will solve all our problems overnight, but they are a great first step that even gun owners support. So, I'm putting everything I learned from my time in the Navy and at NASA -- 375 aircraft carrier landings, 39 combat missions and more than 50 days in space -- to working with Gabby and Americans For Responsible Solutions' more than 100,000 members to get this done. When you're at the controls of a plane or the space shuttle, you rely on data. You analyze it methodically; you evaluate it objectively. The data around background checks is clear: Up to 40% of gun transfers are made without background checks, and a national survey of inmates found that nearly 80% of those who used a handgun in a crime acquired it without a background check. That tells me that criminals are getting guns, because we're making it too easy. And 82% of U.S. gun owners -- including more than 70% of NRA members -- support criminal background checks for all gun sales. Ninety-two percent of all households in the country support universal background checks. That tells me that citizens across the country want Congress to get this done, because they know it will keep us safer. That's a clear path, right there. We can get there if we all raise our voices. Talk to your neighbors, your co-workers, the parents at your kids' basketball game. Talk to your elected representative. Tell them you want one system, a universal background check that will keep all of us safer and respects our Second Amendment rights. Join Gabby and me at www.Americansforresponsiblesolutions.org.

"(CNN) -- If this all shakes out the way authorities say it will, the deaths of two local prosecutors, the panic that gripped a city and a massive manhunt that ensued may all stem from the theft of some computer monitors and a disgraced lawman who held a grudge the size of Texas. The brazen shootings of a Kaufman County prosecutor in January and those of the local district attorney and his wife last month stunned the nation. An army of law enforcement officials converged on the area near Dallas. Gov. Rick Perry vowed to find the killer and doubled a $100,000 reward that had already been offered. But despite the feverish search, investigators had one big problem - a plethora of suspects. By the nature of their jobs, prosecutors make many enemies. Detectives eyed an ever-growing lineup of potential suspects -- a local white supremacist gang, drug cartels. Leads that had them looking far away from the town where victims were gunned down. But in the end, prosecutors say, the culprit was closer than they thought. Right under their nose. In broad daylight . Those who worked with Mark Hasse thought the prosecutor was lucky to still be alive. The hard-charging attorney, known for being a supreme story teller, had his own story to tell. He had once crashed a World War II-era plane -- an insane plummet that crushed his skull and left him without the sense of smell. He survived, only to meet his demise January 31 on the county courthouse parking lot. Someone confronted Hasse, investigators say, then shot him dead. The killing, which occurred in broad daylight in the middle of town, sent law enforcement scrambling. A local attorney said Hasse feared for his life and had recently began carrying a gun with him to work, daily. Detectives scoured Hasse's cases for possible culprits. Many emerged. But still as the days moved on, no was arrested. No was named as the prime suspect. District Attorney Mike McLelland vowed to find the ""scum"" who killed his ""stellar"" assistant. Shot a dozen times . McLelland, a man known for not mincing words when it came to criminals, was angry. He aimed a steely stare at the reporter's cameras as if eying Hasse's killer. ""I hope that the people that did this are watching, because we're very confident that we're going to find you,"" McLelland said at a January news conference. ""We're going to pull you out of whatever hole you're in, we're going to bring you back and let the people of Kaufman County prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law."" Two months later, the 63-year-old prosecutor was dead. His body was found in his Kaufman County home along with his wife's on March 30. They both were riddled with bullets, investigators said, shot at least a dozen times. Texas DA, wife killed . At his funeral, McLelland's daughter told the many assembled to continue to fight like her father had. ""He was quite eloquent in saying that he didn't give a sh-t if people were scaring him, and he wasn't frightened, and he was going to stand his ground,"" Christina Foreman said. But fear seemed to be creeping in. An interim district attorney was picked to lead the shaken area until the governor could select a new top prosecutor. ""I wonder if the governor is going to find anyone brave enough to take the job of district attorney,"" Kaufman city Mayor William Fortner said at the time. Disgraced justice . Before his death, McLelland had wondered if a white supremacist group was behind the killing of Hasse. ""We put some real dents in the Aryan Brotherhood around here in the past year,"" McLelland told The Associated Press. McLelland said Hasse wasn't involved in the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas investigation, but his office was one of numerous Texas and federal agencies involved in an investigation that led to the indictment last year of 34 alleged members of the group -- including four of its senior leaders -- on racketeering charges. And while detectives were investigating that angle and many others, others focused closer to home. The recent trial of a local elected official had made some feel uneasy. The 2012 trial of Eric Williams, Kaufman County's then-justice of the peace was big news in the area. ""It was a mega-trial for a little community, the sense of it - it was a big trial,"" said Denise Bell of the Forney Post newspaper. Williams lost his job as a justice of the peace after surveillance video showed him taking county computer equipment. He was found guilty of felony theft, got two years probation and lost his law license. Neighbors say his life was turned upside down. In a statement filed with the court after his conviction, Williams denied the thefts and called the loss of his law license ""a life long sentence."" ""I will have to seek another career, with a felony I will not be able to earn what I am used to,"" he said, adding that it would be his wife, who he said was on disability, and his aging parents who would suffer the most. After the killings, investigators interviewed Williams, meeting him at a Denny's. They asked him to take a gun residue test which he did. It came back negative. Williams, through his lawyer, denied any involvement, said he was cooperating. He said he understood why he was being questioned. Williams, his attorney said, held no grudges. Interim DA known as tough court opponent . A confession . Last week, officials arrested Williams and accused him of sending threatening emails to investigators after McLelland's death. At the time, investigators did not say if Williams was being investigated for the string of killings. That arrest left many, who had been searching for answers for so long, with more questions. Then Williams' wife was arrested Wednesday and an arrest warrant made public that seemed to provide the answers. According to the warrant, the wife described her role and said that her husband, Eric Williams, fatally shot Hasse and the McLellands. ""During the interview the defendant gave details of both offenses which had not been made public,"" the arrest affidavit said. Focus on the Williams had intensified over the weekend after authorities carried out searches of their home as well as a storage unit. An FBI spokesman said investigators recovered a cache of guns and a police-style vehicle. Witnesses reported seeing one like it in the McLellands' neighborhood around the time of their killings. Murders of prosecutors in U.S. called 'beyond rare' What next . Williams has yet to be charged for the killings. His wife, Kim Lene Williams, 46, is being held on murder charges. For residents of the close-knit community, the arrest brought a glimmer of hope . ""Quite honestly this has been troubling. It is a tragic series of events that none of us would have ever expected to occur in our county,"" Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood said. ""There is a sense of relief that perhaps this case is moving forward."" For Bell, of the local Forney Post newspaper, the arrests may remind her of a warning McLelland gave her. Before his death, the district attorney told her that he suspected that Williams was dangerous. The scorned lawman's grudge could extend beyond just getting even with the legal system McLelland had warned. McLelland had advised the reporter to be careful around Williams. ""Because I sat in the front row and covered this trial for 10 days,"" she said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","A Texas prosecutor was killed in January .

Aftab Ali, also known as Aftab Khan, pleaded guilty to charges of unlicensed money transmitting and immigration document fraud in a plea deal that included his deportation, a statement from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said. Khan, 28, was one of the men picked up in a terror sweep a year ago after the botched May 1, 2010, car bomb attempt. ""Investigators obtained evidence that Khan had provided $4,900 to Faisal Shahzad, who was later convicted of carrying out the bombing attempt,"" ICE said. ""Khan borrowed the money and transferred it to Shahzad in February 2010 as part of a 'hawala' transaction in which Khan's family received an equivalent amount of money in Pakistan,"" the statement said. The federal complaint against Khan did not charge that he was complicit in the attempted bombing or that he knew what Shahzad intended to do with the money, ICE said. ICE agents accompanied Khan, who lived in Watertown, Massachusetts, on a flight from Boston to Islamabad, Pakistan, Saturday, the agency said. Khan, 28, had been in federal custody since May 2010, when he, his uncle, and a man in Maine were arrested.","Aftab Ali Khan was arrested after the bombing attempt a year ago .

"(CNN) -- Three years after Haiti's devastating earthquake, more than a third of the country's hospitals are still not functional. A cholera outbreak has killed more than 7,000 people and overwhelmed the already-reeling health care system. Three out of the four medical schools in Haiti were damaged in the January 2010 quake, which killed the entire second-year class at the nation's largest nursing school. In all, more than 200,000 people perished in the magnitude-7.0 earthquake. Despite this bleak outlook, Dr. John Macdonald says he feels ""blessed every day."" Macdonald, a doctor at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, runs a health clinic in Port-au-Prince that's managed to serve 10,000 patients since it opened more than a year ago. In a country where so many things seem to go wrong, his program and others like it stand as a suggestion that it has been possible, at least to some extent, to make a difference in health in Haiti. Macdonald's clinic tends to Haitians with wounds and spinal cord injuries. Other programs have successfully vaccinated children, distributed condoms and brought down malaria rates. ""There are major failings in our system,"" says Dr. Jean Marie Rwangabwoba, an adviser in disease prevention and control to the Pan American Health Organization, a part of the World Health Organization. ""But at the same time, there's some hope the system can really get back on its feet."" Haiti still reeling from quake . Country club dinners and a $100,000 check . According to Rwangabwoda, malaria rates in Haiti are now under 1%, down from 5% seven years ago, thanks in large part to wide distribution of mosquito nets treated with insecticides by his group. Last year, a major vaccination campaign against diseases such as measles and rubella reached 90% of children under 9, he said. About 2.2% of the population has HIV, when many had thought by now it would be around 5%, he added. Condom distribution has helped keep that rate relatively low, he said. These programs were funded by large groups such as the Pan American Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Other programs, such as Macdonald's clinic, rely on smaller donors and some level of serendipity. Macdonald, a wound care specialist, says he was devastated to see people dying in Haiti after the quake from wounds that could have been easily treated. It was more than just wounds from the earthquake. Women had cuts in their breasts where cancerous tumors had erupted through the skin; men had grotesque genital swelling caused by infection; children had maggot-filled wounds on their scalps. Macdonald yearned to start a clinic just for wound care. In 2011, he pleaded his case to a potential donor during lunch at the Coral Ridge Country Club in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. A man who'd been sitting at the next table walked over about 40 minutes into Macdonald's pitch. ""He said, 'I'm a lawyer, and I have a client who has an interest in Haiti and is in a charitable mood. Would you speak with him?' "" Macdonald recalls. His answer, of course, was yes. A few months later, Macdonald had lunch at the same country club with the lawyer's client, a French-Canadian businessman, and at the end of the meal, Macdonald was handed a check for $100,000. ""His wife was with us and she was crying, and at first I thought it was because this was her jewelry money, but she was crying because she was so happy,"" Macdonald says. Haitians living in fear 'under the tent' That check gave birth to a wound clinic in conjunction with Hospital Bernard Mevs in Port-au-Prince and Project Medishare, a group started by doctors at the Miller School of Medicine. About 50 patients a day come into the clinic, and in addition there's a 10-bed ward for people suffering spinal injuries. A second check for $100,000 from the same donor, who's asked to remain anonymous, has kept the clinic going into a second year. Macdonald spends about a week a month at the clinic, which Haitian staff mostly run. ""This is a very important program, and we want to expand it,"" says Dr. Marguerite Mevs, who founded Hospital Bernard Mevs with her husband and other family members. 'A three-ring circus and a brothel' Finding the funds to stay operating in Haiti is all about persistence, says Dr. Enrique Ginzburg, international medical director of Hospital Bernard Mevs/Project Medishare. ""If you get a 'no' in one area, you just go in another direction to accomplish the same goal,"" Ginzburg says. Macdonald agrees but makes another observation. ""Being a doctor in Haiti is like being a doctor for a three-ring circus and a brothel,"" he says. ""On the one hand, you look and see all this amazing talent doing all these incredible feats. But there's also stuff going on behind closed doors you don't want to know about -- corruption, people taking money."" The trick is to not pass judgment, he says. ""You're a guest in someone else's country,"" he says. ""You're fascinated, and helpless to walk away."" Haiti transitions from relief to rebuilding .","Some programs are making a difference in Haiti's health care, doctors say .

"(CNN) -- I've been teaching English in college for 40 years, and I've never met a single professor who likes grading. ""Hate"" is too strong a word for what they feel. But nobody likes it. The fun stuff is talking to students, holding classroom discussions, thinking about your subject in complex ways and trying to convey your enthusiasm for the subject. Education is about leading students in useful directions, helping them to discover their own critical intelligence, their own voices. Now a company has come up with software that can grade our papers for us. EdX is a nonprofit company started by Harvard and MIT. It also creates online courses called MOOCs (for massive open online course). With this new software, students submitting their papers online can get immediate feedback: no more waiting until the lazy professor gets around to grading their work, probably leaving coffee rings and inky fingerprints on the pages. Having a program grade papers would apparently free teachers to do other things, but I think it would be a mistake. Why? As a teacher, I may begin to understand students by their conversation or how they respond in class, but when they actually have to put their thoughts on paper, I can learn a huge amount in a relatively brief time. I can see how they think and feel in relation to the material before them, and if (and how) they have problems in making connections, marshaling arguments, drawing conclusions. Needless to say, I can also get a sense of where they are with the material at hand. Have they learned enough to progress to the next stage? The truth is, students rarely come to college -- any college -- knowing how to write well. This takes a lot of what one of my old profs used to call ""correction."" I remember sitting beside him in his office as he went over my papers. He would draw a red pencil through adjectives, suggesting that I find stronger nouns, not more bolstering words. Don't say it was a ""long narrow street."" Kill the adjectives. Call it an alley if it's an alley. He also told me to get rid of those adverbs. Get a stronger verb and you won't need an adverb, he would tell me. So don't say: ""He ran swiftly down the narrow street."" Instead, try something like this: ""He sped down the alley."" I learned from this guy how to put my sentences into a more active voice, how to subordinate clauses, to embed them in a rolling syntax, making thoughts more subtle, arguments more persuasive. Now that was teaching. Real education lives in sitting side by side with a student, in the face-to-face exchange of ideas and feelings. But grading papers often represents the beginning of a good exchange. I think my best teaching moments have occurred off-stage, late at night. I would spot a problem in a student paper and respond at length, in writing, in the margins. This would lead to an affecting moment in my office, where the student would come back at me to discuss. The conversation would continue, often for a very long time. In some cases, for years. I don't think any software program is ever going to replace people in education. It may offer some help, but it's not the real thing. To paraphrase Mark Twain, it's the difference between lightning bugs and lighting. Sometimes, we need the flash itself, even the jolt, to push us in the right direction. I don't believe software, however sophisticated, will ever provide that kind of jolt. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jay Parini.","Jay Parini: Professors are not crazy about grading papers, but new software can do it for them .

He says computers can't work with students one-on-one to correct writing habits, errors .

"Washington (CNN) -- The nation's powerful gun lobby has faced headwinds from vocal lawmakers, a galvanized presidential administration and an American electorate that polls show favors tougher gun laws following December's school massacre in Connecticut. Yet, when the hundreds of hours of legislative debate, on camera pleas, backroom negotiations and intense lobbying have ended, groups like the National Rifle Association may find that they have narrowed the scope of gun control legislation. ""If you have 100 missiles coming at you and you knock out 99, I would say you were successful,"" Richard Feldman, president of the gun rights group, the Independent Firearm Owners Association, said of efforts by gun rights groups. ""After the Sandy Hook massacre, I was very worried,"" said Feldman, who served as regional political director for the NRA during its rise to power in the 1980s. ""The talk was about an assault weapons ban, a gun registry, background checks. Everything was on the table. But the only thing legislatively coming down the pike, the only thing we're talking about is background checks. I would count that as a success for the NRA,"" he added. Senate gun law proposal lacks enough support now . The Senate has taken up legislation backed by President Barack Obama and many Democrats that would toughen laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases, and devise ways to improve school safety. A bipartisan compromise by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, to expand background checks is the first item up for debate. But Manchin said on Monday that it didn't have enough support yet. A minimum of 60 votes are needed to clear procedural hurdles. As things stand now, supporters need at least seven votes from Republicans, the party most closely aligned with NRA views on gun rights. Though smaller gun rights groups, such as the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, support the measure, the NRA reiterated its threat to hold those who back the compromise politically accountable. The NRA exerts political clout through a rating system that identifies friends and foes of its positions in Congress. It directs substantial contributions to political campaigns it favors or opponents of candidates it dislikes. The NRA was also able to marshal its large and active membership base to press lawmakers on the upcoming gun vote. ""NRA is opposed to Manchin-Toomey, and it will be a scored vote,"" NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said, meaning lawmaker ratings with the organization will be affected by how they vote. A high rating is a political plus for congressional lawmakers from conservative states or districts, especially those up for re-election in 2014. ""There is a lot of member contact going on right now that isn't so obvious,"" said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the State University of New York at Albany's School of Criminal Justice. ""This isn't one of those debates where we're seeing a lot of ads. But this is where groups like the NRA are strong at using members in states to reach out to lawmakers,"" he said. Gun rights group endorses background check deal . The NRA's message both in public and private conversations with lawmakers is clear. ""The NRA is forever. Your vote on that issue is forever. And when the next election comes along we're going to talk about that,"" Lizotte said of the NRA's message to lawmakers. The Manchin-Toomey amendment will be one of perhaps dozens to be debated on the broader package of gun laws pushed by President Barack Obama following the shooting deaths of 20 first-graders and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. In debate expected to last two weeks, senators will consider efforts by both sides to either expand or weaken the gun package. Key issues that had some momentum coming out of Newtown but are fiercely opposed by the NRA appear to have a slim chance of passage. These include a Democrat-driven push for banning semiautomatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons and limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds. Republicans will push an NRA proposal to make state concealed weapons permits acceptable throughout the country, a concept opposed by many Democrats. The assault weapons proposal by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Manchin-Toomey compromise and the plan around concealed weapons will all be up for votes beginning on Wednesday as amendments, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said. The powerful gun lobby and its allies in Congress have been able to use a sophisticated campaign. They have consistently shifted the focus among various provisions, raised new arguments to old issues, and proposed solutions that would expand weapons use and training instead of increasing regulation. The gun lobby has had a hand in helping to shape or steer the direction of many amendments to the overall bill, gun policy experts say. Take, for example, the ban on semi-automatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons proposed by Feinstein, a California Democrat, and backed by Obama. Fiercely opposed by the National Rifle Association, Republicans and some Democrats, Reid calculated that it would be best not to include it in the main bill because it would invite a filibuster. In the House, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said the chamber would look at anything the Senate approved. But he's not promising a vote. ""What the NRA does as well if not better than any organization in this country I do what you do in the old civics courses. You educate your supporters,"" Feldman said. ""You get them to communicate their views with elected officials in a targeted manner."" Why is this so hard? The disconnect on background checks and guns .

"Pasadena, California (CNN) -- When President Barack Obama formally ended ""don't ask, don't tell"" in July 2011, ending a 17-year ban on gays serving openly in the U.S. military, Tracey Cooper-Harris felt liberated about her future as a veteran. As a sergeant in the U.S. Army, she received more than two dozen medals and commendations during her 12 years of service, which included tours in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. ""Like a lot of other vets, I've had some struggles, including post-traumatic stress, but that's one of the issues that I'm taking care of,"" she said. While Cooper-Harris struggled with PTSD, she managed to earn a Bachelor of Science degree from California State University, Northridge, and landed a job at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Los Angeles, where she helps other veterans with disabilities. Four years ago, Cooper-Harris disclosed her sexual orientation and married longtime partner Maggie Cooper in California, where same-sex marriages were legal under state law. Three days later, voters passed Proposition 8, an initiative that invalidated such marriages. Supreme Court will tackle same-sex marriage . ""We knew there was a possibility that Proposition 8 would not go in our favor, but on that particular day, that was not really on our minds,"" said Maggie, who met Tracey during a women's rugby match at Occidental College, where she coaches a women's team. Like the 18,000 same-sex couples who obtained marriage licenses before the ballot initiative went into effect, the couple's marriage is still recognized as legal in California. They are entitled to the same protections as other married couples under state law. Victory for lesbian, years after her longtime partner's death . But in 2010, Tracey was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a chronic, disabling disease that attacks the brain and nervous system and has no cure. Because the Department of Veteran Affairs determined that the disease is connected to her military service, Tracey says she qualified for disability benefits of about $1,400 a month, which help cover medicine and doctor visits. In late 2011, Tracey applied for additional disability compensation as a married veteran to help ensure that her spouse had supplemental support. When the couple received a letter from the Department of Veterans Affairs denying dependency benefits, based on their marital status, it was a setback in their struggle for same-sex equality. ""It hurts and it's really frustrating,"" Tracey said. Federal appeals court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act . Under the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, the federal government does not recognize Maggie as a legal dependent. Therefore, she cannot receive spousal benefits that would be available to a male spouse. In February, Tracey and Maggie Cooper-Harris filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against the Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Justice. ""This unequal treatment of Tracey and Maggie's marriage under federal law demeans not only their marriage but also the remarkable sacrifices of Tracey, a woman who gave more than nine years of her life in active duty military service to this country,"" according to the lawsuit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center on behalf of the couple. ""I just want to make sure that if and when something does happen to me, if any of my service-connected issues get worse, if I get really sick or incapacitated, that Maggie's provided for,"" Tracey said. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Veterans Affairs declined to comment on the lawsuit. Washington starts issuing same-sex marriage licenses . What worries Tracey is how Maggie will cope if she dies from the disease. According to their lawsuit, because of her gender, there are benefits in death that Maggie wouldn't receive, like bereavement counseling or death indemnity compensation. ""It's very disappointing to think that during one of the roughest times in life, Maggie would be left out in the cold,"" Tracey said. What's worse, Tracey says, is that under DOMA, a same-sex spouse cannot be buried in a state or national veteran's cemetery. Despite the Department of Veteran Affairs' rejection of disability benefits for same-sex couples, Tracey and Maggie are optimistic that their lawsuit will prevail. Although Tracey is an employee at the same institution she is suing, she says her supervisors have been supportive. As their suit moves forward, equally important to the future of same-sex marriage, Tracey says, is what happens at the U.S. Supreme Court. Soon, it could decide on the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act in eight cases under consideration and one involving Proposition 8. ""I'm very happy to be married to Tracey, and I look forward to a time when it's a fully recognized marriage in the eyes of the federal government and we don't have to worry about some of the things on our minds that add to burdens that already exist in our daily lives,"" Maggie said.

"(CNN) -- Every year, come Valentine's Day, I cringe at the thought of walking down the street with red roses, balloons and chocolates. It's not that I don't like all of the above, I simply dislike the commercialization of love. But whether you're shy or not about proclaiming your love, the reality is that this day is big business. Lufthansa Cargo is one of the many carriers that help to deliver romance. Every year it transports 20,000 tons of flowers and plants. In the days leading up to Valentine's Day, it will fly one thousand tons of roses. Ensuring they reach their final destination in full bloom is a complex logistical chain that begins with the growers. The roses come directly from Kenya, Colombia and Ecuador. They are picked up locally by the freighter and while they vary in shape and quality, they all have to meet tough quality standards and strict European Union regulations. This begins the moment they board the plane. Here, the captain has to shower them with love, attention and a temperature in the range of four and eight degrees. Lufthansa's cargo pilot, Robert Nilles, tells me this is important ""because roses are easily perishable goods, it's very important not to disrupt the code chain."" After a 10 hour flight, they land at Frankfurt and here, it's all about speed and punctuality. With cargo doors open and temperatures below zero, the roses need to be moved quickly. In less than an hour, all 65 tons of roses are moved from the freighter to the perishable center where their temperature is taken once again. Hans-Jurgen Hess is responsible for the next step. As a representative of the German government, it's his responsibility to check all food and plant shipments that come through Frankfurt. But his task is bigger than this: He's a border inspector for the whole of the EU and he must make sure that everything that leaves Frankfurt is clean of any diseases. Picking up a pink bunch of roses, Hess shows me he'll be looking at leaves and stems for plant rust, mildew, whitefly and many more bugs. He'll examine one batch from each supplier and if clear, he'll sign off and they're good for delivery. So next time you buy or receive a bunch of roses, remember the precision of this logistical chain. It may have taken you five minutes to buy them, but it takes six hours to approve them. Now that's commercial love.","The roses come directly from Kenya, Colombia, Ecuador and are picked up by a freight .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The widow of a man gunned down outside his son's suburban Atlanta day-care center plotted his death with her cash-strapped lover for nearly $3 million in insurance and other assets, prosecutors alleged Thursday. A grand jury indicted Andrea Sneiderman on murder, racketeering, perjury and other charges Thursday morning, DeKalb County, Georgia, District Attorney Robert James announced. According to the indictment, she and her then-boss, Hemy Neuman, had been having an affair for about seven months before husband Rusty Sneiderman was killed in November 2010. The Sneidermans were having marriage problems at the time, while Neuman and his wife were in similar straits and facing bankruptcy, according to the charges.

""Neuman and Andrea Sneiderman conspired together to murder Rusty Sneiderman so that they could enjoy a life together, eliminate Neuman's debt problems and fully benefit from the assets the Sneidermans had acquired, as well as the proceeds of Rusty Sneiderman's life insurance policies,"" the indictment states. Rusty and Andrea Sneiderman had two small children and about $960,000 in the bank, according to the charges. Rusty Sneiderman's life insurance policy paid out $2 million plus interest, prosecutors allege. But in a written statement to reporters, Sneiderman's defense team said they ""categorically deny each and every one of the charges that were filed against Andrea today."" ""We are looking forward to a vigorous and complete defense to ensure that Andrea is fully exonerated of these false accusations,"" said J. Tom Morgan, a former DeKalb County district attorney. ""We are confident that, when an unbiased jury hears the facts of this case, it will be clear that Andrea is innocent."" Neuman already is serving a sentence of life in prison without parole in the killing. During his trial, both prosecutors and defense lawyers accused Sneiderman of having an affair with him -- an allegation she denied under oath. A jury found Neuman guilty but mentally ill in March. Neuman's lawyers argued that Sneiderman had ""manipulated"" him into killing her husband, and said Thursday's indictment could boost his chances of a successful appeal. ""The indictment today is clear confirmation of exactly what our defense was,"" said Doug Peters, one of Neuman's attorneys. ""Andrea was an adulterer, liar, and master manipulator."" Sneiderman was arrested at her parents' home in Putnam County, about 80 miles east of Atlanta, after a grand jury returned the indictment Thursday morning, James said. Her attorneys accused James of turning the arrest into a ""media circus,"" saying they had already offered to surrender Sneiderman if charges were brought. James said prosecutors won't seek the death penalty against Sneiderman. In a statement released through their attorneys, Rusty Sneiderman's family said the charges were ""another important step in the pursuit of justice"" for him, but the arrest of their in-law ""brings us no joy.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Most Americans will feel the impact of forced budget cuts when their lives intersect with government -- trying to get through airport security to make a flight, visiting a national park, or using federal programs or assistance. Congress can avert the automatic cuts, called sequester, if it compromises on a deficit-reduction plan before the March 1 deadline. But time is running out. No deal would set in motion some $85 billion in spending reductions that would be phased in through the end of the fiscal year, September 30. Talk Back: Who's to blame for forced spending cuts? Both the House and Senate are on their President's Day break and will have four days to negotiate when they return next week. Congress extended the deadline for action at the start of the year when Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell agreed to defer the cuts for two months. Here's where most Americans will feel their impact if sequester takes effect: . National parks . Expect closed gates at some national parks as the National Park Service would lose $110 million from its annual budget. This could also lead to shorter hours, fewer employees, and possible closure of camping and hiking spaces. Even the most popular national parks, such as Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, wouldn't be spared. By the Numbers: Automatic spending cuts . Airport security and air traffic . Proposed cuts to the Transportation Security Administration could mean trouble for air travel. The wait at airport security checkpoints could increase by at least an hour due to furloughed TSA screeners, who check passengers and cargo for bombs, guns and other prohibited items. It could take longer to get through customs as well. The Federal Aviation Administration manages air traffic at more than 400 commercial airports and cuts raise the possibility of flight delays, especially at crowded airports. The agency has preemptively warned its 47,000 workers of furloughs for one day every two weeks through September. Like the TSA, any furloughs would begin in late April or early May, the start of the busy summer travel season. Budget cuts will mean more time at the airport . Education . The Department of Education budget would also be trimmed. Proposed spending cuts would do the most damage to educational programs that heavily serve low income families. About 70,000 children could be forced out of Head Start, which promotes school readiness for children from birth to age 5. Further cuts to the education budget would also mean less money for schools and districts nationwide. The real impact of automatic spending cuts and why they may happen after all . Public Health . While Medicare and Medicaid will be protected, primary and preventive care, like flu vaccinations, could be closed off to hundreds of thousands of Americans. Cuts to mental health funding will leave over 350,000 Americans untreated. Food and workplace safety is also in danger. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which ensures safe workplaces and investigates accidents on the job would lose about 1,200 inspections, diminishing its oversight. The forced cuts could also affect food safety -- there could be up to 2,100 fewer food inspections if the cuts are implemented. This could lead to a shortage of meat in our markets, as the sale of unchecked meat is prohibited. Blind budget cuts, explained with a tomato . Crime and justice . Federal prosecutors will have to close some cases if cuts are imposed. Federal courts will see a quarter of their employees furloughed and jury trials could be suspended because there will be no money to pay juries. The Department of Homeland Security could lose up to 5,000 agents at the border and the Pentagon would furlough thousands of defense workers. According to FBI Director Robert Mueller, the FBI would lose 2,285 employees. Federal worker furloughs could start in April . Unemployment benefits . Long term unemployed also stand to lose big. Under the proposed spending cuts, benefits are expected to decrease by 10% or, on average, $400 a month. This cut will affect 3.8 million Americans, who use these benefits to pay for food and housing while trying to find jobs in a damaged economy. The proposed cuts will also limit resources at job finding centers, a move the could heavily damage the livelihood of those who are already struggling. Unemployed would lose benefits if federal budget cuts go through .","The National Park Service would lose $110 million from its annual budget .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the days before the Senate voted to end a filibuster and take up gun control this week, President Barack Obama crisscrossed the nation, flying from Colorado to Connecticut in an effort to energize public opinion and pressure reluctant lawmakers. Vice President Joe Biden also made an emotional plea at the White House. And even the first lady brought an audience to tears at a high school in Chicago where gun violence has been felt most painfully. But, as a bipartisan group of senators reached agreement on what some have called a watered-down proposal for expanded background checks for gun purchases, the question remains whether all that lobbying really made a difference. ""It has helped, but it's sort of a two-part story,"" said Robert Spitzer, author of ""Politics of Gun Control"" and chairman of the State University of New York-Cortland's political science department. ""Part one is the president using the bully pulpit to make news events and congratulate those states where they've enacted tougher laws. There's a certain downside that anything that Obama is for is anything his opponents are against,"" Spitzer said. As the president spent considerable political capital over the past few days to champion gun reform, opponents have raised the stakes by vocally speaking out against such policies and making it clear there will be a reckoning come Election Day for any lawmaker who supports them. Take the president's fiery comments on Monday in Hartford. It was a message crafted as much for lawmakers as it was for the families of students and educators killed in December's school massacre in Newtown, which is not far from where Obama spoke. The families sat behind him on stage and traveled to Washington with him on Air Force One to lobby Congress on gun control. ""This is not about politics,"" the president said to applause. ""This is not about politics."" ""This is about these families and families all across the country who are saying let's make it a little harder for our kids to get gunned down."" But it is, at least in part, about politics. Why we're still debating guns . Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative West Virginia Democrat and avid gun supporter who helped lead a bipartisan compromise agreement with fellow senator Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, over background checks, was visibly moved after meeting with Sandy Hook families. ""I can do something,"" an emotional Manchin told parents who lost children in the attack. But when the pair announced their compromise to expand federal background checks to gun shows and Internet sales, the executive director of the Gun Owners of America, Larry Pratt, tweeted the sentiment of many in his organization. ""May Sen. Toomey experience in 2016 the same as he did to Sen. Specter in 2010."" In 2010, Toomey was the more conservative challenger to the late Sen. Arlen Specter in Pennsylvania's Republican senatorial primary. Specter, who beat Toomey in a similar, contentious GOP primary in 2004, later switched parties and lost in the Democratic primary to Rep. Joe Sestack, who then lost to Toomey in the general election. ""It means that he ought to be held politically accountable and the way to do it is in the primaries,"" Pratt told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in a heated exchange, indicating his organization would support a primary challenge to Toomey when he is up for reelection in 2016. The timing of Obama's speech in Hartford preceded the Senate's vote clearing the way for consideration of a Democrat-backed gun control package. The House of Representatives has not yet decided when or if it will take up a similar bill. And the timing of first lady Michelle Obama's emotional homecoming to Chicago, speaking Wednesday at a luncheon fundraiser for a new initiative seeking to curb youth violence, was not by accident, either. She recalled the shooting death of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old who was killed a week after performing in Washington during the Inauguration in January. Saying Pendleton ""was me, and I was her,"" Mrs. Obama reflected on the opportunities that led her to the White House instead of a similar fate. Obama was in Colorado last week, just miles from the scene of last July's movie theater shooting that left 12 people dead, to push for expanded background checks. ""I've come here to Denver today because Colorado, in particular, is proving a model for what's possible,"" Obama told the audience. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper recently signed measures into law that will require universal background checks for gun sales, restrict the size of ammunition magazines and make buyers pay for their own background checks. Before the Colorado gun-control vote, Biden, who heads the Obama administration's efforts on the issue, called several state lawmakers to underscore the broader national importance of the heated gun control policy debate. But those efforts may have backfired, galvanizing pro-gun advocates instead. Colorado gun groups have vowed to help defeat lawmakers in tough districts who supported passing the gun control package. ""I don't want to go their cocktail parties. I don't want to make friends. I just don't want them to stop Americans of their rights including me and my kids,"" said Dudley Brown, executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners. His group, as well as pro-gun rights groups and publications, such as Concealed Carry magazine, have stepped up gun giveaways in states like Colorado, New York and Arizona, where tough gun control laws have passed or are pending. The National Rifle Association, the nation's largest and most powerful gun lobby group, said Wednesday that expanding background checks at gun shows ""will not prevent the next shooting, will not solve violent crime and will not keep our kids safe in schools."" The group's leaders have also been deeply critical of Obama's efforts. ""President Obama should be as committed to dealing with the gang problem that is tormenting honest people in his hometown as he is to blaming law-abiding gun owners for the acts of psychopathic murderers,"" the NRA said in a statement. Obama has often said that the fight for new gun control is personal. He wiped away tears when reflecting on the Newtown shooting spree. And the president was animated in talking about what he sees as national support for stricter gun control policies. However, gun control advocates have worried and polls have shown that in the months following the Newtown shooting, support for stricter gun laws has waned. In that, Obama's fierce push to keep the issue up front has been extremely valuable to those seeking stricter gun laws, Spitzer said. ""It's an imperative that the president be out front on this issue,"" Spitzer said. ""Obama's ability to keep this in the minds of the public paves the way a little more for legislative reforms."" CNN's Ashley Killough, Kevin Liptak, Matt Smith, Jake Tapper, Sherisse Pham and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","President Obama flew from Colorado to Connecticut pushing gun control agenda .

"Kaufman County, Texas (CNN) -- It was, in the words of local newspaper reporter Denise Bell, a ""megatrial for a little community."" A justice of the peace, accused of ripping off taxpayers, labeled ""dishonorable"" by a top prosecutor after his conviction last year and stripped of his job and his law license. Now, amid an even larger investigation into the deaths of two Kaufman County prosecutors this year, that former official, Eric Williams, is jailed on $3 million bond -- charged with two counts of insufficient bond and one count of making a ""terroristic threat."" Authorities haven't explained the charges and they have not said if Williams' arrest over the weekend is related to the investigation into the deaths of District Attorney Mike McLelland, McLelland's wife, Cynthia, and Mark Hasse -- the prosecutor who last year accused Williams of ""using Kaufman County as his own piggy bank."" Hasse, Kaufman County's chief felony prosecutor, died in a brazen daytime shooting outside the courthouse January 31. Someone shot McLelland, the county's district attorney, and his wife, Cynthia, late last month at their Forney, Texas, home. Authorities have not named a suspect or a motive for the killings. Federal, state and local authorities looking into the killings searched Williams' home on Friday, according to an FBI spokeswoman. A day later, Texas Rangers and FBI agents combed through a storage facility in Seagoville, Texas, on a search warrant also tied to the prosecutors' deaths, the spokeswoman said. CNN affiliates KTVT and WFAA, citing anonymous sources, said authorities found 20 weapons and a white Ford Crown Victoria in the storage unit. The car, KTXA reported, matches the description of one seen near the McLellands' home around the time of their deaths. Authorities have not named Williams as a suspect in the deaths. Nor have they said the storage locker search had anything to do with the former justice of the peace, who has denied any involvement in the deaths through his attorneys and in interviews with local media. On Friday, Williams' attorney, David Sergi, released a statement saying his client ""has cooperated with law enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations. He wishes simply to get on with his life and hopes that the perpetrators are brought to justice."" Sergi did not respond to repeated e-mail and telephone messages over the weekend and Monday seeking comment on developments in the case. In March 2012 -- almost a year before McLelland's death -- Hasse and McLelland played prominent roles in prosecuting Williams on one count of burglary and one count of theft by a public official. Accused of stealing computer equipment from a county building, he was convicted and sentenced to two years of probation. After the trial, McLelland rejoiced that the conviction showed the county's ""good ol' boy network is gone,"" according to media reports. Hasse called Williams ""dishonorable"" and a liar, according to the reports. But in a statement filed with the court after his conviction, Williams denied the thefts and called the loss of his law license ""a life long sentence."" ""I will have to seek another career, with a felony I will not be able to earn what I am used to,"" he said, adding that it would be his wife, who he said was on disability, and his aging parents who would suffer the most. In a recent interview with North Texas TV station KXAS, Williams said he bore no ill will toward Hasse or McLelland, saying he felt the officials were just ""doing their jobs."" But Bell, a reporter for The Forney Post, said McLelland told her before his death that he thought Williams was responsible for Hasse's death. He divulged his suspicion, she says, while cautioning her to be careful. Why? ""Because I sat in the front row and covered this trial for 10 days,"" she told CNN.","Authorities have not named former Kaufman County official a suspect in DA's death .

"(CNN) -- I ran my eighth Boston Marathon on Monday, the day the bombs went off. We cannot let this terrible tragedy taint this amazing international event or let whoever was behind this evil act win. That's why I will run it again. Marathoners are tough-minded and can endure discomfort for long periods of time. They enjoy running to push themselves and often run with others and make friends along the way. Some are highly competitive, like me, and enjoy the long, hard journey to get into marathon shape before the race. After all that training, the Boston Marathon is usually a very happy day that results in a joyous sense of accomplishment. But today, most runners are probably feeling as I do: disgusted, saddened, angry and depressed. The race feels surreal, almost as if it didn't happen, and as if a whole lot of training and hard work amounted to nothing. I don't think one participant can walk away from that marathon and feel glad. Most people say they want to forget it because of all the sadness and loss. On the day of the marathon, I had set out to Hopkinton, Massachusetts, where the race begins, to start in the elite women's field, which begins 30 minutes ahead of the remaining waves. As I was standing on the starting line and looking at the thousands of people around me, I was struck by a terrible and unusual thought: ""Today's venue would be an opportune time for someone to hurt a lot of people."" It passed, the gun went off, and I was on my way to Boston. This was an especially exciting year because it was the first time my three children, who are 13, 11 and 10, came to watch mommy run the Boston race. As I concluded the race, the second master's finisher and 20th woman overall, I was immediately escorted back to the Fairmont Copley Hotel where my family and I were staying. We were sitting around discussing the race, and the first explosion went off. Then the next. We all looked at each other wondering what that could have been -- with a gut-wrenching feeling, we realized it had to be bad. Sirens were wailing, and the streets were full of commotion. Panicky texts were coming in fast from family and friends, asking if we were all safe, sending information about the two bombs that went off at the finish line. Our TV was turned off: Someone had told me to keep it off to spare the kids the gory details. The hotel went into lockdown for the next five hours, and our fear grew. We couldn't help but think of all the people involved, the people who were killed and injured, their families, the volunteers, the first responders, the medical personnel and the runners. We wondered how race director Dave McGillivray was doing. He has the respect of the whole running community for all he has done to make the Boston Marathon so special and memorable for everyone involved. My kids keep saying, ""What kind of an idiot would do something like this? Who would do this? What do you think they are feeling about what they did right now? Are you scared to run the Boston Marathon again, Mommy?"" Runners will continue to participate in the Boston Marathon -- but it may take years for the fear to go away completely. I love running this marathon and will continue to do it. But next time I run down Boylston Street to the finish line, I will think of all the people injured and the ones who lost their lives for nothing. And I think my children have seen their mom run the Boston Marathon for the first and last time.

"Washington (CNN) -- As the House and the Senate debated and passed budgets recently, one person was notably absent from the debate: President Barack Obama. For the fourth time in five years, the president is late submitting his budget to Congress. So late, in fact, this year both the House and Senate were forced to move forward without him, rendering the president's budget request completely irrelevant. Unfortunately, the president's tardiness is reflective of his fundamental lack of seriousness when it comes to budgeting. Families and businesses have to ensure that their spending, including their debt payments, doesn't exceed their income, but the president acts as if he doesn't think that should apply to the federal government. Recently, when speaking about his budget (which the White House says will be out next week, a full two months after the deadline), the president said that he didn't want ""to chase a balanced budget just for the sake of balance."" Well, perhaps he should chase a balanced budget for the sake of our economy. For four years now, the president's agenda has been out-of-control spending, massive tax hikes on Americans and burdensome regulations on job creators. Since the president took office, we've seen more than $1.7 trillion in new tax hikes, $518 billion in new regulations, and $6 trillion added to the national debt. The impact of those policies has not been pretty. Economic growth under this president has averaged just 0.8%. That isn't anywhere close to the 5% growth needed for a real recovery. While it's certainly true that the president inherited a bad economy, it's important to note that he inherited it more than four years ago. What has he been doing since? Let's put this in perspective. Ronald Reagan inherited a bad economy. But Reagan put in place growth-oriented economic policies such as fundamental tax reform and fewer regulations, which turned the economy around. During the Reagan recovery, the economy grew nearly three times as fast as it has under Obama's watch. During the fourth year of Reagan's presidency, the economy experienced robust 7.2% growth. In contrast, the fourth year of Obama's presidency produced economic growth of just 2.2%. If the Obama recovery were as strong as Reagan's, our economy would be $1.5 trillion larger today -- meaning more jobs, more opportunity, and more take-home pay for Americans. The fact is Obama's spending, tax and regulatory policies are smothering economic recovery, jobs and opportunity. Just take the president's $2.6 trillion health care overhaul signed into law three years ago. The Federal Reserve recently issued a report stating employers in several regions are laying off workers and cutting back on new hires as a direct result of the president's health care law. Four years into the president's term, 12 million Americans are still out of work and the labor force participation rate has declined to 63.5%. Americans are becoming so discouraged in the Obama economy that they simply stop looking for work. If the labor force participation rate today were the same as when the president took office, the real unemployment rate would be 10.7%. Yet despite the abysmal failures of the president's policies, he continues to argue for more of the same. It's time to try something new: Time to balance the budget, rein in Washington's dangerous levels of spending and unleash economic growth by expanding energy production being held back by the Obama administration, such as the Keystone XL pipeline. It's time to cut excessive government red tape strangling our small businesses and to truly reform our tax code to make rates lower and fairer for all Americans. We should be taking an honest look at the relationship between the president's policies and economic growth. The president's tax hikes, runaway spending and onslaught of new and burdensome regulations are preventing a real economic recovery. It's time for the president to get out of the way of the American people and let our economy take off. It's time to do better than 0.8% growth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Thune.","Sen. John Thune: President Obama is late submitting budget to Congress .

"(CNN) -- There were nights this season when college basketball was compelling, but more nights when it looked dysfunctional. There were nights that featured the spectacular Elijah Johnson of Kansas going for 39 in an overtime win at Iowa State this week, but many other nights that featured a confounding loss of artistry on offense. The game has wheezed and sputtered for three months. It dropped a few goblets of oil from the underside of the carriage with games where teams struggled to score 25 points in a half. I am in the business of watching sports, so perhaps that's why so many people have said to me or sent me an e-mail disappointed at the game they watched the night before. Bleacher Report: Kansas vs. Iowa State . Great defense and good defensive coaching can make games look ugly and viewers see night after night that defense has jumped ahead of offense in the college game. But now it's March and the college game will fire up a brand new ride for March Madness. It will capture the hearts of sporting America as it winds its way through the exalted office tournament pools. But what to do with the old jalopy? It needs more than new wheels and a fresh coat of paint that will come with the new season in November 2013. It needs a real fix. Scoring (points per team, per game) could reach a low not seen since the 1952 season. Offense is becoming a routine struggle as players cope with physical defense, tight-fisted coaches, technology and the increased size, speed and athleticism of opponents. Bleacher Report: March Madness 2013 . Major League Baseball lowered the pitching mound five inches following the 1968 season after pitchers dominated the game from their mountaintops. The NBA opened up a spigot of offense when it banned hand-checking in 1994 and forearms to the chest of ball handlers facing the basket in 1999. Hockey started enforcing its rule book as far as restraining fouls for the 2005-06 season and scoring went up. There is a solution that would work for college basketball. But, first, a few that won't. Unplug technology . Big Brother is watching. The video-statistical knowledge teams have at their fingerprints has hindered the best-laid plans of many teams this season. Ninety percent of teams in Division I men's basketball use a service provided by Synergy Sports that dissects every play, every tendency of an opponent. George Mason University coach Paul Hewitt said technology is invaluable in scouting an opponents' offense and understanding the opposition's strengths. Defense has gotten ahead of offense partly because of this advanced scouting. One coach knows the other coach and his favorite plays. Teams are not only dissecting opponents, they are creating dossiers of referees. What has been the tendency of a referee the last five games to how he makes calls? Well, here it is on the video. Referee assignments are made before the season in some conferences, a few days before games in other conferences, so there is plenty of time to scout a zebra before he shows up. Officials in basketball influence the game more than any other sport, so knowing who is calling your game or how it will be called is paramount to coaches. Play defense without fouling . Defenders are loathe to give up a layup not only because it is two points but also because coaches are screamers and berate kids endlessly about defensive breakdowns. It's like a slow roller through the first baseman's legs. What kid wants an earful of abuse? So the defender fouls with a slight push, which means the dunk at the rim, one of the most exciting plays in the game, is rare. Players need to be forced by the rules to back up to keep a guy in front of them. Let the offensive player shoot the jumper, or risk a foul when you hand check, like the NBA. Players have to be made to play defense with their feet by the referee. The benefit is coaches might actually stop working on defense 70 percent of the time in practice and work on shooting. If there are going to be more open shots, it makes sense to practice them. It would also help the college player going to the NBA where hand-checking is usually not allowed. Send the players to the bench . Coaches want players to get physical and dare the referee to invite the wrath of the ticket buyer by whistling every chuck and hand-check. If the refs called everything ear muffs would have to be given out at the door and there would be maddening stop-and-go action. Well, they need to call everything. Stop the bullying and strip-searching of the ball handler once and for all. Universal officiating . The ultimate new rule would be to put referees under one system. Right now, they are ruled by each conference office, which is a fiefdom that is loathed to relent power. The NCAA could create satellite offices around the country and assign officials to that office. Do it like the NBA. Grade them, kick the worst out at the end of every season. The refs are independent contractors and some of them are lawyers. They might use their day job to protect their night job and sue to work independently. One coach, who did not want to be named because it might invite the wrath of refs, said consistency in officiating around the country would be enhanced if there was a centralized authority. It won't happen. Enforce the rule book . Good luck. There is one rule book in college basketball, but many interpretations of that rule book. John Adams, the NCAA coordinator of officials, started a movement toward Freedom of Movement five years ago and one of the ways to accomplish that was to ask referees to ""call the rule book."" That means calling three seconds in the lane to eliminate the shoving for position, whistling post defenders for excessive arm bars to the back, calling hand-checking and blowing the whistle when physical defenders drive dribblers into the sidelines with chest bumps. I had the referee coordinator of a conference tell me that no harm, no foul is fine. No, it's not, says Adams. A foul is a foul. Reduce the wrestling match in the lane . Hewitt, the George Mason University coach, said the game is too physical in the paint and the contact has to be reduced. Here's a thought: call three seconds on the offensive player. He is not allowed to stand in there four seconds. If there is nobody in there for the defender to wrestle with you have a solution: no scrum. Give coaches more time to work with players in the offseason . Brian Gregory, the coach at Georgia Tech, said there will be a transformation in the game within two years if the NCAA allowed college basketball coaches to work more individually with players. The NCAA, of course, will tell coaches to quit spending so much time on defense in practice. Coaches are going to be told to use their time more wisely. The coaches are getting some blame for the choking of offense. They want to let their teams run and gun, but then they see poor decision making in a fast game, which is followed by a turnover. Turnovers do not look good when committed in front of the athletic director, who is the coach's boss. Bleacher Report: How small ball saved Tar Heels' season . The fans and media hiss at slow, deliberate play, but when a pass sails out of bounds on the break and the player tries to be the least bit creative, the player is labeled careless and it is back to walk-it-up basketball. Now, finally, here's the solution: . The solution is a 24-second shot clock . The game will be quicker and more fun. It will eliminate the walk-it-up style and the boring high-ball screen and the same old offense with the current 35-second clock. The coaches will have to let go of the reins and allow more freedom of movement for their players. ""I have petitioned Conference USA for the last three years to let us go to a 24-second clock,"" said Memphis head coach Josh Pastner. ""It would help our entire league in recruiting because we can be the closest thing to the NBA. It would be dynamite."" More possessions equal a faster game. More offense. I get that. But it is not going to happen. The Have-Nots think they will be buried by the Kansases, Dukes and Memphises of the world who have more talent. The best we will do is a 30-second clock like the women. It might be that college basketball looks at Nielsen ratings where college basketball numbers have stayed the same this year compared to last and figure the game is fine like it is. But, just maybe, more seasons like this last one, where scoring suffered, will convince the caretakers of the game to upgrade offense so the public doesn't have to wait until March for the game to be compelling again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ray Glier.","Ray Glier: College basketball ""has wheezed and sputtered for three months""

"(CNN) -- Tax-free Gulf States will eventually be a thing of the past, according to the head of the Union of Arab Banks. Gulf States in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) are said to be considering plans for a value added tax (VAT) by 2015 while also lowering corporate tax rates to increase foreign direct investment, according to the Paying Taxes 2013 report conducted by the World Bank, IFC and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The GCC is made up of Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Oman. Adnan Youssif, who is chairman of the union, said that any tax should not be considered a ""negative act."" Youssif also expects a good year for Arab banks, estimating that net profits will grow at 15% in 2013. He noted, however ""the growth will not be equal in all countries."" The Union of Arab Banks, headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon, was setup in 1974 to foster cooperation between Islamic banks and support those in the region. Youssif said: ""I think the Gulf banks will take the lead, spearheaded by banks in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar respectively."" He added: ""That is mainly due to the huge government financed projects in these countries."" The bank union chief is less positive on Europe following the recent crisis that has engulfed the eurozone's third-smallest economy, Cyprus. Youssif believes the euro will face ""more problems"" as a result of the political decisions made to solve the crisis in Cyprus. European lawmakers initially proposed a levy on all depositors in the two biggest Cypriot banks, causing savers to panic and protest, in return for a 10 billion euro ($12.8 billion) bailout. He said: ""The bailout deal will hit hard on them and this will lead into a serious problem, but I am afraid that more banks in other European countries will face similar issues."" Most recently, North African countries such as Egypt and Libya have approved new laws on their financial systems. Both countries underwent leadership changes during the Arab Spring that began in 2012. In an attempt to attract foreign investment, in March Libya approved a law that will introduce Sharia-compliant banking and stimulate the country's private sector, according to the ruling National Transitional Council. But Youssif said he is not in favour of shifting towards Islamic finance without fully understanding all the aspects of Islamic banking. He said: ""It is not only about laws and Islamic banking products; there should be an appropriate environment and solid follow up and control from the central bank.""","Gulf States are said to be considering plans for a value added tax (VAT) by 2015 .

"(EW.com) -- There was a chance that two fewer Emmys would be handed out during the telecast this year â until now.

"(CNN) -- The first complete gorilla genome has been mapped by scientists giving fresh insights into our own origins. Gorilla are the last of the genus of living great apes (humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans) to have their DNA decoded, offering new perspectives on their evolution and biology. ""The gorilla genome is important because it sheds light on the time when our ancestors diverged from our closest evolutionary cousins around six to 10 million years ago,"" says Aylwyn Scally, postdoctoral fellow at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge and lead author of the report. ""It also lets us explore the similarities and differences between our genes and those of gorilla, the largest living primate,"" he added. Read more: Mapping out a new era in brain research . A team of researchers examined more than 11,000 genes in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, looking for evolutionary clues. Initial findings have revealed that 15% of the gorilla genome is closer to human DNA than to our nearest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee. Researchers found that genes relating to sensory perception, hearing and brain development showed ""accelerated evolution"" in all three, but particularly in humans and gorillas. Having the entire length of the gorilla genome now means scientists can start to compare all the four great apes at every position on the genome, Scally says. It forms the baseline, he says, from which to move forwards and really explore why and when our genes and those of the great apes diverged. ""Did it happen quite quickly or was it something that gradually happened? At the moment we don't know,"" he said. ""It could have been some climatic change that separated humans in the east of Africa from chimpanzees in the forest -- that's an idea some have floated. If we can see some imprint of it in the genome that would be very, very useful information."" Scientists used the DNA of a female western lowland gorilla (called Kamilah) who resides at San Diego Zoo. In the wild, it is the most widespread species of gorilla, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), with a estimated population of 100-200,000 individuals. The majority are found in Cameroon, Central African Republic, west Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Angola. Its cousin, the eastern lowland gorilla, is less prevalent (fewer than 20,000 individuals) and can only be found in the rainforests of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, says WWF. The research is published in the science journal Nature.","Scientists have completed the DNA map of an African western lowland gorilla .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. plan to give new protection to polar bears was voted down Thursday at an international conference on endangered species. The American delegation at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, had sought a ban on the international trade of polar bear parts. The ban was opposed by Canada, home to the world's largest population of polar bears, as well as Norway and Greenland. It failed with 38 votes for, 42 against and 46 abstentions. ""Unfortunately, politics seem to have overtaken science,"" Dan Ashe, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the head of the U.S. delegation to the Bangkok conference, said in a statement. Polar bears have been listed under Appendix II of the CITES accords, which applies to species that are not currently threatened with extinction but may face it without restrictions on the trade of their body parts. The U.S. had proposed moving polar bears to Appendix I, which applies to species threatened with extinction and effectively bans trade in their body parts. The U.S. says that shrinking Arctic ice habitat, a product of a warming climate, puts polar bear populations in a precarious position. Two-thirds of the world's polar bear populations could face local extinctions within 45 years due to habitat loss, the National Resources Defense Council says. ""We are obviously disappointed that the CITES membership failed to give greater protection to polar bears by limiting permissible trade in polar bear pelts and other body parts,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Interior David J. Hayes said in a statement. ""We will continue to work with our partners to reduce the pressure that trade in polar bear parts puts on this iconic arctic species."" Conservation groups were outraged at the vote. ""It's a sad day for one of the world's most iconic creatures,"" Philip Mansbridge, CEO of Care for the Wild International, said in a statement. ""The world once again had a chance to take action to safeguard polar bear populations and failed,"" Jeff Flocken, North American regional director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said in a statement. ""Each passing year that this iconic species is not protected to the fullest, is another year closer to losing the polar bear forever."" Canada, which has 16,000 of the 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears left in the wild, says polar bear populations are not threatened and the animal does not meet the Appendix 1 criteria. ""The polar bear does not have a small wild population, it does not have a restricted area of distribution and no marked decline has been observed,"" Environment Canada says on its website. Canada also says polar bear parts coming from the country are taken in subsistence hunts, not by commercial operations. ""Harvest quotas are based on principles of conservation and Aboriginal subsistence, and are not market driven; an Appendix I listing would have no conservation benefit,"" the website says. But the U.S. argued that parts from polar bears are traded among 70 countries and that trade encourages kills that, coupled with the habitat loss, put stress on populations that will cause them to shrink. About 800 polar bears are killed by subsistence hunters each year, the U.S. says. Hides can sell for $2,000 to as much as $12,000, the FWS says. ""As polar bear hide prices have skyrocketed, more bears are being offered at auction, and hunting levels have increased,"" Ashe said in the statement. ""Prices for polar bear pelts have doubled over the last few years, and the signs are that trade is increasing. All the evidence says that it is simply unsustainable so it is foolish and negligible of us to allow it to continue when polar bear numbers are diminishing,"" Mansbridge said. ""It's terrible to think that we are postponing protecting such a magnificent animal so that hunters can continue to have their payday,"" he said. Hayes pledged that the U.S. wouldn't give up on trade restrictions. ""We will continue to work with our partners to reduce the pressure that trade in polar bear parts puts on this iconic arctic species, even as we take on the longer term threat that climate change poses to polar bears,"" he said.","U.S. wanted effective ban on trade of polar bear parts .

"(CNN) -- A major bridge between Detroit, and Windsor, Ontario, reopened early Tuesday after a bomb threat shut it down for more than five hours, police said. Authorities closed the Ambassador Bridge after a bomb threat was received around 7:15 p.m., according to Sgt. Eren Stephens, a Detroit police spokeswoman. It finally opened at 1 a.m. after bomb-sniffing dogs ""did not detect or find a bomb or suspicious device."" The U.S. Coast Guard stopped all maritime traffic below the bridge during the incident. The Ambassador Bridge is the busiest commercial international crossing in North America with more than 10,000 commercial vehicles crossing the bridge on a typical weekday, according to the bridge's official website. More than 25% of all commercial goods between Canada and the United States cross the Ambassador Bridge, the website said. The closing followed last Thursday's closing of the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, which also was prompted by a bomb threat. CNN's Rick Martin and Julia Greenberg contributed to this report .","Bomb threat closes the Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Under a gray, overcast sky, more than 1,000 protesters gathered Saturday in the Northern Ireland city of Belfast carrying large Union flags, some wrapped around their shoulders. The silent protest outside the city hall started out peaceful, the quiet only broken by the noise of helicopters circling overhead, conducting surveillance. A few hours later, Protestant rioters got into skirmishes with police. As the protesters passed a Catholic neighborhood, Protestants and Catholics threw bottles at each other. Many police were in the area, accompanied by dozens of heavy armored vehicles. The rally, followed by a march to East Belfast, is the latest in a wave of protests prompted by Belfast City Council's December 3 decision to limit the flying of the Union flag to 18 days per year. Protests were also held across Northern Ireland on Friday night. Most were peaceful, police said, though trouble broke out in places. One of the most serious incidents occurred at O'Neil's Road in Newtownabbey, where about 100 Protestant rioters -- many of them teenagers -- threw concrete blocks, paving slabs, bricks, planks of wood, gasoline bombs and Molotov cocktails at police. They targeted about 30 armored police vehicles and as many as 100 police officers clad in riot gear. In all, four police officers were hurt, with one requiring hospital treatment, and two people were arrested, police said. Amid rain and temperatures just above freezing, police brought in two water cannon, deploying one of them to push back the rioters. Temperatures are also expected to drop later Saturday as the protesters march to East Belfast, a trouble hotspot in recent weeks. The city was rocked by five consecutive nights of rioting at the start of the week. The leaders of the two main unionist political parties met Thursday to discuss concerns within the unionist community. The flag was raised Wednesday for the first time since the controversial vote to mark the birthday of Prince William's wife, Catherine. It was lowered at the end of the day. Northern Ireland authorities have accused loyalist extremists of exploiting the decision by Belfast officials to end the century-old tradition of flying the Union flag over City Hall 365 days a year. The British flag has long been a flashpoint between British loyalists and Irish nationalists, who want Northern Ireland to join the Irish republic. The Belfast City Council vote followed a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police injured. The majority of Ireland gained independence in 1921 following two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming Northern Ireland. Police: Extremist group 'orchestrating violence' in Belfast over Union Jack . In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant loyalists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as ""the Troubles."" The three decades of ensuing violence between loyalists and the IRA claimed more than 3,000 lives, most of them north of the border. While the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, also known as the Belfast Agreement, effectively ended the conflict, distrust remains between Catholics and Protestants. Under the terms of the accord, groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and members of Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the IRA, now work with pro-British politicians in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government. The Union flag is also commonly known as the Union Jack. Some say the term jack should only be used to refer to the flag when it's flown on a warship but according to the Flag Institute, which runs the UK flag registry, this is a relatively recent idea.","NEW: Skirmishes break out as crowds march to East Belfast .

"London (CNN) -- The body of Britain's first woman prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, has been taken to a chapel at Westminster, where it will lie overnight before a ceremonial funeral in London on Wednesday. A short service for those close to Thatcher will be held Tuesday in the Chapel of St. Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster. On Wednesday morning, the coffin will be carried by hearse to the Church of St. Clement Danes, the Royal Air Force Chapel, on the Strand. There, it will be transferred to a horse-drawn gun carriage to be taken to St. Paul's Cathedral, where more than 2,000 guests have been invited for the funeral. Members of the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force will line the two-mile route. The military held a rehearsal very early Monday morning to ensure that all goes smoothly on the day. Veterans of the Falklands War will bear Thatcher's coffin into the cathedral. Thatcher led the country into war in 1982, when British forces repelled an Argentinian invasion of the disputed Falkland Islands, known by Argentina as Las Malvinas. Before the service, a single half-muffled bell will toll for the arrival of the cortege, according to an order of service released in advance by St. Paul's Cathedral. Prime Minister David Cameron will give a reading at the funeral, in accordance with the wishes of Thatcher, who planned many elements of the service several years ago. Margaret Thatcher's granddaughter, Amanda, will also give a reading. As a mark of respect, the chimes of Big Ben, as the bell and clock tower by the Palace of Westminster are commonly known, will be silenced for the duration of the funeral proceedings, said John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons. ""I believe that there can be a profound dignity and deep respect expressed in, and through, silence and I am sure that the House will agree,"" he told lawmakers Monday. Roads and Underground stations near the cathedral will be closed and buses diverted as part of a large security operation led by London's Metropolitan Police. More than 4,000 officers will be on duty for the event, the Metropolitan Police said Tuesday. The threat of demonstrations by anarchists or anti-Thatcher activists, on top of fears that dissident Irish Republicans may try to act, have heightened security concerns. Thatcher was the target of a hotel bombing in Brighton by the Irish Republican Army in 1984. Commander Christine Jones said police had done all they could to mitigate potential risks and threats. ""We wish to deliver our operation in a way that protects public safety within the context of a broader security operation, as with many ceremonial London events,"" she said. ""The right to conduct peaceful protest is a tenet of our democracy; however, that right is qualified in that protest does not stray into acts of crime or violence or the instigation of crime or violence."" A small number of groups have been in touch about plans to demonstrate as the funeral takes place, Jones said. ""We are working with them, and would ask anyone who plans to protest to come forward and speak with us today,"" she said. Thatcher was prime minister for 11 years, from 1979 to 1990. After she was pushed from office after a leadership battle within her own party, she served in the House of Lords as Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven. A public book of condolences held at London's City Hall will close Tuesday afternoon.

"Beijing (CNN) -- For the second time in as many days, an unspecified threat forced a Chinese airline to divert a flight, raising public concern about aviation safety in one of the world's fastest-growing air travel markets. A Shenzhen Airlines flight en route to southern boomtown Shenzhen from Xiangyang -- a medium-sized city in central Hubei Province -- was diverted Thursday night to the provincial capital, Wuhan, shortly after takeoff, the airline said. ""At 10:29 p.m. on August 30, 2012, flight ZH 9706 received threatening information after takeoff,"" the airline said in a short statement posted online. ""To ensure safety, this airline diverted the flight immediately and the plane landed safety at Wuhan Tianhe International Airport at 11:22 p.m. Police have been called in to investigate."" Read more: Threats prompt Air China turnaround . The airline did not reveal the nature of the threat or the number of passengers and crew members on board. The aircraft type is listed as an Airbus A320 -- which typically seats 150 passengers in a two-class configuration -- in its timetable. An anonymous call containing a threatening message prompted the diversion, the Wuhan airport authority disclosed in a statement released online. State media reported that passengers stayed in Wuhan overnight and would travel to their destination on a new flight Friday. Retweeting the airline statement, many users on Chinese social media sites expressed rising anxiety about flying after two successive incidents and demanded more information from the airlines and authorities. On Wednesday, an unspecified threat forced New York-bound Air China flight CA 981 to return to Beijing seven hours after takeoff, the Chinese flag carrier said. Police found nothing suspicious in their investigation of the plane, the airport authority said in statements posted online. State media also quoted police as saying that the initial warning of the threat came from U.S. authorities, who warned China that dangerous goods that may harm the plane and passengers were on board. The flight took off again at 12:31 a.m. Thursday after a change of crew and arrived in New York at 12:38 a.m. the same day, according to the airline's website. Beijing-based Air China was also tight-lipped about the nature of the threat and other details. The aircraft involved, a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, seats up to 344 passengers in the carrier's configuration. Messages and photos posted on Chinese social media sites Wednesday night showed passengers and their luggage being rescreened at the Beijing airport upon landing. One passenger on CA 981, whose online handle is Kejiwaijiao, said he noticed something was wrong when the flight map on board indicated the plane was headed back to Beijing. When he inquired, he said, flight attendants told him it was a map display error. ""The captain notified us (of the reason) after we safely landed,"" he wrote on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. Another passenger, whose Weibo name is Nataliebu, said crew members only told passengers to buckle up and sit tight due to strong air turbulence. On June 29, passengers and crew members thwarted a hijack attempt on a short-haul flight within the far western Chinese province of Xinjiang. Authorities said six ethnic Uyghur men violently tried to take control of the plane before being subdued. The plane returned to its point of origin safely. Security is usually tight throughout Beijing Capital International Airport, the world's second-busiest air hub after Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta. More than 78 million passengers passed through the Beijing airport's three terminals last year.","A Shenzhen Airlines flight was diverted after a threat, the airline said .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel will not open a criminal investigation into the airstrike that killed 10 members of a Palestinian family and two of their neighbors during the November 2012 war with Gaza. Israel's Military Advocate General (MAG) revealed its decision last week in a report that examined allegations of misconduct during Operation Pillar of Defence. The report looked into 80 incidents during the eight days of intense fighting that included Israeli air strikes and Palestinian rocket launches. The independent advocate general said it needed more information on 15 cases, but found no basis for a criminal investigation in the other 65 incidents -- including the strike that killed 10 members of the Al-Dalou family. On November 18, the Al-Dalou family -- including five women and four small children -- was inside their three-story home when the Israeli air force dropped a bomb that obliterated the dwelling. The explosion also heavily damaged two neighboring houses, killing two other people. Neighbors tried desperately to pull people out of the rubble alive but none survived. The Military Advocate General report called the deaths ""regrettable"" but said the military took ""various precautions to reduce the possibility of collateral damage"" and ""the incident did not raise suspicion"" of a criminal offense. During the conflict, the Israeli military changed its story several times as to who the intended target in the home was. The day of the strike, CNN was told the target was Yahia Rabia, who the military said was the head of Hamas' rocket unit. He was not among the dead. Human Rights Watch said the military then changed its story, saying it was targeting Mohmmad Al-Dalou, who did live in the home, identifying him as a Hamas militant. Jamal Al-Dalou denied the allegation about his now-deceased son. But in the days and weeks after the incident, Human Rights Watch said it found evidence on the ground and on the Internet that lead the group to believe Mohammad Al-Dalou was a low-level member of Hamas' armed wing and therefore a legitimate target. But the rights group still condemned the way in which Israel went about trying to kill him. ""Under the laws of war, that person would be a legitimate target. The Israeli strike blew up an entire house, severely damaged the neighboring houses and killed 12 people -- to us that looks very disproportionate. The level of damage to civilians and civilian infrastructure was not adequately related to an attack on one militant,"" Human Rights Watch Senior Researcher Bill Van Esveld said shortly after the group put out its own report on the November war. In an unspecified number of cases, however, the Military Advocate General report did admit mistakes were made that lead to civilian deaths. ""There is indeed basis for the claim that as a result of IDF attacks, uninvolved civilians were killed or injured, or civilian property damaged, usually as unintended damage resulting from an attack against military targets or alternatively from operations errors where civilians were mistakenly identified as terrorist operatives,"" the report said. The Palestinian Center for Human Rights, one of the non-profit groups that sent evidence and filed complaints about some of the deadly strikes, attacked the findings of the report. ""...PCHR believes that Israel's legal system is used as a smokescreen, to provide an illusion of investigative rigor, while in fact providing systematic cover for widespread violations of international law,"" that group said in a statement. The report is also being condemned by Human Rights Watch as ""insufficient"" and at times ""based on a mistaken interpretation of the laws of war."" ""Just saying that the fatal consequences of an attack were unintended or a mistake does not, of course, make the attack lawful,"" Van Esveld said in an e-mail to CNN. Jamal Al-Dalou, the father and grandfather who lost almost all of his immediate family in the November 18 airstrike, including four grandchildren under the age of 8, told CNN the incident has left him feeling like he, too, is dead. ""I call on everyone and the world whether American or British or an Arab or Jew or Christian. I call for the free world and the ones who have democracy and ethics to stand with me and support me and bring the Israeli government to justice for what they have done to me. They have massacred my entire family,"" he said. Israel's military said it conducted some 1,500 strikes during the November incursion in Gaza and took many precautions to avoid killing civilians. In videos shown to CNN, the military illustrated how it dropped leaflets, aborted many missions if civilians were in the line of fire, and used high-precision weapons with pinpoint accuracy to avoid collateral damage. ""Any loss of human life is a tragedy. And as we proved in Operation Pillar of Defence, we are putting great effort in order to reduce the amount of civilian casualties in the state of conflict,"" Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. But Palestinians scoff at Israel's assertion, saying if that is true, why were so many civilians killed? According to a United Nations report, at least 168 Palestinians were killed by Israel during the conflict -- 101 of them civilians, including 33 children and 13 women. Israel disputes that breakdown of the numbers, telling CNN it killed at least 100 ""terrorists"" during the war. Six Israelis, including four civilians, were killed by rockets fired by armed groups in Gaza during the conflict. The Israeli MAG report also said the son of a BBC journalist who died in the fighting was likely killed by a Palestinian rocket and not Israeli fire, as had been widely reported. The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights also looked into that case and last month reached the same conclusion. Human Rights Watch accused Israel of war crimes in the fighting and lodged the same charge against Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza for indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli population centers. Both governments have denied the charges. TIMELINE: Israel-Gaza conflict . READ MORE: Q&A: Gaza strikes could be beginning of ground attack .

"(CNN) -- The ""Abu Qatada"" affair has set off a firestorm of debate in Britain and beyond -- about what constitutes support for terrorism, about detention without trial, deportation and, yet again, about the vexatious issue of Britain's relationship with Europe. Abu Qatada is a militant Palestinian preacher who had been held in high-security jails in the United Kingdom for a total of six years. Last week, an immigration tribunal granted him bail, despite the government's objections. He was released Monday. Abu Qatada came to the U.K. in 1993 with his wife and three children and was granted refugee status because he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities. But that was before his militant preaching became an issue and before al Qaeda became public enemy No. 1. Britain has historically generous criteria for granting political asylum, but the consensus now on the left and the right is that the 51-year-old preacher should not have qualified. By the time he arrived in Britain from Peshawar in Pakistan, Abu Qatada's hardline Salafist views were well formed. Writing in The New Yorker in 2006, Lawrence Wright quotes a Saudi journalist who had met Abu Qatada in the early 1990s. Jamal Khashoggi said ""Abu Qatada had struck him as far more radical than Osama bin Laden... influenced by Salafism, the puritanical, fundamentalist strain of Islam."" As a preacher in London mosques, Abu Qatada soon gained a militant following. In 1999, he allegedly sought to justify the killing of Jews, including children, and attacking Americans. Three days after 9/11, Abu Qatada preached that the attacks were part of a global struggle between Christianity and Islam, and were a response to America's unjust policies. In another sermon, he sought to justify the killing by a Muslim of a ""non-believer"" for the sake of Islam. At the same time, Abu Qatada ran a magazine called Al Ansar, which supported jihadists in Algeria at a time when the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria was waging a brutal campaign of massacres and assassinations. His rhetoric attracted a growing following in mosques and online among young militants, but no evidence has been produced in a British court to suggest he was involved with specific al Qaeda conspiracies. A Spanish government indictment sought to show that Abu Qatada did go beyond sermons. It alleged that an al Qaeda member, Barakat Yarkas, made more than 20 trips from Spain to Britain between 1995 and 2000, bringing Abu Qatada funds raised for jihad. When London police raided Abu Qatada's home early in 2001, they found $250,000 in cash under his bed. Abu Qatada maintained it was to build a mosque, but some of the money was said to have been marked for the Chechen mujahideen -- at that point a cause celebre among jihadists. Abu Qatada was detained in the U.K. in 2002 under sweeping anti-terror legislation enacted after 9/11 -- along with dozens of other Islamist militants. Videos of his preaching were found in a Hamburg, Germany, apartment used by some of those involved in the 9/11 attacks, including ringleader Mohammad Atta. British and other intelligence agencies asserted he had close ties to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Counter-terrorism sources also maintained he was a big influence on Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian who would emerge as al Qaeda's leader in Iraq. Both had been convicted of involvement in a terror plot in Jordan in 2000, and according to one al Qaeda operative, it was Abu Qatada who had introduced al-Zarqawi to the al Qaeda leadership. Would-be shoe-bomber Richard Reid was also an admirer. In denying Abu Qatada's release from jail in 2004, a judge said, ""We have no doubt that his beliefs are extreme and are indeed a perversion of Islam for the purposes of encouraging violence against non-Muslims and Muslims who are, or have been, supportive of Americans."" In arguing for his continued detention the following year, the British government summarized his role, saying ""He provides advice which gives religious legitimacy to those who wish to further the aims of extreme Islamism and to engage in terrorist attacks, including suicide bombings."" His place in jihad was not unlike that of militant preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in Yemen last year. After Britain's highest court struck down detention without trial, Abu Qatada remained behind bars as the British government began proceedings to deport him to Jordan. He'd already been convicted there in absentia of involvement in two terrorist attacks in 1998, as well as the 2000 plot. Abu Qatada appealed, saying deportation would put him at risk of torture and lengthy pre-trial detention. His case moved gradually up the ladder of British justice but was eventually dismissed by the House of Lords, which found that ""the risk that evidence obtained by torture would be used in the criminal proceedings in Jordan would not amount to a flagrant denial of justice."" Enter the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions are binding in U.K. cases. Last month, the court decided that Abu Qatada could not be deported to Jordan because there was ""a real risk of the admission of evidence obtained by torture at his retrial."" British Prime Minister David Cameron reacted angrily to the decision, telling the House of Commons last week: ""It is not acceptable that we end up with a situation you have someone in your country that threatens to do you harm that you cannot try, you cannot detain and you cannot deport."" It's a red meat issue to Conservative politicians in Britain. Traditionally hostile to Europe's influence in Britain's affairs, they believe the U.K. should not be bound by the court's decision. Ministers are conscious that emotions are running high. Home Secretary Theresa May told Parliament: ""The right place for a terrorist is a prison cell; the right place for a foreign terrorist is a foreign prison cell far away from Britain."" But as one popular tweet puts it: ""Abu Qatada has not even been convicted of a parking offense in Britain."" And that's for two reasons. Authorities are unwilling to produce evidence in open court that might prove some operational or direct link to terrorism for fear of compromising intelligence sources. And it is notoriously difficult to prove a crime has been committed by the use of words that influence others' actions. As Britain's Home Office admitted in 2005: ""We accept that Qatada encouraged and raised funds for individuals to go to Afghanistan; he may not have gone further as an organiser."" While the U.K. authorities try to negotiate assurances from Jordan that would allow his deportation, Abu Qatada is on bail, but under strict conditions. He is electronically tagged, confined to his home for 22 hours a day, banned from using the Internet or a cell phone, banned from attending any mosque or publishing any statement, banned from receiving visitors without permission -- and those are just a few of the conditions. For now, Abu Qatada's ability to invigorate the hearts of jihadists is very limited.","Abu Qatada's hardline views were formed before he entered Britain .

"(CNN) -- The Bahrain Grand Prix is threatening to overshadow the Formula One season for a third year running as the kingdom's government and leading human rights organisations dispute the recent arrests of up to 70 people. In 2012 days of anti-government protests failed to halt the Bahrain GP which went ahead even as nearby streets were blocked with burning tires and trash. Protests in Bahrain started in February 2011 spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. But demonstrations in Bahrain failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown by authorities in the island state. The crackdown was backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates under the banner of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The Bahrain Center for Human Rights told CNN Arabic that 20 people from the Dar Klaib and Shahrakan villages -- both near the Bahrain International Circuit -- had been arrested, with another 50 arrested from the Aldeir and Samaheij villages near to the airport. The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights described the government arrests as ""attacks carried out by the security authorities"", with BRAVO (The Bahrain Rehabilitation and Anti-violence Organization) president Nada Deif specifically linking them to the April 19 GP. ""Most of the detainees are activists in the fields of journalism documenting and photography,"" said Deif. ""This latest crackdown and the way it's being carried out raises new questions about the Bahraini authorities' commitment to reform,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch (HRW) on the organisation's website, which reported police have conducted up to 30 raids in on towns close to the F1 circuit and the roads leading to the capital, Manama. ""These raids and detentions suggest that officials are more concerned with getting activists out of circulation for the F1 race than with addressing the legitimate grievances that have led so many Bahrainis to take to the streets."" However, the Bahrain government insisted the arrests were not linked to the GP. ""The recent arrests came after a terrorist assault on the Foreign Ministry building using Molotov bombs,"" the Bahraini communication minister and government spokeswoman Samirah Rajab told CNN Arabic. ""Their arrest came under the rule of law and they were sent to Public Prosecution office ahead of their trial. It has nothing to do with the F1 race. ""It's the state responsibility to protect its people along with those who are living in the county and impose security. Also the security forces implement law when arresting someone and don't raid houses unless it has an order from the court of public prosecutor. ""The comments written by HRW are at best secondhand observations made without evidence. HRW is not on the ground in Bahrain to make such comments without verifying its source."" Last year opposition calls for large protests had raised fears the Bahrain GP would have to be canceled for a second year in a row and pose a threat to F1 crews, workers, and fans. Anti-government protesters had called the race a publicity stunt by the country's rulers to make the nation appear more unified. F1 is the world's most popular motor sport, and races have a TV audience of more than 500 million, though the scenes last year in Bahrain were viewed as a public relations disaster for both the sport and the country's authorities. In 2011 the Grand Prix was canceled completely after drivers including former F1 star Damon Hill raised concerns following the death of at least 35 demonstrators as the government called in Saudi Arabian-led forces to help stamp out unrest. Canceling the race in 2011 cost Bahrain an estimated $480 to $800 million in potential investments. Bahrain's Sunni-ruled government crushed the Shiite protests, though the opposition has continued to demand political reform in protests and, occasionally, clashes with authorities. Earlier this week Hill called on the F1's ruling body the FIA and its president Jean Todt to come up with a definitive position on this year's race. ""The vast majority of people in the sport would like to say we don't want to come here to make life worse for people,"" Hill, who now works as a motorsport television pundit, was quoted as telling a number of British newspapers after a security briefing in Westminster in London. ""We would like you to enjoy F1. It has lots of positive things to offer. But please don't, on our behalf, round people up and brutalize them. I don't see that being political. It's more ethical than political."" Neither the FIA nor Todt were immediately available for comment. ""The messages I'm getting from various people in the opposition -- and there have been pretty regular street protest over the past three weeks -- is that the F1 race will be more of a focus than it was last year,"" British MP Richard Burden, who chairs parliamentary groups on motorsport and who was outspoken against last year's race taking place, was quoted as telling the Guardian newspaper: . ""That's what they anticipate happening. If anything happens it will be a tragedy for all concerned. ""I hope in the next few days that people will understand that words do have an impact."" Bahrain plays a key strategic role in the Middle East and is home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet headquarters.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- What started off as an exciting boat trip to celebrate China's National Day in Hong Kong quickly turned into a nightmare for more than 100 passengers on board. Local power company Hong Kong Electric had been ferrying a group of its employees and their families to watch an evening fireworks display in the city's Victoria Harbor when it collided with a ferry heading from Hong Kong Island to Lamma, one of 200 outlying islands in the territory. Passengers on board the stricken vessel described how quickly the water rushed in. ""First it was up to here and then here. The water rose so quickly. We thought we were going to die for sure,"" one woman, who declined to be named, told CNN affiliate i-Cable. Read more: Hong Kong's worst ferry disaster in decades . ""Everyone was underwater. The boat overturned; everything came crashing down; the chair slid down."" Another woman recounted her terrifying ordeal trying to free herself from her seat as the boat sank. ""My leg was stuck, and I couldn't get it out. I thought I wouldn't be able to get it out, and I was going to die,"" she said. ""The water was suffocating me. My friend tugged with all her might and got my leg out. I was wearing a life jacket, so I floated up to the surface. I had swallowed a lot of water. I really thought I was going to die. Thinking about all those at the bottom who were stuck, they're not here anymore."" A male passenger described the chaos as the boat rolled violently. ""I opened the window and pushed a child out. I put a life jacket on him and pushed him out first,"" he told i-Cable. ""At the time, it was very chaotic. The boat was completely standing straight up in the water. It was chaotic. All the tables and chairs were everywhere. It was like a slide; everything was sliding down."" The shocked survivor admitted he didn't know where his wife was. Rescue services, quickly on the scene with boats and helicopters, managed to pluck more than 100 people from the water, though 28 were declared dead on the scene, while another nine died in hospital. The other vessel involved -- a regular passenger ferry -- managed to limp to the safety of the pier just a few hundred meters away on Lamma, southwest of Hong Kong Island. Witnesses on board the ferry described the moment the two vessels collided. ""We suddenly heard a loud noise.

"(CNN) -- He was born in the year of the Tiger -- and China's Guan Tianlang will be hoping to mix it with a certain Mr Woods once again after rewriting the history books at Augusta. While most teenagers take on Woods on their game consoles, China's Guan was busy making history Friday after becoming the youngest ever player to make the cut at a major championship. The 14-year-old overcame a controversial slow play penalty to qualify for the weekend's action after carding a three-over 75 to leave him four-over for the tournament. At 14 years and five months, Guan breaks the record held by Italy's Matteo Manassero, who made history at the British Open at the age of 16 years and two months. Guan wasn't even born when Woods became the youngest ever player to win the Masters at the age of 21 back in 1997, but the two shared a practice round earlier this week with the teenager looking far from overawed. He kept his cool on a difficult day where his participation in the final two rounds hung by a thread, after he was penalized on the 17th hole following a failure to heed the warnings given by referee John Paramor. Guan is the first player to be punished for slow play in a major since France's Gregory Bourdy at the 2010 PGA Championship . Leader Jason Day, who finished on six-under, could have ended the youngster's hopes had he managed to gain one more shot. But the Australian finished with a round of 68 to finish one clear of Fred Couples and fellow countryman Mark Leishman. ""I respect the decision they make,"" Guan told reporters following his round. "" I just changed my routine before the Masters, and the routine is good, but I think today is pretty hard because if you're timed only 40 seconds, it's pretty hard because you need to make the decision. The wind switched a lot. But that's for everybody."" Guan's problems began on the 13th where he was given a warning following his second shot, before he was hit with a one-shot penalty on the 17th. The decision split players and fans alike with two-time winner Ben Crenshaw coming to the youngster's defense. ""This isn't going to end up pretty, I don't think,"" Crenshaw told reporters. ""I'm sick for him. He's 14 years old ... when you get the wind blowing out here, believe me, you're going to change your mind a lot. ""I'm sorry, I'm a player. It is not easy to get around this golf course the way it's set up for two days."" England's Lee Westwood, who finished three shots off the lead on three-under, also backed Guan. ""He's a youngster just learning the game and it's his first professional tournament, it seems a little bit harsh to me,"" Westwood told reporters. ""He probably learned to play slowly after watching us professional golfers on TV, so why should we be surprised?"" While there was a great deal of sympathy for the talented teenager, 1992 champion Couples says the decision was the correct one. ""The soft-coated answer would be I feel bad, but I also feel like they just don't go around handing out one-shot penalties here,"" he told reporters. ""I don't even know of anyone who has ever got one. ""It feels hard to give a 14-year-old a penalty, but he's in the field. He beat a lot of guys yesterday, whatever the age he is."" At the top of the leaderboard, Day will hope to finally end Australia's wait for a Masters Champion. The 25-year-old finished second in 2011 but produced a sublime round of 68 to ensure his place at the top of the leaderboard. Tiger Woods had looked set to finish towards the top only for an outrageous piece of misfortune to cost him at the 15th. The World No.1 hit his third shot onto the par-five 15th only for it to hit the stick and rebound into the pond. Woods finished on three-under alongside the likes of Jason Dufner, Justin Rose and Australia's Adam Scott amongst others. Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy will have title aspirations of his own after hitting a two-under 70 to leave him right in the mix. The 23-year-old, ranked second in the world, carded a level-par round of 72 on Thursday but produced a much improved performance during his second round. ""I made a lot of good putts for pars on the front nine,"" he told reporters. ""I mean I didn't play my best for the first few holes and the eighth hole (eagle) really got me going, really kick started me. ""Then I started to hit some really good quality shots. I took advantage of a couple of easier holes on the back nine, 13, 14. ""Anything under par today was going to be a good score and I stayed patient out there when I needed to and it was a good day. ""I'm comfortable with my game, I'm happy with this position going into the weekend,"" he said. Defending champion Bubba Watson made the cut by the skin of his teeth after carding a one-over 73. Watson is five-over for the tournament and in a tie for 55th place. Several big names missed the cut including Ian Poulter, Louis Oosthuizen, Graeme McDowell and three-time major winner Padraig Harrington.","China's Tianlang Guan, 14, becomes youngest player to make cut at a major .

"(TIME.com) -- The month in which babies are born can affect how their immune systems develop, and even how vulnerable they are to autoimmune diseases. Scientists studying the neurological disorder multiple sclerosis, in which the body's own immune cells destroy the protective coating around nerves and can lead to paralysis and loss of other functions, have long been puzzled by the ""birth month effect."" Many patients with MS are born in the spring, and rates of the disease are lowest for those born in November. Some have speculated that insufficient levels of vitamin D, which the skin produces when exposed to sunlight, on the mom's part could play a role, since babies born in May are gestated during the colder, darker months, while winter babies are in utero during the spring and summer. Now a study published in JAMA Neurology shows that this hunch may be correct, and suggests a mechanism for how the vitamin might be driving immune system development. TIME.com: Vitamin D not recommended post-menopause . Researchers in the UK studied 50 babies born in London in May and 50 babies born in November between 2009 and 2010. They sampled blood from the newborns' umbilical chords and recorded levels of vitamin D and a specific type of immune cell known as autoreactive T-cells. T-cells are the white blood cells that battle pathogens like bacteria and viruses, but autoreactive T-cells are aberrant versions that mistake the body's own cells as foreign and attack them as they would an unwanted infection. TIME.com: Multiple Sclerosis drug may not slow disease . The researchers found that babies born in May had vitamin D levels that were 20% lower than those in babies born in November, and almost double the amount of autoreactive T-cells. They speculate that vitamin D may be important in some way in educating T cells about how to recognize self cells; this occurs in the thymus, and errors in the training could lead to higher levels of the destructive T cells. The connection between vitamin D and immune disorders first emerged from population studies that showed people who lived further away from the equator, in places with less sunlight, were at higher risk of developing MS. But the researchers caution that their results still don't suggest that lower levels of the vitamin cause autoimmune disorders like MS. So it's not clear yet whether supplements of vitamin D could help to lower rates of the disease Ã¢â¬â especially for those conceived in July and born in May. In fact, experts continue to debate how much vitamin D is appropriate for otherwise healthy people when it comes to preventing disease, since studies on the subject are conflicting. The Institute of Medicine currently recommends that adults get about 600 IU daily. TIME.com: After Jack Osbourne's MS diagnosis . More research is needed to figure out whether pregnant women might need to take more vitamin D in order to strengthen their babies' immune systems, but doctors now have a better understanding of what birth months have to do with how the immune system develops.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Protests broke out Friday throughout Northern Ireland against a decision by Belfast City Council members to stop flying the Union flag year-round. ""Most of the protests were peaceful, although disruption was caused to the road network in Belfast and across the country,"" police said in a statement. One of the most serious incidents occurred at O'Neil's Road in Newtownabbey, where about 100 Protestant rioters -- many of them teenagers -- threw concrete blocks, paving slabs, bricks, planks of wood, gasoline bombs and Molotov cocktails at police. They targeted about 30 armored police vehicles and as many as 100 police officers clad in riot gear. At least one officer appeared injured. His head bowed, the officer was helped away by comrades. Amid rain and temperatures just above freezing, police brought in two water cannon, deploying one of them to push back the rioters. Police were trying to gain control of a main highway. In pictures: Flag protests in Northern Ireland . In all, four police officers were hurt, with one requiring hospital treatment, and two people were arrested, police said. Thirty-three gasoline bombs were thrown at police during the demonstrations, after which all the roads were reopened. Read more: Clinton urges calm amid tensions in Northern Ireland . The eruptions occurred after two nights of calm that followed five consecutive nights of rioting. Belfast has been at the center of a wave of protests prompted by the City Council's December 3 decision to limit the flying of the flag to 18 days per year. The disorder has resulted in more than 100 arrests and left 66 officers injured. The flag was raised Wednesday for the first time since the controversial vote to mark the birthday of Prince William's wife, Catherine. It was lowered at the end of the day. The leaders of the two main unionist political parties met Thursday to discuss concerns within the unionist community. Read more: Political forum aims to stem N.Ireland violence . Northern Ireland authorities have accused loyalist extremists of exploiting the decision by Belfast officials to end the century-old tradition of flying the Union flag over City Hall 365 days a year. The British flag has long been a flashpoint between British loyalists and Irish nationalists, who want Northern Ireland to join the Irish republic. The Belfast City Council vote followed a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police injured. The majority of Ireland gained independence in 1921 following two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming Northern Ireland. Police: Extremist group 'orchestrating violence' in Belfast over Union Jack . In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant loyalists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as ""the Troubles."" The three decades of ensuing violence between loyalists and the IRA claimed more than 3,000 lives, most of them north of the border. While the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, also known as the Belfast Agreement, effectively ended the conflict, distrust remains between Catholics and Protestants. Under the terms of the accord, groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and members of Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the IRA, now work with pro-British politicians in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London and Nic Robertson and Peter Taggart reported in Belfast.","NEW: Four police officers are hurt, one is hospitalized .

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton is front-page news again. What did she do to warrant this treatment? Nothing. The Page 1 splash in The New York Times the other day was a nicely executed compilation of ... sheer speculation. That is, the same sort of chatter that everyone in the political/media world has engaged in since the day after Barack Obama's re-election. And it immediately launched dozens of cable news segments to rehash the rehash. What explains this? Whatever happened to having to generate a little news, or even pseudo-news, to warrant some coverage? Watch: Did NBC control damage with Jay Leno/Jimmy Fallon spoof? The answers, in no particular order: . -- It's Hillary. Which means clicks and ratings. -- Things are slowww right now. -- Covering the legislative drip-drip-drip over immigration and gun control is boring; handicapping the 2016 race is easy, fun and nonfattening. -- It's another excuse to write about Bill. -- The media love Hillary and are not-so-subtly rooting for her to run. First woman president and all that. Watch: What? Princeton grad urges female students to find husbands . Now there's no denying the obvious: Clinton would be a prohibitive front-runner. Most Democrats hope she'll make a White House run. She would probably be a strong general-election contender, given the Republican Party's disarray, especially after honing her foreign-policy chops as secretary of state. So how did the Times story advance the dialogue? Let's see: . -- Clinton hasn't made up her mind. -- Her spokesman says she hasn't made up her mind. Friends say she's ambivalent. -- Lots of donors would give her money if she ran. -- Other Democrats are hamstrung, waiting to see what she'll do. -- She will be 69 when the next election rolls around. -- She hasn't issued a Shermanesque statement against running. (See?!) -- Oh, and she has a half-dozen staffers working for her at a transition office while she gets ready to give big-money speeches. Watch: Not rocket science -- New York Times defends sexist obit . The coverage seems a bit myopic to me. Hillary Clinton is incredibly popular right now in part because she's had diplomatic immunity for the past four years. Except for the aftermath of the fatal attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya -- and the trumped-up fiction about her suffering from ""Benghazi flu"" -- she has managed to stay out of politics during her tenure at Foggy Bottom. Now that Clinton is a private citizen, she can steer clear of the crossfire for a couple of years while building her brand and her bank account. The moment she lets it be known that she's running, if she does, the Republican attack machine and conservative media complex will begin beating her up. That reminds me of a reality that seems to have faded into the ether. Clinton royally botched her campaign last time around. She blew a 30-point lead to a freshman senator, allowed massive staff infighting and failed to fully compete in the caucus states. That doesn't mean she won't learn from her mistakes, but it's hardly an insignificant fact. Watch: Why Barbara Walters will be missed when she retires . When Clinton, barely out of the Cabinet, made a video endorsing same-sex marriage, it was a clear sign that she's at least keeping her options open for 2016. But there was barely a skeptical note in the press: Why was she changing her stance now, when it was politically safe for a Democrat, from 2008, when such a move would have been courageous? I wouldn't bet a ton of money against Clinton being the next Democratic nominee, but the 33 months between now and the Iowa caucuses is a political lifetime. Who would have picked Obama to win in April of 2005? A Times story from that month had Newt Gingrich predicting that Clinton would be the nominee and ""very formidable."" And any Hillary health problems, of course, could scramble the equation. The latest New York Times piece is just the beginning. The political press will plow this ground again and again until the former first lady makes up her mind. But keep in mind that the media don't get to conduct a coronation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: Hillary Clinton getting media coverage without generating any real news .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- A Tibetan man set himself on fire in front of a famous Buddhist shrine in the Nepalese capital on Wednesday, police said, becoming the latest Tibetan to adopt this harrowing form of protest over Chinese rule. Read more: The politics of Tibetan self-immolations . The man, believed to be in his early 20s, came out of a nearby restaurant doused in petrol and set himself alight in front of the revered Boudhanath Stupa in Kathmandu, said Keshav Adhikari, a police spokesman. ""The whole of his body is burnt,"" Adhikari said, adding that the Tibetan was not able to communicate when he was taken to a hospital for treatment. Authorities are still trying to identify the man. Read more: China sentences 2 Tibetans over self-immolations . Self-immolation has become a dramatic and desperate form of protest in recent years for ethnic Tibetans unhappy with Chinese rule. Tibetan advocacy groups say the number of self-immolations by Tibetans inside China since February 2009 stood at 99 at the end of January. Several others have set themselves on fire in other countries, including India. Opinion: Tibetans reject Chinese rule with one voice . Self-immolation began as a form of protest among Tibetans in China in February 2009, when a young monk set himself ablaze. In March 2011, another young monk followed in his footsteps, becoming the first to die. Scores of others have since followed suit. Independently verifying the reported self-immolations inside China is often difficult because of restrictions on reporting from the restive areas and the reluctance of local officials to comment on the accounts provided by foreign-based Tibetan advocacy groups. Beijing has taken a tough line on the protesters and their associates, accusing the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, of fomenting unrest inside Chinese borders. Read more: How many more Tibetans will sacrifice themselves? Last month, a court in southwestern China gave heavy sentences to two ethnic Tibetans convicted of murder for ""inciting"" people to set themselves of fire. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising, has long denied China's assertion that he's seeking Tibetan independence. He says he wants only enough autonomy to protect their traditional Buddhist culture. Beijing rejects accusations of oppression, saying that under its rule, living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people.

"CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (Reuters) -- The U.S. space agency NASA on Thursday confirmed it had discovered the apparent sabotage of a noncritical component of the international space station due to be carried up by the space shuttle Endeavour. It launched an investigation after finding cut wires in a piece of computer equipment intended to transfer data from station sensors to the ground, the agency said. NASA says it discovered the apparent sabotage of a noncritical component of the international space station. NASA said it will try to launch Endeavour on August 7 for the spacecraft's first mission in nearly five years. Endeavour, fresh from a complete overhaul and the last of NASA's three remaining shuttles to return to flight following the 2003 Columbia disaster, is due to carry out a construction mission to the $100-billion space station. It will be NASA's second shuttle flight of the year. Endeavour was almost totally rebuilt during its overhaul and was like a new space shuttle, shuttle program manager Wayne Hale told reporters at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where the launch will take place. ""It's like driving a new car off the showroom floor,"" Hale said. Endeavour's seven crew members include teacher-astronaut Barbara Morgan, who trained 22 years ago as the backup to teacher-in-space Christa McAuliffe, one of the astronauts who died when Challenger blew up at liftoff in January 1986. Endeavour will be carrying a new support beam for the half-finished space station and a replacement gyroscope needed to help the outpost maintain its position in space. Among the shuttle's upgrades is a new system that will enable the spacecraft to tap into the station's electrical system and stay longer at the outpost. If the power transfer system works properly, NASA plans to extend Endeavour's mission from 11 to 14 days. That will allow time for the crew to finish extra work preparing the orbital outpost for the arrival later this year and next year of laboratories built by Europe and Japan. It also will carry a module loaded with about 5,000 pounds of equipment and supplies for the station crew. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(Financial Times) -- Irish homeowners applying for debt writedowns will have to give up satellite television, foreign holidays and private school educations for their children under a strict new insolvency law introduced to tackle the country's debt crisis. On Thursday Ireland's Insolvency Service set out monthly spending limits for people seeking debt deals from their creditors, highlighting the impact austerity is having on Irish spending habits. A single person will be allowed just Ã¢âÂ¬247.04 a month for food, Ã¢âÂ¬57.31 for heating and Ã¢âÂ¬125.97 for ""social inclusion and participation"", an expenses category that includes tickets for sporting events and the cinema. ""A reasonable standard of living does not mean a person should live at luxury level, said Lorcan O'Connor, director of the newly established Insolvency Service of Ireland. ""But nor does it mean that people should be punished and live only at subsistence level,"" In most cases, people seeking debt deals will also have to give up private health insurance and their cars, although they will be able to keep their vehicles if they do not have access to public transportion. The guidelines mark Ireland's first attempt to quantify acceptable living standards when people declare bankruptcy or reach an insolvency arrangement with creditors under its new insolvency regime. Banks will also use the guidelines as they begin restructuring tens of thousands of home loans over coming months. Stubbornly high unemployment and falling wages, caused by a five-year economic crisis, have pushed almost one in four Irish mortgage holders to the brink. Some 120,000 Irish mortgages are in arrears of 90 days or more. A further 100,000 loans have been restructured with short-term fixes. Unlike many other EU countries, including the UK, Dublin has included secured mortgage debt within its insolvency regime, in an effort to encourage banks to negotiate long-term restructuring deals with debtors. Under Engish insolvency law, which is less proscriptive than Ireland's new guidelines, ""reasonable"" day-to-day expenses for bankrupts include holidays, mobile phones and video rentals. While gym memberships, private health care, gambling, cigarettes and alcohol are considered unreasonable, English debtors do not face monthly cash limits. Alan Shatter, Ireland's minister for justice, warned banks that they could face heavier losses if they did not agree debt deals with struggling mortgage holders, who might instead choose to declare bankruptcy. House prices have halved since the Ireland's property market peaked in 2007, leaving an estimated 400,000 mortgage holders with negative equity. Unlike in some US states, mortgage holders cannot escape debt obligations by surrendering their property to the bank. Irish banks that sell repossessed properties at a loss can pursue homeowners for the difference. Last month Dublin ordered banks to provide long-term solutions to struggling mortgage holders, prompting some concerns about the danger of ""moral hazard"". ""We will do write-offs. It is absolutely part of the give-and-take in a restructuring where both sides make concessions and it is not debt forgiveness,"" said David Duffy, chief executive of Allied Irish Banks. ""Anything that is done will be with full respect to the moral hazard that would be created,"" he added.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Sixteen insurgents were killed during a fierce battle after they attacked a military base in a restive area of southern Thailand early Wednesday, authorities said. Thai military officials said 50 to 60 heavily armed attackers tried to storm the navy base in the province of Narathiwat under cover of darkness, but navy personnel had been forewarned and fought the insurgents off in an intense, hour-long firefight. It appeared to be the latest flare-up in a worsening conflict between government forces and Muslim separatists in southern Thailand in which more than 5,000 people are believed to have been killed since 2004. Although Thailand's population is overwhelmingly Buddhist, Muslims make up a large percentage of the population in the country's three southernmost provinces, near the border with Malaysia. Parts of those provinces have been under an emergency security decree for years, but analysts say the Thai military is struggling to deal with the militants. ""Insurgents have withstood and adapted to the military's tactics, growing more proficient and daring in the process,"" the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization that provides analysis and advocacy on conflicts around the world, said in December. Meanwhile, successive Thai governments ""have opted to muddle through South East Asia's most violent internal conflict,"" the group said in a report on the conflict, citing ""bureaucratic turf battles and a bitter national-level political struggle."" Well-armed attackers . The insurgents who carried out the attack Wednesday were armed with military-grade weapons, including laser-guided rifles and hand grenades, said Col. Pramote Promin, a spokesman for the Thai military. Some of the roughly 100 Thai navy personnel on the base were wounded in the fighting, he said, but none were killed. The military had received a tip about the attack and was ""on full alert"" when it happened, he added. The military is now trying to track down wounded insurgents who fled from the clash, Pramote said after visiting the area. He said that after a count at the base, the number of insurgents killed stood at 16, one fewer than the initial total he gave earlier Wednesday. There was no word Wednesday from the elusive Muslim separatists, who don't usually claim responsibility for attacks they carry out. Unrest linked to arrest . On Sunday, a roadside bomb in Yala province, which is next to Narathiwat, killed five Thai soldiers, authorities said. Lt. Gen. Dithaporn Sasasmit, a spokesman for the Thai internal security operations command, said recently that the latest insurgent violence is related to the arrest of one of the separatist leaders in January. ""Every time when authorities can arrest or conduct raid operations to prevent possible attacks, they would try to show off and create some situations,"" Sasasmit said. Human Rights Watch last year said that in 2011, insurgent groups targeted teachers they saw as symbols of state efforts to undermine Malay Muslim identity. The group said that Thai security forces have faced few consequences for abuses against Muslims.","NEW: The Thai military says 16 insurgents were killed, one fewer than previously stated .

"(CNN) -- The escalation of tensions in ethnically Tibetan regions of China is the latest in a series that have resulted in deaths, frayed ties between the United States and China, and greater pressure from Beijing against the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet for India in 1959 after a failed uprising. March 2008 -- Hundreds of Tibetan monks gather in Lhasa in protests to mark the 49th anniversary of a Tibetan uprising against Beijing rule. Protesters sought the release of fellow Drepung monks, who apparently were detained, as they tried to celebrate the awarding of the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama months earlier, according to foreign Tibetan rights groups. As the week wore on, protests and violence escalated. Rights groups said more than 140 people died, while Chinese authorities put the figure at 22 dead. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao blamed supporters of the Dalai Lama for the violence in Tibet and said Chinese forces exercised restraint in confronting unrest there. April 2008 -- The global Olympic torch rally for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics begins but becomes a flashpoint for protests one month after the unrest in the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Thousands protested on the streets of San Francisco, and the unruly scene of the London leg of the torch run was labeled ""a public relations nightmare"" by the Times. ""We express our strong condemnation to the deliberate disruption of the Olympic torch relay by Tibetan separatist forces regardless of the Olympic spirit and the law of Britain and France,"" a China spokeswoman said at the time. Meanwhile in Tibet, 30 people were convicted of arson, robbery and attacking government offices related to the March violence and receive prison sentences ranging from three years to life. November 2008 -- China sentences 55 people for involvement in anti-China protests, out of the 1,300 originally detained, according to state media, although the charges and sentences they received weren't revealed. December 2008 -- Chinese authorities arrest 59 people in Tibet accused of spreading rumors and inciting sentiment against the state and public safety, state-run media reported. January 2009 -- Lawmakers in Tibet approve March 28 as a holiday to mark the date that China says about one million people were freed in 1959 from serfdom in the Himalayan region, state-run media reported. The legislation was aimed at ""reminding all the Chinese people, including Tibetans, of the landmark democratic reform initiated 50 years ago,"" a parliament spokesperson said. March 2009 -- Near the one-year anniversary of the riots and 50th anniversary of the failed Tibetan uprising, a monk carrying a Tibetan national flag and shouting slogans set himself on fire in Sichuan Province and then was shot at by police, a human rights group reported. Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, reported a local official as saying that the man had been taken to a local hospital immediately after police extinguished the flames. Foreign tourists are banned from visiting Tibet during the month. February 2010 -- China summons U.S. ambassador to express its ""strong dissatisfaction of a meeting between the Dalai Lama and U.S. President Barack Obama. March 2010 -- Beijing appoints the 11th Panchen Lama -- handpicked by the Chinese government as the second highest Tibetan spiritual figure -- to the Chinese People's Consultative Conference. Beijing's critics, however, say that the inclusion of the Panchen Lama at the annual meeting is part of a stepped up effort to undermine the popularity of Tibet's exiled leader, the Dalai Lama. October 2010 --Tibetan students take to the streets in protest, claiming their culture is being wiped out, as China overhauls school curriculum and limits the use of the Tibetan language in schools. ""The protest resulted from a new education policy which reduces Tibetan language teachings,"" a government official told CNN at the time. The government said 800 students protested, while the activist group Free Tibet said 4,000 to 6,000 students protested. March 2011 -- The Dalai Lama, at a speech marking the 52nd anniversary of the failed 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule which caused him to flee into India, announces he will retire political responsibilities as head of Tibet's government-in-exile but will remain its spiritual head. Lobsang Sangay is elected by Tibetan exiles to take over day-to-day political responsibilities. On March 16, a monk named Phuntsog set himself on fire to protest the third anniversary of the 2008 protests, according to Free Tibet. August 2011 -- A 29-year-old monk, Tsewang Norbu, sets himself ablaze after chanting slogans, according to Free Tibet. The self immolations continue, and by October a nun -- the first woman -- is reported to have killed herself, the ninth Tibetan to commit self- immolation in protest. January 2012 -- Three more monks set themselves ablaze in protest, bringing the number who have self-immolated in protest to 16 since March 2011, Free Tibet claims. Twelve are thought to have died from their injuries.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United edged closer to a record 20th English Premier League title despite having to rely on a late equalizer from Robin van Persie to rescue a draw at West Ham. The Dutch striker looked offside as he finished off from close range in a match that left both managers unhappy with the officials. Manchester City's victory over lowly Wigan means they reduced the gap between themselves and United to 13 points but Alex Ferguson's side can still win the title as early as Monday if results go their way. In Wednesday's other English top flight game Chelsea won 3-0 at local rivals Fulham to move back into third place in the table and edge ahead of London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham in the battle for the European Champions League places. At Upton Park, Manchester United were put under pressure right from the start by West Ham, who took the lead after 16 when Ricardo Vaz Te nodded home after being set up by England striker Andy Carroll. United leveled on the half hour mark when Japan international Shinji Kagawa teed up Antonio Valencia to slot home from close range. Just before halftime, Carroll caught United goalkeeper David De Gea after going up for a corner -- a challenge that infuriated Ferguson, who later said it should have been a red card. West Ham retook the lead ten minutes after the break as Mohamed Diame fired a low shot into the corner past De Gea. But United rescued a point when van Persie tucked home from close range after Kagawa's effort had hit both posts, though replays showed he had been offside from the initial shot. United can be confirmed as champions if they defeat Stoke on Monday night, but only if City lose to Tottenham the previous day. Ferguson told Sky Sports: ""We had to stand up to a lot, we kept going and twice came back. We had determination and courage to play. I was pleased with the result. ""They are very, very aggressive, you hope for a strong referee and I don't think we got that. We don't like losing and they showed that again tonight. Their goalkeeper saved them in the last 20 minutes."" His opposite number Sam Allardyce said: ""The linesman's taken a famous victory away from us. To draw via a default goal from Manchester United is hard to swallow. ""They shouldn't make their mistakes. If players make those kind of mistakes they are dropped. Its a massive decision he's made. I'm bitterly disappointed."" City's victory came courtesy of a superb late winner from Argentina striker Carlos Tevez though they were made to live through some nervy moments by Wigan, who are battling relegation. England goalkeeper Joe Hart had to save brilliantly from Wigan striker Franco Di Santo in the first half before Tevez beat two men and fired into the roof of the net in the 83rd minute. ""We were so tired. Wigan played good football, I think they will stay up. Carlos's goal was fantastic,"" City manager Roberto Mancini was quoted as saying by the Premier League. Chelsea cruised to a 3-0 win over Fulham to strengthen their claim on a Champions League spot and move into third place. Two goals from John Terry and a thunderous 35-yard strike from Brazil international settled the west London derby. Chelsea are a point ahead of Arsenal with a game in hand and three clear of Tottenham in fourth. In Italy, Roma set up an Italian Cup final with city rivals Lazio after beating Inter Milan 5-3 on aggregate in their semifinal. Leading 2-1 from the first leg Roma went 1-0 down early on but hit back with three goals, two from Mattia Destro and one from Vasilis Torosidis before Ricardo Alvarez grabbed a consolation for Inter. The final, due to take place at the Stadio Olimpico ground both clubs share, could prove a headache for the authorities after last week's derby between Lazio and Roma was marred by violence, leading to eight arrests. In Germany, Stuttgart set up a German Cup final with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich after beating Freiburg 2-1 while Paris Sanit-Germain were knocked out of the French Cup by Evian.","Robin van Persie scores a late equalizer as Manchester United draw 2-2 at West Ham .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A blast targeting Shiites in a busy Pakistani marketplace killed at least 78 people on Saturday, police told CNN. The attack in the southwestern Pakistan city of Quetta left at least 180 people wounded. The explosives were packed into a parked water tanker and were remotely detonated, said Mir Zubair Mehmood, a senior police official in Quetta. The South Asian nation, overwhelmingly Sunni, has been beset by sectarian strife and attacks for years. Mehmood said the attack targeted a Shiite Hazara community. Ethnic Hazaras live mostly in Afghanistan, and there are also Hazara enclaves in Afghanistan and Iran. President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf strongly condemned the bombing and vowed to go after the militants. Earlier this year, a wave of attacks in Quetta left 87 people dead in the Shiite community.","At least 78 people are killed and 180 wounded, police say .

"Editor's note: Michael Wolfe is co-founder of Unity Productions Foundation, a nonprofit organization that has produced six documentary films for national broadcast. He edited the Wilbur-award-winning book ""Taking Back Islam: American Muslims Reclaim their Faith,"" and his television work has been nominated for Peabody and Emmy awards. Michael Wolfe says new media give voice to Muslims who weren't fully recognized by mainstream media. (CNN) -- ""The media is dying."" It's the title of a Twitter page and a prime topic of conversation among reporters. Enter a room full of journalists, and you'll hear constant anxious chatter about dying newspapers and massive layoffs at print publications. Just one example: The Seattle Post-Intelligencer recently became the first major newspaper to cease its print edition and go exclusively online, after more than 150 years of chronicling the city's history. As a writer who's been in the game for years -- over 30 and counting -- I'm challenged by all there is to learn and at times overwhelmed as I watch old media gradually head toward extinction. Yet, as a Muslim writer, I am excited by the world of new possibilities. Why? Because I recognize that mastering the online world can unleash a great force to promote understanding among people. With all the focus on Islam and Muslims in the news, the voices of American Muslim civic leaders, or even ordinary Muslims going about their daily business, are too often missing in stories about their own communities here and abroad. Why is it we so often hear what this or that expert thinks about Muslims yet so rarely hear what Muslims themselves think? Into this fray steps the Web. The soaring dominance of new media is an extremely important moment in the history of relations between Muslims and their neighbors. For the first time, ordinary Muslims can speak directly to their non-Muslim neighbors -- and share their views on just about anything -- without the mainstream media as intermediaries selecting their talking heads, pundits and experts. Muslims should seize this golden opportunity to communicate their stories and views directly to the world. Take this recent example, a national online film contest called ""One Nation, Many Voices."" The sponsors (Link TV and One Nation, a nonprofit initiative) challenged Americans to create their own short digital videos about what it means to be Muslim in America today. Now in its second year, the contest attracted more than 150 submissions, with close to 26,000 people voting online for their favorites. The entries provide a fascinating snapshot of what ordinary American Muslims think about the present state of their community, from the grand-prize-winning ""Arab in America"" -- a spoof about the challenges of finding a job and blending in -- to the youth-category winner ""Green Blue Sea,"" about a young scuba diver's reverence for the natural world. Why do films like this matter? Because comprehending how Islamic values are expressed in Muslims' lives today is of central importance to the cause of peace and understanding and to realizing the promise of pluralism on which America and the global world is based. Now, perhaps in the nick of time, the Web offers Muslims the chance to blog in their own words, tweet their reactions to a breaking news story or further progress in their own communities by exchanging ideas through online forums. This new reality is already playing out locally and globally. Progressive American Muslim bloggers like Souheila Al-Jadda, Wajahat Ali and Eboo Patel are contributing to the marketplace of ideas online and sharing their perspectives on major breaking news stories. Muslims in the United States and around the world are reacting in real time when events like the Mumbai attacks happen, often to condemn the violence when some mainstream media pundits are busy saying that none of them cares, or worse. But conversations aren't one-sided; they involve at least two parties. What does this mean? It means that the opportunity Muslims now have is shared with their neighbors. When a Muslim goes online to blog about why she wears a headscarf, a Christian or Jewish woman who is interested in the topic can ask her questions directly. Sometimes it is geography that separates us, or sometimes we are too shy or embarrassed to ask questions or speak out when face-to-face. The Web makes all of this much easier and unleashes unparalleled potential for humans to communicate directly with the rest of the world. For those, like American Muslims, who have often found themselves left out of mainstream media discourse, the possibilities are now vastly improved. The ultimate impact this will have on society at large remains to be seen, but with many ordinary Muslims finally speaking for themselves, and people of other faiths taking part in the conversation, the future is looking brighter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Wolfe.","Michael Wolfe: World of traditional media is undergoing rapid change .

"(CNN) -- News of a recent meningitis outbreak has sent many Americans into panic mode. As of Thursday afternoon, 170 people in 11 states had become sick with the noncontagious fungal meningitis; 14 of those have died. Health officials expect those numbers to rise as the investigation continues. The cases have been linked to injections of contaminated steroid medication made by the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center. ""I'll be skipping my allergy shot,"" @TheAnchorMom tweeted. ""Maybe this is crazy but ever since the meningitis outbreak I am scare(d) to get a flu shot even (thinking) it will be contaminated,"" Lana Flores posted on Facebook. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday as many as 14,000 people may have received the contaminated steroid injections. Health officials have been able to contact about 90% of those to warn them. The idea that a medication created to fix health problems could potentially harm people is frightening, especially when that medication was contaminated in something called a compounding center. Typically medications are mass-produced by drug manufacturing companies. So what's a compounding center, and why are we getting our medications from it? Compounding pharmacists customize medications to fit an individual's needs. Doctors prescribe these custom medications when the manufactured drug won't work -- for example, when a dosage is too large, or a patient has an allergy to a dye or ingredient in the original product. Pharmaceutical compounding is a common practice, said David Miller, executive vice president and CEO of the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists. In fact, compounding is the way all medications were made up until about the 1950s, when mass manufacturing of medications began. ""That was the only way that medications could be filled for people -- having pharmacists making it from scratch,"" Miller said. Meningitis outbreak: Your questions answered . Now compounding pharmacists work in pharmacy centers like the New England Compounding Center, in hospitals, in small independent drugstores, and in drugstore chains like Walgreens or CVS across the country. But only 1% to 3% of all prescriptions currently dispensed in the United States are compounded, according to the IACP. Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician in Atlanta, said she regularly writes prescriptions for compounded medications for her child patients. Sometimes it's to ask the pharmacist to turn a manufactured pill into liquid form so children can take it easily. Other times the compounding pharmacist adds a flavor to the medication to make it more appealing. ""That's just our only option,"" Shu said, ""unless you want to sneak it into their food."" Hospitals often ask for compounded drugs to receive the correct dosage for specific surgeries. If the manufactured bottle contains too much, they would have to waste the rest of the medication since the sterilized seal has been broken.Compounding pharmacists also work for veterinary practices. Many of the same medications we take can be customized for our pets or the animals in zoos. Kevin Outterson, an associate professor of health law and bioethics at Boston University, said there's been a recent increase in reliance on compounding pharmacies in the United States. Physicians and clinics are increasingly getting material from compounding pharmacies because they can sell drugs at a lower cost than major manufacturers, he said. Compounding pharmacies usually make only a couple of doses for a specific patient, which can lower the cost of production. Of course, the opposite can also be true -- if the compound is a complex cancer drug, producing just a few doses would be exponentially more expensive than mass production. Miller said compounding pharmacies also fill gaps when there's a drug shortage. As drug companies struggle to keep up with orders, or when they stop producing altogether because they're not seeing a profit, these pharmacies can access the raw drug ingredients and provide the medications for patients who are already in midtreatment. One question the outbreak has raised is why and how a compounding pharmacy was shipping out medications to 23 states. Did all 75 facilities that received the contaminated steroid injections have prescriptions filled for the medication? Or was the NECC acting as a manufacturer? One woman's fight for compounding pharmacy guidelines . ""The saddest part about this is that there were so many doses administered,"" Miller said. ""(Meningitis) takes up to a month to a month and a half to develop. We've got patients who may have been exposed who are literally waiting to see if anything happens. As a pharmacist, that really upsets me personally, and it upsets my entire profession."" On Wednesday, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick accused the NECC of misleading regulators and operating outside its license by shipping large batches of drugs nationwide. And the state pharmacy board took the step of requiring all compounding pharmacies in Massachusetts to sign affidavits stating they are complying with state regulations requiring compounders to mix medications for specific patients. With so many questions still unanswered, the public's worries about allergy shots, flu shots and other prescription medications are understandable, Miller said. Unfortunately, this kind of contamination could happen with any drug -- manufactured or compounded. Yet the vast majority are perfectly safe, Miller said, and patients shouldn't avoid a needed medication out of fear.However, he said, patients should feel free to ask their doctor or pharmacist: Where does this drug come from?

CNN's Miriam Falco, Danielle Dellorto and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","NEW: The CDC says 14,000 people may have received contaminated injections .

"(Financial Times) -- A senior Chinese auditor has warned that local government debt is ""out of control"" and could spark a bigger financial crisis than the US housing market crash. Zhang Ke said his accounting firm, ShineWing, had all but stopped signing off on bond sales by local governments as a result of his concerns. ""We audited some local government bond issues and found them very dangerous, so we pulled out,"" said Mr Zhang, who is also vice-chairman of China's accounting association. ""Most don't have strong debt servicing abilities. Things could become very serious."" The International Monetary Fund, rating agencies and investment banks have all raised concerns about Chinese government debt. But it is rare for a figure as established in the Chinese financial industry as Mr Zhang to issue such a stark warning. ""It is already out of control,"" Mr Zhang said. ""A crisis is possible. But since the debt is being rolled over and is long-term, the timing of its explosion is uncertain."" Local government debts soared after 2008, when Beijing loosened borrowing constraints to soften the impact of the global financial crisis. Provinces, cities, counties and villages across China are now estimated to owe between Rmb10tn and Rmb20tn ($1.6tn and $3.2tn), equivalent to 20-40 per cent of the size of the economy. Last week, Fitch cut China's sovereign credit rating, in the first such move by an international agency since 1999. On Tuesday, Moody's cut its outlook for China's rating from positive to stable. Local governments are prohibited from directly raising debt, so they have used special purpose vehicles to circumvent these rules, issuing bonds under the vehicles' names to fund infrastructure projects. Investment companies owned by local governments sold Rmb283bn of bonds in the first quarter of 2013, more than double the total for the same period last year. Such an increase would normally be expected to boost the economy, but China's growth unexpectedly slowed to 7.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. Mr Zhang said many local governments had invested in projects from public squares to road repairs that were generating lacklustre returns, and so were relying on financing rollovers to pay back their creditors. ""The only thing you can do is issue new debt to repay the old,"" he said. ""But there will be some day down the line when this can't go on."" Mr Zhang added that he grew alarmed when smaller towns and counties discovered that investment vehicle bonds were an easy way to raise financing. ""This evolution was quite frightening,"" he said. ""China has more than 2,800 counties. If every county issued debt, it could lead to a crisis. It could be even bigger than the US housing crisis."" Beijing has taken steps to control bond issuance by the local governments' investment companies. In December, the finance ministry barred them from injecting public assets such as hospitals and schools into the special purpose vehicles they use to sell bonds. Bonds issued by government-owned investment companies almost always receive top-tier credit ratings from domestic agencies because they are seen as being guaranteed by the provinces and cities that back them. But Mr Zhang puts little faith in official guarantees, saying ShineWing only audited bonds if it was very clear that borrowers were able to make repayments: ""When the time comes, it won't be the government that assumes responsibility. It will be the accounting firms and the banks that do."" ShineWing's caution is an example of how an elite group of Chinese accounting firms are trying to establish reputations as responsible, well-managed entities capable of challenging the global Big Four in the industry. ShineWing has been the most aggressive Chinese firm in expanding abroad and is now planning a move into Europe.

"(CNN) -- It's a surreal and horrifying scene. Father and daughter are in a truck that's parked in a relatively distant field, behind a fence. They're watching a building burn. ""It should collapse,"" the dad says. Then, suddenly: A deafening explosion. Vehicle shakes. Microphone hisses. The recording is fuzzy. Then you hear screams. This YouTube clip has been passed all over the Internet, including on news sites, since a fertilizer plant exploded in West, Texas, on Wednesday. ""Are you OK!?"" ""Dad! Dad! I can't hear! Get outta here! Please get outta here! ..."" ""Oh my God."" The video goes black. ""I'm pretty sure it lifted the truck off the ground,"" Derrick Hurtt, who recorded the video, said in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" show. ""It just blew me over on top of her. It all happened so quick that things kind of went black for a moment."" Hurtt told the show his 12-year-old daughter's hearing had returned. Authorities haven't determined the cause of that explosion, which is thought to have killed at least five people and injured scores more, according to news reports. It may well have been an accident, and I am in no ways insinuating it was linked to terror. But already people on the ground and in the media are comparing this tragedy -- along with the Boston Marathon bombing, which may seem like an eternity ago, but happened Monday; and the letters that are thought to contain ricin and were intended for the president and a senator -- to others that linger in America's memory. It seems to be the week of terror flashbacks. That YouTube clip -- it's hard to watch and I can't decide if I should encourage you to do so or warn against it -- gives a small sense of what it must be like to live through any explosion, disaster or terrorist attack, regardless of its cause. Even for those who haven't, many people in the United States are being haunted this week by attacks and disasters of the past. And it's tempting to feel like we've been cursed to relive these nightmares over and over again. The parallels are eerie. Oklahoma City. The Waco fire. Both of those anniversaries (if we can call them that) are this week, as Amy Davidson pointed out in a smart piece for The New Yorker. The fertilizer plant exploded in West, Texas, which is only 20 miles or so from Waco, the site of the David Koresh compound fire. ""Massive -- just like Iraq. Just like the Murrah (Federal) Building in Oklahoma City,"" D.L. Wilson, from the Texas public safety department, said at a news conference. The letters that possibly contained ricin have thrown people back to the moment after the September 11 attacks when there was an anthrax scare on Capitol Hill. The Boston bombings, cause unknown, drew comparisons to 9/11, the Atlanta Olympics bombing -- and Oklahoma City. A former co-worker of mine, Bob Doucette, wrote ""An open letter from Oklahoma regarding the Boston Marathon"" on his blog. He highlighted the emotional parallels. ""It's hard to find the right words. But we feel your pain, shock and sadness. Deep within us,"" he wrote. ""Back in 1995, while working for a little suburban newspaper in Oklahoma City, I went to the Murrah Building site soon after the attack. What I saw reminded me of past bombings, overseas, in havens of war like Beirut. Friends and co-workers are still haunted by what they saw there. Oklahoma City rebuilt, but did not forget."" The past comes back to life -- no matter the cause. And April is a particularly awful month for it. The assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. (April 4, 1968); the death of Abraham Lincoln (April 15, 1865); the shootings at Columbine High School (April 20, 1999); and those at Virginia Tech (April 16, 2007) all happened this month in history. At the time of writing, no evidence links this week's frightening events -- the bombing, the letter, the explosion. Nor is there evidence to tie them to terror events of the past. I'm not interested in teasing out the potential motives or causes behind these disasters. In the case of the Texas explosion, it's possible that it was simply a horrific accident, although authorities say they are treating the area as a crime scene until they have firm evidence to the contrary. What is more interesting to me right now is the psychological toll this takes on us. This has been a traumatic week in every since of the word. Lives lost in Boston and West, Texas. Fear in Washington. As we pray for the victims and their families ... and sing the national anthem in unison at hockey games ... and run in tribute to those who were hit by a bomb at a marathon finish line ... and lend our support to people in Texas ... we're left wondering what this all means and if we'll be able to stitch up the wounds and move on. CNN iReport: Run for Boston 2014 . Those directly hurt or whose loved ones were killed in these events may never be the same. But where does this leave the county as a whole? It's hard to say for now. Perhaps, as many people have pointed out, we can take comfort in knowing there are ""helpers"" and heroes in each of these tragedies -- people run toward the sound of the blast or toward the flames. And in the fact that, as Peter Bergen wrote earlier this week, terrorist bombings in the U.S. have been ""exceedingly rare"" since 9/11. We'll have to wait for clues to emerge about what or who caused all of this week's events to really know how to process them. There will always be flashbacks of terror and disaster and tragedy. Maybe that's the world we live in. But that doesn't mean we can't push back. That's why I'll be watching from afar as people convene on April 28 for the Oklahoma City Memorial Marathon. As Doucette, my former colleague, writes, ""We'll be running for the 168 of our own who died and the many more who were spared but inexorably scarred. But we're running for your guys, too. Because we know."" The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","A fertilizer plant exploded in Texas on Wednesday, killing at least five people .

"Brookline, Mass. (CNN) -- Like many of us, and especially those of us staying off the streets of Boston, I've been not knowing things all day. That's because I've been watching the mainstream media as well as my favorite social media. It turns out that not knowing something reveals its own kind of truth. Yesterday, when we didn't have a Suspect No. 1 or No. 2, we each filled in the blanks. We assumed the perpetrators were terrorists, which implies a political motive. I'm going to guess that a vast majority of us assumed that the perpetrators would be male and not very old, because that's what our experience has shown us. We may also have filled in blanks about complexion, religion, and whether we expected them to have accents. These are more likely to show us something about how we think the world works. For example, as Friday has worn on, you probably were not surprised to hear the suspects' friends and neighbors say that they were ""quiet"" and ""nice,"" because that's what neighbors of mass murderers seem to always say. But I was quite surprised when more and more people came forward effusively praising Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as someone who reveled in diversity, who was always helpful, who worked with the cognitively disabled, who was highly social. Why was I surprised? Because it doesn't fit my pre-built narratives. It's made me realize that I only have three Mass Murderer Narratives into which I slot the facts about any particular incident. First is the Anti-American: someone who so hates this country that he (and sometimes she) attacks it. Second is the Antisocial: the resentful loner out to take revenge on those who are more popular, or who relishes his or her few minutes of popularity's stand-in, celebrity. Third is the Delusional: someone completely detached from reality. Of course, these are not mutually exclusive. But why these three? After all, there are other narratives available by which I could understand these horrific events. For example, some people have narratives that involve people being evil, or about weak mortals being tempted by . Satanic forces, or about brave soldiers fighting the forces of the ""New World Order."" The narratives that shape our expectations in the absence of actual information can tell us a lot about our most basic understanding of the world. For example, my three narratives each assume humans are pretty much autonomous, and therefore we have to look inside them to see the reasons they acted -- a set of political beliefs for the Anti-American, impossible social needs for the Antisocial, and totally crazy beliefs for the Delusional. Further, all three of my narratives assume that empathy and social connection are the natural state for humans, so you have to come up with reasons to explain antisocial behavior; there are other narratives that say that humans are fundamentally selfish, so you have to explain altruistic behavior. I am not recommending my narratives. I'm just saying that seeing how you assimilate scraps of information when you don't actually know anything can illuminate the basic riverbeds your understanding runs through. As the evidence drips in, watch which pieces make sense to you, and which ones don't. His family is from Chechnya? If you nod as if you knew it all along, that tells you what narrative you prefer. If you expected to hear that his Facebook page was bitter and depressed, then you again know how you'd like to understand the world. This inability to maintain blanks in our understanding isn't a failure of understanding so much as it's a consequence of what it means to be conscious creatures. To understand an event is to see it as part of a sequence of related events -- that is, to see it as part of a story. That's what understanding does. It's perhaps paradoxical that the condition of understanding is also inimical to seeing things in new ways, and often to see them as they actually are. We can at times come to new narratives and new understandings, but it's not easy, it's rare, and it doesn't free us from this basic limitation of thought -- a limitation made clear when we're sitting in front of our screens not knowing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Weinberger.","David Weinberger has been laying low in Boston not knowing things all day .

"(CNN) -- ""If something happens to Capriles, I am willing to go to Caracas to defend him."" These are fighting words, but not from a soldier. They are from Daniela Maggiolo, a 35-year-old publicist in Venezuela and supporter of the country's opposition election candidate -- and loser of Sunday's contested presidential vote -- Henrique Capriles Radonski. Her anger over the results of last Sunday's election is so great she now claims she will not have children in Venezuela, because they will not have what she describes as ""a decent life."" Why? Because, she said, she fears division. Bitterly opposed to the government, she never voted for the late President Hugo Chavez, who ran the country from 1999 to 2013 and whose death earlier this year triggered the election. She said she never believed in his policies. But despite the political discord, she wants a country that is united. She is one member of an opposition whose protests -- alongside counter-protests by government supporters -- have wracked the country's streets since Nicolas Maduro, Chavez's handpicked successor, apparently won Sunday's election with a razor-thin margin. Opposition supporters allege the win was obtained through fraud, which fueled mass protest. At least eight people are reported to have died in post-election violence, state media said, while scores more have been injured. The government news agency said those killed were all followers of Maduro, although CNN has not been able to confirm this. Supporters of Capriles have demanded a recount, and their pleas may be working. Even though the government has strongly denied all fraud allegations, Venezuela's top election official said Thursday that there will be an audit of 100% of the votes cast in the election. Official: Venezuela to audit 100% of election results . The decision came after a lengthy debate, said Tibisay Lucena, president of Venezuela's National Electoral Council. Officials have already audited 54% of ballot boxes, and will now look at the remaining 46%, she said. But is it too late? Maduro is set to be sworn in at a ceremony on Friday and it is unclear whether the audit will affect the inauguration. Also up in the air, is whether the streets of Venezuelan cities will continue to ring with the sounds of protest. But who are the protesters -- and why are they so angry? The triggers for the unrest are not hard to find. Venezuela's economy remains stagnant, with inflation predicted to hit an extraordinary 30% this year, while food shortages continue despite the country sitting on massive (and lucrative) oil reserves. Class is also a key issue in the tensions. Support for Chavez's socialist movement remains strong amongst the poor, who benefited from his programs. Those who support Capriles tend to come from more middle and aspirational working classes, for whom his message of day to day, bread-and-butter issues, such as jobs and crime, resonated. Why is Venezuela so divided? The gap between left and right, haves and have-nots in Venezuela has always been wide, but has increasingly become a gaping maw that has polarized society almost to the breaking point. Maduro's evaporating 10-point lead in pre-election polls seemed to indicate that enthusiasm for Chavez's firebrand form of socialism was ending for some voters at least, and it seems the closeness of the results has emboldened opposition protesters to demand action. In Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, Capriles supporter Daniel Medina hit the streets this week banging pots and pans in a ""cacerolazo"" demonstration -- literally ""casserole"" for the pots that are bashed -- until, he claims, pro-government supporters on motorbikes forced him to run for shelter. ""This is not the first time I have participated in peaceful protests, I've always opposed the government as I do with the current illegitimate government,"" he said. Fearing for his safety, he told CNNE he plans to leave the country until the unrest dissipates. And the protests are not just contained in the capital. Luis J. Gonzalez, a 40-year-old Venezuelan from Margarita Island, Nueva Esparta State, used to work as a tourist guide before the job died out along with the industry. Now working a desk job, he blames policies adopted under the current and previous government for scaring tourists away. Anger over his own situation, but also for what he feels are the millions of voices not being heard by the government, led him to support the opposition. ""Millions of Venezuelans -- half of the electorate -- don't share the ideology of the current government,"" he said. There are ""abuses of power that the government commits daily.

In New York, Andrea Martinez, 23, who supports Capriles, was stunned to see hundreds of protesters outside the Venezuelan consulate in the city.

"(CNN) -- The families of four people killed and dozens injured when a stage collapsed at a Sugarland concert in August filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the country duo. Seven people were killed and at least 40 injured when metal scaffolding fell onto the ""Sugarpit,"" a section usually occupied by Sugarland's most faithful fans, when a storm swept through the Indiana State Fair on August 13. The lawsuit, which comprises 48 plaintiffs, contends that the band ""failed or refused to cancel the Sugarland concert despite inclement weather"" and that it had ""ultimate control over the lighting"" that fell on many of the victims. ""Sugarland had supervisory authority and discretion for stage size, lighting, instruments, trusses, sound equipment and location of sound equipment, and the stage system,"" the suit said. Forecasters warned that heavy rain and strong winds would hit the fair nearly two hours before the storm moved through, causing the collapse of the stage. The National Weather Service estimated winds at 60 to 70 mph. ""Sugarland was not required to perform if Sugarland determined their performance would be impaired or prevented due to inclement weather,"" the suit said. ""The decision whether to cancel the Sugarland concert due to weather conditions was the responsibility of Sugarland."" Sugarland's representative said the group would offer no comment about the lawsuit.

"(CNN) -- Three years ago, a federal court found the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responsible for the catastrophic flooding of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. On Monday, an appeals court threw that decision out. The new court decision, which potentially gets the government off the hook for tens of millions of dollars in damages, is based on a legal provision specifically designed to keep courts from second-guessing government decisions when the government is sued for its actions or inaction. Residents of New Orleans, where more than 1,000 people were killed and many thousands made homeless in one of the worst disasters in American history, have been suing the corps, arguing that it failed to maintain a Mississippi river canal and didn't protect the city properly from the storm. A federal judge issued a blistering decision against the corps in 2009, accusing it of negligence over a period of 40 years because of ""insouciance, myopia and short-sightedness."" The real trouble begins after the storm . U.S. District Court Judge Stanwood Duval Jr. awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages to each of five families that lived in the worst-hit sections of the city: the Lower 9th Ward and St. Bernard Parish. The ruling opened the way for about 100,000 other homes and businesses in the affected area to claim compensation, theoretically making the government liable for tens of millions of dollars. But a higher court reversed the decision Monday. The appeals court found that the government could not be held responsible because of a provision known as the discretionary function exception, or DFE, which says the government can't be sued for actions that an agency or government employee makes, or fails to make, if the function is discretionary. The DFE is intended to prevent courts from second-guessing government decisions ""grounded in social, economic, and political policy"" during the course of lawsuits, the appeals court said. ""Our application of the DFE ... completely insulates the government from liability,"" the three judges hearing the case wrote. Monday's ruling is not final. Plaintiffs can ask the full 5th Circuit Court to rehear the case, or they can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Katrina made landfall on the morning of August 29, 2005, between Grand Isle, Louisiana, and the mouth of the Mississippi River. A few hours later, the storm again crossed over land on the other side of the river, its winds only slightly diminished. Once a Category 5 storm, it had weakened to a Category 3 storm with 127 mph winds when it hit. Katrina devastated New Orleans when the city's levee system failed and widespread flooding occurred. More than 1,800 people died in the storm, nearly 1,600 in Louisiana. Overall, the storm damage covered more than 90,000 square miles and displaced nearly 300,000 people, causing more than $81 billion in damage. The Federal Emergency Management Agency called Katrina ""the single most catastrophic natural disaster in U.S. history."" The plaintiffs who sued the government said the Army Corps of Engineers' failure to properly maintain the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet canal made the flooding significantly worse than it would otherwise have been. In the 2009 district court ruling, Duval wrote that because the corps failed to maintain the shipping channel, erosion widened it, and its banks -- which helped protect the levees -- deteriorated, leaving the levees unprotected, undermined and more vulnerable to waves coming off Lake Borgne. The corps also failed to take other actions, such as armoring the banks with rocks, attorneys for the plaintiffs said. CNN's Ashley Hayes and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","An appeals court says the government is immune from the lawsuit .

"(CNN)  -- The world's poorest countries could pay 40 percent more for food this year than they did last year because of rising prices, according to a United Nations report released Thursday. Rising food prices have left many people, like this Ugandan boy, unable to afford food and malnourished. In those countries, nearly a billion people are on the brink of malnourishment and, as food prices climb, more at risk of starving. The latest Food Outlook report, compiled by the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization, shows that countries which spend a substantial part of their budgets on food will pay $169 billion this year for food imports. That is 40 percent higher than last year and four times higher than in 2000. ""Food is no longer the cheap commodity that it once was,"" FAO Assistant Director-General Hafez Ghanem said. ""Rising food prices are bound to worsen the already unacceptable level of food deprivation suffered by 854 million people. ""We are facing the risk that the number of hungry will increase by many more millions of people."" The FAO lists 82 countries as ""Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries"" that cannot produce or import enough food to meet their all their population's needs. More than half of the countries are in Africa. Riots from Haiti to Bangladesh to Egypt this year over surging food prices brought the issue to a boiling point. The United Nations' World Food Program and World Bank President Robert Zoellick recently appealed to the international community to donate $500 milllion to help meet emergency needs by those hit by the high food and fuel prices. Last month, U.S. President Bush ordered the release of $200 million in emergency aid. The money, to be drawn from a food reserve, will address food needs in Africa and elsewhere, the White House said. The United States is the world's largest provider of food aid, delivering more than $2.1 billion in food aid to 78 countries last year, the White House said in a statement. ""This is the world's big story,"" said Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University's Earth Institute. ""There are riots all over the world in the poor countries. ... Our own poor are feeling it in the United States."" Zoellick has said the rising costs could mean ""seven lost years"" in the fight against worldwide poverty. ""While many are worrying about filling their gas tanks, many others around the world are struggling to fill their stomachs, and it is getting more and more difficult every day,"" Zoellick said last month in a speech opening meetings with the world's finance ministers. ""In just two months,"" Zoellick said, ""rice prices have skyrocketed to near historical levels, rising by around 75 percent globally and more in some markets, with more likely to come. In Bangladesh, a 2-kilogram bag of rice ... now consumes about half of the daily income of a poor family."" The price of wheat has jumped 120 percent in the past year, he said, meaning that the price of a loaf of bread has more than doubled in places where the poor spend as much as 75 percent of their income on food. ""This is not just about meals forgone today or about increasing social unrest. This is about lost learning potential for children and adults in the future, stunted intellectual and physical growth,"" Zoellick said. In the United States and other Western nations, more and more poor families are feeling the pinch. In recent days, presidential candidates have paid increasing attention to the cost of food, often citing it on the stump. The issue is also fueling a rising debate over how much the rising prices can be blamed on ethanol production. The basic argument is that because ethanol comes from corn, the push to replace some traditional fuels with ethanol has created a new demand for corn that has thrown off world food prices. Jean Ziegler, U.N. special rapporteur on the right to food, has called using food crops to create ethanol ""a crime against humanity."" Sachs said, ""We've been putting our food into the gas tank; this corn-to-ethanol subsidy which our government is doing really makes little sense."" The ethanol industry rejects the focus on ethanol in examining food prices. ""The contrived food vs. fuel debate has reared its ugly head once again,"" the Renewable Fuels Association, which lobbies Congress on the behalf of the industry, said on its Web site, adding that ""numerous statistical analyses have demonstrated that the price of oil -- not corn prices or ethanol production -- has the greatest impact on consumer food prices because it is integral to virtually every phase of food production, from processing to packaging to transportation."" Analysts agree that the cost of fuel is among the reasons for the skyrocketing prices. Another major reason is rising demand, particularly in places in the midst of a population boom, such as China and India. Also, Sachs said, ""climate shocks"" are damaging food supply in parts of the world. ""You add it all together: Demand is soaring; supply has been cut back; food has been diverted into the gas tank. It's added up to a price explosion.""","Report: Poor countries will spend $169 billion this year on food imports .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Friday denied a stay of execution for a California man who raped and murdered a 15-year-old, but gave him a choice of whether to die by single injection or the state's recently revised three-drug method. If the execution proceeds as scheduled on Wednesday, Albert Greenwood Brown could become the first person to be executed in California since 2006, when legal challenges arose prompting the state to revise its lethal injection procedure. He could also become the first inmate to be put to death in California's new lethal injection chamber, which was modified to meet requirements to come out of the review. If, however, Brown elects to be executed by a single injection of sodium thiopental and the state refuses, a stay of his execution will be ordered, U.S. District Judge Jerry Fogel wrote in a decision issued today. Read the judge's ruling (PDF) Fogel noted that present litigation had nothing to do with ""the wisdom or morality of the death penalty"" but rather, the narrow issue of whether the 56-year-old was entitled to a stay of execution. ""The passions that surround these issues are deep and entirely understandable, but they have little to do with the limited legal question presented here,"" he wrote. ""The court is painfully aware that however it decides a case of this nature, there will be many who disagree profoundly with its decision. The moral and political debate about capital punishment will continue, as it should."" Brown was sentenced to death in 1982 for the rape and murder of Susan Jordan, who was walking to Arlington High School in Riverside when Brown pulled her into an orange grove, according to court documents. He raped and strangled her with her own shoelace and took her school identification cards and books. Later that evening, he looked up her family in the phone book and called their home, the documents state. ""Hello, Mrs. Jordan, Susie isn't home from school yet, is she?"" court documents quoted him as saying. ""You will never see your daughter again. You can find her body on the corner of Victoria and Gibson."" He also placed a call to police directing them to her body. During the investigation, three witnesses identified Brown as being near the scene of the crime. Police also found Susan's school books and newspaper articles about her death in Brown's home, and clothing with semen stains in Brown's work locker. During the penalty phase of Brown's trial, his lawyer presented psychiatric evidence suggesting that he had emotional problems, including sexual maladjustment and dysfunction and claimed he was remorseful. The jury deliberated for three hours before returning a death verdict, according to an opinion issued September 19 by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Brown had exhausted all his state and federal appeals and habeas corpus issues, according to the Riverside District Attorney's Office, when he petitioned the court last week to join the case that led to an overhaul of the state's execution procedures, which took effect August 29. Among the changes, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation: the revised three-drug method, which includes new directives on how to prepare and administer the mixture; a new selection process and training program for members of the ""lethal injection team,"" which consists of groups including the security sub-team, the intravenous sub-team and the infusion sub-team. The state also built a new execution facility at San Quentin Prison, home of California's male death row, with a bigger death chamber and observation room that separates guests of the condemned inmate from witnesses related to the victim. Brown argued that, until the court had an opportunity to conduct a full review of the regulations, no executions should proceed, according to Fogel's opinion. Lawyers for the state argued that the defense failed to show the new regulations created ""a demonstrated risk of severe pain,"" as required by the most recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to test lethal injection protocol, Baze v. Rees. They also argued that the regulations had come about after years of review and public hearings, and in direct response to issues raised by the Supreme Court, and expressed concerns over deviating from them. Fogel wrote that allowing the condemned inmate to choose which injection protocol to use would address that concern. ""Allowing a condemned inmate to make such a choice is consistent with Ninth Circuit authority in cases arising both in California and elsewhere,"" he wrote. California's last execution was on January 17, 2006, when Clarence Ray Allen was put to death for three counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances. From behind bars, he had helped orchestrate a deadly armed robbery at a convenience store.","If it proceeds, Albert Greenwood Brown's execution will be first since lethal injection review .

"Mumbai, India (CNN) -- To say Gregory David Roberts has witnessed much in his life would be an understatement. The 57-year-old native Australian was sentenced in the late 1970s for a series of armed robberies.   He escaped prison and found his way to Mumbai, India, where he lived for 10 years forging a new life, including work as a doctor in the city's slums.   Roberts' other career highlights? He joined the mafia in Mumbai, fought against Soviet forces in Afghanistan and married a princess. CNN's Anjali Rao spoke with Roberts in Mumbai, the setting and inspiration for ""Shantaram,"" the novel loosely based on his life. Watch Roberts talk about his life in the slum . A brief excerpt from the interview: . CNN: Is it kind of strange that you used to live here, and you were down to your last pennies I guess, and now when you come back here it's with CNN, or Madonna and Guy Richie. Is it kind of strange the way that your life has just taken that change, that turn? Roberts: No, I know this sounds strange, but I think it was to be expected. I had a dramatic change that occurred in my life 19 years ago. I changed the orientation of my life, took control of my life. I think that if you do that, and you stay true to it, and you stay true to a set of principles -- of being fair, honest, positive, and creative in what you do; of pledging not to harm others, and to minimize any amount of harm that you do to other people or to the world around you; you don't take drugs, you don't poison your mind, you don't take alcohol; you focus on what you're doing, keep your discipline -- then I think it's natural that positive outcomes will occur. There's a sense in which it's a natural progression, from taking control of your life and saying, ""I'm going to make my destiny happen. I'm not going to allow destiny to control me, I'm going to control my destiny."" I think that we can expect it to happen in those ways, so it's not really a surprise. The thing is, it's not surprising that I've come to know these people; the surprising thing for me is that they are almost universally nice people. I haven't met anyone at that level -- whether it's Richard Branson, or Johnny Depp, or Madonna, to name a couple -- who are not very, very nice people, and deeply concerned about the world they live in, and trying to make a difference.

"(CNN) -- The year 2012 was declared the globe's 10th warmest since record keeping began in 1880 and the warmest ever for the Lower 48 U.S. states, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center. Last year also marked the 36th consecutive year with a global temperature above the 20th century average, the federal agency said Tuesday. ""All 12 years to date in the 21st century (2001 to 2012) rank among the 14 warmest in the 133-year period of record (keeping). Only one year during the (20th) century Ã¢â¬â 1998 Ã¢â¬â was warmer than 2012,"" the center said. In 2012, the contiguous United States experienced its warmest year since national record keeping began in 1895, the agency said. The new record broke the prior one, set in 1998, by 1 degree Fahrenheit, the center said. The year's average temperature of 55.3 degrees Fahrenheit across the Lower 48 was more than 3.2 degrees warmer than the average for the 20th century, NOAA reported earlier this month. Every state in the contiguous United States saw above-average temperatures in 2012, with 19 of them setting annual records of their own, NOAA said this month. Meanwhile, the country faced 11 weather disasters that topped $1 billion in losses each, including a lingering drought that covered 61% of the country at one point. That drought shriveled crops across the American farm belt, which is expected to cause a rise in food prices in 2013, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. It also turned forests of the mountain West into stands of tinder that exploded into catastrophic wildfires over the summer, scorching millions of acres and destroying hundreds of homes. In October, Superstorm Sandy, a post-tropical cyclone, killed at least 110 people in the United States and nearly 70 in the Caribbean and Canada. Damage estimates from the storm run around $80 billion in New York and New Jersey alone. Most of the world saw warmer annual temperatures, including most of the Americas, Europe and Africa, the federal agency said. Western, southern and far northeastern Asia also had the same experience, officials said. Science, satellites and superstorms: Preparing for the next big one . ""Meanwhile, most of Alaska, far western Canada, central Asia, parts of the eastern and equatorial Pacific, southern Atlantic, and parts of the Southern Ocean were notably cooler than average. Additionally, the Arctic experienced a record-breaking ice melt season, while the Antarctic ice extent was above average,"" the U.S. agency said. At the same time Tuesday, the world's warming trend was blamed for the postponement of a sled dog race in Minnesota. The John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon and Mid-Distance Races were rescheduled to March 10 from January 27 because of scant snow. ""For the third time in six years, we've had to cancel or reschedule the Beargrease sled dog race due to lack of snow,"" race coordinator Pat Olson said. ""We recently had a big rain storm. Rain, but no snow, which messed up the trails. Lots of people [in the sled dog racing community] are doing what we're doing. There was a race scheduled for last weekend and this weekend, and both of those races were forced to be rescheduled due to lack of snow,"" Olson said. One musher cited global warming -- disputed by some analysts and politicians -- as an explanation. ""Last year all but one sled dog race was canceled in Minnesota,"" said Peter McClelland, a sled dog marathon racer and operator of a sled tour business in Minnesota. ""Over the past five years, we've lost a month of snowy weather on either side of the typical winter season. That's a big deal, to lose a month when your season is only four months out of the year. ""It seems to be that this is just a climate change issue,"" McClelland continued. ""Temperatures are going up. Historically we used to have snow by Thanksgiving, but that hasn't happened for over a decade."" The 400-mile marathon race is regarded as one of the most famous dog sled races, held on Minnesota's North Shore, along the usually frosty Lake Superior. Last year, the Beargrease races were canceled because of ""lack of snow and poor trail conditions,"" the race's board of directors said. CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","2012 ranks as the globe's 10th warmest since 1880, when record keeping began .

"(CNN)  -- An analysis carried out by a language monitoring service said Friday that Gov. Sarah Palin spoke at a more than ninth-grade level and Sen. Joseph Biden spoke at a nearly eighth-grade level in Thursday night's debate between the vice presidential candidates. The analysis by the Austin, Texas-based Global Language Monitor said Palin, governor of Alaska and the GOP vice presidential nominee, used the passive voice in 8 percent of her sentences, far more than the 5 percent used by the Democratic senator from Delaware. The analysis noted that the ""passive voice can be used to deflect responsibility; Biden used active voice when referring to [Vice President Dick] Cheney and [President] Bush; Palin countered with passive deflections."" ""It obscures the doer of the action,"" said Language Monitor President Paul Payack, an independent with no political affiliation. The two candidates were nearly even in total number of words spoken. The normally voluble Biden restrained his tendency to ramble by uttering just 5,492 words during the 90-minute debate, versus 5,235 for Palin, Payack said. In last week's debate between Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain, Obama spoke 8,068 words during the 90-minute event, while McCain spoke 7,150, Payack said. Thursday night's debate between the vice presidential candidates ""was more collegial, thinking out loud as opposed to just hammering points,"" Payack said in trying to explain the difference. ""It was a much calmer style."" His analysis ranked the candidates' speech on several other levels, too. Here's the breakdown: . Grade level: Biden, 7.8; Palin, 9.5 (Newspapers are typically written to a sixth-grade reading level.) Sentences per paragraph: statistically tied at 2.7 for Biden and 2.6 for Palin. Letters per word: tied at 4.4. Ease of reading: Biden, 66.7 (with 100 being the easiest to read or hear), versus 62.4 for Palin. The analysis said Abraham Lincoln spoke at an 11th-grade level during his seven debates in 1858 against incumbent Stephen A. Douglas in their race for a Senate seat from Illinois. But higher grade level doesn't necessarily mean better sentence, Payack said. He pointed to Palin's second-to-last sentence in the debate, which the formula put at a grade level of 18.3: . ""What I would do, also, if that were ever to happen, though, is to continue the good work he is so committed to of putting government back on the side of the people and get rid of the greed and corruption on Wall Street and in Washington,"" Palin said. ""When she said it, it sounded good, but on paper it's a completely different animal,"" Payack said. ""It's like, what is that?"" But Biden had his own challenging moments, such as this 32-word gem, rated grade 15.6: ""The middle class under John McCain's tax proposal, 100 million families, middle-class families, households to be precise, they got not a single change; they got not a single break in taxes."" Payack praised the usually longer-winded Biden for showing restraint here. ""In a typical Joe Biden thing, this sentence would serve as a launching point to even more complex and convoluted statements. Last night, he was particularly reserved, and you only had to be a college graduate to decipher it, according to the readability statistics.""","Language monitoring service says Palin spoke at 9.5, Biden at 7.8 .

"(CNN) -- ""I don't think the euro should exist,"" said Saxo Bank co-CEO Lars Seier Christensen to CNN's Richard Quest, in terms that could hardly be less fractious to supporters of the 17-nation single currency bloc. ""It's quite clear that what lacks here is fiscal union but it's also very clear that the populations of Europe are not supportive of that goal."" The eurozone will also pull itself apart as competitiveness will continue ""to develop in different directions,"" said the head of the online Danish investment bank. He added that the people of the eurozone -- in particular, Germany as the monetary zone's prime pillar -- will not make sacrifices for ""the weaker part of the eurozone"" -- Greece and other southern European countries. Christensen's controversial comments stand in stark contrast to what eurozone supporters have said -- advocating for austerity to keep the union together. Germany, Europe's largest economy, fears that a Greek exit from the eurozone could lead to a domino effect in which other massively-indebted countries -- Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy -- may pull out from the common currency, leading to the breakup of the eurozone. In December 2012, German Chancellor Angela Merkel won more support for bailout funds for Greece. In July, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank promised to do ""whatever it takes to preserve the euro"" which set off rallies for Greek, Spanish and Italian bonds. Still, Saxo Bank's Christensen believes the euro will disappear at some point in the future -- and despite hitting 13-month highs -- because he believes overall support does not exist. ""I'm not saying it's a bad thing that support is not there,"" said Christensen, ""because the ability to adjust your currency is an important equilibrium between different economies and different developments. When that's gone you're left with a completely different set of problems."" The bank CEO declined to give a timeline but said it ""depends how long the Germans hold out... how long the German population is willing to buy into supporting"" fiscal union. ""I can tell you the problem is going to get greater rather than smaller... I fear that the markets will take the thing apart eventually.""","Saxo co-CEO: 'Euro should never have existed'

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A day after he made a swift exit from an Islamabad court when a judge revoked his bail, former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf appeared before a magistrate on Friday and was formally placed under house arrest. The development is the latest setback to Musharraf since the former military ruler returned to Pakistan last month to fight a series of court cases against him and re-enter the country's turbulent political scene by seeking to run in upcoming elections. His arrest also highlights the increased willingness of Pakistan's judiciary, who clashed with Musharraf during his time in power, to pursue cases against high-profile figures previously considered to be untouchable. No former Pakistani army chief has previously been arrested and detained. Amid a long-running fight with the judiciary, Musharraf resigned as president of Pakistan in 2008 after nine years in power and went into exile the following year, living in London and Dubai. He came back to Pakistan last month under heavy security. But so far, his return does not seem to be going according to plan. Earlier this week, Pakistani election officials barred Musharraf from running for a seat in parliament in elections next month, a decision his lawyer has said he will challenge. That decision appears to have emboldened members of the judiciary, many of whom have bitter memories of their treatment by Musharraf during his time in power. But the legal drama concerning a former head of the army appeared to be fueling concerns about how the powerful Pakistani military might respond, with the country under the management of a caretaker government ahead of the elections next month. ""The fears that the army might sharply react if the cases are taken to their logical conclusion hang in the air,"" The Nation, an English language newspaper, wrote in an editorial Friday. ""But Pakistan is now irrevocably destined for a democratic transition, and on this, all institutions agree."" Accused of detaining judges . The Islamabad High Court had ordered Musharraf's arrest on Thursday in a case in which he is accused of illegally ordering the detention of senior judges in 2007. The high court said in its ruling that it was an ""act of terrorism"" to prevent the judges from doing their job. But he quickly left the building after the judge announced the decision, returning to his farmhouse compound outside the Pakistani capital. His legal status at that point was unclear. Local media reported he had been placed under house arrest, but the judge's order for his arrest remained outstanding. On Friday morning, local broadcaster Geo TV broadcast images of Musharraf arriving at a court building accompanied by uniformed police officers and other members of the security forces. Pakistani authorities have provided some of his heavy security detail since his return. Islamabad police spokesman Naeem Iqbal said officers had formally arrested Musharraf and produced him before a magistrate in court. But Mohammad Amjad, a spokesman for Musharraf's political party said the former president had presented himself in court. He said Musharraf denies the charges against him and never gave any order to detain or abduct the judges in 2007. Farmhouse arrest . After appearing before the magistrate on Friday, Musharraf was allowed to return to his farmhouse, which has been converted into a ""sub jail"" where he is being held under house arrest, according to his lawyer, Ahmed Raza Qasoori. Musharraf will continue to seek bail in the case, Qasoori said. An attempt on Thursday to appeal the Islamabad court's decision at the Supreme Court appeared to have so far been unsuccessful. Qasoori said that Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, the Islamabad High Court judge who ordered Musharraf's arrest, is one of the judges whom Musharraf is alleged to have had detained in 2007. As a result, Qasoori said, Siddiqui should have recused himself from the case. Siddiqui wasn't immediately available for comment on Friday. In another step in the process, Musharraf will have to appear in court again next week. He had previously received bail extensions in the cases concerning him. He was also initially granted ""protective"" bail to ward off potential arrest when he returned to Pakistan. But the judiciary appears to have taken a more aggressive line than he may have expected, stepping up the pursuit of cases against him. When asked last week about his fears of arrest, Musharraf brushed the question aside. A mixed reception in Pakistan . Musharraf was disqualified from contesting elections in Pakistan because of the state of emergency he declared in 2007. Even though he hasn't been tried for that action, the move was ruled an act of treason, making him ineligible to run for office. Musharraf maintains he should not be barred because he has not been convicted of any criminal acts. Some Pakistanis are happy to see the return of the ex-military ruler, hoping his leadership could help restore order to a country riddled with political division and plagued by extremist violence. But he also made many enemies in the final years of his presidency, notably among the judges he allegedly detained. The Pakistani Taliban vowed to send a death squad to hunt down the former president if he returned to the country, though Musharraf has said he has been living under threats of death since September 11, 2001, when he supported the American war on terror and fought against the Taliban. The former general became president after a bloodless coup in 1999. Musharraf's popularity began declining in 2007 after he suspended the nation's Supreme Court chief justice for ""misuse of authority."" The move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence a court decision on whether he could seek another term in office. CNN's Nic Robertson and journalist Nasir Habib reported from Islamabad. CNN's Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- In the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, the cast and crew of a new Sandra Bullock-Melissa McCarthy comedy about Boston law enforcement want to show their appreciation for FBI agents and police with an advance screening of the film. ""The Heat,"" which hits theaters June 28, was filmed in Boston with a lot of help from law enforcement there. Director Paul Feig said Thursday that he is arranging an advance screening to show support for the city. ""The movie is such a love letter to Boston,"" Feig said. ""A lot of our cast are Boston people, either born or raised. So we really would like to support that city. I love that city."" Bullock plays an FBI agent who is sent to Boston to work on an investigation. ""It's been an amazing tight-knit community before this happened, and it just bonded a community even more,"" Bullock said. ""I don't think a screening would ever be enough, feel like it's enough to do for them."" McCarthy plays a Boston cop who clashes with Bullock's character over jurisdiction. ""It's a remarkable place, an amazing city that's obviously going through a really tough situation,"" McCarthy said. ""I have a sweet spot for it now.""

"Cairo (CNN) -- As was the case exactly two years ago before President Hosni Mubarak's ouster, streets around Egypt were roiled by deadly clashes Friday, pitting protesters against both police and supporters of the nation's current leader. At least seven people were killed, six of them in Suez where gunfire erupted during clashes between anti-government protesters and those loyal to President Mohamed Morsy, according to official media outlets. Four of those killed in Suez had been shot in the abdomen, Health Ministry spokesman Ahmed Omar told state-run EGYNews. It was not clear which group those killed belonged to or who was responsible. The head of security in Suez denied his forces fired on protesters, state TV reported. By Saturday morning, Egyptian armored vehicles were dispersed around Suez at the request of the city's security chief, who had said his forces were fired upon and feared the situation was getting out of control, EGYNews reported. Yet the unrest was not confined to the coastal city of Suez, on the northern tip of the Red Sea. The seventh death was in Ismailia, according to EGYNews. Nationwide, at least 456 people -- including dozens of police and security forces, though the vast majority were civilians -- were injured throughout the day, health ministry officials said. Into Saturday morning, after the anniversary of what some call the January 25 Revolution officially had passed, thousands of protesters were still in a standoff with police outside state-run Nile TV's offices in Cairo. Some demonstrators there tossed Molotov cocktails, while police responded with tear gas. The unrest comes as Egypt continues its struggle to find stability, security and harmony after the ouster of Mubarak, who in his 30 years of ruling Egypt was accused of vigorously clamping down on dissent. He has been given a life sentence for his role in the killings of peaceful protesters demanding his exit, though he will get a new trial in April, the state-run MENA news agency reported this month. Morsy, who became the North African country's first democratically elected president last year, has since become a target for some who say he hasn't been inclusive or true to the revolution's goals. Those critics say he has amassed power for himself and his Islamist allies. Morsy was a leader in the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that was banned under Mubarak, before he rose to power. He has defended his moves as necessary to move Egypt forward in the face of pressing issues and persistent obstacles. On Friday, state TV reported security forces had thwarted attempts to raid security headquarters in Faiyum, a city about 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Cairo. Other security forces turned back pushes on government buildings in Damietta, Kafr el-Sheikh and Gharbia, as well as Suez. In Ismailia, a city between Suez and Port Fouad in northeastern Egypt, protesters torched the main office of the Freedom and Justice Party -- the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing -- state TV reported. The coastal city of Alexandria also was the site of clashes between opponents and supporters, multiple eyewitnesses told CNN. The violence prompted Morsy to issue statements on his official Twitter account, in which he offered his condolences for those killed and pledged his support for all Egyptians' right to protest peacefully. At the same time, the president said the government won't hesitate to prosecute those responsible for violence ""and bring them to justice."" ""I call on all citizens to uphold the noble principles of the Egyptian revolution to express their opinion freely and peacefully, renounce violence in word and deed,"" he said. Read more: Opinion: U.S gets it wrong on Egypt again . Protests, violence near Cairo's landmark Tahrir Square . There also were protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the hub of the popular movement that began its push on January 25, 2011, to unseat Mubarak. Back then, protesters spilled into the streets around that major intersection in an unprecedented display of anti-government rage. At one point, the activist masses in the world's largest Arab nation broke through riot police who had lined Tahrir, or Liberation, Square. Police lobbed tear gas and used water cannon, but the protesters were undaunted. Since then, the square has continued to be a focal point for demonstrations for Egyptians from all factions. That was true again Friday, and by afternoon at least 10,000 liberals, moderates and secularists had gathered there to vent their anger at Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood for -- in their view -- hijacking the revolution. ""All ages, all classes, women even more enthusiastic than men,"" CNN iReporter Dr. Abdel-Maguid Ramzy said of the crowd he joined for four hours in Tahrir Square, many of whom blamed Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood for Egypt's economic malaise. ""They feel betrayed."" One pocket of violence broke out a few blocks from the square, where police erected a barrier of concrete blocks on a street leading to the Interior Ministry and other government buildings. Young protesters threw rocks over the barrier at officers stationed there, who responded sporadically with tear gas or threw stones themselves. At least 29 people were treated for cuts, broken bones and birdshot injuries, Health Ministry spokesman Khaled El Khatib said. Six police officers were also hurt in the disorder near Tahrir Square, according to the Interior Ministry. Egyptian police also fired tear gas to disperse protesters who tried to cross barbed wire outside the presidential palace, which is in the northeast of Cairo, Nile TV reported.

"Osh, Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- The first U.N. aid plane arrived Wednesday in Uzbekistan to help the thousands of people who have fled ethnic clashes in neighboring Kyrgyzstan, officials with a U.N. Refugee agency said Wednesday. The cargo plane carrying about 800 lightweight tents will add to a growing effort to try and aid the estimated 100,000 people who have fled fighting in Kyrgyzstan for refugee camps in Uzbekistan. Several countries, including the United States, Germany and Russia, also have sent aid. The International Committee of the Red Cross has said tens of thousands more people are displaced within Kyrgyzstan and the scope of the humanitarian crisis is ""immense."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov from London on Wednesday, thanking Karimov for his help with the humanitarian situation, according to a statement from Ban's office. The secretary-general promised assistance to affected people in southern Kyrgystan and those seeking refuge in Uzbekistan, and said he intended to consult with key members of the U.N. Security Council upon his return to New York later Wednesday. Relative calm continued in Osh, Kyrgyzstan's second largest city, Wednesday. But still sporadic gunfire could be heard. The Central Asian nation's news agency 24.kg reported that the death toll had risen to 179, a number that some observers discounted as low. Kyrgyzstan's interim government had declared Wednesday a day of mourning for families of the many killed and thousands wounded in the violence that started last week. The government had sent extra security forces into Osh and Jalal-Abad, the hardest-hit cities, on Tuesday to help calm the situation. The ICRC says it was able to visit the main detention center in Osh Wednesday for the first time since the crisis started and has delivered food provided by the World Food Program to around 1,000 detainees. The WFP says it has 3,000 metric tons (about 6.6 million pounds) of food -- mainly wheat flour and oil -- in ready for distribution in Kyrgyzstan. The WFP says that's enough to feed 87,000 people for two months -- and as long as its personnel can get safe and unimpeded access to those in need, they're prepared to bring the food. However, the WFP says transporting aid from the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, is difficult, because the roads aren't safe and commercial trucking companies are reluctant to risk their vehicles. The pressing issue for many aid groups Wednesday was trying to deal with refugee camps that were overwhelmed with refugees. The ICRC is particularly concerned with hygiene, ""with many people drinking from irrigation ditches and reports of spreading dysentery,"" ICRC Anna Nelson said. The clashes are part of the most serious outbreak of ethnic violence in the former Soviet republic since 1990, when hundreds of people died in skirmishes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in Osh. ""The past 20 years have been spent working very hard to avoid this kind of conflict, but everyone is aware of the danger, Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the UN refugee agency UNHCR, told CNN. ""The situation is like a striking a match on petrol."" It was not clear what sparked the violence, which came weeks after bloody protests removed Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiev from office. Colville said there's a strong consensus in the Kyrgyz government that this wasn't a spontaneous interethnic clash, but one that was orchestrated and deliberately provocative. ""It's very hard to confirm anything for sure, but cross-checking seems to indicate a planned, provocative act. The Kyrgyz government is naming names, but UNHCR is not in a position to name names or point fingers,"" said Colville. In recent days, more than 100,000 ethnic Uzbeks have fled the clashes with ethnic Kyrgyz, into camps in Uzbekistan, according to Uzbekistan's Foreign Ministry. The flow of people was so overwhelming that Uzbekistan had close some of its border crossing areas leaving many standing at the border on the Kyrgyzstan side of a barbed-wire fence. Many ethnic Uzbeks that have remained in Kyrgyzstan have had to hide out in abandoned buildings. Red Cross workers came across one mosque outside Jalal-Abad where an estimated 6,000 frightened people have gathered for safety.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus faced fresh trouble Thursday after the Bangladeshi government ordered an inquiry into irregularities during his tenure as head of his microlending bank. The Bangladeshi Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, ordered the Internal Resources Division to ascertain whether Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank, enjoyed tax exemption while he was managing director of the bank, said Cabinet secretary Mohammad Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan. Yunus, who is now in his 70s, founded Grameen Bank three decades ago in an effort to alleviate poverty. He was forced out as managing director last year after Bangladesh's central bank, the financial regulatory authority in the South Asian nation, said Yunus had to end his service at age 60 and that holding his position at 70 was illegal. Yunus unsuccessfully challenged the central bank's decision in court. As a result of their work, Yunus and Grameen Bank won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. He was also awarded the American Presidential Medal of Freedom and a U.S. Congressional Gold Medal. The Grameen Bank model was replicated in many parts of the world as its work drew increasing attention to microcredit, a then-novel idea of making small loans to poor people who would not qualify for standard bank loans. The Cabinet on Thursday also approved a draft law reducing the power of Grameen's board and allowing its government-nominated chairman to appoint the bank's managing director. It also directed the Bangladesh central bank and the Financial Institutions Division to report on how much money Yunus made in salaries and allowances while head of the bank after he turned 60, Bhuiyan said. Yunus immediately expressed deep shock at the decision. In a statement, he said he had always worried the government would take over the bank. ""Now my apprehension has started to become a reality. I am so disheartened that I am unable to express my feelings,"" said Yunus. During a visit to Dhaka earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton angered the government when she said she hoped the work of Grameen Bank and Yunus would not be undermined by government actions. Finance Minister A.M.A. Muhith at the time said the government, which owns a 25% stake in Grameen, had not taken any action against the bank and that the bank was performing well without Yunus. Yunus' supporters say he was under fire for criticizing politicians and trying to form his own political party five years ago during an interim, unelected, military-backed government. That party was later abandoned. The government, however, denied the claim.","Muhammad Yunus won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for founding Grameen Bank .

"(CNN) -- A bus bombing that killed five Israeli tourists, the bus driver and the suspected bomber in Bulgaria was probably carried out by a male suicide attacker who had a fake Michigan driver's license, Bulgaria's interior minister said Thursday. Israel said it suspects Iran or an Islamist militant group was behind the attack, which occurred Wednesday in a parking lot outside Burgas International Airport in Bulgaria. Tensions between Israel and Tehran have been escalating in recent months. Explainer: Explosion comes amid growing tension . In a televised statement Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack was ""perpetrated by Hezbollah, Iran's leading terrorist proxy,"" as part of a global campaign that has reached a dozen countries on five continents. But he offered no evidence. Israel's U.S. Embassy said Wednesday that it had no proof that Iran was the instigator of the attack. Netanyahu said Hezbollah and Iran have been trying to foment terrorism in countries that include Kenya, India and Cyprus, as well as in the United States, where an Iranian tried to kill the Saudi diplomat. He urged world powers to expose Iran as ""the premier terrorist-supporting state that it is"" and prevent it from developing ""the world's most dangerous weapons,"" a reference to its nuclear program. ""We will continue to fight against the terrorists and exact a heavy price from those that support them,"" Netanyahu said. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said Israel was engaging in ""baseless accusations against other countries in order to distract the attention of the international community from its terrorist activities being carried out throughout the world,"" according to a statement from the state-run IRNA news agency. ""The Zionist regime as master of state and organized terrorism has its hands in (the) blood of innocent Lebanese, Palestinian and other nationalities,"" Mehmanparast said. The Iranian Embassy in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, said earlier that Israeli suggestions that Tehran was involved in Wednesday's attack were ""unsubstantiated"" and that the assertion was politically motivated. The identity of the man thought to have put a backpack bomb on the bus remained a mystery, but he was carrying a Michigan driver's license that FBI officials say was fake, Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said. Fingerprints were being checked, and investigators were at the scene to collect evidence, he said. Meanwhile, a third and final Israel Air Force aircraft left Bulgaria Thursday for Israel, this one carrying coffins holding the bodies of the victims, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. The aircraft was to land at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, where the coffins were to be received in an official ceremony. Thirty-three Israelis wounded in the blast arrived earlier Thursday in Tel Aviv. Maj. Gen. Itzik Kreis of the Israel Defense Forces said at the airport that one of the wounded was in critical condition. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak warned of consequences for those responsible. ""We will find those who executed this attack and those who sent them,"" he said. At the United Nations, the Security Council issued a statement condemning the attack. In all, 32 people were hospitalized, some of them in critical condition, said Bulgaria's permanent representative to the world body, Stefan Tafrov. Two Russians, an Italian and a Slovak national were among the victims of what he called ""the largest terrorist attack against Bulgaria in our modern history."" Asked if Iran or Hezbollah was responsible, he said, ""As of today, we don't know. We simply haven't identified the responsible country or organization or entity. We can't exclude anything, but we haven't identified the force, the organization behind this attack."" ""I can't get into the details of the investigation, which, of course, is still going on,"" Israel's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Haim Waxman, told reporters. ""We know the fingerprints are very clear: The hands of Iran and Hezbollah are all over this attack."" Regarded by the United States and Israel as a terrorist organization, Hezbollah is a Shiite militant group that holds power in the Lebanese government. It is financed and armed by allies Iran and Syria. Bulgaria, whose Black Sea beach resorts are a popular destination for Israelis, has not speculated on who may have been responsible for the attack. Bulgaria received nearly 8.4 million visitors in 2010, the last year for which U.N. World Tourism Organization figures are available. The vast majority of the country's visitors that year, more than 8 million, came from Europe. About 25,000 visitors came from the Middle East. Tsvetanov sought to reassure those alarmed by the attack. ""I can assure you that we're doing all we can to strengthen security in all the areas where it might be necessary to do so,"" he told Bulgarian station TV7. The Iranian Embassy statement said Iran condemns all terrorism. ""Iran and Bulgaria are friends, and they follow their relationship on the basis of mutual respect and interests,"" it said. ""The rotten tricks of the enemies can never shake the stability of this friendship."" Iran's state-run Press TV also quoted Iranian spokesman Mehmanparast as telling the Arabic-language Al-Alam television network that Iran condemns the attack. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran, which itself is the biggest victim of terrorism, considers any act that endangers the lives of innocent people in order to fulfill illegitimate political objectives as inhumane and strongly condemns it,"" Mehmanparast said. Bulgarian authorities believe that the bomber was carrying the bomb in a backpack, which he placed in the luggage compartment underneath the carriage, Tsvetanov said. The bus was to have taken about 47 passengers to a resort. Security footage aired by Bulgarian National TV shows the man believed to be the bomber, who is white with long hair and wearing khaki shorts, a baseball cap and sneakers. He appears relaxed as he walks among other travelers, carrying a backpack and a smaller bag. Tsvetanov had earlier said another person died overnight from the blast, but he subsequently said the Israeli ambassador had misinformed him. Read Netanyahu's full statement . According to a U.S. State Department International Religious Freedom Report, released in September, more than 80% of Bulgaria's 7.6 million residents are Orthodox Christian, with Muslims making up the largest minority at about 13%. Jews make up fewer than 5% of the country's population, the report says. U.S. President Barack Obama condemned the ""barbaric terrorist attack."" ""As Israel has tragically once more been a target of terrorism, the United States reaffirms our unshakeable commitment to Israel's security, and our deep friendship and solidarity with the Israeli people,"" said Obama, who called Netanyahu to express his condolences.

"SAN ANGELO, Texas (CNN) -- The state of Texas should not have removed children from a polygamist sect's ranch because it didn't prove that they were in ""imminent danger,"" an appeals court ruled Thursday. Photos from a Web site launched by the sect show scenes during and after the raid of their ranch. In the ruling, a three-judge panel did not order that the children be returned to their families on the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado, Texas. Instead, the judges gave the lower court 10 days to vacate an order placing the children in state custody. ""The existence of the FLDS belief system as described by the department's witnesses, by itself, does not put children of FLDS parents in physical danger,"" the judges said. More than 450 children were removed from their homes last month on the Yearning for Zion Ranch, which is owned by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, a Mormon offshoot that practices polygamy. In its ruling, the Texas 3rd District Court of Appeals decided in favor of 38 women who had appealed a lower court judge's decision that the children remain in state custody. Although the ruling applies only to the children of the 38 mothers represented in this case, a lawyer for the women said the Court of Appeals' reasoning would apply to all of the children who were removed from their homes. ""It is a great day for families in the state of Texas,"" said Julie Balovich of Texas RioGrande Legal Aid.  Watch Balovich and the FLDS mothers react to the ruling Â» . Members of the YFZ community said they were ""extremely grateful"" for the court's ruling, but acknowledged the long road ahead. The state can still appeal the decision or renew the investigation. ""I'd like to see the children in my arms before I rejoice greatly,"" said Maggie Jessop, who has two girls and two boys in state custody across Texas. Jessop told CNN's Larry King that the experience had traumatized her children, whom she has visited several times since they went into foster care. ""They feel betrayed by adults, and they're hurting very badly,"" Jessop said. The parents said they had spent the last few weeks zigzagging across the state to visit their children, who were taken from the sprawling 1,700-acre ranch on April 3. ""You can see it's a lot of stress on them,"" Edson Jessop said, referring to his three boys and girl. ""Every time we leave, they go through that trauma again. It's enough to rip your heart out."" State officials told CNN they were reviewing the ruling. ""We are trying to assess the impact this may have on our case and what our next steps will be,"" child welfare spokesman Patrick Crimmins said in a written statement. ""Our office is confident that [the] state's lawyers will review the appropriate next steps in this case to ensure the safety and welfare of the children involved,"" Krista Piferrer, spokesman for Texas Gov. Rick Perry, said in a written statement. The law grants the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services the authority to take emergency possession of a child if authorities have reason to suspect that there is an ""immediate danger to the physical health or safety,"" warranting their immediate removal. According to the ruling, the department obtained an emergency order to take custody of the children based on reports from a hot line caller who said she had been raped and impregnated on the ranch. The girl, who claimed to be 16, reported that she had an 8-month-old baby and was pregnant again, and that she was married to Dale Barlow, who abused her physically and sexually. Lawyers for the 38 mothers said authorities used those allegations to draw broader inferences about the practices and beliefs of all the sect members. After interviewing five minors who were or had been pregnant, CPS removed all of the children, based on the assumption that the community's belief system allowed minor females to marry and bear children, lawyers for the women argued. ""The department's lead investigator was of the opinion that due to the 'pervasive belief system' of the FLDS, the male children are groomed to be perpetrators of sexual abuse and the girls are raised to be victims of sexual abuse,"" the ruling noted.  Watch CNN's Sunny Hostin explain the ruling Â» . After the state took custody of the children, the mothers appealed the order on the grounds the department failed to establish that the need for protection was urgent. Because no such proof was presented, the mothers argued that the district court, which backed the raid, abused its discretion and was obligated to return the children to their parents. The appeals panel agreed. ""Evidence that children raised in this particular environment may someday have their physical health and safety threatened is not evidence that the danger is imminent enough to warrant invoking the extreme measure of immediate removal prior to full litigation of the issue,"" the panel wrote.  Watch how the ruling favors FLDS Â» . Furthermore, the court said, CPS did not make any reasonable effort to determine if measures other than removal would have reduced the perceived risk to the children. Outside the courthouse, Balovich said it was ""ridiculous"" how the courts had ignored the parents' rights. ""It was about time a court stood up and said that what has been happening to these families is wrong,"" she said. Surrounded by the FLDS mothers represented in the case, Balovich said authorities considered the YFZ Ranch one household, an assertion with which the appeals court did not agree. Therefore, proving that there was abuse in one household did not mean the state could apply that behavior to the entire ranch. ""This was the right decision,"" Balovich said, adding that she and her clients are ""ecstatic about this news."" The ruling noted other deficiencies in the Department's investigation. The authenticity of the initial abuse reports that turned authorities' attention on the ranch is in question, the court noted in its ruling. Police have alleged that a family shelter crisis line received multiple calls March 29 and 30 from a caller claiming to be Sarah Jessop Barlow, age 16. At least one of the telephones used by ""Sarah Barlow"" has been traced to a Colorado woman. Police say Rozita Swinton is a person of interest in connection with the reports of abuse at the ranch, but she has not been charged. She does, however, face a charge of providing a false report to authorities in a Colorado case. Court hearings in the FLDS case resumed Monday, with hearings in several courtrooms to accommodate lawyers for the children. The hearings were held so the parties could review ""family service plans"" dictating the parameters under which FLDS parents can regain custody of their children. FLDS members have denied any physical or sexual abuse takes place, and maintain they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. The sect's leader, Warren Jeffs, is in a Utah prison after being convicted on charges of being an accomplice to rape in connection with a marriage he performed in 2001. Jeffs also faces trial in Arizona on charges stemming from arranged marriages involving FLDS teens.","Lower court has 10 days to reverse its ruling or appeals court will act .

"(CNN) -- After more than six years, Sony is set to unveil the latest iteration of its PlayStation line this Wednesday. With the PS4, Sony also aims to recapture some of the luster it has lost to competitors like the Nintendo Wii and Micrsoft Xbox. While Sony's PS2 is still the gaming world's best-selling console with more than 150 million units, estimates put PS3 sales at about half that at 77 million. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the new PS4 will let users stream games online. Sony is also rumored to be working on an online TV service to rival cable companies which would prominently use the PlayStation console. Sony's decline has been seen as a metaphor for the falling fortunes of Japan Inc. Sony's share price rose 1.5% higher by mid-day on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as investors hope the PS4 will be a financial lifeline for the troubled tech giant. In its most recent quarter, Sony bled $123 million from its books with gaming-related sales falling 15.1% year-on-year while its ailing television division saw sales plunge 23.3%. The company's third quarter results appear to stem a larger loss of $197 million from its second quarter and a $310 million loss in its first. But if Sony does not report a profit for the fourth quarter of 2012, the company will post five full years of consecutive losses. One crutch for Sony -- and all other of Japan Inc.'s exporters from automobiles to tech and optics -- has arrived in the form of currency devaluation. Since October 1 the yen has weakened 20% -- from under 78 yen to more than 93 yen to the U.S. dollar -- which has helped the bottom line of Japan's exporters. As a currency weakens, a country's exporters enjoy a profit boost when earnings are repatriated back to the home country. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has continued to voice strong support for monetary easing and the associated yen weakness. At the same time, the governor of the Bank of Japan, Masaaki Shirakawa, announced he will step down March 19 -- several weeks earlier than his scheduled term ends. Shirakawa had opposed some of Mr. Abe's stimulus measures. The international community fears the fall in the yen may spark a currency war. In the meantime, a weaker yen gives Sony and the rest of Japan's exporters an easier path to recovery. A strong debut for the latest version of the PlayStation, one of Sony's marquee products, would also be a welcome relief for the beleaguered company.","Sony to unveil new Playstation this Wednesday, six years after PlayStation 3 .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Horrified witnesses described how Egyptian police officers stood by as violent clashes between rival fans at a football match in the northeastern city of Port Said left scores dead. Hundreds of supporters of clubs Al-Ahly and Al-Masry were critically injured in the attacks and as they tried to flee. The violence is one of the world's worst sporting disasters and prompted officials to indefinitely suspend Egypt's football premier league. The attacks started out of sight of television cameras in the stadium's hallways and terraces. When the referee blew the final whistle, thousands of Al-Masry home team fans stormed the pitch despite their team's hard-fought 3-1 victory. See high-res images of the riots . Police conscripts then stood by as rival fans attacked each other with rocks and chairs. ""The police did nothing to stop it,"" said Amr Khamis, an Al-Ahly supporter, at the train station in Cairo after returning from the match. ""Officers refused to open the gates of the stadium, so we could not escape and had to face thousands of Al-Masry hooligans attacking with rocks, knives, swords and anything else you can imagine."" Mamdouh Eid, executive manager of the Al-Ahly fans committee, also blamed officers. ""The police stood there watching, and the ambulances arrived late. I carried several dead fans in my arms,"" he said. Tension was building throughout the game, Eid said, as Port Said fans threw bottles and rocks at players. Hours after the match ended, thousands of Al-Ahly fans -- who bore the brunt of the violence -- gathered with anti-military protesters at Cairo's main train station. Families of victims wailed and cried as chants of ""down down to military rule"" echoed through the station's hall. It was unclear whether intense sports rivalries or political strife caused the clashes. However, many supporters blamed the tragedy on the ruling junta that they said had failed them after the overthrow of former ruler Hosni Mubarak on February 11, 2011. ""This orchestrated attack comes a day after the minister of interior failed to convince parliament that the emergency law must be reinstated in order to maintain stability in Egypt,"" said Ahmed Fawzy, an Al-Ahly soccer fan who has participated in the protests against both Mubarak and the military council that once reported to him. On television talk shows, analysts and anchors discussed the massacre, but few could explain why so many fans had died. Why deadly riots go beyond football . Interior ministry officials blamed the referee for failing to stop the match earlier as signs of violence against players and between the fans became clear. ""There were organized groups in the crowds that purposely provoked the police all through the match and escalated the violence and stormed onto the field after the final whistle,"" said Gen. Marwan Mustapha of Egypt's interior ministry. ""Our policemen tried to contain them but not engage."" New violence erupted Thursday in Cairo, where protesters confronted police near the Interior Ministry headquarters. At least 900 people were hurt in clashes near the ministry, officials reported. Protesters remained in the area early Friday. Egypt has recently experienced a breakdown in security, with several armed robberies, kidnappings and random killings taking place across the country in the past week alone. A French tourist was caught in crossfire and killed in Sinai during an armed robbery at a foreign currency exchange, an HSBC bank was robbed in broad daylight, and a busy Cairo street was blocked by families of an angry bus driver who was shot dead by another angry driver. Bedouins from Sinai also kidnapped 25 Chinese workers for 24 hours on Tuesday, releasing them only after the military promised to retry five inmates on death row for their role in the 2004-06 bombings in Sharm El Sheikh in Sinai. Parliament held an emergency session on Thursday to discuss the sporting tragedy, while Egypt's military junta has announced three days of mourning. Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri suspended Port Said's security chief and the head of police investigation. The two men will face an inquiry. Ganzouri also accepted the resignation of Port Said's governor. It remains to be seen now whether the Port Said massacre further stirs tensions that were already high after the first anniversary of the January 25 uprising.

"Washington (CNN) -- Before Tuesday night's debate, polls showed Mitt Romney had gained ground with women voters. But his comments about using ""whole binders full of women"" as a hiring aid while governor, whiffing on an equal pay law question, and alluding to helping women get home to cook dinner has landed the GOP presidential hopeful in verbal quicksand with some female voters. He'll have to do some serious repair to regain traction, political experts say. Online erupts over 'Binders full of women' That's because Tuesday night's debate made clear that both presidential campaigns are focusing on female voters Ã¢â¬â a group that makes up the majority of the electorate. Some of the spiciest exchanges between the candidates in their second debate were over so-called ""women's issues."" ""Romney's discussion of his promotion of women in his gubernatorial administration was ... problematic,"" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. ""First, Romney's description of how he found female appointees sounded an awful lot like affirmative action, and someone will bring this up again. Accusations, interruptions define bruising debate . Also, the Twitterverse exploded with links to articles about how Bain Capital under Romney's leadership didn't have a female partner."" The highest-ranking woman in his gubernatorial administration was his No. 2, Lieutenant Gov. Kerry Healey. Beth Myers has long held senior positions in Romney's political campaign. President Barack Obama was quick to use the ""binders"" line against Romney on the campaign trail Wednesday. ""We don't have to collect a bunch of binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women ready to learn and teach in these fields right now,"" Obama told supporters in Mount Vernon, Iowa. Vice President Joe Biden at a campaign event Wednesday in Greeley, Colorado, questioned where Romney's comments were coming from. ""What I can't understand is how he has gotten in this sort of 1950s time warp in terms of women,"" he said. Romney responded on Twitter: @MittRomney ""I understand the challenges women face and want to make it easier for them in the workplace."" 'Romney just can't connect with working women' During the debate at Hofstra University in New York, Romney, who worked in business before serving as governor of Massachusetts, said he ""learned a great deal"" about the inequalities between men and women in the workplace when leading his state. When he and his staff ran into problems finding qualified female applicants to fill cabinet posts, Romney said he ""went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks,' and they brought us whole binders full of women."" Undecided women voters who were watching the debate and participating in a focus group in Ohio reacted positively to Romney's anecdote during dial-testing for CNN. The responses from the women jumped sharply on-screen when Romney spoke about workplace flexibility. 25 funniest debate tweets . The tweets, posts and pictures quickly exploded on the internet. Before the debate ended, there were Twitter hashtags and handles, a series of memes on Tumblr, and a Facebook page with over 100,000 fans. The ""binders full of women"" phrase was the third-fastest rising search on Google during the debate. Romney's comments 'extremely offensive to women' Not to be outdone or out-messaged, the Romney campaign put out an ad as the debate wrapped up, clarifying the GOP nominee's support for contraception and belief that in some cases abortion should be legal. But there is a lingering perception behind the comedic Internet takes on Romney's ""binders full of women"" response and pre-emptive advertising aimed at women that he is disconnected from the day-to-day issues facing that critical group of voters. And in a close election, that type of narrative could be a problem for Romney as he fights to woo a narrow pool of voters. 5 things we learned from the debate . ""The gap between Obama and Romney was declining and I'm not sure ... if the governor made significant headway (with women voters),"" said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra. A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted last week showed Romney had closed the gap with women and was within one point among women who are likely voters, 48% for Romney and 49% for Obama. Throughout the debate, Obama and Democrats sought to reverse that trend and widen that gap. Obama tried to draw a distinction between himself and Romney on a number of women's issues, tying equal pay, contraceptives and health care to the economy. Obama said his administration's Affordable Care Act gives insured women free contraception coverage and asserted that Romney ""feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making."" Romney reacts to frenzy over 'binders' comment . Romney pushed back, calling the president's statement ""completely and totally wrong."" While not opposing the availability of contraception, Romney opposes the contraception rule, arguing it forces some religious institutions to go against their faith. After the debate, Democratic pundits criticized Romney's efforts to hire women. ""What it demonstrates here and why these debates are important because they're a window into what people are really thinking and how they operate,"" former Clinton adviser and Democratic analyst Richard Socarides said on CNN's Early Start. ""Here's a situation where, you know, it should have been readily apparent to anyone that there were plenty of qualified women but they had to make this special effort."" Socarides gave Romney points for trying to hire women but said in doing so, ""Romney demonstrates that he's living in another world.""""Qualified women should be apparent to everyone,"" added Socarides. He said he didn't understand why Romney ""has to go out and make this special effort to find women."" And though Romney sought to highlight his support of flexible work schedules for women, his reference to women who need such schedules to race home to make dinner for their families may have ruffled some female voters the wrong way. Opinion: Romney's empty 'binders full of women' ""His discussion of work-life balance appeared condescending to some because of the reference to women cooking dinner,"" Gillespie said. Romney will now have to rebuff the Obama campaign's attempts to define him as someone who is anti-woman, political experts say. Romney campaign surrogate Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, said one reason more women may be looking to vote for Romney is because of his economic message. ""The Number One issue with women is jobs and the economy,"" Blackburn said on CNN's Early Start recently. The former governor will have to do more of this type of messaging if he wants to sway this group, Bose said. Romney, she said, will have to hammer home the message ""what's good for women is good for the country."" Roundup: 10 takes on the second presidential debate .

"(CNN) -- Iran's controversial nuclear program began more than 50 years ago with aid from the West. Now, despite Iran's assurances that its program is purely peaceful, some Western countries, the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency say they're concerned that Iran wants to use the program to create a nuclear weapon.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A judicial council on Thursday admonished the chief judge of the nation's largest federal appeals court for having ""sexually explicit photos and videos"" on his personal Web site, but decided against any further punishment. The panel chose not to discipline Judge Alex Kozinski beyond the admonishment. Judge Alex Kozinski, 58, of the San Francisco, California-based 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals previously apologized and had recommended an investigation because of the public controversy over the material. A panel of judges assigned to investigate concluded Kozinski's ""possession of sexually explicit offensive material combined with his carelessness in failing to safeguard his sphere of privacy was judicially imprudent."" His actions, the panel wrote, ""can reasonably be seen as having resulted in embarrassment to the institution of the federal judiciary."" But Kozinski was not disciplined because he had removed himself from an ongoing obscenity trial when news broke of the visual material on alex.kozinski.com, which the judge launched in 2002, according to the 41-page opinion issued by the judicial council. According to the council's written opinion, the material included a photograph of naked women painted like dairy cows, a woman shaving her pubic hair, and a video of a half-dressed man ""cavorting with a sexually aroused farm animal."" Kozinski testified to a judicial conduct panel that much of the material was ""like odd things that I've thrown into a room without looking at them."" He said some of the files were e-mailed by friends, much of which he did not bother to view. He admitted storing some of the sexually explicit photos, but said, ""I don't know why I kept them."" The judge also said he never considered his site public and thought he had blocked access to the subcategory file in question, which was labeled ""stuff."" There was no immediate reaction from Kozinski or his lawyer to the panel's admonishment. Kozinski had earlier apologized to the investigative panel for his ""unfortunate carelessness."" ""I have caused embarrassment to the federal judiciary,"" he said. ""And thus whatever shame was cast on me personally, it reflected on my colleagues and our system of justice as well."" The controversy erupted when Kozinski was about to serve as a trial judge -- separate from his work on the higher appeal court -- in a 2008 obscenity prosecution of adult film producer Ira Isaacs. Kozinski recused himself when the Los Angeles TImes published a story about the Web site material, and he later asked for a probe into the incident. The Isaacs case has not gone to trial, but is on appeal over pending motions at the 9th Circuit. Kozinski is not expected to take part in the matter. Kozinski is one of the most colorful and outspoken members of the federal bench. Born in Communist Romania, he emigrated to the United States at age 12 and still speaks with an Eastern European accent. His parents were Holocaust survivors. He was named to his current seat in 1985 by President Reagan, and he was the youngest federal appeals judge in the nation at the time. A mainstream Jewish conservative with libertarian views on free speech, the judge is admired for his writing skills, intellectual curiosity and sense of humor. He is also one of the few federal judges who will do press interviews, speaking with CNN on several occasions about a variety of topics. He also wrote an online ""diary"" for Slate.com a few years ago. He is especially outspoken in oral arguments on his appeals court, and his detractors say he tends to dominate the questioning, often to the dismay of his fellow judges.","Alex Kozinski is chief judge of the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals .

"(CNN) -- It's not a good week to be a celebrity cell phone. But before we even begin to dive into that world, let's go into a different preventive exercise that you'll thank me for later: Take your cell phone out. Go into the media library that stores your photos. Among the pics of your pet and that amazing plate of spaghetti from that fancy dinner, find the incriminating ones you wouldn't want a soul seeing. Erase them. Do the same with text messages. All set? Good. Now we can carry on with a feeling of safety while immersing ourselves deeper into the story at hand. On Wednesday, two of Hollywood's hottest young stars -- Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis -- reportedly found themselves at the center of a cell phone hacking scandal that is said to have eventually made its way all the way to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI could not confirm the name of specific hacking victims, and a representative said in a statement that ""The FBI is investigating the person or group responsible for computer intrusions of high-profile figures, but due to it being an ongoing investigation, we're not at liberty to confirm specific victims or the number of victims."" Neither Johansson nor Kunis has confirmed that their phones have been hacked. For Johansson, alleged nude photos zoomed across the Internet after they were allegedly stolen from her cell phone. And while there is supposedly only one photo of Kunis taken from her phone, it's the alleged photos and texts to and from Justin Timberlake that are causing a stir. Kunis and Timberlake had definite on-screen chemistry in ""Friends with Benefits,"" a film about, well, friends who sleep together. Pretty much anyone with knowledge of Hollywood or celebrities thought something was going on there. With every media interview, the two joked and feigned a flirty relationship that raised eyebrows. Then, the media blitz ended, Timberlake was spotted again with ex Jessica Biel, and that was that. That was until Wednesday, when reports of alleged stolen cell phone photos from Kunis' phone reportedly of Timberlake -- one where he's said to have a pair of underwear on his head -- started surfacing. As of early Thursday, said photos -- if they actually exist -- had not yet surfaced. In unrelated, but still relevant, cell phone hacking news, Sienna Miller for the first time opened up this week about how she was a victim of the massive News of the World phone hacking scandal that invaded the lives and communications of several celebrities, politicians and families of murder victims. When stories began hitting newsstands that clearly no one could possibly know about aside from Miller and her closest confidants, she said on ""Today,"" she became ""incredibly paranoid"" because she felt ""everything is compromised enormously. ... It had a huge impact on relationships, friendships and my career."" While Miller's case is far different from the alleged cases of Johansson and Kunis, all of this hacking raises the question: How can situations like this be prevented? Here are a few suggestions, ideas and thoughts* that can help not only the celebrities involved, but, in one scenario, might also aid our struggling economy. (And before you let loose in the comments, be aware that the tongue was firmly in the cheek when these were written.): . Ã¢âÂ  Build a government-run celebrity cell phone network: Just like you and me, celebrities have cell phone contracts with the same old protections of non-celebs. Well, they (clearly) need better mobile security. So, take whatever cell phone system the CIA, FBI and military operate on -- with all of the necessary security measures in place -- build an offshoot version of it only for celebrities, and charge them an exorbitant amount of money each month for it. In fact, charge them based on how scandalous the content on the phone is. The more nude pics or salacious texts you have, the higher your monthly rate. The money goes straight to the government, their nude photos stay safe, and our national debt just got lessened. U.S.A! U.S.A! Ã¢âÂ  Walkie-talkies and CBs: If the technology of today makes it easy for scandals of this nature to occur, people of importance should turn back the clock and embrace the old school. Trouble ensues when your phone doubles as a portable hard drive for photos and other potential red flags. A walkie-talkie doesn't. Hey, get a beeper while you're at it. The worst thing that can happen there is someone texts you ""58008."" Ã¢âÂ  Make cell phone hacks an act of terrorism: Somewhere, the hacker behind the celebrity stings is laughing and living it up after exposing the lives of people in the spotlight. One surefire way to stop him/her and 99% of the others from trying to continue the art of the hack? Those so-called ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques. Answer this: Would you post a nude photo of someone if it meant potentially being waterboarded and slapped repeatedly? Didn't think so. *Or just don't take/have/send things like this on your phone.","There are reports of alleged stolen cell phone photos of Justin Timberlake .

"(CNN) -- Cyclist Lance Armstrong will not cooperate with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's investigation of performance-enhancing drug use in the sport, an Armstrong attorney said Wednesday. USADA had given Armstrong -- who publicly admitted such drug use last month -- until Wednesday to decide whether he would cooperate under oath with investigators as part of a possible path to altering his USADA-imposed lifetime competition ban. ""Lance will not participate in USADA's efforts to selectively conduct American prosecutions that only demonize selected individuals while failing to address the 95% of the sport over which USADA has no jurisdiction,"" Armstrong attorney Tim Herman said in a written statement Wednesday. USADA CEO Travis Tygart issued a statement Wednesday saying that ""over the last few weeks (Armstrong) has led us to believe that he wanted to come in and assist USADA, but was worried of potential criminal and civil liability if he did so."" ""Today we learned from the media that Mr. Armstrong is choosing not to come in and be truthful and that he will not take the opportunity to work toward righting his wrongs in sport,"" Tygart said. ""At this time we are moving forward with our investigation without him and we will continue to work closely with (the World Anti-Doping Agency) and other appropriate and responsible international authorities to fulfill our promise to clean athletes to protect their right to compete on a drug-free playing field."" Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles by international cycling's governing body in October after a damning report by USADA accused him and his team of the ""most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program"" in cycling history. He first admitted using performance-enhancing drugs and blood doping during a January television interview with Oprah Winfrey. The USADA banned Armstrong, 41, for life but said the ban could be reduced to eight years if he cooperated under oath with investigators. Armstrong's competitive cycling career is long over, but he moved on to triathlons and won several of them in 2012. The agency initially gave Armstrong a February 6 deadline before extending it by two weeks. CNN's Jason Morris, Wayne Sterling and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Agency had given cyclist until Wednesday to decide whether he would cooperate under oath .

"(CNN) -- Celebrity publicist Max Clifford was charged Friday with 11 counts of indecent assault against a girl under the age of 16 as part of an investigation into sex abuse allegations against the late British TV presenter Jimmy Savile, according to the Metropolitan Police Service. Clifford was arrested in December on suspicion of sex offenses in connection with the investigation -- dubbed Operation Yewtree -- into numerous allegations made against Savile and others following a documentary that aired in October. In the documentary, several people came forward alleging Savile abused them. The charges against Clifford, who has previously said the claims were ""totally untrue,"" include allegations of sex abuse that date between 1966 and 1985, the police said in a statement. Clifford has been ordered to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on May 28 to answer the charges. Police set up Operation Yewtree to investigate sexual abuse claims after a documentary by broadcaster ITV in October unleashed a flood of allegations against the star, who before that was seen primarily as an eccentric but charismatic man who raised millions of pounds for charity. The investigation has three strands, one involving claims against just Savile, another involving ""Savile and others,"" and the third involving only ""others."" The earliest claim against Savile dates back to 1955 and the latest from 2009, when he was in his 80s. Savile, a popular BBC television personality with his trademark white-blonde hair, was the face of the shows ""Top of the Pops"" and ""Jim'll Fix It."" He died in 2011.

"(CNN) -- Everything may be bigger in Texas, but it's not all cowboy boots and big hair in Dallas. Streets of Sparkle fashion blogger Jaclyn Welch won't be stopping to snap a photo of stereotypical style any time soon. ""Your big hair? Not getting on here!"" Welch said, laughing. ""It's the football season look: cowboy boots, jean shorts. But the great thing about Dallas, since we have the stereotype in place already, is that you can get away with wearing cowboy boots."" Instead, the downtown Dallas scene is all about dressing to the nines in designer duds. Welch uses her blog to celebrate the flashy and classy women who treat the sidewalks as their stage. Even in the extreme summer swelter, Dallasites won't be caught without their heels and decadent ensembles. ""It's like a Southern preppy twist, depending on the neighborhood,"" Welch said. ""Everyone is wearing some sort of a classic piece. It's a Neiman Marcus/J. Crew mix."" Below, Welch explains the Dallas look. CNN: What's the style vibe in Dallas? Welch: People's perception of Dallas is really funny when they've never been here. And when they come here, I guess they don't expect women to shop -- like we're all walking around in cowboy boots. Neiman Marcus was started here, so that's the vibe. The women here love to dress up. It's very classy, mixed with flashy -- a timeless look with a statement piece, like your shoes or a bag. Women here really appreciate that one designer piece. A lot of people in Dallas aren't from the area, so it's a lot of bringing things in and mixing with what we already have. Colorful layers of style on Chicago's streets . CNN: In addition to Neiman Marcus, what other stores are popular for Dallasites? Welch: Forty Five Ten brings in a lot of designers that you can't find anywhere. Our vintage stores are really good: Lula B's, Dolly Python, Buffalo Exchange. We are a one-stop shopping type of people -- so NorthPark Center is where most Dallasites shop (they have everything, including our very first H&M, opening in August). CNN: The temperatures are spiking in Dallas. How has that affected the street style? Welch: The funny thing is, it's 104 degrees and women still put in the effort to look good. To me, it's kind of a celebration of style in this weather. The vibe is always going to be the same, and it's a polished look. Here's the thing about Dallas: Everyone is getting in their cars and walking into air-conditioned buildings, so it's really hard to do a street style blog here. It's not like Chicago or New York, with tons of people passing you by. You have to wait around and see what you find. Get smart: Portland street style . CNN: How do you approach people to take their picture? Welch: In Texas, we like to talk a lot, so everyone I stop has a story about what they're wearing. Every piece is like a drawn-out conversation. A lot of street style blogs are just about the photography. For me, it's the entire experience -- having that moment with someone and paying them a compliment, which is maybe a Southern way of doing things. Dallas women, because they dress up, want to be seen. When you walk up to them, and they got dressed for a reason today, they want somebody to say, ""you look good."" Imagine going your whole day and you're like, ""I look so fabulous and not one person has told me I look good."" Then, imagine the day when somebody wants to take your picture. I think of it as ""this is your moment, make it yours."" That's how it is in Texas. Fashion from Tokyo to Toronto . CNN: What made you want to begin street style blogging? Welch: It was always about the person, celebrating women who take the time to dress up and look good. I approach the people that I want to ask, ""where did you get that?"" It's me communicating with them, asking what they do, where they're from and then talking about the style in itself. I like the stories behind everything. It's my favorite part, like a treasure hunt. There are a lot of people that I think look great and I don't take their picture. So it's not always about that, but an attitude you get from them. It's walking down the street and whatever makes me go ""whoa."" First, it's ""what are you wearing?"" and then, ""who are you, what's the rest of the story?"" It's not all country in Nashville .","Jaclyn Welch's street style blog shines the spotlight on Dallas' flashy fashion .

"(CNN) -- Odds bodkins, but this medieval romp is a strange and sorry beast, a one-eyed monster so starved of mirth it devours its own tail. Insert a modern expletive or three in an affected English accent and that line gives you the gist of the film ""Your Highness"" and its one and only comic idea, which is to recreate the rollicking sword and sorcery adventures of yore, and punch them up with anachronistic vulgarities and stoner jokes. It's not a very original idea. If you've seen ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" or Rowan Atkinson's ""Blackadder,"" you might not be averse to it in principle. Alas, ""Your Highness"" isn't a worthy comparison of such illustrious predecessors. This misbegotten enterprise Â­Â­-- a collaboration too far between actor/screenwriter Danny McBride (""Eastbound and Down"") and ""Pineapple Express"" director David Gordon Green Â­-- is such an egregious waste of talent it might send unsuspecting audiences rushing out to give ""Sucker Punch"" a second chance. Maybe Snyder's folly wasn't so bad after all? McBride and Green go way back. The actor was credited as assistant director on Green's first feature, ""George Washington,"" and played a supporting role in his second, ""All the Real Girls,"" opposite Zooey Deschanel Â­who plays the virgin Belladonna here. Ten years ago these young filmmakers wanted to make art. Now McBride is sticking a dismembered Minotaur's sex organ in Deschanel's eager face. How far they've come! Then there's James Franco, as McBride's good-looking older brother, Prince Fabious, and Natalie Portman as the bloodthirsty archer, Isabel. You might briefly wonder if the movie isn't some hideously elongated Oscar skit gone horribly, horribly wrong, not least because Franco seems to be sleepwalking through this gig too. But even the Oscar telecast seemed shorter in comparison. The pity of it is, there's nothing wrong with the narrative framework. The brothers are forced on a quest to vanquish an evil warlock (Justin Theroux, not so bad) and save Belladonna from a fate worse than death. Let's note in passing, the film is also very handsomely designed by Mark Tildesley (""28 Days Later""). According to McBride, they pitched it as ""Krull"" meets ""Barry Lyndon,"" which is a better one-liner than anything that found its way into the script. The old school special effects work is artful and amusing, with several affectionate nods to the influence of veteran stop-motion maestro Ray Harryhausen. A five-headed dragon transfigured from a magician's hand is especially ingenious. If they had only had the courage of their convictions and stuck with a tongue in cheek tribute to those innocent fantasy movies, they might just have had something here. But the relentlessly smutty, lazy and above all unfunny innuendos (if a single entendre counts as an innuendo?) drain all the life out of it. As for the ""Barry Lyndon"" reference, presumably that springs from the film's Emerald Isle locations, but Stanley Kubrick must be spinning in his grave. Green and McBride are talented and energetic enough to get past a misfire like this, but that doesn't make ""Your Highness"" any less of a travesty. They should be royally ashamed of themselves, and at the very least, sent off to bed after a jolly good spanking.","""Your Highness"" is a medieval romp starring Natalie Portman and James Franco .

"London (CNN) -- Music stars including Pete Townshend of The Who, Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand and Corinne Bailey Rae called on Russia to free three members of the punk rock band Pussy Riot, who are on trial in Moscow on hooliganism charges. The musicians said the charge was ""preposterous,"" arguing that artists ""make legitimate political protest and fight for freedom of speech."" The Pussy Riot members went on trial Monday, charged with hooliganism after performing a song criticizing President Vladimir Putin in one of Moscow's grandest cathedrals, Russia's state news agency reported. ""Mother Mary please drive Putin away,"" the band screamed, their faces covered in neon masks, inside Christ Savior Cathedral in February. Three were arrested soon after. The charge carries a potential seven-year sentence. Putin is visiting London on Thursday, Pussy Riot's celebrity backers noted as they urged him to ""ensure these three women receive a fair trial."" ""We are especially concerned about recent reports that food is being withheld from them and that they have appeared in court in a cage,"" their supporters said in a letter to the Times of London. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, Maria Alyokhina, 24, and Yekaterina Samutsevich, 29, grinned at cameras and waved their handcuffed arms behind their backs Monday as police brought them from a van into the court. They appeared in court in an enclosure that forced them to bend down to speak through small window to be heard. The women apologized to Orthodox Christian believers if they felt they had been insulted, state news agency RIA-Novosti reported. The trial is taking place at the Khamovnichesky Court, the agency said. Read more: Jailed punk band Pussy Riot pushes free speech limits in Russia . Amnesty International said Monday the trial ""never should have taken place."" John Dalhuisen of Amnesty said the singers had been making ""a legitimate protest -- this is not a criminal offense. They must be released immediately."" ""They dared to attack the two pillars of modern Russian establishment -- the Kremlin and the Orthodox Church. While many may have found their act offensive, the sentence of up to seven years in prison they may expect on the charges of hooliganism is wildly out of all proportion,"" he said. Pussy Riot specializes in sudden, often illegal public performances, including one in Moscow's Red Square. The punk prayer was inspired by the women's anger about the relationship between the Russian government and the Orthodox Church, according to their manager, Tolokonnikova's husband. The Orthodox leader Patriarch Kyril has been widely reported as saying Putin's years in power have been a miracle from God. The band's behavior in one of Russia's most sacred cathedrals has outraged many of the country's faithful. ""This is a disgusting thing to do,"" one woman told CNN. ""They should go to jail,"" said another. ""A year or two. Let them think about their behavior."" But even some of those who were offended believe the women should not be in jail. ""If necessary, God will punish them,"" said one man. ""It must be not be cruel punishment.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When Scarlett Johansson was hired by Woody Allen for the film ""Match Point"" in 2005, she was a last-minute replacement. Penelope Cruz, left, Scarlett Johansson and Woody Allen pose at the ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" premiere. Now Johansson is Allen's leading lady of choice, following in the footsteps of Louise Lasser, Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow. The actress stars in her third Allen film, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" set to be released Friday. And her role as Cristina is nothing short of anticipated -- mostly because of buzz about her steamy love scenes with co-stars Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. In the movie, Johansson and actress Rebecca Hall play, respectively, Cristina and Vicky. The two spend a summer vacationing in Spain where they meet a passionate artist (Bardem) and his slightly crazy ex-wife (Cruz). The love triangle that results is classic Woody Allen. ""[The movie is] about how hard it is to find love in the world, and how many traps and pitfalls there are,"" Allen said. ""And how many problems we make for ourselves.""  Watch the cast of ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" talk about the movie Â» . In other words, his ""usual negative spiel,"" he said. CNN talked to Johansson about why she loves working with Allen, what it was like to kiss Cruz and the public's ""crazy"" reaction to her Barack Obama support. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: I think I'm going to start off with the question that's on everyone's mind. What was it like to kiss Penelope Cruz? Scarlett Johansson: It was a lot less hairy than kissing Javier Bardem, I will say that. It's so unsexy when you're actually doing it because there's like 60 crew members eating their lunch, you know, trying to catch a bite while you're doing the scene. I think that it felt very normal. These two characters are in love with each other and it's romance. It's not some gratuitous make-out session. I mean it was part of our characters' lives, their development. CNN: Well, this is your third time working with Woody Allen, and I'm convinced that there's something in your clause that says you have to do at least one Woody Allen film per year. Johansson: I so wish that I could have that kind of contract. I would do craft service [movie catering] for Woody. I would do anything for him. He is so much fun to work with because, you know, we're friends, and it's like I come into work every day and you're working with people that you love, and you know, we have almost a silent communication between us. CNN: Had you ever met Javier or Penelope at all? Johansson: I met Penelope before, but only outside of work. I met her socially, but I didn't really know her. And Javier, I don't think I had ever met him. You know we're going into this really intimate relationship, all three of us, and we all fell so easily into that pattern. Penelope and Javier are both the sweetest. Of course, every woman on the side is charmed by Javier. He's so charismatic ... and Penelope's like this little firecracker. So the three of us just had such a wonderful time and really just enjoyed the scenes that we had together because we were able to improvise. We were able to really have an interesting dynamic between us. CNN: What was the one thing that lured you to this film? Was there one thing, other than Woody Allen, that made you say, ""This is something I really want to do?"" Johansson: I think that I could not necessarily relate to, but I had an understanding of my character when I read the script. I would never do a film unless I could imagine myself playing the part and I had an idea. I kind of knew her, or I felt like I could get into that mindset, and that was the lure -- other than of course all the other things you mentioned, like Woody, Barcelona, Penelope, Javier ... ahh, like I said, I'd do the craft service. CNN: You are quite the busy actress. [You just got] engaged, you've got ""She's Not That Into You"" coming out. How are you doing it all? Johansson: Well, [the film is] finished and it's going to be released, I think, in February. And also I have ""The Spirit"" coming out in December, and I just directed a short. So it's a lot, you know, but this is my work. This is what I love to do. It's my job and it's what I've always been passionate about -- performance and being collaborative and creative. I mean, that's what I thrive on. CNN: Are you going to be able to squeeze any time to go to the [Democratic Convention]? I know you're a Barack Obama supporter. Johansson: I'm not exactly sure if I'm going to go yet. I have a lot of friends that are going, of course, and I'm very, very excited to see him accept the nomination. I can't wait to hear the speech. I know a lot of people feel that way. CNN: There's been so much fallout ever since you mentioned your name with Barack Obama. (There was some minor clucking in late spring when Johansson said she and the candidate had exchanged e-mail messages.) What do you think of that? Johansson: It is crazy. I think that it's, you know, it's strange. I've been supporting Obama for years, and always, I think like a lot of his supporters, always wanted him to run ... please run, please run! And then when he finally did run, [I wanted to do] anything I could do, any way I could be associated and help out. It's funny how the media has twisted it around in like some crazy way, but I will continue obviously to be a surrogate and do fundraising and all of that stuff. I'm a huge, huge supporter.","Scarlett Johansson stars as free-spirited Cristina in ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona""

"(CNN) -- ""Precious,"" a movie about a 1980s-era Harlem teen who strives to overcome abuse, neglect and illiteracy, pulled five Independent Spirit Award nominations Tuesday morning. Stars Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique were both recognized for their portrayals of a mother and daughter in a dysfunctional relationship, with a best female lead nomination for newcomer Sidibe and a best supporting female nomination for Mo'Nique. The film's success is not entirely a surprise, considering that the Oprah Winfrey- and Tyler Perry-backed Sundance darling has earned $27 million at the domestic box office and was received well by audiences during its slow rollout in cities across the nation in November. Sidibe's work in ""Precious"" has been one of the breakout roles of the year, and the young actress is rumored to be the star of a new series, ""The C Word."" However, it hasn't been all smooth for ""Precious"": The film earned zero nominations for the Gotham Independent Film Awards, which were given out Monday night. The Gotham awards are a New York-based indie film honor. ""The Hurt Locker,"" by contrast, took home two Gotham awards Monday night, one for best picture and the other for best ensemble. There were no Independent Spirit Award nominations for this Iraq war drama, however, as it was nominated last year. For the Spirits, ""Precious"" is facing off against the Zooey Deschanel-driven ""(500) Days of Summer,"" ""Amreeka,"" ""The Last Station"" and ""Sin Nombre"" for best picture. ""Summer"" also snagged a nomination for best male lead, a nod for Joseph Gordon-Levitt. On top of the best picture nomination, ""The Last Station"" -- a biographical piece about Leo Tolstoy featuring James McAvoy, Helen Mirren and Paul Giamatti -- is up for best director, best screenplay, best female lead and best supporting male lead. Christian McKay, another relatively unknown actor in the United States, has gotten lots of love from critics for his portrayal of Orson Welles in Richard Linklater's ""Me and Orson Welles,"" and the Spirit Awards noticed, giving the British actor a nomination for best supporting male performer. In order to be considered, all films had to be 70 minutes long with a budget under $20 million, and had to have screened at one of the major film festivals, such as Sundance or Toronto. The awards ceremony is typically held the Saturday before the Academy Awards, but since the Spirit Awards are celebrating their 25th anniversary in 2010, they're moving out from under Oscar's shadow and will air live on the Independent Film Channel on March 5.","""Precious"" and ""Last Station"" both lead Independent Spirit Award nominations .

"(CNN) -- The accused terrorist who said he was tortured into making a false connection between al Qaeda and Iraq has died in a Libyan prison, human rights monitors said Tuesday. Colin Powell featured Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi's claim in a presentation to the U.N. Security Council. Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi's allegation that Iraqi agents trained al Qaeda operatives in the use of chemical and biological weapons was ""pivotal"" to the Bush administration's case for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, said Stacy Sullivan, a counterterrorism adviser for the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. ""He's a fairly significant figure in the counterterrorism world, and his testimony I would say provided the linchpin for the invasion of Iraq,"" she said. Then-Secretary of State Colin Powell featured al-Libi's claim in the dramatic presentation he made to the U.N. Security Council just weeks before the invasion, citing it as evidence of ties between Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's government and the terrorist network responsible for the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. Al-Libi recanted his account after the invasion, and no other evidence supported the story, the Senate Intelligence Committee reported in 2006. Al-Libi's death was first reported by a Libyan newspaper over the weekend and confirmed by Human Rights Watch researchers Monday, Sullivan said. The newspaper report said he had committed suicide, and the group is asking Libya to conduct a ""full and transparent"" investigation into his death. Researchers from the New York-based organization were ""stunned"" to discover him in a Libyan prison in April during a fact-finding mission to the North African country, Sullivan said. The United States did not transfer al-Libi to the Guantanamo Bay prison camp with other top al Qaeda captives in 2006, and Washington had never confirmed what happened to him, she said. When prison officials pointed out al-Libi to the researchers, he refused to talk to the group. He told them, ""Where were you when I was being tortured in American jails?"" Sullivan said. ""He got really angry and walked away,"" she said. The Libyan newspaper Oea reported Sunday that al-Libi, born Ali Mohammed Abdelaziz al-Fakhry, had committed suicide in a prison cell in his native country. He had been getting regular visits from his family, the last one in late March, the newspaper reported. ""Upon discovering his body, the police and a doctor were dispatched to the prison immediately to start the investigation,"" Oea reported. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the United States was investigating the report, but had no immediate comment. ""I have to refer you to the government of Libya for any details regarding the matter,"" he said. Al-Libi had trained al Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan and was captured in Pakistan in late 2001, according to the Intelligence Committee report. After the invasion of Iraq, he said his statements connecting Iraq to al Qaeda had been made in response to threats by American interrogators and by beatings at the hands of intelligence agents in Egypt, where he was transferred in 2002. ""I think he would be able to tell us more about the secret CIA prison program and the rendition program,"" Sullivan said. Al-Libi told the CIA in 2004 that he had made up the story ""in order to gain better treatment"" and avoid being shipped to Egypt, the Intelligence Committee reported. Egypt denies wrongdoing, but was widely believed to have tortured prisoners in its custody, according to an April report from the Senate Armed Services Committee. As early as February 2002, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency warned that al-Libi ""was likely intentionally misleading his debriefers,"" the Intelligence Committee report states. The CIA supported al-Libi's account, but added language to its January 2003 assessment noting that he would not have had first-hand knowledge of any weapons training, according to the committee. The Bush administration argued that the invasion of Iraq was necessary because Iraq was concealing chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs from international inspectors and could have shared those weapons with terrorists. No such stockpiles were found after the invasion, and the independent commission that investigated the 2001 attacks found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the two entities. CNN's Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","Accused terrorist said he was tortured into saying Iraqis trained al Qaeda operatives .

"Boston (CNN) -- The closed shops and empty streets that once gave Boston the feel of a ghost town teemed with life again Saturday as a cold morning rain stirred residents to grumble about a more familiar New England grievance: The weather. Yet for many across the region, Monday's marathon attacks and a terrorist manhunt spurred changes more subtle and difficult to quantify than those wrought by the deadly force of two bombs that detonated near the finish line. The manhunt spanned Boston and its surrounding suburbs, riveting the nation and deepening concerns about the origins of the attack and the likelihood of another. ""I think I understand a little better how people feel in other countries that go through this,"" said Debby Singh, 39, who had huddled in her Watertown apartment as authorities combed the area in search of the suspected bomber. ""We were just so paranoid."" 'A million questions' for bombing suspect . Others said the experience offered a rare front-row seat to a phenomenon unfamiliar to most American cities, tested their faith or simply reminded them of life's fragility. ""Never have I seen anything like this,"" said Watertown resident Tony Paulino, as businesses shuttered and streets closed, leaving many to wonder how long the manhunt would drag on. ""It makes you wonder how safe we all are."" Sara Pradziak also seemed cautious, even after police made an arrest, despite hundreds of college-aged revelers who poured out of their homes Friday evening when the lockdown expired. ""There's always this thing in the back of my head that wonders if all of this is a little premature,"" she said. For Stephen McAlpin, the experience of crouching in his bathtub with his wife, Emily, as bullets whizzed through his Watertown home left him tired and still shaken a day later. ""There's no real going back to normal after something like this,"" he said. ""It feels today like we're waking up from a nightmare."" As Boston reeled, younger suspect partied . As the overnight shoot-out unfolded between police and suspected terrorists, the couple had been directly in the line of fire. ""I knew that I couldn't protect her,"" he said. ""There was nothing I could do."" When it was all over, shell casings littered his front yard and seven bullet holes were scattered across his home, including one in his living room that left his television shattered. At least one other round pierced the walls of his neighbor's home and blasted harmlessly into their children's bedroom. ""It's terrifying to hear about something like that,"" McAlpin added, saying the shootings had forced things into perspective. ""In the midst of feeling really safe, there was this reality yesterday that we could die from bullets and explosions in our American home,"" he said. ""That's not something you'd expect."" On Saturday, as life returned to normal, local bars and coffee shops in Boston were abuzz with talk more reflective of the nature of the attacks than the specific ways in which the teenager had initially evaded authorities. Manhunt began with intense firefight in dark street . ""We're all still in shock,"" said Ester Maxman, a local resident who had watched Friday as traffic trickled through Boston's normally bustling downtown streets. ""This type of thing just doesn't happen here."" The violence has left many grappling without answers, which President Barack Obama echoed in a hastily arranged address to the nation on Friday night. ""Why did these young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence?"" the president said. ""How did they plan and carry out these attacks? And did they receive any help? The families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers."" By Saturday afternoon, security across Boston remained tight. Checkpoints were still visible in parts of the city, as were flower memorials set up near the marathon finish line, where three people suffered fatal wounds and more than 170 were injured. But at Fenway Park, in an attempt to regain a sense of normalcy, more than 35,000 Red Sox fans bellowed out the lyrics to their eighth-inning signature tune, ""Sweet Caroline,"" led personally in a surprise appearance by Neil Diamond. ""I bring love from the whole country,"" the 72-year-old singer told the crowd, drawing raucous cheers. The Sox then rallied to beat the Kansas City Royals after trailing 2-1 in the top of the eighth.

"Beijing (CNN) -- The death toll from earthquakes that rocked southwest China rose to 80 on Saturday, after the tremors destroyed roads and communication lines, and forced tens of thousands of evacuations, state media reported. More than 800 others were injured in the Friday quakes, according to Xinhua news agency. Officials fear the death toll may rise as they scramble to reach affected areas. Large rocks blocked roads, and communication lines and other infrastructure were downed, hampering rescue efforts. About 100,000 people have been evacuated and 100,000 others are in need of relocation, state media reported. Premier Wen Jiabao, who will direct rescue efforts, inspected stricken areas Saturday and visited the injured. Initial estimates put the ""direct economic losses"" from the tremors at more than half a billion dollars, the news agency said. The four earthquakes struck near the border of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Their magnitudes ranged between 4.8 and 5.6, according to the U.S. agency. All four quakes struck at a depth of 10 kilometers (six miles). The southwestern region of China is prone to earthquakes. In May 2008, a magnitude 7.9 quake in Sichuan province caused widespread devastation, killing at least 69,000 people.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- In the wake of a teacher misconduct scandal, Los Angeles school officials have referred the discipline cases of 604 teachers from the past four years to state authorities to decide whether the teachers' licenses should also be revoked, a school spokesman said Thursday. Of the 604 cases in which teachers were fired or facing discipline, 60 teachers were accused of sexual misconduct with pupils on or off campus or with minors who weren't students, school officials told CNN. The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing will investigate 366 of the 604 teacher cases, spokeswoman Anne Padilla said on Thursday. Most of the cases focused on allegations of teacher misconduct that involved student safety. The referral of the cases to state licensing investigators is the latest turn in the nation's second largest school system. It has been reeling from a scandal at Miramonte Elementary School, where two teachers have been charged with lewd acts on pupils, including one teacher accused of putting children in adult-like bondage situations and placing semen-filled spoons at their mouths. The lurid allegations prompted an internal review of the system's handling of past teacher misconduct cases, and the district determined that 604 cases needed to be referred to state licensing authorities for review, though ""a substantial number"" of other misconduct cases had already been reported to the state, school officials told CNN. ""Protecting California's schoolchildren is always a priority for the commission. The workload has been a challenge, but a necessary one,"" commission executive director Mary Vixie Sandy said in a statement. The 604 cases include teachers who were disciplined or were about to face discipline since July 2008, according to Ira Berman, Los Angeles Unified School District director of employee relations, and Vivian Ekchian, the district's chief human resources officer. The cases also include teachers who were fired by the school board or who left the district after termination proceedings were initiated or while an allegation of misconduct was pending, Berman and Ekchian said. The system doesn't know whether any of the teachers who were fired or who left the district are still in the classroom in other school districts, according to Berman and Ekchian. The 604 figure also includes teachers who were suspended for 11 days or more for a variety of reasons not involving sexual misconduct with students, the two officials said. ""The safety of our students is our No. 1 priority,"" Ekchian said in explaining why the system referred the 604 cases to the state. The United Teachers Los Angeles, the teachers' union, had no comment Thursday on the school board's action, spokeswoman Marla Eby said. The system's internal investigation arose after parental outrage at Miramonte, where a teacher resigned from the system last year but was not referred to the state for possible license revocation, school district spokesman Tom Waldman said. That person is former teacher Mark Berndt, 61, who pleaded not guilty in February to allegations he bound young students, then photographed them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and three-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces, among other graphic depictions. ""We had not informed Sacramento to revoke Mr. Berndt's credentials,"" Waldman said. Berndt's teaching credentials have been suspended, Padilla said. Berndt is being held on $23 million bond and faces 23 counts of lewd acts on a child. The 23 victims were between 7 and 10 years old, and all but two of them were girls, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. Authorities have said they have discovered roughly 600 images allegedly taken by Berndt in his classroom. Los Angeles School Superintendent John Deasy has said Berndt was removed from his teaching job in January 2011 after school officials learned of the police investigation. A teacher for 30 years, Berndt initially challenged the school district's decision to dismiss him. But he eventually dropped his appeal and resigned last spring. His arrest in January led to a broader fallout over the adequacy of safeguards for the school's students and the prospect of more victims. Days after Berndt was taken into custody, another Miramonte Elementary teacher -- Martin Springer, 49 -- was arrested and charged with three felony counts of lewd acts with a girl younger than 14. He has pleaded not guilty. The school board subsequently shut Miramonte for two days, during which the board reconstituted the entire staff in the 1,400-student school. Miramonte is in unincorporated Los Angeles County within the Florence-Firestone area, about six miles south of downtown Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the California state auditor is going to carry out an emergency $300,000 audit of the Los Angeles Unified School District's actions in managing and documenting child abuse claims, said State Assemblyman Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, who sponsored the performance audit proposal. The incident at Miramonte and similar allegations of child sex abuse at other Los Angeles public schools prompted the audit, Lara said.

"(CNN) -- Rescuers hoping to find two hikers missing on the frigid slopes of Oregon's Mount Hood faced worsening weather conditions Monday night as forecasters predicted white-out conditions that could severely hinder search efforts. ""Starting tonight and through tomorrow, it's going to be windy, and white-out conditions are going to be highly likely,"" said Scott Weishaar of the National Weather Service. Up to 2 feet of snow is expected to fall Monday night into Tuesday at the elevation where rescuers are searching for any signs of Anthony Vietti, 24, and Katie Nolan, 29, who have been missing since early Friday. A third hiker who was with them, 26-year-old Luke Gullberg, was found dead Saturday. A state deputy medical examiner said Monday that the cause was hypothermia, CNN affiliate KGW reported. Rescue crews took advantage of a brief break in the weather Monday afternoon to search previously unreachable higher elevations of the mountain. ""Unfortunately, we did not detect anything out of the ordinary as far as gear or people,"" searcher Monte Smith told reporters. ""With increasing snowfall coming down, it's going to make everything that much harder."" Weishaar said another series of storms Wednesday will dump another 10 inches to 18 inches of snow in the area, with temperatures in the low- to mid-20s. Snow was expected to start falling at 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET). ""We only have today. We know we only have today,"" said Vietti's aunt, Teri Preiss. Rescuers said they were putting no time limit on their efforts, and would do all they could despite the grim forecast. ""This remains a search and rescue mission,"" Clackamas County Detective Jim Strovink told an afternoon news conference. ""We have two experienced climbers who were well-equipped. We have an obligation to continue on and that's what we're going to do. We owe that to the family and we owe that to the climbers."" Search crews will meet Tuesday morning to assess weather conditions and determine how to proceed, the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office said after ending search efforts for the day Monday. Ground efforts have been severely hampered by avalanche conditions, which kept rescuers from accessing the parts of the mountain they wanted to reach early Monday morning. The avalanche threat also thwarted ground searches Sunday, authorities said. Searchers were also examining high-resolution photographs taken by aerial surveillance teams, hoping to find any sign of life. Capt. Chris Bernard of the U.S. Air Force 304th Rescue Squadron said infrared devices are being used as well. If the hikers have gone into a snow cave and have an air vent, the devices could pick up a heat signature, he said. When the three hikers set out at about 1 a.m. Friday (4 a.m. ET), they were planning a fairly easy, ""semi-technical"" hike in which they would come down the south side of the mountain, said Deputy Scott Meyers of the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office. Preiss said pictures show ""it was a perfect climbing day, absolutely clear."" The three hikers sent out a message in advance saying that conditions were ""absolutely perfect"" and that they would be back by late afternoon, she said. ""These kids loved, loved climbing. All three of them. They climbed together often. They climbed hard mountains together before. And they did it successfully and well. And they were careful climbers,"" Preiss said. Dr. Christopher Young with the state medical examiner's office said Gullberg had suffered minor injuries -- cuts, scrapes and bruises -- apparently caused by a fall, KGW reported. Investigators believe the 26-year-old was able to move himself after falling an unknown distance. ""Accidents can happen -- and it happened here,"" Preiss said, describing Gullberg as a ""passionate young man"" who was very well-prepared for all his hikes. David Vahey, a family friend of the Viettis, said, ""We know that they, all three, loved hiking  and they all three loved Jesus. And we just want to ask for prayer."" The three hikers are from the Pacific Northwest. Vietti's home is Longview, Washington; Nolan's is Portland, Oregon. Gullberg was from Des Moines, Washington. Gullberg's MySpace page is filled with photos of him hiking in various places. A friend wrote Saturday on the page, ""I love you dude and miss you."" His grandmother, Marjorie Gullberg, said she will miss his smile. ""He was just like my son. He did everything for me,"" CNN affiliate KPTV quoted her saying. Dennis Simons, a chaplain for the fire and police departments in the city of Sandy, Oregon, spent time with the families of all three on Sunday. ""They're grieving and hoping. There are thousands of people around the world praying that Katie and Anthony will be found alive,"" he told reporters, holding back tears. The mountain rises 11,239 feet above sea level, with a vast base that stretches over 92 miles (148 km). It is the highest mountain in  Oregon. Mount Hood is a dormant volcano with steam constantly spewing from holes, according to the Web site mthood.info. Gullberg's death is the latest of many accidents on Mount Hood, KPTV reported. The worst occurred in May 1986 when nine people, including seven students from Oregon Episcopal School, died after they dug a snow cave during a sudden storm.","""This remains a search and rescue mission,"" Clackamas County detective says .

"(CNN) -- The 152-year-old Melbourne Cup is back on home soil, after a surprise win by Green Moon in Australia's most famous horse race. Bred in Ireland but owned and trained in Australia, Green Moon's victory will be sweet for local horse trainers and racing fans, who have seen the cup go to international entries in recent years. The six-year-old stallion took the winner's share of the AUD6 million (USD6.2 million) prize money, beating Fiorente second and Jakkalberry third. Green Moon was ridden by Hong Kong-based Australian jockey Brett Prebble. The win also marks the fourth time a horse owned by Lloyd Williams, an Australian businessman and property developer, has won the high-stakes contest that is watched by millions across the country. Green Moon was an early contender but questions emerged over his form after a disappointing seventh place at his last race just over a week ago. Six of the eight favorites in this year's race were from overseas and were dubbed by Australian media as ""international invaders."" Last year's winner was Dunaden, a French stallion and another French horse -- Americain -- won the race in 2010. ""There is nothing like winning the Melbourne Cup. The Melbourne cup is Australia,"" says trainer Mark Kavanagh, whose horse Shocking won in 2009. ""Any other race I don't think it would really matter but the Melbourne Cup is such an Australian icon that it is hard for them to stomach that it might be leaving Australian shores,"" he told CNN's Winning Post. Home-grown entries have been overshadowed by foreign contenders as a lucrative prize pot lures horses bred and trained mainly in Europe. The prize money has become all the more tantalizing in the past few years as the Australian dollar has strengthened against other major currencies, making it worth the $150,000 it costs to transport and stable the horses during their stay down under. ""Well they've got to travel half way across the globe, they've got to settle in and they've got to get used to our dry Australian tracks but at the end of the day there is six million Australian dollars waiting for them so there are plenty of them that are going to have a crack,"" Kavanagh said before this year's race. It's hard to overstate the significance of the race in the Australian sporting and social calendar. Imagine the party atmosphere of the Kentucky Derby with the tradition and pageantry of the Grand National and Royal Ascot. A novice's guide to the Melbourne Cup . Held at Flemington Racecourse, the race meet attracts some 100,000 punters dressed in their finest hats and formal attire, along with more comical takes on the occasion. It is also watched by millions at bars, homes and outdoor screens across the country. ""There are race meetings, I understand, in other parts of the world. But no-one promotes their race like we do,"" Robert Doyle, the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, told CNN. ""I mean who else has a public holiday for a horse race? We do and we think it's perfectly natural."" The race, part of a week-long meeting, also has a huge economic impact for the city, with millions bet and more spent. Race goers alone are estimated to spend nearly $30 million during the week, while the carnival and other events that accompany it bring in $350 million, Doyle said. Cup memories: The legs that stopped a nation . British horse trainer Luca Cumani, who has twice narrowly missed out on winning the cup, says another reason why there are more international entries is because European horses tend to be bred for covering longer distances compared to their Australian counterparts. However, he says the international horses have their own obstacles to overcome. The animals have to travel for 50 to 60 hours and then face two weeks of quarantine. Quarantine regulations also make it difficult for international trainers to bring in their own food so the horses have to get used to the local cuisine. ""Which is not a help and they suffer from jetlag just the same as people do and they take quite a while to adjust,"" he told CNN's Winning Post. Kavanagh, like most Australian trainers, is not particularly sympathetic to the foreign horses' plight, but as long as the prize money remains high, it's likely that entrants will come from far and wide.","Green Moon has won Australia's most famous horse race, the Melbourne Cup .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spain's Socialist Prime Minister announced Monday the dissolution of parliament in order to hold early elections on November 20, which polls indicate the opposition conservatives will win handily during Spain's deep economic crisis. Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said last April he would not seek a third term. He has been squeezed by the nation's prolonged economic downturn. The unemployment rate is almost 21%, and almost 5 million are jobless. Numerous opinion polls indicate opposition Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy, 56, has a double-digit lead -- from 10 to 15 percentage points -- over the Socialists. On Monday, Zapatero convened a Cabinet meeting, and the only order of business was to approve a decree to convene early elections on November 20. Zapatero has talked publicly about this for weeks, a sharp change from his stance earlier this year when he said he intended to serve out his full four-year term due to end in March 2012. Rajoy has lost twice to Zapatero, in 2004 and 2008. But his conservative party swept to victory in regional and local elections last May, presaging what the polls predict will be a triumph for Rajoy the third time around. He's a former Cabinet minister under the conservative administration of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar from 1996 to 2004. Rajoy has been criticized for not revealing detailed plans of how to get Spain out of its crisis, especially at a time when financial markets have battered Spain. Many international analysts say Spain could be at even further risk, along with Italy and Portugal, if troubled Greece defaults on its debt. Rajoy said over the weekend that if elected, he would install a 100-day shock plan of ""austerity and efficiency"" so that national, regional and local governments get in step to avoid duplication in spending. The Socialist candidate is Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, 60, who served under Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and most recently under Zapatero, rising to the positions of deputy prime minister and interior minister. He told supporters over the weekend that the elections during this crisis are among the most important in Spain's 30 years of democracy following the death of the long-ruling dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. After the Cabinet meeting on Monday, Zapatero formally informed King Juan Carlos of the decision and then spoke to reporters at the prime minister's compound. ""Today is not a day to take stock of this government,"" Zapatero said in a nationally-televised statement. ""Today is a day to open the balance for the candidates to present their plans and for the people to decide freely about them."" ""I have great confidence in Spain,"" Zapatero added. ""I know that sooner than later we'll get out of these difficulties."" The pre-campaign has been underway for months, but the official campaign will begin on November 4, two weeks before the vote.","Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero convenes a Cabinet meeting Monday .

"(CNN) -- Formula One driver Mark Webber has penned a new deal with Red Bull Racing, extending his contract with the team to the end of the 2013 season. The Australian won his second race of the season at Sunday's rain-soaked British Grand Prix, closing the gap in the drivers' championship between himself and first-placed Fernando Alonso to 13 points. ""I've been with Red Bull Racing since 2007 and have achieved nine grand prix wins during that time,"" Webber told the team's official website. ""I'm high on confidence at the moment and firing on all cylinders. I know the team well and I'm very comfortable here; we have grown together over the years and it feels like absolutely the right thing to stay with Red Bull for another season."" Tire talk: Pirelli takes center stage in F1 . Team principal Christian Horner said of the announcement: ""Much of Mark's Formula One success has been during his time with Red Bull Racing and together we have achieved 10 poles, nine wins and 31 podiums. ""As there was a strong desire from both sides to continue the partnership, it was a logical decision to extend our relationship and it is with great pleasure that we confirm Mark will drive for us in 2013."" Much was made of a possible move to Italian rivals Ferrari at the end of the current season, but Webber has dismissed the speculation, stating: ""There were discussions with Ferrari, but my decision was to stay here."" With the combined efforts of Webber and double world champion Sebastian Vettel, Red Bull currently hold an imperious lead at the top of the constructors' championship, 64 points ahead of Ferrari, who have failed to finish top since 2008. The relationship between the two Red Bull drivers has often been perceived as less than amicable, with tempers flaring when they crashed into each other during the Turkish Grand Prix in 2010. But Webber was quick to dispel any notion of hostilities. On his partnership with the German, Webber said: ""Obviously with Seb, we've worked very, very close together for a long period of time now. I think no-one would really have envisaged how long we have worked together, so that's probably been a bit of a surprise. ""There are not many teammates staying together for that long in Formula One, but it's proved to be a successful partnership with both of us working very hard with the key technical members of the team. ""It's been a potent operation. We're still competitive when we hit the track. Last year there wasn't much racing between Sebastian and I, but in 2009, 2010 and this year, there have been some great battles."" When asked about his future beyond the 2013 season, Webber remained enigmatic. ""It's a results-based sport at the front of the grid so the future lies in my own hands,"" said the 35-year-old. ""It's down to me to deliver the on-track results.""","Aussie Webber will extend his contract by one year .

"(CNN) -- If the name Diana Nyad sounds familiar, it's probably because you've heard of her incredible feats of human performance -- before people like Lance Armstrong and Michael Phelps became household names. Meeting Nyad, it's instantly obvious there's something different about her. By spending just five minutes with her -- or better yet, watching the 62-year-old swim -- you'll know you're in the presence of an amazing athlete. On Sunday, more than 30 years after her last competitive swim, she will once again take to the waters of the Straits of Florida to attempt the 103-mile swim. It's her fourth attempt to claim what she calls the ""Xtreme Dream."" ""I'm feeling some pressure,"" she said in an interview that aired Friday. ""I'm feeling tremendous inner pressure that this has got to be it, this has got to be the last time. ""On the other hand, I have to tell you, I am sky-high excited,"" she said. ""My adrenaline is just pumping out of my skin."" In the 1970s, Nyad was unstoppable. In addition to winning multiple swimming marathons, she was one of the first women to encircle the island of Manhattan, and she holds the world's record for longest ocean swim -- 102.5 miles from the island of Bimini in the Bahamas to Jupiter, Florida. But there was one goal that eluded her. Nyad will continue chasing 'Xtreme dream' ""I'm turning 60, and I thought, 'What have I done with my life? What haven't I done with my life,'"" she said two years ago. ""I started thinking, 'You know what, Diana? You've got to get real with life's lessons; one of which is, you can't go back.'"" But a chance sighting of her own face in the rear view mirror changed her outlook completely. ""I caught my eyes, and I thought, 'Wait a second. There's one thing you actually can go back for' -- and that's the dream swim, which was Cuba to Florida."" Her first attempt was in 1978. ""I remember, I got down to the shore with my six handlers,"" she said. ""We're looking out at a raging sea of whitecaps."" Nyad said her navigator assured her that the seas calmed down almost to the serenity of a skating pond just a few miles out. Unsure, she took his word for it and dove in. ""If you're on the Everest team that's on the penultimate climb, and a storm comes in, you don't say 'What the heck, we're going anyway,"" she said. ""In this swim, we just said, 'What the heck, we're going anyway."" Forty-one hours and 49 minutes later, Nyad's team pulled her out of the sea -- battered, delirious, ravaged by jellyfish, and only 50 miles from where she had started. That left her almost 60 miles from her intended landing spot. The sting of jellyfish, man-of-war and unfulfilled dreams . Last year, Nyad twice met a similar fate. On her first attempt in August, an 11-hour asthma attack and shoulder pain forced Nyad out of the water about 29 hours into her swim. Again in September, it was several stings from Atlantic box jellyfish that ended her quest. This Sunday, for the third time in a year, Nyad will take to the seas -- departing from Havana, Cuba's, Hemingway Marina on a quest to swim for the Florida shore. ""I'm ready for this,"" she said this week. ""We've got the right team. We've got a great weather window coming up, and I'm just picturing that Florida shore and finally getting to those Florida Keys."" ""I've left no stone unturned in training,"" she said two years ago. ""I look at the weather, I look at my team, I look at shark devices, so I'm ready."" Speaking of sharks, Nyad is attempting the swim without a physical shark cage, and she is relying on an electronic shark repellent device and a team of divers to keep them away. Why does she continue to try? ""I would be lying if I said I'd just been stewing over this for 30 years. I really haven't,"" she said previously. ""The issue here isn't as much about making that big athletic dream. Really bigger than that is this existential grappling about being 60."" Nyad's journey: In her own words . She went on to paint a picture of those her age ""back in the day"" as old people -- wrinkled, shriveled up and discarded by society. ""Look at 60-year-olds today. They're not old, and I'm not old,"" she said previously. ""I'm not as fast as I used to be, I'll admit that,"" she said this week. ""But I actually feel a little more powerful. I don't feel as quick, but I feel more powerful. ""And in terms of mind, I'm just a calmer person,"" she said. ""I take things in stride. I used to get very angry if the weather didn't turn out the way I wanted it to ... I didn't think it was fair. I realize at this late stage in life that not everything is fair, and I accept things more readily."" ""I'm older than I was, yes,"" she said two years ago. ""I'm slower than I was, but I'm still vital and I'm still powerful, and when I walk up on that shore in Florida, I want millions of those AARP sisters and brothers to look at me and say, 'I'm going to go write that novel I thought it was too late to do. I'm going to go work in Africa on that farm that those people need help at. I'm going to adopt a child. It's not too late, I can still live my dreams.'""

"London (CNN) -- Four people in the United Kingdom, including a journalist at The Sun newspaper, have been charged in a police probe into alleged payments for newspaper stories involving the royal family, British prosecutors said Wednesday. They will appear before Westminster Magistrates Court on May 8. Their cases stem from Operation Elveden, a police probe into ""allegations involving the unlawful provision of information by public officials to journalists."" One of the men charged is Duncan Larcombe, royal editor at The Sun, Britain's best-selling tabloid and part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. empire. He faces a charge of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. John Hardy and Claire Hardy, who worked at the Sandhurst military academy during the time Princes Harry and William were based there, also are charged with conspiracy to commit public misconduct in office. John Hardy served as a color sergeant at Sandhurst and Claire Hardy is his wife. ""It is alleged that from 10 February 2006 to 15 October 2008, 34 payments were made to either John Hardy or Claire Hardy totaling over ÃÂ£23,000 for stories relating mainly to the Royal Family or matters at Sandhurst,"" prosecutors said in a statement. The fourth is Tracy Bell, a Defense Ministry pharmacy assistant at the Sandhurst medical center, who is charged with one count of misconduct in public office. ""It is alleged that Tracy Bell received ÃÂ£1,250 between 17 October 2005 and 7 July 2006 relating to five articles published in The Sun regarding matters at Sandhurst,"" the prosecutors said. London's Metropolitan Police is running Operation Elveden parallel to a probe into claims that UK journalists hacked people's voice mails to get stories. The two investigations were set up in the wake of the scandal over an allegation that in 2002, the voice mail of a missing 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler, was hacked by an investigator working for the News of the World newspaper before she was found murdered. The furor led to the closure of News International's Sunday tabloid, the News of the World, in 2011. Dozens of arrests have been made in connection with the two inquiries. An executive editor at The Sun, Fergus Shanahan, was charged last week for alleged illegal payments to a public official. Shanahan is due at Westminster Magistrates Court on the same day as the four people charged Wednesday. 'Collective amnesia' Separately, the UK police watchdog released the findings Wednesday of its inquiry into Surrey Police's handling of the hacking of Milly Dowler's voice mail. Surrey Police officers appear to be ""afflicted by a form of collective amnesia"" in relation to the force's failure to investigate an allegation in 2002 that the News of the World had hacked the teenager's phone, said the Independent Police Complaints Commission. No action was taken to investigate the claim despite it being known about at all levels, the IPCC said. ""We will never know what would have happened had Surrey Police carried out an investigation into the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone in 2002,"" said Deborah Glass, IPCC deputy chairwoman, in a statement. ""Phone hacking was a crime and this should have been acted upon, if not in 2002, then later, once the News of the World's widespread use of phone hacking became a matter of public knowledge and concern."" Surrey Police has since apologized to the Dowler family.

"(CNN) -- Elisa Baker, the stepmother of 10-year-old Zahra Baker, was indicted Monday on second-degree murder charges in the girl's death, a Catawba County, North Carolina, court clerk told CNN. Zahra was reported missing from her Hickory, North Carolina, home in October, and some of her dismembered remains were found a month later. Elisa Baker, 42, ""desecrated the victim's body to hinder detection, investigation and prosecution of the offense,"" the indictment said. The stepmother already was charged with obstruction of justice after police said she admitted to planting a fake ransom note. She told police the girl was killed two weeks before she was reported missing, according to search warrants. ""The defendant had a history and pattern of physical, verbal and psychological abuse of the victim,"" the indictment said. The indictment described Zahra as ""very young, physically infirm, or handicapped."" The girl lost part of her left leg at age 5 and lost hearing in both ears while being treated for cancer. ""The defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence, including a domestic relationship, to commit the offense,"" the indictment said. District Attorney Jay Gaither said Monday that the state ""has no credible evidence to suggest that anyone other than Elisa Baker"" was involved in the killing. Documents released after Zahra's remains were found in November tell a grisly story. The stepmother said the disabled girl's body was dismembered and disposed of in various locations, documents said. A search warrant dated October 27 shows police were looking for latex gloves used to dismember Zahra and trash bags used to store body parts. Hickory Chief of Police Tom Adkins called the indictment a ""milestone"" in the case -- ""holding someone accountable that members of 'team Zahra' have been working towards since the first words spoken on that 911 call"" in October, reporting the girl missing. Elisa Baker was also charged last month with bigamy. She is accused of marrying the girl's father before divorcing her previous husband, a Catawba County court official said.","NEW: Elisa Baker acted alone, DA says .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed the appointment of former Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas as their new head coach. The 34-year-old lasted just nine months at Tottenham's London rivals, and was sacked in March after a run of disappointing results left them languishing in sixth place in the league. Prior to his spell at Stamford Bridge Villas-Boas enjoyed a record-breaking first season at Portuguese club Porto, winning a domestic double as well as the Europa League. He replaces Harry Redknapp who was dismissed by Tottenham three weeks ago. ""Tottenham Hotspur is a great club with a strong tradition and fantastic support, both at home and throughout the world,"" Villas-Boas told the club's official website. ""I feel privileged to be its coach. For me, this is one of the most exciting coaching positions in the Premier League. ""I have had several discussions with the chairman and the board and I share their vision for the future progress of the club. ""This is a squad any coach would love to work with and together I believe we can bring success in the seasons ahead."" Redknapp guided Tottenham to fourth place in the Premier League last season but the club missed out on European Champions League qualification after Chelsea won the continent's premier club competition. That triumph, overseen by Villas-Boas' successor at Stamford Bridge, former player Roberto Di Matteo, meant Chelsea took Tottenham's place by virtue of being crowned champions. Di Matteo has since been appointed Chelsea's permanent boss, while Villas-Boas has swapped one London club for another.

"(CNN) -- Extreme natural events, not man-made climate change, led to last summer's historic drought in the Great Plains, a new federal study said Friday. Drought occurred in six Plains states between last May and August because moist Gulf of Mexico air ""failed to stream northward in late spring,"" and summer storms were few and stingy with rainfall, said a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""Neither ocean states nor human-induced climate change, factors that can provide long-lead predictability, appeared to play significant roles in causing severe rainfall deficits over the major corn-producing regions of central Great Plains,"" the report summary said. The drought in Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota was the worst since record keeping began in 1895, even eclipsing the notorious Dust Bowl droughts of 1934 and 1936, said study leader Martin Hoerling, a NOAA meteorologist. ""The event was rare, and we estimated maybe a once in a couple of hundred years event,"" Hoerling said. ""But for as extreme as it was, it didn't have any strong indications for early warning. ""It's highly unlikely that this upcoming May to August will be as dry as last year's,"" he said, referring to the six states. Although he believes in global warming, Hoerling said greenhouse gas concentrations weren't behind the heat wave in the Midwest region. ""I'm an advocate of global warming because science tells me that greenhouse gases have warmed the planet by about 1 degree Celsius in the last 100 years. So there's no question about that,"" he said. ""But the science also tells that every drought that's occurring isn't a result of climate change."" Last summer's dryness had caused at least $12 billion in economic losses, as of last July, before the drought peaked, the study said. Crop yields and commerce on major rivers fell during the sweltering weather, the report said. ""It remains to be seen if the economic effects of the 2012 drought will approach prior events, including the 1988 drought that inflicted $78 billion in losses and the 1980 event that caused $56 billion in losses (adjusted for inflation to 2012 dollars),"" the report said. The study was prepared by 20 scientists from several universities and NOAA. ""It was highly vetted through a review process,"" Hoerling said of the study. A climate scientist disputed the study's findings and said it failed to address the role of global warming in an appropriate way. ""The analysis failed to take account of the record low snow pack in the Southwest, the development of the drought there and the record high temperatures, the inadequacies of the models used, or why there was no monsoon,"" said Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a federally funded facility. ""We know that drought forms naturally, but the role of global warming, via the extra heat available ... is to increase the intensity of the drought, and thus the subsequent heat waves and wildfire risk,"" Trenberth said. ""The study does not answer why there were so any records broken last year throughout the U.S."" Major snow disappoints with minor moisture . Hundreds of U.S. counties labeled disaster areas due to drought . 2012 broke U.S. heat records . How severe weather affects food supply .","NEW: Climate scientist disputes study findings .

"Hickory, North Carolina (CNN) -- Residents of Hickory, North Carolina, held a candlelight vigil to celebrate the life of Zahra Baker, the freckle-faced girl authorities discovered dead more than a month after she was reported missing. Zahra would have turned 11 on Tuesday, police said. ""Thirty-nine days ago, most of us did not know Zahra Baker. But over more than a month, we have all fallen in love with her and become better people because of her,"" said Hickory Police Chief Tom Adkins. The girl's stepmother, Elisa Baker, reported Zahra missing on October 9. Elisa Baker was arrested the next day, after police said she admitted to writing a fake ransom note found at the family's home in Hickory. No one other than a relative had seen Zahra since September 25. At the vigil, people lit candles and prayed. They sang ""Happy Birthday"" and released white balloons and balloons that said ""Happy Birthday."" Adkins spoke about the young girl's strength of spirit, her bubbling personality and the desire she had to be just like any other child. He did not address the investigation into her death. Zahra lost part of her left leg at age 5 and lost hearing in both ears while being treated for cancer. Both her biological parents were from Australia. The girl's father, Adam Troy Baker, was arrested in late October in nearby Catawba County on eight charges: five counts of writing bad checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. Authorities said the charges were unrelated to Zahra's disappearance, and he was later released on bail. His wife, Elisa Baker, remains in jail. Besides an obstruction of justice charge for the ransom note, she is accused of writing worthless checks. Police said she has been cooperating with investigators, including going with them to a search site. Her sister, April Fairchild, attended the vigil. ""It was amazing,"" she said. ""It's such an inspiration to see the support."" Hickory Mayor Rudy Wright was also there and spoke about Zahra. He said her tragic death brought out the best of the community, though most people never knew her. ""In her photos, we can see the resiliency she surely had and we wish we could hold her and give her love and security,"" he said. ""Zahra is in a better place tonight.""

"New York (CNN) -- A New York man the federal government dubbed the nation's ""Most Wanted Deadbeat Parent"" has pleaded guilty to evading $1.2 million in child support payments. Prosecutors said Thursday that Robert Sand, 50, spent more than a decade evading his obligations to his three children by his two former wives. He admitted to relocating from New York to Florida and then fleeing the country after arrest warrants in 2000 and 2002 were issued, according to Loretta. E. Lynch, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. In November, Sand was arrested while trying to enter the Philippines without proper identification and was deported to Los Angeles, where he was taken into custody by U.S. marshals. In the past decade, Sand ran a business in Thailand, accumulating fees that eventually totaled more than $1 million in back child support. In January 2012, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services launched a website to get the public's help in finding and bringing fugitive ""deadbeat parents"" to justice. Sand was listed as the No. 1 suspected offender based on the amount he owed. Authorities say Sand previously had been arrested in Thailand and charged with possession of a false British passport. In early 2010, a federal warrant was issued for his arrest. ""Today, the defendant has admitted to abandoning his responsibilities to the children he helped bring into this world, and to leaving the country to do so,"" Lynch said. ""Neither court orders nor the familial bond meant anything to him as he fled to avoid his obligations."" Sand faces up to four years imprisonment. Sentencing is scheduled for May 21.

"Rome (CNN) -- Italian President Giorgio Napolitano has asked center-left politician Enrico Letta to form a new government, the president's spokesman said Wednesday, raising hopes of an end to the country's political impasse. Speaking after their meeting, Letta told reporters he would consult with parties Thursday and then would return to the presidential palace to ""fully accept"" the mandate. The step comes four days after Napolitano, 87, was re-elected by Italy's Parliament on Saturday to an unprecedented second term. Italy has been locked in a political stalemate since February's general election left a three-way split between the right, the left and a wild-card party. A delegation led by Letta, a 46-year-old former deputy prime minister who belongs to the center-left Democratic Party, met with Napolitano on Tuesday. Letta said that he was surprised to receive the call from Napolitano on Wednesday morning but that he accepted the challenge ""with great commitment."" ""We are going through a very difficult time,"" he said. Letta said the most important step was to tackle unemployment, especially among young people -- a problem that is pushing many young Italians to leave the country. The second most pressing issue facing Italy is the need for political reform, he said. READ MORE: Mired in financial troubles, Italian couple commits suicide . Constitutional changes are needed to reduce the number of parliamentarians and fix an electoral system that has kept the country locked in a political stalemate it can't afford, he said. ""We need to do this together with the largest participation possible,"" said Letta. He also said the policy of austerity in the European Union needs to change. Napolitano said he was ""satisfied"" because the road to forming the new government is finally open. The only way this can happen is through a ""large coalition"" that can ensure a majority in both houses of Parliament, he said. Letta is very young for a prime minister by Italian standards but is very experienced, he added. The former leader of the Democratic Party, Pier Luigi Bersani, tried to form a government last month but failed. He resigned after the re-election of Napolitano. No one has taken over the leadership of the party, the dominant member of a leftist coalition.

"(CNN) -- Start with 19 gorgeous half-naked models, throw in a $2.5 million bra and a few wings that weigh up to 50 pounds a pair, and you have the elements of this year's Victoria's Secret fashion show. The 2011 show airs Tuesday in more than 90 countries, proving that the definition of ""sexy"" may be the same on all seven continents. Dazzling women in glitter, wearing sky-high heels with elaborate underwear, are some of the obvious reasons more than 9 million viewers tuned in to last year's show. But with this year's scheduled performances by Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nicki Minaj, who knows how many fans are also anticipating the celebrity showcase? Joining the group of stars, Adam Levine will perform as he walks the runway with girlfriend and Victoria's Secret model Anne Vyalitsyna. Nine million viewers may sound like an large number of people gazing at pretty women in bras and panties. But who wouldn't want to see this spectacle? ""The show fulfills a fantasy, and not just the obvious one of gorgeous women in their underwear,"" said Glamour magazine contributing style editor Tracey Lomrantz. ""Everything about it is over the top, from the performances to the sets to the shoes. It lets the audience have a kind of escapist moment to a place where everything is sparkly and idyllic,"" Lomrantz added. Glitter won't be the only thing glistening on the New York runway. This year, model Miranda Kerr will be wearing the traditional $2.5 million Fantasy Treasure Bra. That's right, this Angel will be gleaming in a bra encrusted with more than 3,400 hand-placed gems. Aside from the million-dollar rocks, beauty products from the Victoria's Secret collection will be used on all 19 models. If you're keeping track, almost 40 cans of hairspray will be used, and 21 makeup artists will use products exclusively from the VS makeup collection, according to HollywoodLife.com. The combination of the fashion, makeup and celebrity performances will help create this year's spectacle on a grand scale. Pretty faces on bodies with killer curves don't hurt. Famous VS models -- or should we say Angels -- like Adriana Lima, Chanel Iman and Erin Heatherton have some of the most envied bodies that both men and women admire. ""It's interesting how many women say they use the show as a motivator to hit the gym or to finally start their diets,"" Lomrantz said. And although men often gaze at the toned bodies strutting the catwalk, some are sure not to confuse fantasy with reality. ""It is important to remember, as with all fashion shows, that what you see on the runway is not what you will see in a store -- it's a projection of desire,"" Esquire magazine's Matt Sullivan said. These angels aren't always naturally blessed with the bodies they have. Many of the models follow a strict diet and exercise regimen. Lima admited to The Telegraph that she has been working out with a personal trainer every day since August. Fast-forward to nine days before the show, and the only thing she eats or drinks are protein shakes made with powdered eggs. Speed up to the final 12 hours, and Lima doesn't consume a speck of anything -- not even water. ""No liquids at all, so you dry out. Sometimes you can lose up to eight pounds just from that,"" Lima told The Telegraph. Although they put in hard work, the VS Angels end up envied. Not only do these tall beauties effortlessly balancing heavy decorated feathers in nothing but lingerie and a smile attract Nielsen ratings, but the taping of the show enjoys its fair share of media coverage. ""When there is an event this big, people pay attention,"" fashion blogger Mark St. James said. ""When models look this flawless and graceful, you can't help but fall victim to their provocative lingerie, powerful femininity and, of course, sex appeal."" Ladies, it's almost time to whip out your little pink bag, pump up the hair and put on your best ""Vicky C"" garments in anticipation of this year's show. Men, pop the popcorn, call your friends and get ready to gather around the TV to admire the models and rock out to the musical guests. According to St. James, ""Victoria's Secret is the Cirque du Soleil of lingerie. The ever-increasing popularity of the Victoria's Secret shows comes from the excitement of being apart of a world where Angels are stunningly beautiful, the industry's top musical talent performs live, and power and sexual energy pour from the runway every year."" And thanks to the Victoria's Secret fashion show, we're even closer to seeing a real-life heaven on Earth.","The 2011 Victoria's Secret fashion show will air on CBS at 10 p.m. Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- It has long come as a mystery to soccer fans: how can India, with a population of 1.2 billion and a burgeoning passion for football, be languishing at 162nd in the world rankings below Madagascar and Nepal? It is an anomaly that organizers of the country's new Premier League Soccer franchise hope to tackle, with their model that intends to echo the success of cricket's money-spinning IPL tournament -- a shortened format of the sport featuring some of its biggest entertainers. Six former legends of the game, including ex-Arsenal and France midfielder Robert Pires and Italy's 2006 World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro, have signed up for the inaugural tournament due to start in February. The Celebrity Management Group has signed a 30-year deal with the Indian Football Association and hopes to create a new surge of popularity for soccer in one of the most densely populated countries on earth. Six teams will participate in Monday's auction in Kolkata to acquire stars of football's past. The list also includes former Spain forward Fernando Morientes, who won three European Champions League titles with Real Madrid, ex-Argentina striker Hernan Crespo, Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler and Nigeria's former World Cup star Jay-Jay Okocha. Each club will have a maximum of $2.5 million to spend in the first year, with no team allowed more than four foreign players. Each squad must also contain six under-21 Indian players. It is a concept that Bhaswar Goswami, executive director of CMG, hopes will transform the fortunes of the nation's soccer team. ""The PLS has already created a huge interest among fans, players and sponsors. It's a great chance to be associated with global brands,"" he told CNN. According to Goswami, around 155 million Indians watched football on television in 2010, and a study in 2009 by the World Bank found that 47% of the population would describe themselves as soccer fans. But there is no question that India is cricket crazy, with revered batsman Sachin Tendulkar, known as the ""Little Master,"" sure to trump former England and Manchester United footballer David Beckham as an icon on the sub-continent. Though Goswami denies the PLS will be similar to the IPL, there are many similarities -- not least the hope that big names will add a large helping of glitz and glamor to proceedings. The annual 20-over cricket competition has proved a huge success since it launched in 2008, with the world's best players auctioned off to the nine teams, set against a backdrop of Bollywood bling. However, Goswami prefers to look elsewhere for a comparison -- English football's Premier League. ""If I have to benchmark myself, I will benchmark with the EPL, which is the most successful league across the world,"" he said. ""Moreover, the PLS will actually complement football in India. It will create a new market, a new audience and will produce more homegrown talent,"" he said. Sports analyst Harpal Singh Bedi told CNN that football was now the second most-watched sport in India behind cricket, and that the PLS could prove a game-changer. ""This is a very good attempt,"" he said. ""There are foreign players, foreign coaches and, if it is conducted like the IPL with proper planning, the PLS too can be superb.""","Indian Premier League Soccer announces it will launch in late February .

"(Rolling Stone) -- The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame will make up for past oversights at this year's induction ceremony by admitting the backing groups of six first-generation rock stars. The honored groups include the Blue Caps (Gene Vincent), The Comets (Bill Haley), the Crickets (Buddy Holly), the Famous Flames (James Brown), the Midnighters (Hank Ballard) and the Miracles (Smokey Robinson). In each of these cases, the backing group failed to get into the Hall of Fame at the same time as their frontman - sometimes causing a great deal of controversy. The Hall of Fame's failure to induct the Miracles along with Smokey Robinson in 1987 caused a particularly large uproar. Hall of Fame rules state that artists are eligible for induction 25 years after their debut release. At the time, Robinson had been a solo artist for only 14 years. The six groups will be inducted April 14 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's annual ceremony at Cleveland's Public Hall. ""These Inductees are pioneers in the development of the music we call rock and roll,"" the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's president and CEO Joel Peresman said in a statement. ""As part of our mission to recognize the most impactful, innovative and influential artists in rock, the committee brought forth these six groups that belong in the Hall of Fame.""

"West, Texas (CNN) -- ""Shovel by shovel,"" investigators are combing through the charred remains of a fertilizer distributor leveled by a massive explosion one week ago. Much of the landscape surrounding the West Fertilizer Co. in West, Texas, is unrecognizable. What was once a corn silo appears to have crumpled in the force of the blast. A blue tarp covers the shell of a rail car. Left is a crater nearly 100 feet wide and 10 feet deep that was once the site of a building. The crater is now filled with mangled metal and crumbs of mortar. Concrete chunks -- some the size of shopping carts -- are strewn hundreds of yards away from the blast site. But amid the devastation, forensic mappers are hoping to find clues. Hundreds of small pink flags indicate anything on the ground that crews want forensic investigators to take a closer look at. Officials face a difficult task in reconstructing the fire that preceded the deadly explosion. Still unknown: what types of chemicals and in what quantities were stored at the facility. Town devastated by explosion is guided by the West way . One official likened the investigation to a jigsaw puzzle. ""Right now, think of that coffee table where all 100 pieces are gathered around,"" Brian Hoback, an official with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told the San-Antonio Express News. ""Now, we're going to pull them together."" ATF Special Agent in Charge Robert Champion said determining what started the initial fire is ""the key."" ""We feel the explosion was caused by the fire so we've got to determine what the cause and the origin of the fire was, and that's why we're ... attempting to re-enact that fire scene,"" Champion said. ""A fire scene is complicated in itself. But you compound that with an explosion and it really complicates the issue."" So far, investigators have ruled out the possibility that natural causes ignited the fire. Meanwhile Wednesday, in a memorial at the blast site, an American flag was raised and a bugler played taps as workers paused to remember the 14 people killed. A few miles away, one of those victims, Kenneth ""Luckey"" Harris Jr., was laid to rest. Harris, a 52-year-old Dallas firefighter who lived in West, was one of 10 first responders who died. Hundreds of firefighters from Dallas and other areas surrounding West came for the funeral, the first to be held for a first responder killed. Firefighters lined the sidewalk as Harris' flag-draped coffin was carried out and loaded into the back of a Dallas firetruck to be carried to the cemetery. Bagpipes played as the coffin proceeded through the crowd. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will attend a larger memorial service on Thursday in Waco for all 14 victims. Ahead of the service, the president signed a proclamation Wednesday ordering all flags in the state flown at half-staff on Thursday. City workers from Waco will replace West workers on Thursday so they may attend funerals and take a break from trying to repair the city's water system and cleaning up the town.

"(CNN) -- An important hydroelectric dam shared by Brazil and Paraguay failed Tuesday night, pushing a large swath of central and southern Brazil into darkness, said the country's minister of mines and energy, Edison Lobao. At about 10:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET), the Itaipu dam shut down completely, Lobao said in a radio interview. Power began to slowly return Tuesday night, and authorities expected a restoration of power overnight, Lobao said. An official at Brazil's National Electric System Operator told CNN that the incident at Itaipu caused an outage of 18,000 megawatts. The official declined to be named because he was not authorized to talk to the media. The outage was approximately equivalent to the amount of energy needed to power the state of Sao Paulo and its 20 million residents, the official said. ""Everything's fine,"" the official said, adding that as Itaipu rebooted, it would repower the affected regions. Millions of people were affected by the blackout in six Brazilian states that included the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. The capital, Brasilia, was unaffected, CNN en EspaÃ±ol reported. Neighboring Paraguay and Uruguay also reported related blackouts, Lobao said. Rio's main streets and avenues were in a total blackout. Video footage showed long lines of cars at a near standstill on the roads, and the subway system in Rio came to a stop.

"(CNN) -- The investigation of Monday's deadly twin bombings in Boston will rely to an extraordinary extent on crowdsourced surveillance, provided by Marathon spectators' cellphone photos, Vine videos, and Instagram feeds. Investigators in Boston, led by FBI special agent in charge Richard DesLauriers, want to see any and all imagery taken by anyone and everyone where the blasts occurred Monday. In an unusual move, the team of local, state and federal authorities investigating the crime openly called for spectators to provide any images or video they might have, all of which could potentially provide leads or evidence in the case. ""We'd like to review any type of media,"" to include ""video [and] photographic evidence"" of the attack that killed three and injured more than 150 people, Gene Marquez of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said today. Within minutes of the twin blasts, photos and videos of the bombing flooded Twitter, Facebook, Vine, YouTube and other social media. All that adds up to a vast, distributed unwieldy trove of potential information for the inquiry. The investigation is currently ""secur[ing] all video"" from surveillance cameras at Copley Square, Boston police commissioner Ed Davis said at a press conference today. But investigators want to construct a wider mosaic of imagery, from a greater set of angles and vantage points, than street-mounted cameras can provide. Davis said authorities plan to ""go through every frame of every video we have to determine who was in the area."" As is likely to be the case as the tools for capturing imagery grow smaller, cheaper and more mobile, law enforcement officials described the search for spectator photos and videos on a continuum with the accounts of eyewitnesses they seek to interview. Investigators urged everyone to cooperate with what they said will be an increased law-enforcement presence in and around Boston. ""Assistance from the public remains critical,"" DesLauriers said, warning that the inquiry is just beginning to ""interview witnesses and process the crime scene"" and it could ""take some time"" before any leads, let alone evidence, develop. Davis said the Copley Square crime scene, currently narrowed to 12 blocks, is the most complex ever encountered by Boston police. Juliette Kayyem, a former homeland-security adviser to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, praised law enforcement and Marathon attendees for rapidly clearing an area of thousands of people in order to preserve the crime scene. There are limits to the crowdsourcing. The data used in the investigation will be crowdsourced. The investigation will not be. A crowdsourced investigation runs a high risk of becoming a witchhunt, as we saw in the Newton shooting spree. The Boston Marathon is one of the most if not the most photographed annual running event in the world. This image from yesterday shows professional and amateur photographers lining the course. It is unclear whether law enforcement had overhead cameras mounted in helicopters or other aircraft over the Marathon. (Boston-area cops don't have spy drones Ã¢â¬â yet.) But the era of readily-accessible commercial imaging tools provides a twist on the exponential growth of surveillance tech used by law enforcement and homeland security. The data on your phone can become an adjunct to police during the highest-profile investigations. That isn't an unfettered benefit to police. The military has found that its explosion of imagery data has stressed its ability to process it, to the point where its futurists are hunting for algorithms that can pre-select images a human analyst sees. Davis requested that any spectator providing media showing the attacks indicate the time they collected the data so police ""don't need to go through the electronic signature.""

"(CNN) -- A magazine publisher, a photographer and a regional newspaper are under investigation in France for invasion of privacy over the publication of vacation pictures of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, authorities said Thursday. An unnamed female photographer was placed under investigation on April 2, according to Caroline Chassain, spokeswoman for the Nanterre prosecutor. Mondadori France, publisher of the French edition of Closer magazine, was placed under investigation on April 4, and La Provence, a regional daily newspaper, was placed under investigation Monday. Topless photos of Catherine, wife of Britain's Prince William, appeared in the French edition of Closer. Photos of her in a bikini were published in La Provence in September. The grainy topless pictures, shot from a distance, were taken while Catherine was sunbathing in private during a vacation at a chateau owned by William's uncle in Provence, southern France. Closer and La Provence declined to comment on the investigation. The lawyer acting for the Duchess of Cambridge in France, Aurelien Hamelle, also declined to comment. Catherine is expecting her first child with William, who's second in line to the British throne. Closer was fined last September for publishing the topless photographs and ordered not to distribute the magazine in print or online. A French court also ordered the magazine to hand over the original photos to the royal family within 24 hours of the ruling. The photographs subsequently appeared in outlets in other countries, including Denmark, Italy and Sweden. No media outlet in Britain published the images.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A 7-year-old girl whose body was found in a trash bin outside her Georgia apartment building died of blunt force trauma to the head, was stabbed and had been sexually assaulted, authorities said Tuesday. The killer probably lives in the apartment complex where the child lived or had ready access to it, said Vernon Keenan, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. ""We have multiple leads we feel are valuable and we're going to carry those out,"" he said. Sixty-five state and federal investigators are trying to piece together the events that led to the killing of Jorelys Rivera at an apartment complex in Canton, about 40 miles north of Atlanta, where the girl was found three days after she went missing. Jorelys likely died between an hour and an hour and a half after she disappeared, Keenan said. Keenan also said that investigators uncovered what they believe is blood in a vacant apartment unit. They do not currently have any suspects in custody, he added. Relatives of the little girl mourned her death. ""My world collapsed,"" her father, Ricardo Galarza, told CNN affiliate WAPA in Puerto Rico. ""I couldn't believe that they robbed her from me."" ""They destroyed my soul,"" her grandmother, Wanda Ivette Rivera, told the same network. ""They took a piece of my heart."" Another family member, Miriam Rivera, urged the state of Georgia to ""throw the full weight of the law to the person who did this."" Police have asked for help from the public to find out who killed the little girl. She was last seen alive Friday near a playground at her apartment. Police initially thought she might have wandered off, but, after more than 48 hours of searching, they said they believed she was kidnapped. ""It's so close to home. To think she was just right there at the park and from there disappeared is the scariest thing,"" Maria Rodriguez, a friend of the girl's mother, told CNN. Canton police, assisted by the FBI and the GBI, expanded the search area Monday and began canvassing for sex offenders living nearby. Earlier in the day, as volunteers and police handed out fliers with information and a picture of the missing child, her mother spent the morning in court trying to regain custody of her other children, who were taken by the Department of Family and Children's Services over the weekend in the wake of Jorelys' disappearance for alleged lack of supervision. Her request was denied and the children remain in DFAC's custody, according to the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department. The girl's parents are not suspects, Keenan said. Joselin Rivera had spoken with local media hours after her young daughter went missing Friday, saying she just wanted her returned safely. CNN's Gustavo Valdes contributed to this report.","NEW: Jorelys Rivera likely died 1 to 1 1/2 hours after she disappeared .

"(CNN) -- On February 3, the Baltimore Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII in what was a thrilling finale to the NFL season. While that game was played almost three months ago, don't be fooled into thinking that the NFL went into hibernation. Quite the contrary -- teams, fans and pundits alike quickly turned their attention to this year's NFL Draft. What is the Draft to the NFL? Think of the Champions League group stage draw. While that takes place in Monaco, the NFL Draft is held in New York City, with neither event involving a playing ball. Over the years, the Draft has arguably been the second biggest single-day U.S. sporting event behind only the Super Bowl. That may be why league officials expanded it to three days back in 2010. For months on end, team scouts, coaches, and officials do their best to evaluate young college talent from across the country in the hope of picking the right players that they are confident will turn into superstars. In the course of just three days, the NFL's 32 teams get to pick in seven rounds, which amounts to over 250 players being selected. While many of the aforementioned players pan out and turn into stars, a large number of them flop on the biggest stage. Think of 1998. The number one pick was Peyton Manning, who went on to become a four-time NFL Most Valuable Player and Super Bowl champion. But the number two pick that year was Ryan Leaf -- arguably the biggest bust in NFL history after he was released just a few years into his career. Do the latter rounds matter? Most definitely, as one of the most famous diamonds in the rough -- Tom Brady -- was picked in the sixth round of the 2000 Draft and 199th overall. Brady has since guided the New England Patriots to five Super Bowl appearances, winning three of them. While the Super Bowl has always been ""the"" event in the U.S., the NFL Draft has steadily gathered more steam through the decades to be what it is today. The first one -- held in 1936 -- was held in Philadelphia and featured players' names written on a blackboard from which teams would choose from. Fast forward to the present day. The event is held in New York City's Radio City Music Hall, with rabid NFL fans allowed to attend, and most importantly, all three days televised nationally with non-stop coverage. The spectacle of young and promising college football players being selected by legendary NFL franchises now garners so much interest, that day one of the Draft is watched by more people than an NBA Finals game -- that's including LeBron James and the Miami Heat's triumph last season. How many of the more than 250 players selected will pan out? Only time will tell. But one thing is certain: time has cemented the NFL Draft as must-see television in the U.S.","Top college talent is selected in NFL Draft .

"(CNN) -- A grand jury indicted the nanny of two young children found stabbed to death in the bathtub of their Manhattan apartment for their murders, court documents show. Yoselyn Ortega, 50, was arrested earlier this month and charged with the murders of Lucia Krim, 6, and her brother Leo, 2. Court documents released Tuesday show the grand jury indicted Ortega on first- and second-degree murder charges in both deaths. Police say on October 25, the children's mother, Marina Krim, returned to the family's Upper West Side apartment, found Lucia and Leo dead in the bathroom and saw the nanny stab herself with a kitchen knife. A mother's greatest fear . Ortega has been recovering since then at Weill Cornell Medical Center under police watch, and was still there as of Tuesday, according to hospital spokeswoman Linda Kamateh. Krim left two of her children with the nanny to take her 3-year-old child, Nessie, to a swim lesson at a nearby YMCA, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said last month. She had expected to meet the nanny around 5:30 p.m. at a dance class, but when Ortega failed to appear she went back to the apartment. The late children's father is Kevin Krim, a senior vice president for CNBC Digital and former Yahoo executive. A native of the Dominican Republic, Ortega had been a naturalized U.S. citizen for 10 years. Friends had introduced the family to Ortega, and she had worked for them since Leo's birth two years ago, police said. Ortega was not a live-in nanny, but Marina Krim's blog, ""Life with the Little Krim Kids,"" offered the loving mother's view of a family life that included Ortega as a member. In February, the Krims traveled to the Dominican Republic, where they met Ortega's family. ""We spent the past nine days in the Dominican Republic,"" Marina Krim wrote on February 18. ""We spent half the time at our nanny, Josie's sister's home in Santiago and the rest at Balcones de Atlantico in Las Terrenas, a condo-style hotel where the 'Real Housewives of Dominican Republic' and their families hang on weekends. It was wonderful."" She added, ""We met Josie's amazing familia!!! And the Dominican Republic is a wonderful country!!"" One photograph showed the families together, Ortega holding the girl who was learning how to swim at the time her siblings were killed.

"(CNN) -- Beijing residents blanketed by smog are pointing to U.S. readings on pollution levels -- and slamming official reports from the Chinese government. On Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, more and more people are uploading and reposting screen captures from air-quality-monitoring apps -- generally one from the U.S. Embassy -- highlighting ""very unhealthy"" or ""hazardous"" pollution levels, at times that China officially reported only ""slight pollution"" in the same areas. China acknowledges the concerns and notes that it uses a different system to measure air pollution. State-run news agency Global Times on Tuesday carried the headline, ""Non-government air quality assessments on the rise due to distrust over official data."" ""Zeal for independent assessments of air quality has been on the rise nationwide in China recently, amid public distrust over official data resulting from the failure of national evaluations to include PM 2.5 level, an air pollution index used worldwide, in their calculations,"" the article states. The U.S. Embassy explains that PM 2.5 refers to fine particulates less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. The U.S. Consulate General in Guangzhou, China, explains that these smaller particles ""are believed to pose the largest health risks"" and ""are small enough to get into the lungs and even the blood stream."" Chinese monitoring stations around Beijing track only larger, ""coarse"" particulates, between 2.5 and 10 micrometers in diameter. On Monday, the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau stated that the Air Pollution Index (API) was between 150 to 170, indicating ""slight"" pollution. The U.S. monitor, meanwhile, which sends out tweets throughout the day, reported at times on Monday that the air in Beijing was ""hazardous,"" with Air Quality Index (AQI) readings over 300. On October 9, the U.S. monitor reported a reading of over 500, which it labeled ""beyond index."" The official government reading for that same date states there was ""slight pollution."" While many official reports on Chinese state-run media refer to the air as being filled with ""fog,"" the government acknowledges the haze is due to smog. The state-run China Daily reported this week that while ""fog alerts"" are declared, ""Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environment Affairs, said the hazes that have been smothering Beijing are really 'smog.'"" While pollution is an ongoing concern in the country, the weather in recent days has made matters worse, said CNN International weather anchor Mari Ramos. ""Beijing's weather has been dominated by high pressure, which means sinking air and dry days. This weather pattern aggravates their air quality problem,"" Ramos said. ""The air is stagnant, there is no mixing and all the pollutants are trapped near the surface."" The Chinese capital has only had 1.5 mm of rain since October 14, she said. ""There is a glimmer of hope on the horizon, but not until the end of the week. By Friday, when a cold front comes through, there is a small chance of rain,"" Ramos said, adding that even if it doesn't rain, the end to the current weather pattern will bring a ""welcome relief."" In posts online, many Chinese people say they can smell sulfur dioxide in the air. Some have posted photos of sites throughout Beijing, showing how little visibility there is. The poor air quality has caused a surge in the numbers of patients with respiratory problems, and the Beijing Meteorological Bureau issued four yellow alerts for dense fog in the last two days, the Global Times article says. Doctors suggest people of all ages avoid outdoor activities. CNN's Tian Shao and Jaime FlorCruz in Beijing contributed to this report.","U.S. readings show ""hazardous"" air while China reports ""slight pollution""

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Much of Chile was in the dark Sunday after a blackout knocked out power to 90 percent of the country, CNN's sister network in the country reported. The blackout was caused by an overheated transformer in the Bio Bio area, the country's minister of energy, Ricardo Rainien, told CNN Chile. Rainien said crews were slowly restoring power, and he expected electricity to be fully restored by midnight Sunday. Subway service was also affected, CNN Chile said, but all passengers had been evacuated from stopped trains as of Sunday night. Government officials were asking residents to stay calm and remain in their houses until power is restored. The blackout comes two weeks after a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck the country, killing more than 500 people. Aftershocks as high as magnitude 7.2 continue to disrupt recovery efforts. iReporters recovering after the quake . Rainien said that another blackout is possible because of the weakened electrical system following the quake.","Blackout was caused by an overheated transformer in the Bio Bio area, official says .

"(CNN) -- It's a stirring sight, and it happens just once a year -- a full field of thoroughbred gray horses thundering down one of Britain's most famous racecourses in a fiercely-contested handicap event. ""You don't have to be a racing purist to appreciate the spectacle of 19 gray horses charging down the July Course,"" Newmarket's PR manager Tony Rushmer told CNN. ""There are not many of them, it's their scarcity that gives them cult appeal."" Once described as ""diseased"" and genetically inferior, gray horses have achieved a special place in hearts of racing fans in recent decades -- winning some of the industry's biggest events. The Newmarket handicap was first run in 2003 and has grown in popularity with both the professional racing fraternity and the general public. The 2012 version was won in fine style this month by Medici Time, ridden by Eddie Ahern, and once again attracted interest over and above the moderate standard of the runners. Tough winners . But the enduring appeal and popularity of grays is well known in racing circles. ""It's a wonderful spectacle with wonderful-looking horses. And it's very good for racing,"" says Tony Carroll, a former jockey who trained last year's winner Time Medicean -- which this time finished outside the placings. So why are gray horses so popular? Carroll believes it's because they are perceived as good bets for punters. ""They're tough horses and many are winners,"" he told CNN. Some of the greatest flat performers in the United States have been grays -- going back to early 1950s with the great Native Dancer, who has sired a line of champions. Brian Zipse, the managing editor of the influential website Horse Racing Nation, said that the legendary colt, who was nicknamed the ""Gray Ghost,"" made his reputation as the sport was being shown widely on television for the first time. ""The fact that here was a gray horse that won so often made him even more famous because he stood out,"" he told CNN. Native Dancer was named Horse of the Year twice, and other grays to win the award include Spectacular Bid (1980), Lady's Secret (1986) and Skip Away (1998). Rated greatest . Zipse has a soft spot for Lady's Secret, a filly sired by the legendary Secretariat, who is rated by many the greatest racehorse of all time. He was taken by his father to watch the Belmont Stakes in New York in 1973 when Secretariat completed the Triple Crown by adding a devastating 31-length victory to his Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes successes. ""The stand literally shook that day,"" Zipse recalled. Lady's Secret was one of Secretariat's best offspring -- and as a gray filly she had a double affinity with race followers. ""When a top filly races against colts, it's similar to how people feel about a gray racing against more common colors,"" Zipse said. This year's gray attraction in the United States has been the striking colt Hansen -- almost white by pigmentation. He failed to live up to the promise shown as the top juvenile in 2011 and was out of the placings at the Kentucky Derby, but has a ""big fan base"" according to Zipse. A desert bloom . On the other side of the Atlantic, the gray Desert Orchid -- ""Dessie"" to his fans -- was one of the most popular horses in the history of the sport. Racing over the national hunt jumps, Desert Orchid won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1988 and the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park four times. There is an eye-catching statue in his honor at that track in west London. This year, the gray Neptune Collonges won the Grand National at Aintree, a feat which eluded Dessie, who never ran in the prestigious UK race. Both these great grays stood out even more because, as older horses, their coats had grown even lighter with age. The official definition of a gray is outlined in ""Identification of Horses -- Instructions for Veterinary Surgeons,"" a book produced by Weatherbys in conjunction with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and British Equine Veterinary Association. All thoroughbreds listed by Weatherbys in the UK have to have their coloring and markings registered by a veterinary surgeon. ""The body coat is a mixture of black and white hairs, with the skin black. With increasing age the coat grows lighter in color,"" reads the definition. Nature's anomaly . Official figures confirm that grays are a rarity. Weatherbys' ""General Stud Book for 2011"" records that 2.8% of the foal crop in the UK were registered as gray, with bay the most prevalent color at 73.3%. Chestnut was next at 20.4%, then brown at 3%. In genetic terms, to breed a thoroughbred gray one of the parents has to be so colored -- but it was not always a popular combination. Italian Federico Tesio (1869-1954) is renowned as one of the most successful breeders in the history of horse racing. At his Dormello Stud in Novara near Lake Maggiore, Tesio and his wife bred and trained a string of great champions over a half-century period. His books on the subject are still ""must reads"" for aspiring thoroughbred breeders, but he insisted gray horses were ""diseased"" not just differently colored and his views proved influential. Grays indeed are more likely to develop tumors, known as melanomas, but many are benign. While gray hairs are a sign of aging (as in humans) this is exacerbated for horses as pigment is prevented from reaching the hair. Perhaps because of Tesio's views, grays were out of vogue and even segregated into gray-only races, not for the positive reasons that prompt the race at Newmarket and others in the United States. The stunning success of Native Dancer and his offspring would have done much to change attitudes and in and era dominated by television, their ability to stand out in a packed field is priceless. ""Fans gravitate to gray horses because they are rare and it's easy to spot them,"" concluded Zipse.","All-gray events proving popular with fans of horse racing .

"(CNN) -- Three British men on holiday in the United Arab Emirates were beaten and subjected to electric shocks by police following their arrest on drug charges last July, a prisoners' rights group claims. British citizens Grant Cameron, Karl Williams and Suneet Jeerh, all ages 25, have been in detention in Dubai for more than seven months. They were arrested on charges of possession of the synthetic cannabis, ""spice,"" according to Reprieve, a UK-based organization that provides legal support to prisoners. Dubai police denied any torture took place. The suspects were expected to be in a Dubai court Thursday morning for a first hearing in the case, said Marc Calcutt, a lawyer with Reprieve. But the hearing was postponed until March 14 because witnesses failed to appear, Calcutt said. Williams told Calcutt about the alleged abuse by Dubai police that he said occurred in a hotel room and the desert when the lawyer visited Dubai and was given ""informal access"" to Williams and Cameron. ""I remember that the police put a towel on my face so I could not see. They kept telling me I was going to die,"" Williams said in a statement released by Reprieve. ""Then they took off the towel and I could see that there was a gun pointed at my head ... I started to believe that I was going to die in that room."" At one point, the police pulled his pants down and zapped his testicles with electric shocks, Williams alleged . The men were also pressured to sign documents in Arabic, without translation, after multiple beatings, Reprieve alleged. The UK Foreign Office said it is aware of the allegations. ""We can confirm that we have been providing consular assistance to three British nationals detained in the UAE since July 2012. We have also been in close contact with Reprieve,"" the Foreign Office said. ""The FCO takes all allegations of mistreatment and torture extremely seriously. With the individual's consent, we raise allegations of mistreatment with the relevant authorities and request that they conduct a full impartial and independent investigation."" The men are charged with consumption, which holds a minimum sentence of four years, and possession with intent to distribute, which could lead to 15 years in prison, Calcutt said. If they are charged with trafficking, they could face the death penalty. Williams and Cameron came to Dubai to visit Jeerh who had moved there from the UK six weeks earlier, according to Calcutt. The three were driving a hired car and when they reached Jeerh's apartment building they were arrested. The three allege they were then taken to the desert and subsequently to William and Cameron's hotel where they claim the beatings and electric shocks occurred. Calcutt also claims that Williams' hand was kicked until it was broken and says he has X-rays to prove it.","Dubai police deny any torture took place .

"(CNN) -- 1. Good football game. 2. How could that ref not call that?! 3. The blackout. 4. Beyonce, wow, man. 5. A lot of bad ads. Well, that's basically it. Did I leave out anything? These would be your top five Super Bowl talking points, wouldn't you agree? Because if something more interesting happened on Super Bowl Sunday that's still got you talking on Monday, I would very much like to know what it was. F-words overheard in the winning team's celebration, perhaps? (Hey, watch your Flacco mouth, pal!) Or that guy going 108 yards with a kickoff? How about a Harbaugh mentioned every 10 or 20 seconds on TV? Oh, and that cute Clydesdale. And the losing team's quarterback, Colin I'm-So-Good-I-Can-Kiss-Myself. And there were those sweet kids from Sandy Hook, singing ""America the Beautiful"" so beautifully, alongside the increasingly beautiful Jennifer Hudson. OK, I suppose somebody out there might be talking about some of these things, too. I personally thought John Harbaugh's Ravens 34, Jim Harbaugh's 49ers 31 was a truly cool Super Bowl, possibly one of the 10 best ever played. I have sat through quite a few bad, bad Super Bowls in my day, including one inside this same New Orleans dome where a 49ers team beat the living gumbo out of a Denver Broncos team. Compared to that clinker, trust me, Sunday's game between Baltimore and San Francisco was a classic. But it sure didn't start out that way. Kickoff came in the late afternoon in Los Angeles, where I watched Super Bowl XLVII on a XLIII-inch screen. It was still light outdoors out west as the game drew close to halftime, and the score was so one-sided -- Baltimore was up by 21-3 at one point -- I reached for the remote control of my TV. Let's see, what else was on? ESPN: ""World's Strongest Man"" competition. ESPN2: Auburn vs. Florida women's gymnastics. TNT: A rerun of ""Law & Order"" (what a surprise). AMC: ""The Walking Dead."" No, I stuck with CBS, where, on their way to the locker room, the 49ers also appeared to be the walking dead. Beyonce came out next and sang -- really sang, not like at Barack Obama's inauguration. And then her two old teammates from Destiny's Child sang along with her. I think they sang ""Bootylicious,"" a song that I believe Beyonce was not asked to sing at Obama's inauguration. Soon the second half began. It took approximately 12 seconds for a Raven named Jacoby Jones to fly 108 yards for a touchdown. Baltimore was now up by 28-6 and Mr. and Mrs. Harbaugh's son John was looking more and more like destiny's child. I picked up that remote once more. HBO: ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close."" TLC: ""My Big Fat American Gypsy."" MTV: ""Snooki and JWOWW."" VH1: ""Mob Wives."" ID: ""Wives With Knives."" A tough choice, obviously. I decided no, I cannot change this channel now, because I might miss a Super Bowl commercial that everybody else will be buzzing about tomorrow. Maybe a funny one with a talking baby or a chimpanzee. Maybe a sexy one with somebody classy like Danica Patrick or Snooki or JWOWW. Then the whole screen went dark. The players on my TV were suddenly harder to see than Manti Te'o's girlfriend. I sat there squinting until I realized that the City of New Orleans' combination football stadium and hurricane shelter had just blown a fuse. A power blackout caused an interruption to the TV event everybody wanted to see, or at least everybody who didn't prefer watching Auburn vs. Florida women's gymnastics. A lot of perplexed,mixed-up people began running around in that dome, some of them probably calling Louisiana Gas & Electric to make sure that the city had remembered to mail in the February payment. A number of lame jokes made the rounds -- yes, this is why the 49ers play their home games in a park called Candlestick -- and I was asked by more than one person what would happen if New Orleans failed to get the lights back on. I lied that the game would be moved to Baton Rouge and played on Super Bowl Tuesday. Thirty-four long minutes later, lights, camera, action. It was OK to play. Somebody (maybe FEMA?) did a heck of a job. Up to then, everything had been going Baltimore's way. Joe Flacco was having a Joe Montana kind of day at quarterback, Michael Oher was throwing blocks the way Sandra Bullock taught him to in that movie, Ray Rice ran hard and Ray Lewis apparently made a lot of tackles, because those TV guys kept talking and talking and talking about Ray Lewis, even though I didn't actually see him make tackles. Ahhh, but as soon as Joe the Electrician (or whoever they called) screwed in all the new light bulbs, the Super Bowl looked entirely different. Colin Kaepernick began making great plays at quarterback for the 49ers, giving himself a great big kiss on the arm for a job well done. Colin's the kind of kid who would pour Gatorade over his own head after a win. We had ourselves a football game all of a sudden, San Francisco coming within two points, 31-29. I should have seen it coming because the 49ers never choke in a big game. I can't recall the Niners ever playing poorly in a Super Bowl, just as I can't recall the Niners ever playing a good game before the NFL had a Super Bowl. Could they actually win this game? Could they solve Baltimore's defense one more time -- as soon as CBS ran 20 or 30 more commercials? Elementary, as Sherlock Holmes almost never says to Lucy Liu. Kaepernick looked great. He was fast. He was bootylicious. He got the 49ers within striking distance. The Ravens were trapped between a pit and a pendulum. A pass was thrown, lobbed high above Niner receiver Michael Crabtree's head, but Jimmy Smith of the Ravens seemed to have Crabtree in his pincers. Would it be called pass interference? Would it be a first down for the 49ers, a yard or two away from a winning touchdown? Would Kaepernick run for a score and then kiss himself on the mouth? Nope, no flag. No call by the ref on that pass. Maybe he lost it in the lights. It was a memorable ending. Certainly more memorable than most of the commercials, which didn't even star any funny chimps. Baltimore's post-game celebration was colorful and wild. Flacco apparently could be heard by TV viewers using some bad flaccin' language. He also accepted an award for being voted the Most Valuable Player of the game, but at least he didn't accidentally say that he was going to flaccin' Disneyland. Another big game had come and gone. I am sure that many of you would agree that this was one of the best Super Bowls that you have ever seen. You know, except for the dark part. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Downey.","Mike Downey: Super Bowl XLVII seemed headed for a blowout -- until the blackout .

"(CNN) -- Power returned slowly to Venezuela on Tuesday night, a few hours after widespread outages blacked out nearly half the country, trapping people in elevators, stalling subways, filling streets with pedestrians and forcing hospitals to switch to emergency generators. The streets of Caracas, Venezuela, are thronged with people during Tuesday's power outage. ""We understand that at 1600 hours -- that is to say at 4 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) -- there was a blackout on a national level that was produced by an explosion, which is being investigated"" in the Guri hydroelectric power station, Caracas Mayor Juan Barreto said. ""That produced a blackout in 16 states of the country, particularly those of the central north coastal area."" The city's emergency plan kicked in, and about 400 firefighters in training had reported for duty to help, he said. City firefighters had gone to 37 buildings in the capital to free people from elevators. The head of the country's electric authority, Hipolito Izquierdo, told state-run Venezuelan Television that 60 percent of the power had been restored by 7 p.m. local time (7:30 p.m. ET) and predicted that power would be fully restored before 9:30 p.m. (10 p.m. ET). ""We are now recovering,"" he said. Minister of Interior and Justice Ramon Rodriguez Chacin blamed a fault in a generator at the plant in Guri, which caused a high-voltage power transmission line to overheat. In taking the line out of service, power was disrupted to other areas, he said. In all, about 40 percent of the country was blacked out, officials said. Affected zones included parts of the capital city of Caracas -- where streetlights were dark -- and the states of Zulia, Lara, Carabobo, Yaracuy, Portuguesa, Miranda, Falcon, Merida, Aragua, Bolivar and Tachira, the station said. Gustavo Gonzalez, the president of Caracas Metro, the city's rapid-transit system, said it was functioning normally. But a ticket seller at one station said train service had been halted and riders were being diverted to buses.

"(CNN) -- Now it begins. All over again. The primary season over and the nominating conventions complete, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama hit the ground running Friday for the final stretch of a campaign that began, for Romney at least, more than a year ago in Iowa. Over the next 60 days of campaigning, much of it focusing on key battleground states, the two men will pitch their visions for the country to a divided electorate. They spent Friday in two states that have long figured prominently in presidential elections, and which are considered up for grabs this year: Iowa and New Hampshire. President Obama, fresh off his speech Thursday night accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, began his day with a rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with Vice President Joe Biden and their wives. Meanwhile, Republican challenger Romney addressed supporters in Orange City, Iowa. Five things we learned from Day Three of the DNC . Later, the candidates swapped states -- with Obama and Biden traveling to Iowa City for an event at the University of Iowa while Romney spoke to supporters in Nashua, New Hampshire. While many of their speeches echoed remarks they've made in recent weeks, including at their respective national conventions, one new and hot topic Friday -- especially for Republicans -- was a worse-than-expected jobs report issued by the Department of Labor. While unemployment fell to 8.1% in August from 8.3% the month before, the dip was largely the result of fewer people looking for work, an analysis of the data showed. The economy added 96,000 jobs in August, but that's down from 141,000 the month before. Economists polled by CNNMoney had predicted 120,000 new jobs in August. Speaking to reporters Friday in Sioux City, Iowa, Romney called the latest report ""very disappointing,"" stating that for ""every net new job created, approximately four people dropped out of the workforce."" ""After the party last night, the hangover today,"" Romney said, referring to Thursday's Democratic National Convention. The former Massachusetts governor also played up the jobs report at his public rallies Friday, vowing to overturn Obama's signature health plan and institute a number of new policies that he says will energize the economy. ""This economy is going to come back in a big way ... but it is going to require me being elected president,"" Romney said in Nashua, eliciting a roar from the supportive crowd. Obama fired back in his Portsmouth appearance, stressing the positive news that businesses had created jobs for the 30th straight month. But he ackowledged the pace was insufficient. ""We know it's not good enough. We need to create more jobs, faster,"" the president said. And as he did during his speech Thursday night in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama specified several economic-related pledges and said it could take years for the economy to be back at full steam. But any progress thus far will be for naught, and everyday Americans will be sold out, if Romney wins the election, he said. Jobs report brings end to Democrats' convention high . ""If you turn away now -- if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for isn't possible -- well, change will not happen,"" he said in his speech. He said voters will have ""a choice between two different paths for America, a choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future."" In response, Romney said Obama was offering more of the same policies he said have led to high unemployment, rising deficits and a slow economic recovery. ""Americans will hold President Obama accountable for his record -- they know they're not better off and that it's time to change direction,"" the Romney campaign said in a statement. In Iowa, he reiterated the charge, and said Obama's acceptance speech highlighted his opponent's shortcomings. ""There was nothing in the speech that gives confidence that the president knows what he is doing when it comes to jobs and the economy,"" Romney said. In the latest CNN/ORC International poll -- conducted before the Democratic convention -- Obama and Romney were tied. In the poll of 1,005 likely voters, 48% said they would support Romney and an identical number backed Obama. About 2% said they favored neither candidate, and 1% had no opinion.

"New York (CNN) -- New York City officials on Monday were preparing the site where a part believed to be from one of the 9/11 airliners was found so that they can begin the search for human remains, according to the New York Police Department. Staff from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner will start sifting through soil for human remains on Tuesday, police said. A Boeing Company technician confirmed that the piece, discovered Wednesday, is a support structure from a trailing edge flap found on the wing of a Boeing 767 like the ones that were flown into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. It could not be determined from which of the two planes the part came, police said Monday. The piece was found in an 18-inch gap between two buildings near ground zero. One of the buildings is 51 Park Place, the site of a controversial Islamic community center. Surveyors who found the piece called authorities to report that they'd found ""apparently damaged machinery,"" police said. Contrary to an initial theory that the piece could have been lowered by a rope found still wrapped to it, the police department clarified Monday that a police officer had attached the rope last week to maneuver the part to better see a serial number and other indicators. The plane part is about 5 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 17 inches deep, police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. Investigators are still trying to determine how the support structure became wedged into such a small space. ""If you see how confined this space is, and you realize the chaos that existed on this street, I think it's understandable. It's not that surprising,"" Kelly said. ""It's very, very confined, and no construction work went on, or no clean up went on in this 18-inch space between the two buildings"" after the attacks. Some family members of 9/11 victims are outraged by the discovery. Sally Regenhard, whose son Christian, a probationary firefighter, died when the towers collapsed, said: ""I'm disgusted, because after 9/11, the proper search was never done. The whole aftermath was uncoordinated. It was inadequate."" Regenhard has been one of the leading voices and, at times, critics for the families of the 9/11 victims, pushing hard for a federal investigation and calling for a more comprehensive search for remains and debris. ""We advocated for a huge trajectory from that collapse,"" she said. ""Human remains were thrown at least for a mile, but probably 2 or 3 miles from the site."" In recent years, debris and human remains have been discovered in various spots around Lower Manhattan. Police are treating the area as a crime scene and say the part of wreckage will remain there until a final home is chosen. In the past, the National Transportation Safety Board has taken some parts, while others have become part of museums. Sharif El-Gamal, president of Soho Properties, which owns 51 Park Place, said, ""We are cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities to make sure this piece of evidence is removed with care as quickly and effectively as possible."" This is not the first time this building has had national attention. It was the center of many protests while Park 51, the Islamic center, was seeking permission to locate there in 2010. Critics said the center's proximity to ground zero was unacceptable, while supporters argued it was meant to bring people together. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Rob Frehse, Chris Kokenes and Mary Snow contributed to this report.","Officials to look for human remains Tuesday at site where plane part was found .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Delays in deposing Kanye West and other witnesses in the divorce of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries mean the 72-day marriage may not legally end until next year, lawyers said at a hearing Wednesday. Humphries, an NBA forward, accuses Kardashian, a reality TV star, of fraud by entering the marriage only to make millions of dollars with their wedding, Humphries' lawyer, Marshall Waller, told Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephen Moloney. The August 20, 2011, wedding was aired in October on E! Entertainment in a two-part special titled ""Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event."" Kardashian filed for divorce at the end of October. ""Ms. Kardashian had no intention of going through with the marriage,"" Waller said. ""The wedding was simply for the benefit of her television show."" Humphries is asking for an annulment of the marriage instead of a divorce. ""To what end does he want this annulment?"" Kardashian lawyer Laura Wasser asked in court Wednesday. Wasser accused Waller of dragging his feet in making his case with vague charges. Kardashian's legal fees have already reached $250,000, which Wasser said she will try to force Humphries to pay. ""We're going to ask for every penny to be paid by Kris,"" she said. Humphries' case is taking longer to build because of delays in getting documents from NBC Universal and Bunim/Murray Productions, two companies involved in the wedding broadcast, Waller said. ""I'm trying to find information out and somebody is trying to stop me,"" he said. The deposition of Kardashian will not happen until after Humphries' lawyers have reviewed the production documents, Waller said. Kris Jenner, Kardashian's mother, is among the 33 people listed as witnesses by Humphries. While she has accepted a subpoena, she will not be questioned until Humphries' lawyer gets her business records, Waller said. Kanye West, Kardashian's current boyfriend, could be a key witness in the divorce trial, but the hip-hop star has so far evaded Humphries' efforts to subpoena him for a deposition, Waller said. Kardashian answered the door at her Los Angeles home on July 16 when a process server knocked and said told her he had something for West, Waller said. ""She said he was on phone and she wouldn't accept it, so he left it,"" he said. West was not there at the time, Kardashian lawyer Laura Wasser said. The server -- who she described as ""a strange individual"" -- left the subpoena in a Nordstrom department store box, she said. Efforts to reach West though his lawyer and publicist have been unsuccessful, Waller said. Humphries' girlfriend will be deposed by Kardashian's lawyers in New York Tuesday, Wasser said. The lawyer did not name the girlfriend in court. Judge Moloney set the next hearing for November 28. A trial date of early 2013 may be set then, he said.","Subpoena for Kanye West in Nordstrom box left at Kardashian door, her lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- A day after more than 440 bodies were recovered -- the highest single-day death toll to date in the nation's civil war -- at least 160 more people were found dead in Syria on Sunday. Here are some of the latest key developments in the country's 17-month crisis. On the ground: Daraya becomes a horror story . On Sunday, 62 people were killed in Damascus and its suburbs, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The LCC said 21 people, including an entire family, were found dead in the Damascus suburb of Daraya. It said 48 people were killed Sunday in Daraa, the town south of Damascus near the Jordanian border where Syria's uprising began. CNN spoke by Skype to an activist named Osama, who said the army was executing families in their homes in Daraya and stealing some possessions. He said shelling began last Monday and the military closed all the ways in and out, but he kept in contact with people inside Daraya through the Internet. He was told the army moved into the neighborhood on Friday and began sweeping through buildings where families were taking cover. At least 50 bodies were found in one apartment basement, he reported. Saturday's death toll included more than 200 bodies found in Daraya, but it was unclear when those victims were killed. One death consumes Syrian family's life . CNN cannot independently verify reports of death tolls, as the Syrian regime has severely limited access by international journalists. It's not surprising that Daraya came under attack, opposition activist Rafif Jouejati said. ""Daraya is being targeted because it is the closest to the capital, and it is one of the first cities that revolted against the Assad regime and was the spearhead of the peaceful demonstrations in the beginning of the revolution,"" said Jouejati, a spokeswoman for the LCC. ""I believe the regime thinks that the only way to end the revolution is (to) kill, kill, kill. Deep down, they know they are failing, but they want to destroy as much as possible before it is over."" But the Syrian government had a different take on the situation in Daraya: . ""The armed forces cleared the town of Daraya in Damascus countryside from terrorists ... eliminating a large number of them,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. Inside Damascus: VP surfaces . New video shows Syrian Vice President Farouq al-Sharaa in Damascus holding an official meeting in the capital, despite reports this month that he had defected. The video, distributed by Reuters, showed al-Sharaa meeting with a top Iranian official, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, who according to Syrian state media arrived in Damascus on Saturday. Iran's state-run Press TV also reported that al-Sharaa had met with an Iranian official ""amid anti-Assad TV's defection rumors."" More than a week ago, a spokesman for the rebel Free Syrian Army said al-Sharaa had fled the regime. Syrian state-run TV, at the time, did not explicitly say whether al-Sharaa had defected, but reported that the vice president's office issued a statement saying al-Sharaa ""has never at any moment thought of leaving the homeland to whatever direction."" Had al-Sharaa defected, it would have marked the highest-level departure from President Bashar al-Assad's regime yet. A stream of Syrian officials resigned from the regime in recent weeks, including Republican Guard Brig. Gen. Manaf Tlas and Prime Minister Riyad Hijab. Like al-Sharaa, the men are Sunnis who held top posts in a government dominated by the country's Alawite minority. Will Syria's first lady take a stand or stand by her man? Observers view al-Sharaa's power and influence as more significant than the prime minister, who only served in the post for weeks. Al-Sharaa has more clout as a long-time prominent, loyal member of the regime's old guard. He served as foreign minister under al-Assad and his late father, Hafez, for more than 20 years and has been vice president since 2006. The region: Turkey denies sending aid to rebels, slams the Syrian government . Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu rejected claims that his country was shipping weapons to Syrian rebels in their quest to oust al-Assad, the Anadolu news agency reported Saturday. ""These are the arguments which authoritarian regimes had always used to conceal their internal problems,"" Davutoglu told the NTV news channel, according to Anadolu. Davutoglu added, ""No regime fighting its own people can survive long. (The al-Assad regime) has months, and maybe even weeks -- not years."" Syria's neighbors: What's at stake? Syria explained: What you need to know . CNN's Yousif Basil and Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","NEW: Activists report 62 killed in Damascus and its suburbs, including an entire family .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Documents showing that China offered to sell arms to Moammar Gadhafi in the waning days of his rule are ""the real deal,"" a senior member of Libya's transitional government said Monday. The comment follows a report by Canada's The Globe and Mail newspaper saying that state-controlled Chinese arms manufacturers were prepared to sell at least $200 million worth of weapons to Gadhafi, which would have violated U.N. resolutions banning such transactions. The Globe and Mail said one of its reporters found the documents, in Arabic, in a pile of trash in Tripoli's Bab Akkarah neighborhood, an enclave that was home to some of Gadhafi's most loyal supporters. The documents, which were posted Sunday on the website of the Toronto-based newspaper, do not confirm whether any military assistance was delivered to Libya. However, Libya's National Transitional Council said it appears deliveries might have been made. ""We found several documents that showed us orders, very large orders, of arms and ammunition specifically from China, and now we do know that some of the things that were on the list are here on the ground, and they came in over the last two to six months,"" said Abdulrahman Busin, NTC spokesman. He said it is unclear whether the exact list on the document was delivered, ""but there were many things on that list that are here, and these are brand-new equipment, brand-new weapons, brand-new boxes of ammunition that haven't been opened yet, that were clearly delivered only in the last few months. ""Don't forget that we have many of the generals and high commanders who defected some time ago who know Gadhafi's regime very, very well, know what he has and doesn't have, and we know 100% that there was a lot of weapons and arms that were delivered to Gadhafi over the last few months -- during the war and during the sanctions,"" Busin said. And Mohamed Sayeh, a member of the NTC, said Libya's new leaders have seen the documents. ""This deal is a real deal and we have seen the official documents,"" he said. ""It was signed by Chinese officials, and it was to send guns and artillery to Libya through Algiers to expedite the deal."" China says it followed U.N. Security Council resolutions that banned the export of arms to Gadhafi's government. ""The Gadhafi regime sent people to China to engage in contact with certain individuals of relevant Chinese companies in July without the knowledge of the Chinese government departments,"" Jiang Yu, a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN. ""Chinese companies have not signed any military trade contracts with Libya -- let alone provided military exports to Libya."" The report comes after fighters from the NTC overran Tripoli and ousted Gadhafi, whose whereabouts remained unknown. In a phone interview with the Syrian-based al-Rai television network, a man identified as Gadhafi spokesman Musa Ibrahim declared the fugitive Libyan strongman ""remains patient"" and planning a counterattack against the rebel movement that drove him from power. ""I tell the Libyan people not to surrender to the gangs and that the end is near,"" Ibrahim said late Monday. Transitional government troops are perched on the outskirts of one of Gadhafi's last bastions of support, with Libya's new leaders giving Gadhafi loyalists in Sirte, Bani Walid and a handful of other towns until Saturday to surrender or face attack. But Ibrahim said there was ""ongoing resistance"" in areas that Gadhafi has lost, and that Gadhafi ""is inside of Libya fighting."" ""The Libyan forces are still present,"" he said. ""We will protect the liberated cities and will get back the cities that were robbed from us, in a legal way and at the right time."" Meanwhile, the NTC says it is moving its headquarters from Benghazi to Tripoli this week to begin implementing its plans for a new future for Libya. And the British government announced Monday that it had re-established its diplomatic mission in Tripoli, led by an acting special representative, Dominic Asquith. ""The arrival of this team marks another significant step in the UK's relations with the new Libya, and reflects the progress the NTC has made in improving security and stability on the ground,"" Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement announcing the move. The documents NTC officials were examining Monday detailed a trip by Gadhafi's security officials to Beijing on July 16 during which they met with four state-controlled weapons manufacturers, the newspaper reported. ""The companies suggest that they make the contracts with either Algeria or South Africa, because those countries previously worked with China,"" the documents say. According to the newspaper, the documents show the Chinese companies noted that many of the items wanted by Gadhafi were in Algeria and could quickly be moved across the Libyan border. The Chinese said they would replace the Algerian arms sent to Libya, the document said. Busin said Mustafa Abdul Jalil, NTC chairman, has ""made it very, very clear that anybody who has helped and supported and stood by Gadhafi over the months would not be greeted well."" China abstained from voting on a Security Council resolution in March that authorized the protection of Libyan civilians by any means necessary, with the exception of a ground invasion. China, however, did approve a Security Council resolution that banned military assistance, including the sale of weapons, to Gadhafi's government. China, Algeria and South Africa have opposed the NATO bombing campaign in Libya, and the three countries were slow to recognize the authority of the National Transitional Council as Libya's legitimate authority. Sayeh said the NTC was amazed that the deal was discussed at a time when Gadhafi's forces were killing ""thousands and thousands of Libyans, and it was done by two U.N. members"" who signed the arms embargo. ""We will not forget but we will forgive, and we will start all over again,"" Sayeh told CNN. Gadhafi's wife, two sons and other relatives fled to Algeria recently, deepening mistrust between the NTC and Libya's neighbor. Algeria said it acted on humanitarian grounds, but it angered the NTC. The transitional council has accused Algeria of supporting the Gadhafi regime. Algerians also complained to the United Nations about damage done to their embassy soon after NTC fighters entered Tripoli. Algeria will in the future recognize the NTC as the government in Libya, Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci told French radio network Europe 1 last week. ""The NTC has said it is going to set up a government representative of all regions, and when it has done that, we'll recognize it,"" Medelci said. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday said 23 Ukrainian citizens working at Libyan oil industry facilities were arrested. No official charges have been filed, the ministry said in a statement, adding that because of the fighting in the Libyan capital, the NTC is looking at all foreigners in Tripoli with suspicion. The Ukrainian Embassy in Tripoli and the ministry are rendering proper consular assistance to those arrested, the ministry said. As a result, one person was released on Sunday and the others are undergoing security checks, according to the statement. ""Embassy officials are regularly visiting our citizens, examining their conditions and pursuing active steps for their liberation and further return home,"" the ministry said. Ukrainian news agencies on Monday quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Voloshin as telling reporters that those detained have food and water and there is no threat to their lives.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Three suicide bombers launched an attack on the Chechen parliament Tuesday, killing at least three people, officials told CNN. Vladimir Markin of the Russian Prosecutor's Office said two police officers and a civilian died in the attack. Six other officers and 11 civilians were wounded, he said. However, Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov later said that only two people remained in the hospital. The others had ""sought medical assistance due to minor scratches caused by broken glass, or stress disorders,"" he said. A few hours after the attack was reported, the Prosecutor's Office said police had the situation under control. ""The special operation on neutralizing rebels who had stormed into the Chechnya parliament building has just been completed,"" the office's Investigative Committee said on its website. ""All of them were destroyed in a special operation when they showed resistance."" The militants entered the parliament compound as lawmakers were making their way in, according to RIA Novosti, a state news agency. One of them blew himself up at the entrance to the building, while two others managed to get inside and barricade themselves on the ground floor, Markin said. As they were attacked by security forces, they too blew themselves up, he said. The explosions caused heavy damage to parts of the building, according to a reporter for the state-run Interfax news agency.  Stained-glass windows on several floors were blown out, as were exterior tiles on the building, and some interior walls were demolished, the reporter said. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who was on a visit to France, was informed about the incident, the Kremlin reported on its website. Local Russian news agencies reported from the Chechen capital, Grozny, that the parliament resumed its work hours after the incident and held a planned session to discuss the republic's budget. Kadyrov was there, as was Russian Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev, who has been in Chechnya on an inspection visit. Kadyrov announced that the families of those killed in the attack will receive 300,000 rubles (about $10,000) and those injured will receive 100,000 rubles (about $3,300) each. In 2002, suicide bombers driving two trucks carrying an estimated 1 ton of explosives rammed the gates of another government building in Grozny, killing 72 people and wounding 310. Rebels in Chechnya started out fighting for independence in the 1990s, but in recent years, the fight has been aimed more at imposing Islamist rule and asserting their authority in the area. The fight has exacted a heavy toll in the North Caucasus region where Chechnya is located, and has now spread to other regions of Russia. The standard of living in the southwestern republic is poor compared with the rest of Russia. Unemployment is rampant and infant mortality is high. In addition, the Chechen population of about 1 million is mostly made up of Sunni Muslims, who maintain a distinctly different cultural and linguistic identity from Russian Orthodox Christians. The conflict dates back nearly 20 years, with Chechens having laid claim to land in the Caucasus Mountains region. Thousands have been killed and 500,000 Chechen people have been displaced from the fighting. A Chechen rebel leader took the responsibility for the deadly bombings that rocked two subway stations in central Moscow in March. In addition, Chechen rebels held 700 audience-members hostage in a Moscow theater in 2002. A Russian effort to free them resulted in the deaths of 120 hostages. Chechen rebels also were accused of downing two Russian airplanes in 2004. And they took over a school in Beslan in the North Ossetia region in 2004. When the siege ended, more than 330 people had died -- half of them children. In recent years, the insurgency has moved to the east and the west -- to the republics of Dagestan and Ingushetia, where rebels are fighting troops to destabilize the region.

"(CNN) -- Google's Eric Schmidt isn't naive. The tech exec has been bopping all around the world lately -- like the nerdy version of Carmen Sandiego -- talking to people in completely unconnected places like Myanmar and North Korea about the benefits of a future powered by the Internet. He's seen the statistics -- that only 2.7 billion people, or 39% of the global population, are online; that only 7% of households in Africa have Internet access; and that countries like East Timor, Ethiopia and Burundi have Internet penetration rates of near zero. Yet in spite of that, or maybe because of it, Schmidt claimed over the weekend that everyone in the world (capital ""Everyone"") will be connected to the Internet by 2020. ""For every person online, there are two who are not,"" he wrote on his Google+ page. ""By the end of the decade, everyone on Earth will be connected."" That's 6 years, 8 months and 15-some days from now. Pretty soon, huh? It is. And it probably won't happen that fast. As countless bloggers and Twitter users have pointed out in the past 24 hours, we live in a world where only 63% have access to ""improved sanitation facilities,"" i.e. toilets. Universal anything is difficult to achieve. But instead of bemoaning the boldness of his prediction, we should take Schmidt's words as a challenge. Information access is a human right. And until someone invents a version of that ""Star Trek"" computer, the Internet -- both on smartphones and on the pre-smartphone dinosaurs that sit on our desks -- is the best tool we have for spreading it. Everyone should get Internet access by 2020. And if not, then soon after. Mobile phones no doubt will pull the date closer. Still, nothing is assured. It's somewhat annoying and self-serving that Schmidt is the one rallying people behind this cause. Google sorta runs the Internet. The company's executive chairman clearly stands to profit (even more) from the rapid expansion of digital communication technologies. And he also is promoting a new book on the subject, which comes out at the end of the month. So the timing of this fortune-telling is suspect. But someone needed to set a date for the world to rally around. And Schmidt and co. may be in a unique position to actually help create a future where everyone can be online. Meanwhile, his own travels provide an interesting template for why this matters -- and why getting anywhere near universal and open access by 2020 will be difficult. Take North Korea, which Schmidt visited in January. ""Ordinary North Koreans live in a near-total information bubble, without any true frame of reference,"" wrote Schmidt's daughter, Sophie, who accompanied him on the trip. ""I can't think of any reaction to that except absolute sympathy. My understanding is that North Koreans are taught to believe they are lucky to be in North Korea, so why would they ever want to leave? They're hostages in their own country, without any real consciousness of it."" It's easy to see how that could change with access to the world's information -- and how the current war of rhetoric between North and South Korea could be ratcheted down if either of the countries had full and unfiltered access to information about the other side. But it's also clear that technological access is only one part of the battle. Governments around the world must peel back censorship laws and, in many cases, stop actively using the Internet to spy on their citizens. That's likely to be trickier than building infrastructure. Schmidt's March trip to Myanmar also was instructive. ""A mobile phone costs $1,000 per year and doesn't really work anyway, and a tiny number of the 60 (million) Burmese have Internet access,"" he wrote on Google+. ""There is no data service on their mobile network and no international roaming ... Myanmar is one of the last countries to get connected to the Internet, and it will not be a smooth path."" He goes on to question whether cultural trends will influence whether the Internet will be used for good or bad as it does expand in that country. ""Because of the phenomenon of 'anchoring,' where people believe the first thing they hear and anchor from that point,"" he writes, ""will the Internet be used to inflame special interests after 60 years of silence, or will the essential good nature of Burmese citizens prevail and will the transition be smoother than many think?"" I hope it's the smoother transition -- and that it comes soon(ish). The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Google's Eric Schmidt says everyone will be online by 2020 .
John Sutter: That date is unlikely, but the challenge is worthy .
He says access to free and open information is a human right .
Sutter: In addition to infrastructure, government must roll back censorship ."
"(CNN) -- As what might be the final battle rages in Libya, another is looming: the political battle to create a functioning democracy. As Libyan rebels try to consolidate their military gains in Tripoli, the National Transitional Council in Benghazi is trying to activate plans for a political transition. What role the United States will play in Libya's future isn't yet clear, but most believe it will be a major partner in an international effort. Getting an interim government in place in Libya as soon as possible is critical, the U.S. State Department says. That government would lead the process of writing a constitution and getting to elections, the building blocks of democracy. But international assistance will be necessary to put the other blocks in place. The priority is security, ""because we don't need any more civilian lives lost in Libya,"" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. U.S. officials said they're encouraged by reports the rebels have set up checkpoints around public buildings to promote public safety. ""Tripoli does not look like Baghdad looked after the fall of Saddam Hussein,"" with widespread looting, said Jeffrey Feltman, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. Confusion over the reported capture of one of Moammar Gadahfi's sons by the opposition raised questions about whether the Libyan people and the international community can trust the council with Libya's future should Gadhafi fall. Observers say the reported arrest -- and prompt reappearance -- of Saif al-Islam are at the least an embarrassing distraction for the rebels as they seek to take control of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. Mahmoud Shammam, minister of information for the NTC, acknowledged the situation over the reported capture was confusing. ""We admit our communication was not clear,"" he said, saying it had been representatives in Benghazi who stated Saif al-Islam was under arrest, rather than the prime minister. Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Tuesday that the rebels had the confidence of the American government despite the conflicting information over Monday's arrests. ""We have definitely found them to be credible and reliable interlocutors,"" she said. Professor Daniel Serwer of Johns Hopkins University has met with the NTC and said the opposition seems acutely aware of the need to establish the rule of law. ""From what we know, they want a democratic Libya, an Islamic state but a state that is clearly a multiparty state, that is clearly a liberal state. It would not be unique perhaps in the world, but it is certainly an experiment for Libya, which has not had a state at all."" The rebels who NATO assisted in routing Gadhafi forces are not professional soldiers and would need help in securing the huge stockpiles of Gadhafi's weapons and ammunition, including weapons of mass destruction like mustard gas. There also are reports of Gadhafi loyalists shedding their uniforms and melting into the crowds to fight another day. They will have to be tracked down. ""All along we've been talking about the inevitability of some foreign boots on the ground. That will take place, whether the fighting assumes what we would call street-to-street, block-to-block type of engagements that are characterizations of urban warfare or, more importantly, during these periods of transition,"" said retired U.S. Army Brig. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks. ""There will be a transition and it's coming up shortly. You've got to be able to lock down Gadhafi's military forces so they don't grow legs and go elsewhere and that takes some degree of a force on the ground."" While the United States has contributed substantial assets and intelligence to NATO-led efforts to oust Gadhafi, President Obama declared that no U.S. ground troops would be used in that effort nor in the aftermath. Referring to the rebels, a White House official said on Tuesday, ""They haven't asked"" for U.S. boots on the ground and ""they don't want"" U.S. boots on the ground. The official suggested any support of that nature would have to come from international partners. The NTC's stabilization team said it is considering asking several Arab states -- including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan -- for a force of several hundred troops to help protect important installations in Tripoli. Gadhafi's stockpiles of mustard gas and possibly other chemical weapons and surface to air missiles constitute a threat that would go beyond Libya's borders. ""Well, I'm worried about it as are many others,"" said Nicholas Burns, a former U.S. undersecretary of state and ambassador to NATO, ""...because if they were to get out and proliferate, it could do untold damage on the United States."" Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said while he had faith in the good intentions of the rebels, ""I don't know what their capacities are to find this stuff and to secure it. And we are going to start having to talk about some of the issues that are a little bit more difficult like what kind of international role is going to have to be played in Libya once Gadhafi has fallen ... we're going to be facing questions pretty early on about whether there has to be something more, including perhaps some international forces that can go in and secure weaponry if the rebels are unable to do so."" Marks said he still has concerns about Libya's one-time nuclear weapons program; even though Gadhafi gave up the program, the intelligence behind it is still dangerous. ""The smart technical brains I would imagine are still in place, and what side are they on? Where do their loyalties lie?"" The NTC has already agreed to a timetable for a new government. The next step would be an ""interim authority,"" broadening the TNC from 33 members to 60 to include newly liberated parts of the country. A 15-person panel will draft a constitution over 45 days. The constitution would then be voted on in a national referendum and legislative elections would be held four months later. A presidential election would be held two months after that. NTC officials estimate the process will take 10 to 15 months. ""(It would) become an interim government that would represent a broad cross-section of Libyans from different walks of life, different parts of the country, different political backgrounds,"" Nuland said. But tribal loyalties, control over oil revenues and disputes over Libyan government assets -- including $30 billion frozen by the United States -- could cause rifts in the opposition. Then things could turn ugly. I think we're going to have to expect to see a slow transition, perhaps a chaotic transition, perhaps, even, unfortunately a violent transition that wouldn't be surprising at all given the degree of disinfection and disunity that this country has suffered for so long."" Burns said. The U.S. is working with the United Nations to release $1 billion to $1.5 billion in frozen assets, Nuland said Tuesday, and give the money to the NTC for humanitarian purposes and to ""help it establish a secure, stable government."" Burns said the same international effort that carried out the military effort should now carry out the economic one. ""The Obama administration made a big point of saying the Europeans and the Arabs should be leading. And I think now that needs to extend to the aftermath of the fighting,"" he said. ""If there is going be a major international economic effort to help stabilize Libya, to rebuild the shattered cities, of course the United States should participate, but the Europeans should lead and do more because France and Italy and Spain have greater historical social economic interests than we do, and certainly the Arab countries should do more to help the Libyans. ""President Obama was criticized, as you remember, by some of his critics for having been too solicitous of the allies, for not having had the United States in front. It turns out to have been a very wise policy. It does spread the burden and the burden should still rest on the issue of weapons and other -- and on economic aid, I think, with the European allies and with the Arab neighbors."" William Cohen, a former secretary of defense and U.S. senator, called the international effort against Libya ""an important geopolitical statement."" ""Other countries have to step up and carry some of the burden. It can't be the United States leading every effort and you have other countries, whether it's the British or the French or the Italians or others who have strong ties, historically, to Libya, they have to play a bigger role,"" Cohen said. ""The United States can bring its power to bear in the form of intelligence, surveillance, direct munitions or precision guiding munitions. We can do all of that, but it's time for others to step up and bear some of the load that we've been carrying for many, many years now."" CNN's Jill Dougherty, John Helton, Chris Lawrence, Tim Lister, Dan Lothian and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Next battle ahead for Libyans is forming government and securing the country .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate approved a measure on Thursday aimed at ending budget-related air traffic controller furloughs that have been blamed for widespread flight delays this week. A bipartisan agreement giving Transportation Department budget planners new flexibility for dealing with forced spending cuts cleared the chamber unanimously. ""It will be good news for America's traveling public if Congress spares them these unnecessary delays,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""But ultimately, this is no more than a temporary Band-Aid that fails to address the overarching threat to our economy posed by the sequester's mindless across the board cuts."" The House was expected to take up the proposal on Friday. The plan also would allow authorities to protect 149 control towers at small and medium-sized airports that are slated for closure for budgetary reasons. Controller furloughs and the planned closure of towers that are privately run but overseen by federal aviation regulators have become political flash points in the partisan-fueled debate over spending in Washington. They have been highlighted by many to illustrate a clear nationwide consequence of the $85 billion in government-wide cuts that took effect in March and may otherwise not be apparent to the public. Vocal and politically powerful aviation interests have argued that the budget cuts affecting their industry would hurt business, travelers and cost jobs. More than 600 million people fly U.S. airlines each year, figures show. Furloughs affecting some 15,000 Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers began this week with the agency saying it had no flexibility to avert them without action by Congress. Under the sweeping austerity triggered by congressional inaction on deficit reduction, the FAA was required to cut $600 million from its budget. The proposal approved by the Senate would allow the Transportation Department to adjust funding to ""prevent reduced operations and staffing"" for the remainder of the current federal budget year, which expires on September 30. More than 863 flight delays were attributable to furlough-related staffing shortages on Wednesday at air traffic facilities in Chicago, New York, Washington, Cleveland, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, Detroit and Dallas, the FAA said. By comparison, there were more than 2,100 delays due to weather and other factors, the agency said. Controllers are spacing planes farther apart at key centers so they can manage traffic with current staffing, the FAA said. The deal designed to loosen the grip of spending cuts on aviation moved quickly through the Senate. ""Something rare has happened in Washington; the Senate came together on a bipartisan basis to put common sense before politics,"" said Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas. Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said she worried that continued FAA furloughs could jeopardize jobs throughout the travel and hospitality industry. Earlier this spring, Congress approved a stop-gap budget law that would, among other things, ease budget cuts for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and Veterans Affairs. CNN's Jim Acosta, Dana Bash and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report .","NEW: White House calls solution a ""Band-Aid""

"(CNN) -- A former U.S. federal employee helped recruit Cuban spies, the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday. A grand jury indictment alleges that Marta Rita Velazquez, 55, a former legal officer at the U.S. Agency for International Development, received orders from the Cuban Intelligence Service, helped pass documents about U.S. defense to Havana and helped a spy for Cuba obtain a position in the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency. ""Beginning in or about 1983, Velazquez conspired with others to transmit to the Cuban government and its agents documents and information relating to the U.S. national defense, with the intent that they would be used to the injury of the United States and to the advantage of the Cuban government,"" the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement announcing that the indictment had been unsealed. Velazquez, who was born in Puerto Rico, resigned from her USAID post in 2002 and has lived outside the United States since then, the Justice Department said. She currently lives in Stockholm, Sweden, the statement said. Officials said Velazquez's indictment is connected to the case of Ana Belen Montes, a former senior U.S. intelligence analyst who pleaded guilty to spying for the Cuban government in 2002. Montes, 55, is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence. Montes and Velazquez studied together at Johns Hopkins University in the 1980s and forged a strong friendship, the Justice Department said, ""with both sharing similar views of U.S. policies in Nicaragua at the time."" The indictment alleges that Velazquez helped a Cuban intelligence officer recruit Montes in 1984 and ""accompanied Montes on a clandestine trip to Cuba for Montes to receive spy craft training"" the next year. In 1985, according to the indictment, Velazquez helped Montes get a job as an analyst for the Defense Intelligence Agency. A grand jury returned the indictment against Velazquez in 2004, the Justice Department said. Velazquez is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit espionage. If convicted, she faces a possible sentence of life in prison.","Marta Rita Velazquez is charged with conspiracy to commit espionage .

"Tampa, Florida (CNN) -- Her family calls her the Mitt Stabilizer. Ann Romney, who is someone who is known to be able to calm her husband down when needed, is taking center stage in trying to paint a more personal picture of her husband of 43 years. ""Whenever Mitt might start, you know, winding up and getting really -- highly energetic they're -- they know that I have, like, a very calming influence on him,"" Ann Romney told CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger in a wide-ranging and at times emotional interview at the family's New Hampshire lakeside home. When asked her secret, she couldn't really explain it. The couple met as high schoolers in Michigan. They were separated for 2ÃÂ½ years when Mitt Romney went off to France to serve as a Mormon missionary. During that period, he was involved in an accident while driving the mission president and his wife; they were hit by what is believed to have been a drunken driver. ""He was thrown out of the car. And so you realize how close your brush with death was,"" she told Borger. Initially, the family got dire news. ""I had word that he was killed ... On his passport it is stamped that he is dead,"" she said. ""And so that was the first word we heard."" He would have some serious injuries but would recover and stay in France, actually taking over the mission. When he returned to the United States, he immediately proposed to Ann. They would start a family in Utah and then move to Massachusetts. ""We are each other's best friend in addition to being, you know, our, you know, loving relationship. We are each other's best friends as well,"" she said. She described their marriage as ""a real partnership."" Asked if she gave him advice, she said ""of course"" adding ""we share everything. There's nothing we do not know about, you know, any struggle that either one of us is going through. We share everything. ""Of course I give him advice, and of course he gives me advice. And I think we listen to each other more than we listen to anyone else."" She described a job that her husband also talked about to CNN, but it is one the family rarely discusses publicly: He served as head of the Mormon congregation in Belmont, Massachusetts, because the church does not employ paid clergy. So Romney not only led services but counseled members of the congregation and helped them in whatever way he could. ""I look at and see how -- how wonderful that was,"" she said. ""When we're mothers and responsible for children, there's something that happens to us -- that service gene that's naturally there where we're taking care, we're watching over. We're nurturing. ""And for men, they often don't get that experience. But when you serve in a way Mitt was serving at that time, that's exactly the experience he had: nurturing, caring, looking out for, being concerned."" Ann Romney has had several health scares over the years and has come back from all of them: early stage breast cancer, a surgery for a growth in her abdomen, several miscarriages -- and a 1998 diagnosis of multiple sclerosis which rocked the family and she said made her ""really dig deep."" iReporters share their MS struggles, triumphs . ""I was for a long time, after the diagnosis, trying to just struggle through on my own, not sharing with how hard of a time I was having. And so, you know, you kinda just wanna tough it out and not be a burden to anyone else. But then, finally, you just can't go on,"" she said. ""I really just was having a very, very hard time, and was very depressed,"" she told Borger, ""and had kind of given up a little bit in thinking that I was -- you know -- it was a little overwhelming."" Her husband took over the household chores -- cooking, going to the grociery store -- and reassured her ""that it wasn't fatal, we were gonna be OK,"" she said. ""No matter what I went through, he was gonna be there next to me and he was gonna be helping me. ""And he was like, 'I don't care how sick you get, I'm gonna take care of you. And I don't care if you . end up in a wheelchair, we'll be OK. I don't care.'"" At that point, she said, ""I wasn't able to do anything."" ""He's amazing,"" she said of Mitt Romney, ""because he is so energetic and so on that, for me even when I was as sick as that he would curl up in the bed with me. ""It was, like, he was gonna do anything he could to just say, ""I'm here. You're OK. Just stay right there and we'll be OK."" She said uncertainty about the disease, which has no cure, was very hard for her to face. ""You don't know how much is it gonna chew me up and spit me out? ... How sick am I gonna get? Is this going to be progressive? Am I going to be in a wheelchair? Am I, you know, gonna lose all function? ""There's this huge unknown. And it's a very, very frightening place to be."" She tried various ways to deal with the symptoms, especially fatigue, including an alternative treatment called reflexology, in which pressure is applied to various parts of the body. She also tried horse riding. While she had not seen major problems from the disease in recent years, she did have a relapse around the Super Tuesday primaries in March. ""I overdid and I knew I was overdoing,"" she said. Most people have ""a reserve tank,"" she explained, but ""with MS you go to empty and you go to empty."" ""It's like you can't take another step. You will fall over. And that's kinda what happened to me. ... I knew I was pushing the limit. But I also didn't say anything to anyone."" Her husband didn't notice, she said, and ""I don't blame him for not noticing. No one noticed. Everyone was so busy. And I don't think I was even . in the same states. I was going to my own states."" She said she ""just had to get past that mile mark and then I'd be OK, and I could rest. But I didn't quite make it to the mile mark. I kinda collapsed."" As she heads into this fall's campaign and an increasing schedule of rallies and appearances, how does she deal with the sort of stress that can trigger the disease? The stress ""is a great teacher,"" she said. ""It really is. Because (I) can't absorb all this that's going on around me. There's a lot of noise and there's a lot of really negative noise that's going on around me, around my husband -- during this campaign. And . so I have to just learn how to not to let that just get into my psyche."" She also described a different side of the Mitt Romney than the one seen by the public: ""fun-loving, warm, spontaneous."" ""Get him out of the public eye (and) he is loose and funny and spontaneous as you'd ever want to be. And just so much fun to be with.""","The Romneys met as high schoolers; their relationship has withstood the test of time .

"TOSTADO, Argentina (CNN)  -- The northern province of Santa Fe usually boasts lush vegetation in September -- the Southern Hemisphere's spring -- but not this year, as Argentina grapples with its worst drought in a century. Cattle in Argentina's Patagonia region. ""Hopelessness approaches, but you realize that hopelessness makes you crazy,"" said Jose Miguel Zabala, a cattleman in Tostado, a town full of hungry, thirsty animals. ""You give up hope, but there is no solution, there is no one who can alleviate the problem."" Zabala is managing 900 head of cattle, 130 short of his usual complement. So far this year, fewer than 200 millimeters (7.9 inches) of rain have fallen, less than a third of the 600 millimeters that usually have fallen by this time. Salt that has concentrated in the remaining well water is slowly poisoning his remaining animals. He and his fellow cattlemen know that more deaths are inevitable. The country's farm sector had already been hurt this year during four months of strikes held to protest an export-tax hike ordered in March by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Meanwhile, it's not just the old and weak cows that are at risk. Young, pregnant cows are dying, too. Government figures indicate that the drought is responsible for the deaths of about 15 percent of the area's 1 million head of cattle. And the impact is creeping into other farming sectors. ""We are almost at the limit of the last date that we can plant sunflowers,"" said Sixto Periche, of the National Institute of Farming Technology.

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan has been hit with a $58,600 by UEFA after being found guilty of ""improper conduct"" following allegations its fans racially abused Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor. The Togolese striker, who scored a precious away goal to take Tottenham through to the next round during last month's Europa League tie, appeared to be subjected to monkey chants, while a fan was also seen with an inflatable banana. Inter won the match 4-1 but crashed out of Europe's second-tier competition on the away goals rule with Adebayor's strike proving crucial. The Italian club was also charged with ""insufficient organization"" and ""throwing of missiles and/or fireworks."" Inter has already been punished in domestic competition after the Italian football authorities found its fans guilty of racially abusing former players Mario Balotelli and Sulley Muntari, who now play for fierce rival AC Milan. The club was fined $65,500 for the incident which took place in March, while it was also forced to pay out $22,700 after fans sang racist chants about Balotelli during a Serie A game against Chievo. Inter is one of two Italian clubs to have been punished by UEFA for racist behavior this season with Lazio having been hit with four charges this campaign alone. Lazio was punished with a $52,000 fine in February on the back of the $230,000 it was forced to pay for racist abuse and other offenses during two group stage games against Tottenham and Slovenian side Maribor. Meanwhile, Benfica has been fined $41,000 for organizational problems and the conduct of its supporters during last month's Europa League clash against Bordeaux in Lisbon.","Inter Milan fined $58,500 for its fans' racist abuse against Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor .

"Bourj Hammoud, Lebanon (CNN) -- Film director Nigol Bezjian was born in Syria, raised in Lebanon and studied in the United States, but nowhere does he feel more at home than in Little Armenia. Little Armenia is the vibrant Bourj Hammoud neighborhood of Beirut. Bourj Hammoud was developed mainly in the 1930s by Armenian refugees who arrived in Beirut after massacres of Armenians in 1915 and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Armenians and many historians refer to the massacres as genocide, but Turkey has always denied there was a genocide of the Armenian population. Bezjian, 57, director of the 1992 film ""Chickpeas,"" took CNN on a tour of his favorite parts of Bourj Hammoud, taking in a family restaurant, bookshop, church and art gallery, where he catches up with colleagues. He said: ""If you ask me what I am, I would tell you I'm Armenian. ""Bourj Hammoud has played a significant role especially after 1950s -- this is where the Armenian patriotism was born ... Armenian literature took root again. ""Armenian culture was reborn here in a way."" As he walked down the bustling streets, Bezjian shook hands with people he knew. ""This is the thing I like, you run into people and friends without planning,"" he said. In an Armenian bookstore, he said: ""When I come here, I see lots of acquaintances and friends from all different walks of life, I directly connect to my people and I get lots of inspiration from them."" In 2003, Bezjian made a documentary called ""Muron,"" named after the consecrated mixture of oil, flowers, and scents used in various rituals in the Armenian Church. Visiting a church Bourj Hammoud, he said: ""Muron is basically used to consecrate icons and also for baptizing, and I wanted to see how this was made. ""When they do a new one what remains from the oil is mixed in the new one so in a way the Muron that is made today is directly connected to what was made in year 301. This sense of continuity is very important."" Bezjian said he is not religious, but loves the church for the silence it provides from the noise of the streets outside. ""Church has always played a central role in preserving the Armenian identity and culture,"" he added. Bezjian takes CNN to an Armenian radio station where the news is read in Armenian and where he is a regular guest. Ending his tour in a restaurant called Baroud run by a father and son, Bezjian ponders the question of identity. ""In this part of the world people don't talk about identity so much, it's a given.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Supporters of former Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, are now publishing a monthly Arab-language newspaper. It's little more than a year on from the January 25 revolution that, after 30 years, deposed Mubarak amid jubilation and hopes for the future. Today, the economy is in trouble, protests continue against the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and Mubarak's ongoing trial -- dubbed the ""Trial of the Century"" in Egypt -- is causing controversy on all sides. Those opposed to Mubarak say they are not seeing justice, while the former president's supporters -- who say they represent ""the silent majority"" -- continue to lobby for Mubarak's release and ""dignity."" Newspaper, the ""Sun of the Truth,"" is their latest tool. Its publishers say it is dedicated to the ""reawakening of public consciousness."" The headline on the front page of the December issue reads: ""Charges against 'President' Mubarak are baseless with no evidence."" Mubarak's trial for corruption and the killing of more than 800 protesters began on August 3, 2011 and is ongoing. Law graduate and journalist Magdi Fouda is Editor-in-Chief of the two-month-old paper. He says he has dedicated his time and money to the project to set the record straight on the revolution. Egypt one year on: How the revolution has changed our lives . ""Most Egyptian media lost its neutrality,"" he said. ""We are a different but true voice that reveals the truth about the January 25 'crisis.' ""(It) has brought nothing but hundreds of kidnappings, more poverty, robberies, incredible loss in tourism and crimes we never imagined."" Economic concerns are high in many Egyptians' minds: Damage to the tourism industry has been estimated at up to $1 billion and the country's net international reserves have fallen by 50%, according to Bloomberg. Richard Quest: Unrest impact on Egypt's tourism . Fouda says he leads a team of 25 contributing journalists and free copies of the paper are distributed major cities in Egypt outside metro stations, residential compounds, universities and malls. They are also distributed in Abaseya Square in an upper-class neighborhood of Cairo, the location of major protests supporting the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces ruling Egypt since Mubarak's ouster on February 11. Fouda says the team printed 100,000 copies of the January edition. Fouda says the glossy 16-page newspaper was licensed in London, England and published in a small local printing press in the free zone in Cairo. The six partners funding the paper, he says, are professional engineers, doctors, and businessmen who have one conviction in mind -- to preserve Egypt and retrieve Mubarak's dignity. ""The former president -- a veteran of four wars and commander of the Egyptian Air Force in the 1973 war with Israel -- cannot be degraded in court like that,"" said Fouda. ""His humiliation is an insult to all the Egyptians he went to war for."" Mubarak's lawyer, Fareed El Deeb, advocates his client's innocence and has capitalized on the former president's honorable military career urging for him to be referred to a military court. Last week, El Deeb asserted that Mubarak was still technically president since he ""gave up"" the presidency orally without signing a written document as entailed in the constitution. A media war erupted and dozens of Egyptian TV stations, classified by their political direction as pro or anti-revolution, analyzed the lawyer's claims according to their political bias. In this confusing media and political landscape, many Egyptians have reverted to humor as a way of coping. Numerous jokes circulated on social networks and through text messages in response to El Deeb's claim that Mubarak is still president. One joke reads: ""Mubarak Out of Office Message: (Auto Reply) I will be out of the office starting from 11/02/2011 until 25/01/2012. For urgent issues contact Country Manager, my delegate Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi."" Tantawi is the head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the ruler of Egypt since February 11 2011. Many Egyptians see Egypt's current rulers as an extension of Mubarak's old regime. Economic shortcomings like the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces' failure to ensure a minimum wage to the millions of Egyptians living under the poverty line have left many in the country angry. It's a demand the opposition has had since Mubarak was in power. Opinion: What do Egypt's generals want? The majority of the population does not share the views in the ""Sun of the Truth,"" according to Dr. Safwat Al Allam, Professor of Political Media at Cairo University. ""The people publishing this paper distribute it for free knowing that the majority of the population are against their views. ""But their tactical approach may win them some of the poor susceptible people caught in the falling economic blunder Egypt is living today."" Al Allam says the revolution in Egypt is an ongoing process that has not been completed. People are confused and polarized amid the anarchy following the removal of the deeply-rooted system that came with the Mubarak era, he adds. Allam suspects the owners of the paper have other hidden motives of self-interest that may not sit well with those activists that have risked their life for the sake of real change in Egypt. Sherif Ahmed, a hard-line protester who participated in the uprising that ousted Mubarak took a glance at the paper before lashing out at the ruling Supreme Council.

"BAUCHI, Nigeria (CNN) -- The truck driver kept his hand on the horn, but resorted to shifting into first gear and used the full weight of his container truck to force his way through the over-crowded and narrow market street. In Nigeria, men burn broken computer equipment to collect reusable metals like copper. But the truck's rattling bulk, over-charged exhaust, and zealous horn only added extra rhythm to the cacophony of hawkers, hagglers, trucks and generators. This was just one of the many deliveries this morning for the big importers of Lagos's second-hand electronics Alaba market. ""A lot of people are interested in buying computer -- just to know what is going on in the world,"" explained Gabriel Okonkwo, as he watched his latest shipment arrive. The doors of his container were thrown open to reveal an Aladdin's cave of second-hand treasures -- computers, stereos, printers and televisions. All were quickly passed down to a mob of eager hands, where they are quickly sold to the local electronic stores. Nigeria is desperate for cheap electronic goods to try and bridge the digital divide with the West.  Watch a report showing piles of e-waste in Nigeria Â» . It is estimated five hundred containers of second-hand electronics are imported to Nigeria every month. It is also estimated that three-quarters of these imported products are broken beyond repair. The figures come from a US-based Environmental group -- BASEL Action Network -- who warns that the broken electronics discarded at local dumpsites are a mounting environmental disaster. At one of the local dumpsites, young boys sift through the electronic waste looking for anything of worth. Cables and wires are burnt to get at re-usable metals like copper wire, a practice which releases toxic metals and chemicals harmful to the local population. ""If you don't control it, there will be serious contamination and exposure of large populations to heavy metals from e-waste. Because it's a huge volume of waste we're talking about. And it's spreading,"" explains Oladele Osibanjo, the director for BASEL Nigeria. The irony is that many of these electronics were discarded by their original owners in the West for recycling. But not all second-hand computers shipped to Nigeria end up on the dumpsites. Traveling to northern Nigeria, we visited the Iya Abubakar Resource Center's IT training course -- attended by students, businessmen, and women. The Centre imports computers, but from charities like Computer Aid in the UK, to ensure they are reliable. For Aisha Hussain, the Center's director, it would be a waste not to use the business and education opportunities provided by the second-hand computers. ""Once you empower someone you do not consider it as waste,"" she explained. ""You empower the person socially, financially -- that shouldn't be referred to as waste because you've given that person a life."" The Nigerian government has ordered a crackdown on the importation of harmful and waste electronics, and is supporting plans to build a recycling plant in the region. Over-seeing the re-sale of his small mountain of televisions and computers, Gabriel Okonkwo is aware of the environmental problems but insists business must be taken into account. ""Both of them have to come hand-in-hand so we can live. If I don't do business I will die, and if the environment is bad I can die,"" he explained. ""So I have to do business in a way that will not affect the environment.""

"(CNN) -- This month, Inside the Middle East gets a rare look inside Saudi Arabia as we investigate the limits of personal expression inside the conservative kingdom. Janadiryah Festival . Now in its 27th year, Janadiryah Festival is a celebration of Saudi heritage and a way to help a new generation connect with its past. Just 45 km from the capital Riyadh, Saudis come here once a year to let go, a chance they rarely get in a society where religious laws limit most forms of expression. The festival is sponsored by Saudi Arabia's all-powerful monarchy who consider it an opportunity to promote traditional culture. Women: Beyond the Driving Issue . Despite strong resistance to change from several conservative groups, Saudi women are fighting for their rights more than ever. From the capital, Riyadh, to the Red Sea port city of Jeddah, we discover the challenges that many Saudi women face on a daily basis - from the driving ban to the inability to travel without the approval of a male guardian. Social Media Revolution . We meet Omar Hussein, a 25-year-old comedian who found his stage on YouTube. His show Al-Tayer, based on local humor, has drawn hundreds of thousands of hits. He's part of a growing trend where comedians and citizen journalists are using social media as a platform to address the two-thirds of the Saudi population under 30. These online celebrities are pushing the barriers of society through their popular, but sometimes controversial talk shows. Edge of Arabia .

"(CNN) -- Elena Lidawi is preparing her piano students to take part in a national competition. Lidawi's students will not perform in front of the judges in person, but by video conferencing. Lidawi teaches at Gaza Music School and the Palestinian national competition they will enter in March and April is only 50 miles away in Jerusalem. But the children are unable to leave Gaza because of travel restrictions imposed by Israel. Israel imposed an economic blockade of Gaza when Hamas won control of Gaza in 2007, to stop what it says is the transit of weaponry to be used by militants in attacks on Israel. Movement of people is severely limited. This is one of many logistical problems faced by staff and students at Gaza Music School, the only music school in the 360 square kilometer strip of land controlled by Israel. The school was set up three years ago by the UK-based Qattan Foundation and is about to be transferred to the Palestinian Edward Said National Conservatory of Music, which has branches in Jerusalem, Ramallah, Bethlehem and Nablus. Lidawi, a 38-year-old Russian who has lived in Gaza for 12 years, has taught piano at the school since it opened three years ago. She entered pupils into the same bi-annual competition two years ago and was pleased with their performance. ""My piano pupils took third and fourth place in the competition,"" she said. ""We worked very hard to prepare, and both myself and the pupils were very happy. The Gazan students competed by video conference against other Palestinians who were able to travel to Jerusalem to compete."" Gaza Music School opened toward the end of 2008, but within months it had been destroyed in the Israeli invasion of Gaza. Israel launched an air and ground military assault on Gaza in December 2008 and January 2009 in an operation against Hamas. Omar Qattan, secretary of board of the Qattan Foundation, said: ""Luckily there was no-one in the building at the time. The academic director had salvaged as many of the instruments as he could by taking them home. ""We decided immediately to reopen it. We rented new premises and managed to open again in the April (2009)."" Lidawi said of the attack: ""During the invasion I was evacuated to Jordan. When the building was bombed everything was destroyed. Many instruments, such as the piano, were destroyed."" Reopened in a new building in a different part of Gaza, the school now has 130 students and is so oversubscribed that only 15% of applicants are accepted. The school specializes in Arabic instruments such as the kanoun, a triangular stringed instrument a little like a horizontal harp, and the oud, a pear-shaped stringed instrument similar to a lute, and also teaches Western classical instruments and music theory. Qattan said: ""Our biggest logistical challenge has been getting both instruments and teachers because of the restrictions. I haven't been able to go myself since 2006."" Palestinians are allowed in and out of Gaza only under very exceptional conditions. Their movement is controlled by both Israel's blockade of Gaza and by the Hamas government. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and the European Union. More from Inside the Middle East: My Syria, by 'greatist living' Arab poet . The school is being taken over by the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music in March after its three-year pilot by the Qattan Foundation to ensure it has the best possible academic program. The Qattan Foundation works to develop culture and education in the Palestinian Territories and the Arab world, with a particular focus on children, teachers and young artists. Suhail Khoury, director of the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music, said of Gaza Music School, ""It's an excellent school. It's an oasis. The teachers have been doing a marvelous job in keeping the school going. There's a lot of talent, it just needs to be nurtured. ""It makes an incredible difference to the children and families in Gaza. It's a tough place and this is the first time there's something like this happening on a serious academic level."" However, he added: ""Our biggest worry is the access. Last December I was allowed to go to Gaza for the first time in 14 years, so that was a big step."" Khoury said technology is vital in helping navigate the travel restrictions in place in Gaza and the West Bank. ""We use video conferencing for interviewing prospective teachers, auditioning and sometimes giving classes. ""We hold a bi-annual national competition and the Gaza students participate by video conference. ""Sometimes it can be tough because the timing isn't very accurate. ""Nothing is straightforward. Exams are not going to be easy, but we have to use the technology as best we can,"" he said. Khoury said that logistical issues such as sourcing instruments and making travel arrangements take up a large proportion of the management's time. ""It's a logistical nightmare,"" he said. ""We can't hold any of our regular concerts or festivals in Gaza. ""When I visited Gaza you apply and wait and hear nothing, and then suddenly you're told you can go but it has to be tomorrow, so you drop everything and go. But you can't do that with visiting artists."" ""Getting instruments and materials into Gaza is also a problem, but we have had great help from friends in international circles.""

"(CNN) -- Here is the question: Can it be called a Michael Bay film if there are no explosions? With ""Pain & Gain,"" the director best known for action-packed films such as the ""Transformers"" franchise and ""Armageddon"" goes decidedly smaller, though no less hefty in the over-the-top nature. The film -- which opens Friday -- stars Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Anthony Mackie as a trio of hapless bodybuilders who launch a harebrained kidnapping scheme. An action-comedy, it's based on the true story of a murderous gang in Florida in the 1990s, which included a group of bodybuilders. Unlike Bay's other projects that have found him alternately hailed and crucified (he appears on both an Internet Movie Database list of all-time worst and best movie directors), there is a dearth of stylized car chases, massive guns and things blowing up. ""Pain & Gain"" was not conceived as a massively budgeted, summer blockbuster. ""I wanted to do a quirky movie,"" Bay told The New York Times. ""I wanted to do something small, just actors acting. It was almost like film school again for me."" Film school? For the man who brought the world ""Bad Boys"" and ""Bad Boys II""? Perhaps that is why Jack Giroux at the Film School Rejects site penned ""The Case for Michael Bay as Visionary Auteur."" ""A Michael Bay picture is many, many things,"" Giroux writes. ""The global showman has made his career off shiny money shots, a broad sense of humor, solid on-screen pairings, well-orchestrated chaos, and much more."" Despite the fact the new film isn't like most of his other movies, Giroux sees elements of Bay in in it. ""The director's newest movie, the abrasively entertaining 'Pain & Gain,' carries on those trademark signatures in many ways,"" he says. ""It's not the explosions which make him an auteur, it's the little things that make his human stories more meaningful than what we see from most blockbuster directors."" Bay probably agrees. He told CNN his latest project reminds him of another of his summer films from many years ago. ""I do like releasing films in summer, but this is a small little movie, but it's got a little of that 'Bad Boys' vibe to it,"" Bay said. ""So this kind of goes back to my roots. I like low-budget movies, and this is a character piece."" Forbes contributor Scott Mendelson notes that ""it's no secret that films like 'Pearl Harbor' (an epic romantic drama set during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor) and 'The Island' (a science-fiction thriller that serves as a parable for the perils of genetic science and/or abortion) were Michael Bay's attempts at artistic legitimacy. ""They didn't quite work out, leading Bay to somewhat surrender and helm a big budget trilogy based on a toy line about cars/planes that turn into robots and fight each other,"" Mendelson writes. ""So here in 'Pain & Gain' we see the return of 'serious' Michael Bay."" Wahlberg told The New York Times he had full faith in Bay -- who has also cast the star in his next ""Transformers"" film. ""You get the artsy-fartsy guys of the world who do these little quirky comedies or dramas, that think they're cool and they're the artists,"" the actor told the paper. ""But he can do the stuff that other guys can't do."" Co-star Ken Jeong, who is best known for ""The Hangover"" films, told The Hollywood Reporter that ""Pain & Gain"" is ""one of best Michael Bay's films ever."" For his part, Bay seemed to have enjoyed the respite that came with being scaled down. He told CNN he tried to keep things intimate on the set. ""It's really refreshing just to have actors act, you know? On 'Transformers' you are dealing with 2,000 people. This is much smaller, intimate, like a 100-person crew!""","""Pain & Gain"" is not your usual Michael Bay fare .
The director is known for big, flashy productions with plenty of explosions .
His new dark comedy had a smaller budget and crew ."
"(CNN) -- Women have been badly let down by the men they stood with during demonstrations that toppled tyrants in the Middle East and North Africa. Shot at, tortured, assaulted and detained -- they were equals at the point of protest but now, as new governments extend their grip, we can see that, as citizens, women remain firmly in the second class. So, as we celebrate the role of women on International Women's day, let us not forget that the struggle for equality is far from won. Even when progress seems to be a given, the pendulum can swing back leaving fresh challenges to defend progressive values. In Egypt, it did not matter that women had played a critical role in the uprisings that ousted the tyrant Mubarak. It did not matter that they had suffered equally from repression and lack of economic opportunity along with the men. It did not matter that they were subjected to the additional burden of discrimination because they were female. It did not matter that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces tried to discredit women protestors by arresting them and subjecting them to forced virginity tests. When elections finally came after so many years of dictatorship, Amnesty International asked political parties in Egypt to make commitments to basic human rights principles: principles such as freedom of expression and assembly, religious freedom, non-discrimination and gender equality. Most of those seeking political power through the parliamentary elections fell short of meeting even these minimum human rights commitments. Read also: Women and the Arab uprisings . The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party which won 235 seats -- 47 per cent of the total - failed even to respond to Amnesty International's request. The Salafist Al-Nur party, which came second with 121 seats (24 per cent) declined to promote women's rights or abolish the death penalty. So 71% of the new parliament is unwilling to commit to promoting women's rights and gender equality. There have been some chinks of light. Tawakkol Karman of Yemen was named as one of three women Nobel Laureates for peace, in an important, though, belated recognition of the role women have played in the protests dubbed the Arab Spring. During those heady days, women were a powerful voice, a compelling presence in the protests. They took the same risks as men when exposing human rights abuses committed by the state and calling for accountability; as leaders and agents of change in the uprisings they have not been exempt from the worst of the violence. Many women protesters were harassed, arrested, tortured and otherwise ill-treated in gender-specific ways just because they are women, defying convention and exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly. In Bahrain, where thousands of women took part in anti-government demonstrations, dozens were arrested and some were reportedly tortured or otherwise ill-treated. In Yemen, women taking part in protests and women activists have been killed, harassed, arrested and in some cases beaten for their participation in protests. In a desperate attempt to sideline women, Yemeni officials demanded that male relatives assert control over the women in their family and stop their activism. Read also: Women prisoners find freedom behind bars . However, women's protest is not new in this region: women were demanding their human rights long before the start of the uprisings of the last year -- in Iran and elsewhere. In Saudi Arabia, 20 years after women first sat at the wheels of their cars and challenged the restriction on females driving, the ban remains in place. Any woman who dares to challenge the ban faces arrest and attacks on their character. Saudi religious clerics have claimed that allowing women to drive would lead to moral decline in the kingdom. The demands of the women are clear. Women want a seat at the table and a voice in the debate and a vote in the decision making. More specifically, women are calling for equal rights to political participation and decision-making, equal rights in law, including in relation to marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance. Women must have legal protection from gender-based violence, including domestic violence and marital rape, and sexual harassment. International Women's Day is an opportunity to recognize the courage and stamina of the women living in the Middle East and North Africa. They will not be pushed back to the kitchen. We must all take a stand today in solidarity with them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Widney Brown .","Widney Brown says women took the same risks as men during the Arab Spring.
However, women are treated as second-class citizens in post-revolution politics, says Brown.
Using cases from the region, Brown argues that the struggle for gender equality is far from won."
"Hong Kong (CNN) -- This is not worksafe. It's a hyperlink to Hiropon, the pornographic fiberglass creation of Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami. To spare you the mouse click, here's the description. Hiropon is an anime-type character with monstrously huge lactating breasts that are spilling out of her bikini. She is both sick and ridiculous, a sculpture that -- I will admit -- makes me wince and laugh at the same time. This supersized fantasy figurine sold at an auction in 2002 for $427,500 and helped transform Murakami into a globally recognized art-world rock star. So when I sat down to interview the artist at the Gagosian Gallery in Hong Kong, I had to ask him what the hardcore Hiropon was all about. Was it a work of social satire? Was he criticizing anime culture by exposing its often lustful portrayal of women as objects? Not at all, says Murakami. It's just a celebration of his teen years as a self-described otaku. ""I became an otaku when I was in high school and absorbed many different things from anime like its erotic and fantasy elements... that very process resulted in that work,"" he says, adding that his art is about finding his true self. Takashi Murakami is one of Asia's hottest contemporary artists and an international art-world phenomenon. He's known for an approach called ""superflat"" -- a technique that combines high art and anime, while employing flat planes of color. The superflat movement propelled Murakami to fame in the 1990s and eventually caught the eye of designer Marc Jacobs. In 2002, Jacobs, as creative director of Louis Vuitton, collaborated with Murakami to update the traditional LV logo. The handbag collection became a defining accessory of the decade. Murakami made his mark in a decade of excess marked by bling, botox and Big Brother. But even in that era of gloss and luxury spin, he used his superflat language to bare his innermost feelings and urges. There's an honesty to his work, however plastic or shiny they appear. So Hiropon, along with his other otaku fantasies in fiberglass like Miss Ko2, is what it is -- an adolescent wet dream made real. Even Murakami's dazzling use of color comes from a true awkward moment of his past -- a teenage desire to please the hot girl in class. ""When I was doing painting as a freshman in university, an older female student came and told me that I severely lacked a sense of color,"" says Murakami. ""It just so happened that her boyfriend was known for his outstanding sense of color."" ""You can imagine, as I was hoping to make a living as a painter, how upset that comment made me! From that day on, I started studying the fundamentals of color."" A desire to please led to a love of dazzling color and his signature psychedelic color palette. A geeky love of sci-fi led to his universe of superflat creations like Mr. DOB, smiley-faced flowers and colorful mushrooms. And a willingness to bare his anime-fueled fantasies -- no matter how grotesque -- led to his super-sized figurines. If you happen to be in Hong Kong, you can get up close and personal with Murakami's work at his latest exhibition, ""Flowers & Skulls,"" at the Gagosian Hong Kong now until February 9. (Just look out for all the carefully-rendered nose hairs in his superflat self-portraits featured in the video above.)","Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami creates erotic, fantasy art with anime influence .

"(CNN) -- After 302 days behind bars -- and 130 days on hunger strike -- Maikel Nabil is savoring his freedom and his food. Nabil, 26, was jailed after being convicted by an Egyptian military tribunal in March last year for writing a blog post and Facebook comments criticizing the country's military rulers who took over from ousted president Hosni Mubarak. He was released on January 24, one of 1,900 prisoners pardoned by Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, before the first anniversary of the start of Egypt's revolution. By chance, Nabil was also released in time for the premiere of ""Back to the Square,"" a film about life in post-Mubarak Egypt, featuring Nabil's brother Mark campaigning for his release. ""Back to the Square,"" by director Petr Lom, premiered at the Rotterdam International Film Festival on January 29 and will be the opening film at the One World International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival in Prague, Czech Republic in March. Nabil's ordeal was one of five stories in the film, which also followed a 15-year-old boy who was almost killed in Tahrir Square on the Day of the Camel during the revolution, when pro-Mubarak supporters on horses and camels clashed with pro-democracy demonstrators. Also featured: An ex-convict who says he was forced to fight protesters in Tahrir Square; a female protester who was subjected to a virginity test; and a woman who says she was arrested and told to testify against her husband. ""As I collected stories it was clearer and clearer that there was a continuing injustice and lack of human rights that seemed to be the most urgent thing to be tackled,"" Lom said. ""Up until the end of last summer, most of the coverage suggested the country had already transformed, but it seemed to be that hadn't really happened."" He said all the characters he filmed were victims of injustice in post-revolutionary Egypt. More from Inside the Middle East: Women and the Arab uprisings: 8 'agents of change' to follow . ""The film has a theme of the loss of innocence, young people growing up and seeing reality and how it corresponds to their young dreams,"" Lom said. In a telephone interview, shortly after his release, Nabil said, ""I want my voice to be heard and I'm happy that is happening. However, I can't say I'm pleased to be released because I shouldn't have been jailed from the beginning. I haven't done anything wrong, I haven't committed any crimes, I have just written my opinions."" He added: ""The army should be tried for its human rights violations, not me. I can be called back to prison at any time, so I'm not really free. They have the material to send me back to jail. But I will continue to speak out. I'm still shouting very loudly."" A government spokesman denied Nabil's accusations of ill-treatment and said the blogger was suffering from disorientation as a result of his solitary confinement. The government has also repeatedly denied allegations of human rights abuses. Nabil went on hunger strike while in jail to protest his trial by military tribunal, which he described as a piece of ""theater"" in which he was unable to defend himself. He was able to sustain his hunger strike for 130 days by drinking water, milk and juice some days. Some days he had nothing at all. Overall, he had nothing to eat or drink on 10 days, 39 days he had only water, and 81 days of drinking milk and juice, Nabil said. ""I used hunger strike as a tool of nonviolent struggle to protest against my trial by military tribunal. ""It was my first experience of hunger strike and I was discovering my body and its ability to resist hunger. The hunger strike was effective because it showed people that I was ready to die for my freedom,"" Nabil said. ""People inside and outside of Egypt took interest in my safety and my life. ""People who refused to defend me changed their mind after my hunger strike. ""I became very, very sick, and suffered from problems with my heart and liver."" Nabil ended the hunger strike on December 31, several weeks before learning he was to be released. ""I ended the hunger strike because of the number of letters I received from activists all over the world. They asked me to stay alive for them to keep my knowledge to fight. These people loved me and wanted me to stay alive. ""The other reason I stopped was because I felt the new parliament in Egypt could make a change."" Egypt's lower house of parliament took over legislative power on January 23 after elections late last year, with 70% of seats taken by Islamist parties. Elections for the upper house of parliament, the Shura Council, will be completed next month. Presidential elections are set for June. More from Inside the Middle East: Egypt one year on: How the revolution has changed our lives . Nabil continued to write nearly 80 articles while in prison and smuggled them out with friends, who published them on the internet. Nabil said he learned of his pardon from news reports three days before his release. ""I didn't believe it or trust that it would happen until I was at home with my family and friends,"" he said. Petr Lom visited Nabil a month after his arrest while filming ""Back to the Square,"" although he was unable to film in the prison. ""It sent shivers down my spine to meet such an extraordinarily courageous young fellow,"" Lom said. ""He didn't mind being in prison for standing up for what's right."" Lom spent several months filming Nabil's brother Mark as he campaigned to raise awareness and support for his release. Mark Nabil traveled to Rotterdam with Lom for the premiere of the film. He told the The Daily Star, Lebanon: ""Maikel was against the way the army was taking over the revolution. He knew that nothing would change if the army took over."" A month after ending his hunger strike, Nabil said he is fully recovered and has regained the weight he lost.","Maikel Nabil was jailed by military tribunal for criticizing Egyptian army in a blog post .

"(CNN) -- While serving on an assignment in Afghanistan on October 23, 2010, Marine Cpl. Juan Dominguez landed on a buried bomb after slipping down an embankment and lost both of his legs and his right arm in an explosion. On the way to the hospital, he prayed that ""if it was God's will, then take me now."" He was at peace with losing his life in that moment. But it was not his time to die. As the 28-year-old veteran recovers, he often tells people not to be sad, because he'd do it again for his country. ""The Taliban's purpose was to kill me, but I survived,"" he said. Remembering 9/11 . Dominguez has spent months undergoing multiple surgeries and grueling physical and occupational therapy sessions since that life-changing October day. To help aid in his recovery, the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation and its partner, the Gary Sinise Foundation, are donating a new ""smart home"" for him to share with his wife, Alexis, and his 9-year-old daughter, Victoria. Dominguez and his family received the house on September 11. ""I consider this foundation like part of my family,"" Dominguez said. ""They've taken great care of me, with no strings attached, and I couldn't have asked for more."" The home is in the Reserve at Paseo del Sol community in Temecula, California. It's specially built to allow him to lead as independent a lifestyle as possible. The home's features include kitchen cabinets and shelves that lower for easy access to items, an elevator, and doors that automatically open as part of an electronic-sensor system run from an iPad. A pool will be installed soon where he can continue his therapy. ""Our team has worked with our subcontractors and vendors to create an exceptional home for an extremely deserving American hero,"" said Marty Langpap, Inland Empire division manager for Standard Pacific Homes. By sheer coincidence, the names of the streets in this subdivision are named after victims of the September 11 attacks, which gives added meaning to the Siller family. Stephen Siller gave his life as a New York firefighter on 9/11, and the family foundation to help veterans like Dominguez is a tribute to his life. Watch: Turning a 9/11 loss into a trauma-healing charity . Dominguez received the keys to the home at 6:59 a.m. PST, the exact time Siller died 11 years ago in the World Trade Center's south tower. ""Giving Juan a measure of his life back after all he has done, on the anniversary of the day our brother died, means the world to us,"" said Frank Siller, chairman of the Tunnel to Towers Foundation. Siller's cousin John Hodge said that what impresses him most about Dominguez is his positive attitude through such adversity. ""This guy is a role model for all of us, and he's deserving of great things,"" he noted. Dominguez, who is from New Mexico, chose Temecula because he fell in love with the city after several visits. Its close proximity to San Diego, where he receives outpatient care, made it an attractive draw, too. One of Dominguez's favorite spaces in his new home is the music room. He plays the drums and guitar and has a studio where he can enjoy his musical passions. Another highlight is space for a nursery room for when he and his wife (whom he married this year) decide to grow their family. ""We've set a goal to have a child within five years,"" he said. After 9/11, how we honored our son's memory . Temecula enthusiastically anticipated his relocation and welcomed him with American flags lining his motorcade's route on the morning of September 11. Two platoons from Dominguez's battalion, Temecula police and firefighters, city officials, representatives from the foundations, city residents and Emmy-winning actor Gary Sinise were on hand to celebrate as Dominguez took possession of his new house. ""I've traveled to many places, and I've never been to a town where people are so nice and welcoming,"" Dominguez said. ""People here already recognize me, open doors for me and consider me their neighbor."" Dominguez's $600,000 ""smart home"" was funded by a $450,000 donation by Ned Wallace, president of Wallace Air Cargo Group Inc. The foundations raised the rest of the money through fundraisers, including a benefit concert starring Sinise and his band in Temecula. The furnishings were donated by Shubert Design Furniture in St. Louis. Volunteers helped move the furniture 1,800 miles from St. Louis to Temecula last week. Hodge says the organization relies heavily on donations and the kindness of others. ""We've built homes for heroes like Dominguez in the past, and we need the help of donors to continue more projects into the future."" Do you have plans to mark the anniversary of 9/11?

"KETCHIKAN, Alaska (CNN) -- The ""Bridge to Nowhere"" may have been shelved. But the ""Road to Nowhere"" is alive and well. Gov. Sarah Palin let the ""Road to Nowhere"" go ahead because the contract had been signed. The proposed $400 million span that would have connected the coastal city of Ketchikan to its airport on Gravina Island died after it became a symbol of congressional excess. But the three-mile access road that was built on the island is ready for residents to take a drive to nowhere. It was paid for by some of the $223 million in federal funding that sparked ridicule among opponents of congressional ""pork-barrel"" spending. In stump speeches, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has touted her eventual decision to abandon the Gravina Island bridge, which she initially supported. But Palin, now the Republican vice presidential candidate, let the access road go ahead because the contract to build it had been signed, a campaign aide said. iReport.com: Are you in a battleground state? Share your stories . Ketchikan Mayor Bob Weinstein calls the road, which was paid for by federal tax dollars, a waste of money that could have been used to fix his city's roads and sidewalks. ""Gov. Palin could have stopped construction of this road,"" said Weinstein, who wore his ""Nowhere, Alaska"" T-shirt to an interview with CNN.  Watch where road ends Â» . The island is connected to the city by a ferry that runs to the airport, well past the point where the bridge was to have been built. But some locals said they'll find some way to use the road, such as running or bicycle riding. ""It'd be nice to see them put something over here now they have a road: park, picnic benches, something to get people out here,"" said P.J. Murphy, who works on the island. ""I mean, it's pretty here."" Read Abbie Boudreau's ""backstory"" blog on ""Road to nowhere"" Campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said Palin would not have allowed the road project to go forward under normal circumstances. But the deal had been signed just before she took office in December 2006, Stapleton said. ""The governor was left no viable alternative,"" Stapleton said. For the first two weeks of her campaign, Palin routinely told audiences in her stump speech that she told Congress ""thanks, but no thanks"" for the bridge, which was backed by the leaders of Alaska's congressional delegation. But Weinstein, a Democrat, said Palin instead spent $26 million to build a road ""that will not go to a bridge."" Palin has been heavily criticized for repeating the stock line about killing the ""Bridge to Nowhere"" without noting that she supported the project as a candidate for governor. She has dropped the line from her stump speech in the past week, but a McCain-Palin aide said that her prepared remarks are being tweaked as needed to reflect current events, and it could come back again.","Road on Alaskan island was built with some of $223 million in taxpayer money .

"(CNN) -- Rescuers are looking for two missing hikers after finding a third dead on the slopes of Oregon's Mount Hood, but the search has been hindered by the threat of avalanches, a sheriff's deputy said Sunday. The hikers began their climb at about 1 a.m. PT Friday. Authorities received a call that they were missing at about 10 p.m. Friday, said Deputy Scott Meyers of the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office. They planned a fairly easy, ""semi-technical"" hike in which they would come down the south side of the mountain, Meyers said. Authorities followed what they believed to be the planned path, and on Saturday found the body of one of the hikers, identified as Luke T. Gullberg, 26, of Des Moines, Washington. Search and rescue personnel were unable to locate the others -- Anthony Vietti, 24, of Longview, Washington, and Katie Nolan, 29, of Portland, Oregon. Coverage from CNN affiliate KPTV . ""This is still called a rescue operation, at least for a couple days,"" Meyers said Sunday, meaning authorities hold out hope of finding the hikers alive in the freezing conditions. ""We have reason to believe one of the two missing hikers has a bivvy sack, kind of like a lightweight sleeping bag. The female hiker is fairly well prepared for this climb -- she did have some stuff to warm up with."" ""We're looking at the area where we found the body,"" he said. ""We think they may have dug into that area and just can't get down."" But the threat of avalanches ""is too high to go forward with a full ground rescue operation,"" Meyers said. Another deputy, Jim Strovink, said there is ""a high level of danger for avalanche potential on Mount Hood."" A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 aircraft was coming to help in the search, and an Oregon National Guard helicopter was flying around the area where the hikers might be, authorities said. When the avalanche danger lowers, three teams will head to the probable areas, Meyers said. ""It could be today, it could be tomorrow,"" he said. Temperatures were in the 20s overnight, with winds higher up the mountain. The mountain rises 11,239 feet above sea level, with a vast base that stretches over 92 miles (148 kilometers). It is the highest mountain in Oregon, a dormant volcano with steam constantly spewing from holes, according to the Web site mthood.info.

"(CNN) -- After a difficult past year, Rafael Nadal is back where he feels most comfortable -- but his rivals are battling to find form ahead of the French Open. While the Spaniard cruised into the quarterfinals of the Monte Carlo tournament he has won for the past eight seasons, world No. 1 Novak Djokovic again had to come from behind to earn his place while Andy Murray suffered a crushing defeat that will demote him to third in the rankings. Fourth seed Tomas Berdych and No. 5 Juan Martin del Potro also crashed out Thursday to thin out the competition for Nadal as he continues his winning return to the ATP Tour following longterm knee problems. His 6-2 6-4 rout of German 16th seed Philipp Kohlschreiber was his 16th successive victory this year following a defeat in the final of his comeback event in Chile in February. ""I feel more relaxed, yes. I had some uneasy moments during the past year,"" Nadal said after his 44th consecutive win at the clay-court event, which set up a clash with 21-year-old Bulgarian Gregor Dimitrov. ""Now I'm back on the tour. Just being here is good news. And winning matches -- I say it every day, but winning every match is very important to me today. Every time I have the chance to go on court and play well, feel competitive, is a really good feeling."" Dimitrov is also on a roll, having followed up his opening victory over world No. 10 Janko Tipsarevic by beating Germany's Florian Mayer 6-2 6-4. ""Really looking forward to that match,"" said Dimitrov, who reached a career-high 31st in the rankings last month. ""Even for now I'm very excited. ""I'm feeling quite good coming on court with (the top players). I feel also physically I'm ready to kind of hang with them more as the match goes on. ""I know tomorrow is another point of view, since clay court you're playing against the greatest of all time. There's that feeling and anxiety that you want to come out and do the best you can. I think most of all you have to keep a good composure."" Murray is seeking to restore his composure after being beaten in less than an hour by Stanislas Wawrinka, a result that will see the Swiss 13th seed's absent compatriot Roger Federer return to No. 2 in the rankings. ""When I started making a lot of errors he was able to dictate all of the points from there,"" said Murray, who made 24 unforced mistakes as he missed out on a possible semifinal against Nadal. ""I've played some good tournaments here but it does take me time to feel comfortable on the surface. I need matches against top players to see what's going wrong and going right and the things I need to work on to get better. ""No-one wants to lose matches like that. Hopefully I can use it as motivation to improve because I really need to do a lot of work. I need to work really hard over the next two weeks to get ready for Madrid."" Last year the Spanish capital's experiment with blue clay proved unpopular with most players, and it was banned for this season. Djokovic was one of the most vocal critics, but this year he is focused on his fitness problems after battling to beat Juan Monaco 4-6 6-2 6-2 on Thursday. ""It's another big test obviously, again a two-hour match,"" said the Serbian, who injured his ankle on Davis Cup duty earlier this month. ""Obviously I'm not physically feeling my best. Somehow feels that I always miss that half a step. But I'm trying. I'm fighting. After I lost the first set today, I tried to find that inner strength. I found it again. So that's a positive thing. Every day brings a new challenge and we'll see what happens tomorrow."" A two-time runnerup in the principality, Djokovic -- who could again meet Nadal in the final -- will next face Del Potro's conqueror Jarkko Nieminen. The veteran Finn triumphed 6-4 4-6 7-6 (7-4) against the 2009 U.S. Open champion as he was taken to a tie-break in the decider after the Argentine saved a match-point, before reaching his first Masters-level quarterfinal since 2006. Berdych lost 6-4 6-2 to 32nd-ranked Italian Fabio Fognini, who earned his first Masters-level quarterfinal appearance -- a clash with French seventh seed Richard Gasquet. Gasquet, a semifinalist in Miami last month, beat Croatian ninth seed Marin Cilic 7-5 6-4. Wawrinka, meanwhile, will next face world No. 8 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who defeated Austrian Jurgen Melzer 6-3 6-0 the day after the Frenchman's 28th birthday. ""To beat Andy that easy was a big surprise, for sure,"" Wawrinka said. ""I'm playing really good, really strong, really confident with my game. He's playing slow, he's playing from the baseline, he's not putting so much pressure. For me on clay, it's perfect.""","Defending champion Rafael Nadal through to last eight of Monte Carlo Masters .

"(CNN) -- Two Japanese airlines grounded their fleets of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which has been beset by a string of mechanical and other problems, after an All Nippon Airways flight made an emergency landing Wednesday. Japan Airlines has seven of the airplanes and All Nippon Airways normally flies 17. It was not clear how long the JAL and ANA flights would be grounded. ANA Flight 692, with 129 passengers, made an unscheduled landing at Takamatsu airport in Japan, said airline Vice President Osamu Watanabe, after a battery alarm signal activated on the plane. Those on board reported a burning smell in the cabin. One alarm indicated smoke in a forward electrical compartment, officials said. The ANA aircraft left Yamaguchi Ube Airport and was en route to Haneda when the incident occurred, airline spokesman Takuya Taniguchi said. Boeing spokeswoman Lori Gunter said the company is ""aware of the event and working with the customer."" Dreamliner woes explained . Dreamliner troubles dating back four months include reports of an oil leak, a fuel leak, engine cracks and a damaged cockpit window. This follows a very difficult development history that included a series of production setbacks and other delays before the plane entered service in 2011. Fifty of the aircraft have been delivered to airlines. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was aware of the latest incident in Japan and was gathering information. The Federal Aviation Administration, which is responsible for air safety, launched a comprehensive examination on Friday of the Dreamliner's design as well as its manufacture and assembly. The FAA said it was monitoring the ANA emergency landing report. ""The incident will be included in the comprehensive review the FAA began last week of the 787 critical systems, including design, manufacture and assembly,"" it said in a statement late Tuesday. The NTSB, meanwhile, continued its investigation of a battery fire last week. NTSB investigators are disassembling the burned battery involved in the January 7 fire aboard a Japan Airlines Boeing 787 at Logan International Airport in Boston. This week, the NTSB released photos that showed charred parts and wire bundles. The fire broke out in the avionics compartment of an empty Dreamliner shortly after it had arrived and passengers had disembarked. A maintenance worker noticed smoke in the belly of the plane and called emergency crews. The battery powers the auxiliary unit and provides electricity for ground operations. The damaged battery was removed last week and transported to a federal laboratory in Washington, according to the NTSB. When new, the battery weighs about 63 pounds. It is approximately 19 by 13 by 10 inches. Officials said they made digital radiographs and computer scans to document the internal condition of the battery before taking it apart. Dreamliner safety review: What it means for fliers . Investigators will download any retrievable data as part of the inquiry. In addition, the airplane's combined flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were also sent to the NTSB for analysis. Fire and rescue personnel used a fire retardant to contain the flames after the battery exploded. Last week, Boeing chief engineer Mike Sinnett expressed confidence in the battery system. ""I am 100% convinced the airplane is safe to fly. I fly on it all the time,"" he said. A week Boeing would like to forget . In addition to the NTSB investigation, Japanese and French aviation officials also have launched investigations. There are more than 150 Dreamliner flights daily, according to Boeing. United Airlines, which has six 787s, debuted the nation's first domestic Dreamliner routes in November with much fanfare. Ray Conner, the head of Boeing's commercial airplanes unit, said Friday that Boeing is convinced of the aircraft's safety and that the airlines that have bought the plane are also confident in its safety. ""These planes are safe,"" he said. ""We welcome any opportunity to further assure people outside the industry."" One passenger said Friday he would avoid flying on a 787 for the time being. ""I am wary of a plane model that has fire problems and leaks fuel,"" said Atlanta-based businessman Bobby Burns, a project manager who takes more than 50 trips a year. ""I think of it the same as a new car model: Wait a year or two to get all the 'recalls' sorted out.""

"(CNN) -- NATO helicopters opened fire on a Pakistani checkpoint early Saturday, killing 26 soldiers, a provincial governor said. At least 14 soldiers were wounded in the attack in the Mohmand Agency area, said Syed Masood Kausar, governor of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Mohmand Agency is one of seven districts of the volatile region bordering Afghanistan. ""It's a huge incident; the reaction is obvious,"" he said at a news conference in Islamabad. The death toll could rise as many of the injuries are critical, military officials said. The officials did not want to be named because they are not allowed to talk to the media. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has called an emergency meeting of military services chiefs to formulate his country's response, his spokesman said. The Defense Committee of the Cabinet will meet later Saturday. In a statement, Gilani said he ""strongly condemned the NATO/ISAF attack on the Pakistani"" checkpoint. The matter is being taken up by the Foreign Ministry ""in the strongest possible terms"" with NATO and the United States, the statement from his office said. NATO's commander in Afghanistan said he is committed to a thorough investigation. ""This incident has my highest personal attention and my commitment to thoroughly investigate it to determine the facts,"" Marine Gen. John R. Allen said Saturday. He also offered his ""sincere and personal heartfelt condolences"" to the families of any Pakistan Security Forces members killed or injured. U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter, said: ""I regret the loss of life of any Pakistani servicemen, and pledge that the United States will work closely with Pakistan to investigate this incident."" The incident on Pakistani soil is likely to damage already strained relations between Pakistan and the United States. Pakistan closed both NATO's supply routes into Afghanistan Saturday in response to the attack, Pakistani military and intelligence officials said. NATO trucks use the routes, in Khyber Agency and Balochistan, to supply U.S. and international forces fighting in Afghanistan. About 50 containers and trucks carrying supplies for NATO were stopped at the town of Jamrud in Khyber Agency on Saturday morning, said Jamil Khan, a senior government official in Khyber Agency, bordering Afghanistan. They were ordered to turn back toward Peshawar, the provincial capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, he said. A second route from Pakistan into Afghanistan, the Chaman border crossing in Balochistan province, was open to NATO supply trucks earlier Saturday but was then shut in the afternoon, the military and intelligence officials said. Roughly 40% of nonlethal NATO supplies and fuel go through Pakistan, with hundreds of supply trucks using the two routes into Afghanistan. About 130,000 troops are deployed in Afghanistan with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, 90,000 of them American, according to NATO figures. Pakistani politicians responded angrily to the incident in Mohmand. Ahmed Khan Bahadur, a provincial lawmaker from the Awami National Party, the ruling party of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, told CNN that people had had enough. ""This is the time to be united as a nation and to punch NATO with a fist,"" he said. ""NATO could never dare if we were united."" Former international cricketer turned politician Imran Khan, who heads the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, condemned the incident and said it was time for Pakistan to pull out of the U.S.-led ""war on terror."" If confirmed, the incident could be the deadliest for Pakistani soldiers involving NATO since a U.S. airstrike in June 2008, which Pakistan said killed 11 of its forces who were cooperating with the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. That airstrike, also in Mohmand Agency, prompted the government in Islamabad to summon the U.S. ambassador and lodge an official protest. NATO's Allen met with the Pakistani Chief of Army Staff Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani on Thursday, the Pakistani military said. ""The visiting dignitary remained with him for some time and discussed measures concerning coordination, communication and procedures between Pakistan army, ISAF and Afghan army, aimed at enhancing border control on both sides,"" a Pakistani military statement said. Meanwhile, a commander of Afghanistan's eastern border police said an operation in the area bordering Mohmand Agency on Friday night killed 10 insurgents. ""Last night, there was an operation there inside Afghanistan,"" he said. ""Pakistani and Afghan Taliban have got a broad presence there as there are forests and difficult terrain. That's why there was an operation."" The military activity was in Afghanistan's Kunar province, he said, adding he was unaware of any NATO attacks on the other side of the border. CNN's Reza Sayah and Nasir Habib in Islamabad contributed to this report.","NEW: Pakistani politicians react angrily to the deaths .

"(CNN) -- Search teams combing the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona found a body on Saturday believed to be that of a missing 20-year-old hiker, the National Park Service said. Bryce Gillies, 20, left last Saturday for a backpacking trip, saying he would return Monday. Bryce Gillies, a student at Northern Arizona University, left last Saturday for his backpacking trip through the Deer Creek-Thunder River area of the park, and said he would return on Monday. A search effort was launched on Tuesday after he was reported missing. Some 50 National Park Service volunteers and staffers from Grand Canyon and nearby parks joined in the search. One search team found a body in the Bonita Creek area on Saturday at 9:30 a.m. (7:30 a.m. ET) that ""has been presumptively identified"" as Gillies, according to NPS. ""The body will be recovered by helicopter via long-line operation and transferred to the Coconino County Medical Examiner,"" NPS said. It is the second death this month at Grand Canyon National Park, a world-famous landmark that receives about 5 million visitors yearly. A California man drove his car over the edge of canyon's South Rim, plunging some 600 feet into the ravine. His July 13 death was ruled a suicide. More than 100 hikers have died at the park between 1925 and 2006, half of them fatal falls, according to Michael Ghiglieri and Thomas Myers, authors of ""Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon.""","National Park Service: Body found in the Bonita Creek area at 9:30 a.m. Saturday .

"(CNN) -- So is this the ""new normal""? That's the question I keep hearing as people try to comprehend the tragedy at the Boston Marathon and its chaotic aftermath. The answer is yes -- in more ways than you might think. I don't mean that we're supposed to get used to explosions, school shootings and other threats arising seemingly randomly and without warning. But we should accept that the old ways of understanding and responding to conflicts and threats no longer apply. In an always-on, post-narrative age, 24-hour cable and Internet news and Twitter feeds offer a steady stream of opportunities for panic and misinformation. We have a suspect; no, we don't; yes, we do. The school is on lockdown; no, it's not. False alarms are still alarms, after all. It's like we are all living in newsrooms, or as 911 operators or air-traffic controllers, for all the emergency interruptions and bulletins we navigate practically every hour. Then consider the equally unnerving limbo we endure once there's nothing new to report. The stakes are too high to return to regular programming, so we just sit there, poised on high alert along with the police and journalists. This time, it was flashing blue lights and the search for a suspect. Before that, it was the live feed of Deepwater Horizon in the corner of the screen for weeks, belching oil into the sea. Whether interruptive or chronic, the anxiety keeps pouring in. We live in a state of ""present shock."" That was the week from hell . And even if network anchors still had the authority they once did, they would not be able construct a satisfying story around the onslaught of neverending news. When the journalists cheered as the police caught the marathon bombings suspect in the boat, it seemed that they were mostly relieved at reaching a definitive conclusion to a neverending news cycle. One news anchor actually declared ""justice won"" as she was at last permitted to cut to commercial. It rang false, because there's no genuine finality anymore. The story just doesn't end. Nor does the anxiety. For it's not so much a matter of responding to a particular crisis, threat or tragedy but of coping with the persistent flow of urgency itself. Some of the unease we feel with the Boston bombings comes from the nagging sense that we have no way of gauging where we are in the arc of violence. Is this the beginning of a new series of attacks, a rare event like the Oklahoma City bombing or part of some greater conspiracy yet to be revealed? Of course, none of the usual narratives apply, for we no longer live in a world with beginnings, middles and ends. That quaint structure went out with the Industrial Age and the moon shot. We no longer design career paths; we no longer invest in the future. We occupy; we freelance; we trade derivatives. Everything happens in the now. Even terror. While there are certainly groups such as al Qaeda with political goals and a modicum of organization, for every plotted attack with strategic goals, there are many more that arise haphazardly, randomly -- by either sympathizers, copycats or mentally ill nihilists with no political justification whatsoever. Boston's week of terror . We're no longer fighting enemies in the normal sense. We cannot begin a war on terrorism and then declare victory when we're done. We can't stick a flag in it and call it won. No, the challenges of a post-Industrial society are less like conquests with clear endpoints than they are steady-state concerns. Oil is spilling. The climate is changing. Terrorists are plotting. Crises are never quite solved for the future so much as managed in the present. But accepting the essentially plotless and ongoing nature of crisis needn't compromise our ability to respond appropriately and effectively. In fact, by freeing ourselves from the obsolete narratives we used to rely on, we can begin to recognize the patterns in the apparent chaos. We may not get answers to rally around or satisfyingly dramatic finales, but neither will we need to invent compelling, false stories to motivate ourselves into action. In a world where crises are constant and perpetual, we might as well begin to develop more sustainable approaches to solving them in real time, rather than once and for all. Life goes on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff: New normal is constant info stream; we don't really know how to respond .

"(CNN) -- If you're the type of person who thinks working out is just a waste of energy, then a new gym developed in the UK might help change your mind. This new fitness center, situated in a city park in Hull, northeast England, not only provides a facility for local residents to get fit but also generates electricity every time the equipment is used. ""So far, the community has generated 40,000 watt hours (40 kilowatts),"" says Georgie Delaney, creative director at The Great Outdoor Gym Company. ""The goal is that a gym like this should serve a community of about 5,000 people and really people could easily make a kilowatt hour per day. So, if you times that by the amount of gyms that we could possibly install, that actually becomes quite a significant amount of energy,"" Delaney said. Read: Arab Youth turn heat up at U.N. climate conference . The company has already installed more than 350 gyms in public places around the UK -- paid for by local councils and free of charge to use for local residents -- but this is their first to convert human energy into electricity. The gym currently powers its own lighting, but the hope is that one day they will be feeding surplus energy into the national grid and reducing electricity bills. ""We truly believe that in the western world we consume too much energy both in terms of food and electricity. What we're trying to do with the green energy gyms is give councils and communities a tool, with a facility like this, so people can actually offset their consumption of both food and electricity,"" Delaney says. The concept clearly impressed city officials in Hull. ""The aim of the council is to get more and more people active instead of sitting in their lounges watching television,"" says councilor Terry Geraghty. ""We want to get people off their [sofas] and get a bit active ... more and more people are getting obese, also diabetes, heart disease, not just in Hull, but in the country,"" he added. Read: Chasing down the world's vanishing glaciers . The idea is also attracting interest from local authorities around the world, some of them in developing countries, says the company. The prototype in Hull cost around $100,000 to install, but there are also plans to develop a cheaper $32,000 model which would charge mobile phones and a larger gym (around $130,000) where power could be fed back to the grid. Ling Ge, a research scientist at the UK's Imperial College London, is impressed with the scheme but its price may be an issue for poorer nations. ""The conversion from the gym to the national grid could be quite costly in developing countries,"" Ling says. Instead of installing electricity-generating gyms in countries in Africa, for example, it might be cheaper to use alternatives such as solar heating, solar power cells or hydroelectric power stations, she says. ""But still, it's a really beautiful concept and it uses existing technology in a novel way,"" Ling said. ""I think it's an excellent way to educate people about the concept of sustainability and changing people's behavior without putting the 's' word in your face.""","Gym which generates electricity from workouts installed in UK city .

"(CNN) -- For most of the 37 years between 1963 and 2000, Jerry Sandusky was the epitome of a Penn State man. That shining image dimmed over the weekend, when police arrested him on seven counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and other charges, including aggravated indecent assault and endangering the welfare of a child. Sandusky, 67, allegedly engaged in fondling, oral sex and anal sex with young boys over a period of more than 10 years, according to an investigative state grand jury's summary of testimony. He maintains he is innocent. Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno spoke for many in the community when he called the string of sexual child abuse charges against Sandusky ""shocking."" The charges put a whole new spin on the title of his autobiography, ""Touched: The Jerry Sandusky Story."" Published in 2001, the book explores Sandusky's career and his involvement in children's charities. A starting defensive end for the Nittany Lions for three years, Sandusky went on to spend all but two years of his coaching career working the sidelines for Penn State, most of them as defensive coordinator. The university has called Sandusky ""largely responsible for Penn State earning the moniker 'Linebacker U,' with 10 of his linebackers earning first-team All-America honors."" Eleven years ago, he retired to focus more attention on Second Mile, the program he had founded for troubled youth. But he still maintained ties to the university, continuing as a volunteer with the athletic department's life skills and outreach programs. ""Football coaching has been a wonderful career because it has brought me into contact with so many exceptional young people,"" Sandusky said in a statement at the time, released by the university. ""The opportunity to impact the lives of the many student-athletes who've come through the program has been one of the great rewards for me. Penn State football is special because of the sense of family established by those associated with the program today and those players, coaches and staff who've been part of it over the years. ""Retiring as an active coach will permit me to devote more time to The Second Mile. As the organization has grown, the demands for my hands-on involvement have increased dramatically. The staff has done a marvelous job of building the organization, which now touches more than 150,000 children annually through eight different programs. I'm anxious to devote my full-time energies to expanding the reach and influence of The Second Mile in a day and age when more and more kids seem to be at risk. "" ""I always felt that Jerry had two loves: One was obviously his ability, his wanting to help younger people in The Second Mile and being a head coach,"" Paterno said in a 2008 news conference. ""He could have been a head coach a couple places, but he really he backed away because they were going to ask him to give up some things in The Second Mile."" In his book, Sandusky writes of his ""unusual life."" ""My time on this earth has always been unique,"" he writes.

"(CNN) -- Tax day may be over, but many Americans are still suffering from tax hangovers. If it's any consolation, here's our country's best-kept fiscal secret: According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, Americans in 2012 enjoyed the lowest tax burdens as a share of our national economy of any developed country in the world. How can it be that we feel so much tax pain, but compared to other developed countries our tax burdens are so low? There are three reasons. The first is the corrosive effect of ""tax expenditures"": government spending programs baked into the tax code, and therefore visible only as reduced tax collections. These hidden spending programs range from subsidies for home ownership to government investments in alternative energy development, and touch virtually every corner of our economy and private consumption decisions. Tax expenditures distort our official data by reducing government tax revenues in the official scorekeeping, rather than being recorded in a manner consistent with their substance, as additional tax collections offset by government spending programs. The United States actually spends roughly as much through tax expenditures as it collects in nominal personal income tax revenues. Our official personal income tax collections are in the range of $1.2 trillion/year, but our tax rate structure operates as if we collected more than $2 trillion in income tax, and then ran additional government spending programs that cost more than $1 trillion/year. Tax expenditures raise your effective tax burden if you are not the beneficiary of any of this hidden government largesse, and reduce your tax burden if you are on the receiving end. Imagine that there are 10 of us in a little country, and we each pay $100 in tax. The government has $1,000 to spend, and you and I each feel $100 of tax pain. Now the government decides to give me a tax credit of $100, so net I have no out of pocket tax bill. But the government also decides to keep things revenue neutral, and so raises taxes on the remaining nine of you to $111.11, which raises $999.99 (forgive the rounding error) for the government to spend. When you now look at total ""tax revenues,"" the government is the same size in the second case as in the first. But you are now paying $111.11 in tax, and therefore feel $11.11 more in tax pain. Those who are net losers (you and the other eight remaining taxpayers, in this example) actually are right to swear that your tax bills seem larger, even if total government collections remain unchanged. Our country stands out from its peers as a tax expenditure junkie. Our addiction means that official data understate the size of government, and citizens do not have a clear picture of what spending programs we actually are financing. In turn, the design of many tax expenditures could not possibly pass Congress if presented as explicit spending legislation. Who, for example, would vote for a home ownership cash subsidy program that subsidizes affluent Americans at a more generous level than it does the middle class? Yet that is the effect of the home mortgage interest deduction, because the same tax deduction is more valuable the higher your tax bracket is. So to this extent, our tax pain is real, and it is some of the invisible spending programs we fund in this manner that need re-examination. The second reason for our low threshold of tax pain lies deeper: We have allowed our fiscal debates to be framed in a way that highlights only the pain of opening our wallets. We can see this backward framing of the issues, for example, in the debate over sequestration, where it is claimed that because taxes cannot rise further, spending must be cut -- without any examination of what purpose that government spending serves. By ignoring the uses to which tax revenues are put, these debates implicitly deprecate the very purpose of government. When you set out to buy a house, you think carefully about how big a house you can afford, but in the end you are not poorer for the money you spent, because you acquired something useful, namely, a new home. Why then in fiscal debates do we look only at the cost of government, and not at the collective goods or services we thereby acquire? Unsurprisingly, once we phrase tax policy as a collective exercise in fiscal masochism, our threshold for tax pain turns out to be very low. The third reason for our low tolerance for tax pain is that the federal government in particular collects its showpiece tax -- the personal income tax -- in the most painful way possible, by asking each of us to assess the tax against ourselves. For most Americans, that means starting from a blank form and a shoebox full of miscellaneous pieces of financial data. Self-assessment is probably unavoidable, but the pain can be mitigated if the IRS were to send taxpayers a ""prepopulated"" tax return that reflects the data already furnished to the IRS. (Imagine, for example, receiving a partially filled-out tax Form 1040 in which all the information concerning your investment income contained in the 1099's thrown into your shoebox had already been entered for you on the appropriate lines.) Programs like this are feasible (and even exist in California and other countries), but have been blocked in the United States in part through the vigorous lobbying of tax preparation companies anxious to protect their franchises. Here, the tax pain is the result of legislative sausage making at its most venal. Tax time will never be pleasant, but making form preparation easier, understanding better how government spending buys useful goods and services, and re-examining the tax expenditures in our tax code at least can mitigate our tax pain. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edward D. Kleinbard.","Edward Kleinbard: Tax day is over, but many Americans are still suffering from tax hangovers .

"(CNN) -- Known by many as Africa's ""father of technology,"" software pioneer Herman Chinery-Hesse has been spawning innovations for two decades, helping to break down tech barriers between the continent and the rest of the world. The Ghanaian innovator and visionary founded SOFTtribe in 1991, one of the largest and most successful software companies in West Africa that has been creating computer solutions for businesses in the continent. More recently, Chinery-Hesse who is often described as '""Africa's Bill Gates,"" embarked on a mission to spark an entrepreneurial revolution in Africa by bringing e-commerce to the most remote corners of the continent. His latest creations range from virtual shopping malls and electronic ticketing to digital insurance and security. Here, CNN highlights some of the best innovations Chinery-Hesse and his teams have created over the years. Shop Africa 53: A subsidiary of Black Star Line, the company Chinery-Hesse create in 2007, Shop Africa 53 is a virtual shopping mall for African products and services that enables merchants to sell their goods on the internet and accept payments on a mobile phone. The website, which Chinery-Hesse describes as an African Amazon/PayPal type of service, allows shoppers anywhere in the world to look for African products and buy directly from local merchants -- from art, clothes and jewelry to food products, cookware and appliances. Read also: Web savvy Africans fuel growth in online shopping . Chinery-Hesse says enthusiastically that the marketplace can give poor African craftspeople access to global markets. ""What's going to happen next is that we're going to augment it with the fact of the poor people in the villages being able to do international trade,"" he says. ""Some of which might grow into multi-billion dollar companies and so on within the next 20 years -- watch this space, Africa is it!"" Keba-Ekong!: This re-usable plastic card, whose name translates to ""bring it again,"" is similar to the Oyster card, a form of electronic ticketing widely used in London, England for public transport. But more than just a travel card, Keba-Ekong! is an all-purpose, pay-as-you-go system that is also used for several other purchases, including concert and cinema tickets, inside and outside Ghana. ""If you're going to watch a concert today in Ghana you'll probably receive one of those cards as your ticket -- when you get to the gate there's a scanner, peep it goes, wait, checking, you can go in,"" says Chinery-Hesse. Read also: Tech whiz brings gift of computers to Ghana's children . ""We have orders for concerts outside Ghana and the same thing happens -- we just deliver the cards to them and on the day of the event we go onto our server and we setup the whole concert, number of seats ... and they can start selling tickets six months in advance and they make their money, their counting is transparent for everybody."" Quickie: For ""Quickie,"" Black Star Line collaborated with an insurance company to launch instant, on-demand cover through the use of scratch cards and mobile phone networks. Just like Keba-Ekong!, Quickie uses the potential of the cloud to offer smart solutions tailored for the Ghanaian market. The product is designed to accommodate the needs of those who are not keen to pay large sums for insurance once a year, says Chinery-Hesse. ""Quickie"" users can activate their cover by sending an SMS with the unique code that appears on the card that they've purchased from vendors of telecom products. ""You scratch the card, you look at your registration number, you stick it in to our server, you're insured and the rest is history,"" says Chinery-Hesse. Akatua: Akatua was one of the first software to be developed by SOFTTribe some two decades ago. Today, the cloud-based product, which has been taken on by many major companies operating in Ghana, claims to be the most efficient, payroll solution in the country. Find out more: Underwater cables bring faster internet to West Africa . It is designed to simplify a series of complex payroll issues such as staff salaries, and maintenance of taxes as well as managing deductions and back pay. Hei-Julor!!!: Chinery-Hesse's latest technological solution aims to use the potential of the cloud to offer what is claimed to be superior protection against armed robberies. Dubbed ""Hagelo,"" which translates to ""Hey, you thief"" the service incorporates scratch cards and crowd sourcing through an internet and mobile phone based application. A monthly $10 scratch card allows users to indicate to BSL's server that their house is under attack. Then, a protection system mechanism is deployed to make sure the thief is caught. ""Within 2 minutes the whole neighborhood will be awake, the police are on their way, a security company is on their way, the radio stations are announcing [this house is under attack],"" says Chinery-Hesse. ""The security people we're working with predict -- this big sign board that's in the starter pack says: 'This crib is protected by Hagelo alert systems, don't even bother, you will run like a wet rat' -- and they say that sign board will put the fear of God into most thieves.""

"New York (CNN) -- While Superstorm Sandy's punch has weakened, its wrath is still being felt. Walloped by severe storm damage and flooding, the New York City area's extensive transportation system is struggling to get back online, while some area airports are resuming service on Wednesday. Other Northeast and mid-Atlantic airport and ground transportation systems were gradually resuming operations. Here's what's happening in many of the affected areas: . Sandy's impact: State by state . Airline operations resuming . New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey would open Wednesday morning for limited service, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced Tuesday night. In preparation for JFK's opening, some airlines were to land aircraft at the airport late Tuesday night. New York City's LaGuardia International Airport is expected to remain closed through Wednesday because of significant damage. N.J. transit operations center underwater . The Port Authority strongly advised travelers to contact their airlines before heading to any of the airports, even if they are open. Delta Air Lines expects to resume limited domestic service to JFK International Wednesday afternoon. Some of the Northeast's other airports are coming back to life. The Boston and Philadelphia airports and the three airports serving the Washington/Baltimore area are open and operational with some airlines already resuming limited flight service. Southwest Airlines (including subsidiary AirTran Airways) is planning to resume normal operations by midday Wednesday across most of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, with the exception of the New York City area and Philadelphia airports, according to a statement. United previously announced that it hoped to resume service at the major Washington area airports and Cleveland on Tuesday evening, weather permitting. Most carriers will allow affected passengers to change their itineraries without penalty. You can check advisories from the major airlines -- American Airlines, Delta, United, US Airways, AirTran, JetBlue and Southwest -- on their websites. More than 19,500 flights have been canceled as a result of the storm, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.com. More than 7,000 Tuesday flights were canceled, FlightAware figures show. By 9 a.m. Wednesday, more than 2,800 Wednesday flights and more than 480 Thursday flights had been canceled. Public transportation upheaval . New York City's critical public transit network was still crippled Wednesday, although bus service was operating ""as close to a normal weekday schedule as possible,"" according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's website. The MTA's commuter railroad service remained suspended Wednesday. Seven subway tunnels under the East River flooded in the course of the storm, and two Long Island Rail Road tubes and two vehicular tunnels were inundated. One subway bridge, three subway yards and six bus facilities also were flooded, according to MTA's website. Six of MTA's seven bridges were open Wednesday, the exception being the Cross Bay Bridge. The MTA said it's too early to estimate how long it will take to restore systemwide service. In New Jersey, most NJ Transit services remained suspended Wednesday, with the exception of bus service in Camden County operating on a weekday schedule. Commuter bus and train service will be running Wednesday in Maryland, according to the Maryland Transit Administration. Some service in Philadelphia was restored Tuesday, and Southeastern Pennsylvania's regional rail commuter lines were scheduled to resume service Wednesday morning, according to a SEPTA statement. In Boston, most transit service resumed Tuesday, with some delays, according to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In Washington, bus and rail service was restored on modified schedules. Normal operations were expected to resume Wednesday. Amtrak will provide some modified service between Newark, New Jersey, and points south starting Wednesday. Trains between Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Philadelphia, and between Boston and Portland, Maine, will also run. However, trains directly to and from Penn Station in New York will be idle.

"Farnborough, England (CNN) -- As one of the world's leading aviation marketplaces, the Farnborough International Airshow is usually an opportunity for airline executives to reach for their checkbooks. This year some might also be reaching for the stars. You told us: Top 5 spots for plane geeks . For six days from July 9, the airshow, will transform a small town to the west of London into a major aviation hub, attracting 250,000 visitors with its unique mix of big business and aerial entertainment. With the UK and other major European markets wallowing in recession or serious debt problems, industry experts warn the show -- now in its 64th year -- could lack some of the sparkle of its predecessors. Billions of dollars are still expected to change hands as passenger jets, cargo planes, fighter jets and unmanned drones are snapped up. But with no traditional aviation launches or announcements scheduled, the main attraction will be a spacecraft. A version of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo -- a two-pilot, six-passenger craft capable of sub-orbital travel -- is scheduled to make its European debut at the show. Reports suggest Virgin boss Richard Branson will use the event to reveal design changes to the craft, which could be carrying its first passengers into orbit next year. So far 500 people -- including movie star Ashton Kutcher -- have signed up for a $200,000 flight. Where planes go to die . Branson may also announce that Virgin Galactic is reviving plans for a satellite-launching service, possibly spurred on by the commercial SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which successfully docked with the International Space Station earlier this year. With 1,400 aviation companies from 40 different countries attending the show, conventional air travel will remain the overall focus -- but don't expect too many surprises. See also: Infographic on the global state of aviation . ""This year won't be a show for aircraft debuts or actual hardware that we'll be seeing for the first time,"" Murdo Morrison, editor of Flight International magazine, told CNN. ""There's nothing there which will be new and terribly exciting. It will be more about the business."" And business is likely to be brisk. Major manufacturers can expect to take significant bookings for their newest aircraft. Airbus will be touting its A380 superjumbo while rival Boeing will be seeking orders for its giant 747-8 and its super-efficient 787 Dreamliner. In 2010, Farnborough witnessed sales of 157 Boeing and 133 Airbus aircraft. Among these was an $9.1 billion order from Dubai-based Emirates for 30 Boeing 777s. In total, orders worth $47 billion were placed. However, says Morrison, overall sales this year may suffer because of the squeeze that the economic downturn is putting on European civil and defense aviation budgets, which usually account for a major slice of the trade at Farnborough. These people really love to fly . This, he says, is doing little to help the airshow maintain its relevance at a time when the difficulties of holding a major aviation event near London are making it less viable. U.S. defense giant Northrup Grumman is among several big names missing from this year's show. ""Farnborough remains an important platform for the industry to meet, for the supply chain to get together and for the companies to meet their customers,"" he said. ""It's also still an important platform for companies to make media announcements. ""But on the negative side, its a big, costly show and some of the logistics are challenging, particularly for those people staying and traveling from London. ""It also struggles a little bit against some of the more niche competitors aimed at smaller parts of the industry. And it struggles because Europe is not a growth market -- the growth markets are Asia, South America, the Middle East and even Africa."" Where dead airplanes come back to life . In addition to a glimpse of the Virgin Galactic exhibition, those who do brave the traffic congestion and unpredictable British summer weather will also be rewarded with the noisy aerial displays that are a trademark of the Farnborough show. These will include an appearance by a Qatar-outfitted Boeing 787 Dreamliner -- the first time the much-delayed flagship has appeared in airline livery. Unconfirmed reports suggest the 787 may make a fly-past, ending Boeing's long absence from aerial display at Farnborough. Says Morrison, the displays at Farnborough (which opens up to the public for its final two days) often prove to be a distraction from the business side of the show, but they are also a key attraction. Among those wowing spectators with their aerial agility will be the Royal Air Force Red Arrows squadron, the Breitling Jet team, the Blades, RedHawks and Breitling Wingwalkers. ""It's really two shows. During the week it's a trade exhibition and at the weekend it is more about showing aviation to the public. This shows UK taxpayers what their money is being spent on and it engages young people in a possible aerospace career -- so there is a plus side,"" he added.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Now that we have Sonia Sotomayor, a Latina, on the Supreme Court, the esteemed body will soon find itself in the middle of a telenovela. The storyline involves the contentious issue of affirmative action, which is central to Fisher vs. University of Texas, a case that is scheduled to come before the court this fall. It will cast a spotlight on two of the court's justices: Sonia Sotomayor and Samuel Alito. Affirmative action seems to be intensely personal to both of them, though for very different reasons. First, let's take a minute to note just how similar Alito and Sotomayor are in terms of their background. Both are baby boomers, born just a few years apart. Alito is 61 years old and Sotomayor is 57. They grew up in neighboring states. Alito is from New Jersey and Sotomayor is from New York. Both came from ethnic, working-class families. Alito's parents were teachers, Sotomayor's father was a tool-and-die worker and her mother was a telephone operator. Finally, both went to Princeton University and Yale Law School, where both served as editors of the Yale Law Journal. Given all those similarities, what could these two Supreme Court justices possibly have to argue about? Affirmative action. That's what. Will the Supreme Court strike down affirmative action? Alito has highlighted in a 1985 job application for promotion to officials in the Justice Department of the Reagan administration that he belonged to a group called Concerned Alumni of Princeton. And what were the Princeton alumni so concerned about? Why, that there were supposedly too many women and minorities being admitted to the prestigious but predominantly white institution. Sotomayor has said that she is a ""product of affirmative action"" and the ""perfect affirmative action baby."" Although she graduated with honors from both Princeton and Yale Law School, she admitted that her test scores ""were not comparable"" to her classmates at both schools. Now imagine how these two justices will weigh in on the case of Fisher v. University of Texas. This is not the first time that the University of Texas at Austin has found itself in the eye of a storm because of its admissions policies. In the 1990s, Cheryl Hopwood successfully sued the law school at UT for its affirmative action program. In an attempt to preserve diversity gains, the Texas Legislature passed the ""10 percent rule,"" which required public universities in the state to admit students from the top 10 percent of the graduating class of every Texas high school. The idea was that ethnic diversity can be achieved without explicitly considering the race factor. But, in 2003, after the Supreme Court gave public colleges and universities the green light to take race into account as a factor in admissions, the University of Texas revised its policies accordingly to admit students who didn't make it into the top 10 percent. This is the policy now being challenged. Abigail Fisher and Rachel Michalewicz, two white students who didn't get into the University of Texas as undergraduates in 2008, claim that it was their race that kept them out, since minority students who they considered less qualified were admitted. Were there no other white students admitted to the University of Texas that year? We can assume there were, and so the idea that it was the plaintiffs' race that kept them out is questionable. Even so, commentators who follow the Supreme Court closely are predicting that the case will deliver a death blow to affirmative action for public colleges and universities. There are at least five justices who will probably oppose racial preferences, including Alito. Meanwhile, the dissenters are likely to include Sotomayor. Don't be surprised if her dissent in this case will contain a tone that is unmistakably personal. Maybe Sotomayor will reflect on Thurgood Marshall's dissent in the landmark 1978 Supreme Court case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which also involved a challenge to race-based admissions. In that case, a majority of the justices agreed that Allan Bakke, a 32-year-old white male, should have been admitted to the University of California Davis Medical School. Bakke had been denied admission, he claimed, because of a special program that set aside for African-Americans 16 of the 100 seats in the entering class. Marshall -- who was the only African-American justice on the Court and probably the only one who ever experienced racial discrimination firsthand -- did not agree that Bakke should have been admitted, and he wrote a powerful dissent that none of his white colleagues could have written. It is at moments like this -- when more women and minorities are in places of power and influence -- that we see the payoff of affirmative action and other efforts to expand educational and professional opportunities for all Americans. We're all human. We view controversial issues with our heart, as much as with our head. We see them through a lens shaped by personal experiences. As a Mexican-American graduate of an Ivy League university, here is what my lens tells me. Part of what Alito and the other Princeton alumni were really concerned about was that -- if something wasn't done to keep women and minorities out of prestigious colleges and universities -- one day, white males may have to deal with them as equals. Watch how Sotomayor handles this case about affirmative action, and you'll see: That day is here. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","The Supreme Court will hear arguments for Fisher vs. University of Texas .

"(CNN) -- A Turkish passenger jet crashed as it tried to land at Amsterdam's main airport Wednesday, killing at least nine people and injuring more than 55, Dutch airport authorities have said. Rescuers attend the fuselage of the Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800 following Wednesday's crash. The Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800, which had 127 passengers and seven crew members according to the airline, broke into three pieces on impact in a field near Schiphol Airport. The injured included both crew and passengers, said acting mayor of Haarlemmermeer municipality Michel Bezuijen. The flight data and voice recorders have been recovered, he said, but investigators still need to determine what, if anything, the pilots said in the moments before the crash. A news photographer at the scene said she saw an unknown number of bodies lying under a white blanket, Maaike Voersma, a journalist with Dutch newspaper De Pers, told CNN. A passenger on the plane who spoke to Turkish network DHA said he saw injured people trapped and squeezed between the seats when he walked off the plane. iReport: Send your videos, stories . Flight 1951, which originated from Istanbul, Turkey, was trying to land at Schiphol when it went down at about 10:40 a.m. local time (4:40 a.m. ET), Dutch airport officials said. At least three crew were among the dead. ""There are still three crew members in the cabin,"" said Bob Steensma of the Dutch Justice Department. ""I'm sorry to say they are dead. We leave them there because we have to investigate the cockpit before we take the cockpit apart."" All the passengers, however, had been removed from the plane as of about 5 p.m., officials said. Roads around the crash site had been blocked to traffic. Six people were critically injured, Ineke Van Der Zande of Amsterdam Emergency Services told reporters at a briefing. Twenty-five passengers were severely injured, she said, and 24 others were lightly injured. The conditions of the other 31 people were not immediately known, she said. Some 60 ambulances transported 84 people to 11 hospitals throughout the region, she said. Witnesses said they saw the nose of the plane pitch up suddenly before the crash, according to RTL journalist Greg Crouch. The plane was broken in three pieces. One tear was in front of the wing, splitting the ""Turkish"" logo in two, and a larger tear was farther back along the fuselage.  See where the plane crashed Â» . Most of the injured were seated toward the back of the plane, which sustained the most damage, a passenger on the plane told Turkish station NTV. Many of the passengers simply walked off the plane through the cracks in the fuselage, witnesses told NTV. Medics treated passengers on the ground next to the buckled hulk of the plane, while firefighters and police examined the aircraft.  See rescuers attend the crash scene Â» . Emergency exits were wide open and there was no signs of fire damage to the fuselage. Also visible was one of the aircraft's engines, apparently separated from the shattered remains of one of the wings.

Watch iReport on crash wreckage Â» . Witnesses said they saw the nose of the plane pitch up suddenly before the crash, Crouch said. A bank manager who was a passenger on the plane told NTV that there were no emergency announcements. The crew's last word to the cabin was an announcement to fasten seatbelts and prepare for landing, the bank manager said. He said he felt the pilot giving more power to the engines before feeling ""turbulence,"" then a sudden drop. He described the crash as similar to a sudden impact that was over in a matter of seconds.  Watch report on survivors describing ""turbulence"" Â» . The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it is sending a team of investigators to Amsterdam to assist in the crash investigation. Kieran Daly, of Air Transport Intelligence said the impact had been severe but it could have been survivable because of the lack of fire. He added that there had been vast improvements in the materials used to build airplanes, meaning they did not burn as easily.  Watch aviation expert comment on Amsterdam crash Â» . Daly also said that the Boeing 737-800 is a reliable aircraft that has been successful and safe in service. ""They really are pretty much state-of-the-art airliners with every imaginable technical benefit the industry has come up with over the years,"" Daly told CNN. ""You would be optimistic that they would be quite survivable in an accident."" Daly said the Turkish aviation industry has a ""pretty good record"" of safety, and that Turkish Airlines, the national carrier, has a ""very good record."" Turkish Airlines said it has 52 Boeing 737-800s in its fleet. They can carry up to 165 passengers each, the airline said. The airline's last accident was of a small commuter jet in 2003, he said. It was a fatal crash that happened at a remote airfield in eastern Turkey, he said. ""Their mainline operation is safe,"" Daly said. ""Their pilots are well thought of."" The last accident at Schiphol Airport happened in December 2003 when an EasyJet flight carrying 103 passengers to London collided while with a lamppost while taxiing during icy conditions, according to Aviation Safety Network's Web site. The crash caused significant damage to the aircraft, but no one was killed. The last fatal incident at the Amsterdam airport happened in April 1994 when a KLM aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff as it tried to return to Schiphol.

"Editor's note: Gloria Borger is a senior political analyst for CNN, appearing regularly on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" ""Campbell Brown,"" ""AC360Â°"" and ""State of the Union With John King,"" as well as special event coverage. Gloria Borger says Democrats seem to be aiding the GOP in its attempt to defeat President Obama on health care. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It's always hard to be optimistic about the passage of any kind of health care reform. After all, history shows that for much of the past century, most attempts to reform the system have failed. There have been some exceptions -- such as Medicare in 1965. But, for the most part, the political will has been insufficient to move anything. Just ask Hillary Clinton. Here's where you have to give President Obama credit: He promised health care reform during the campaign, and he's trying to do what he said he would do. (He's also trying to do almost everything else he promised in the campaign at the same time, but that's another story.) He has held health care symposiums and town halls, met with recalcitrant conservatives and moderates, and kept tabs with congressional leaders on their progress. And Wednesday night, he'll take the issue to the country in a prime-time press conference. The strategy was forthright: Since the country has debated this issue for decades, there's no need to redo it all. And don't write a bill like Clinton did so Congress can spend its time picking it apart. Rather, let the committees (five in all) move their bills and reconcile them until the House and Senate each has a product. The president weighs in when the two chambers try to reach agreement on a final bill. Presto, health care reform. Ah, but this is Congress we're talking about. Should it be any surprise that some congressional Democrats -- having suffered in the minority under a Republican president -- have decided to unleash their inner liberal? No matter how badly the GOP opposition behaves -- and no matter how bereft it is of ideas of its own -- the Democrats seem happy to aid Republicans in their one clear goal for Obama: defeat. The president has called for cost controls above all else in health care reform. He even wants to take Medicare spending decisions out of the political arena and put them in the hands of the docs and technical nerds, who actually understand where real cost savings can be found. But that would require Congress to relinquish some power, so it hasn't happened. Instead, Obama's Democrats have so far given him higher costs (according to the Congressional Budget Office) and higher taxes. Or, in technical parlance, the same-old, same-old. One House version of health reform passed last week proposed a surtax on households with adjusted gross incomes of more than $350,000. It was enough to prompt an intervention by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who changed it to $1 million for joint filers -- so it could be called a millionaire's tax. Have they asked Obama -- the change agent -- whether he really wants Democrats to get back into that old class warfare argument? The trouble for Obama is that he's getting tethered to some of the bad ideas the Democrats propose because he hasn't denounced them. We know that he's cool and patient, but maybe his drooping recent poll numbers will cause him to start drawing some lines in the sand. Americans still like their new president, but they're clearly wondering why he has let congressional Democrats inhabit his body. In a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, for instance, approval of his handling of health care has slid from 57 percent to 49 percent since April. And the Democrats' foray into taxing the rich hasn't done Obama any favors, either: Just one month ago, voters earning more than $50,000 liked Obama more than the GOP on health care by a 2-1 margin. Today, those voters are evenly split. And independent voters -- the key to Obama's electoral success -- are leaving the flock. In April, 57 percent of independents approved his handling of health care; that has now dipped to 44 percent, and 49 percent disapprove. All of which is not catastrophic, but it is a problem. And it's not a problem the Republicans have created for Obama, although they will no doubt try and take credit. In truth, it's something the Democrats have done all by themselves. No Republicans needed. During the campaign, candidate Obama waxed eloquent on the importance of bipartisanship, of turning the page on the politics of the past. ""We need to stop the partisan point scoring and the petty bickering that serves the needs of politicians but not the needs of the American people,"" he said in September in Pueblo, Colorado. ""... I'm running for president because that's the kind of leadership we need right now."" Yes it is. And how about telling that to the Democrats?

"(CNN) -- The Boston Marathon bombings shook the nation. With one suspect killed and the other captured Friday night, there are far more questions than answers at this point. While authorities unravel details in the coming days and weeks, many people are curious about Chechnya and its history, hoping to better understand the background of the two suspected bombers. The important thing to keep in mind right now is that 26-year-old Tamarlan Tsarnaev had a green card, and 19-year-old Dzhokar Tsarnaev became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 2012. Assuming that their motives are related to their Chechen origins would be like assuming that Timothy McVeigh's motives were related to his Scottish/Irish origins. Although the Tsarnaev brothers are of Chechen ethnic background, they are from the neighboring republic of Dagestan -- a tremendously diverse region that differs from Chechnya in many ways. According to press reports, they fled Dagestan for distant Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia sometime before or during the second Chechen war with Russia, which started in 1999 and spilled over into Dagestan. It is likely that they found many Chechen contacts in these new homes, which still have a Chechen diaspora remaining from Joseph Stalin's forced deportation of the Chechen people to those republics in 1944. From Kyrgyzstan, they emigrated to the United States in 2002. Chechnya is a small republic within the Russian Federation of about a million people located in the Caucasus between the Black and Caspian seas. The Chechens have a long history of intense conflict with Russia. In fact, even after encircling the region through the conquest of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan to the south in 1801, it still took the mighty Russian army 60 more years to conquer the region. In 1944, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin accused the Chechens of treason and deported every man, woman and child to locations scattered through Soviet Central Asia in a brutal action with high death rates. The deported Chechen people were only allowed to return in 1957, four years after Stalin's death. It is quite likely that the grandparents or great-grandparents of the Tsarnaevs suffered through these horrible actions. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, 15 constituent republics became independent countries, but Chechnya was just an autonomous region within the Russian Federation, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin refused to allow Chechnya to break free and form an independent state. In 1994, he ordered the invasion of Chechnya to reverse its declaration of independence and to force the region back under Moscow's control. The two-year war and the years that followed were filled with violence, chaos and lawlessness. Estimates of Chechens killed in the 1990s run as high as 100,000. Dagestan was for the most part able to avoid the violence of the 1990s and stayed relatively quiet. Both Tsarnaev brothers most likely heard a lot about the second war between Russia and Chechnya that started in 1999, a war that this time involved parts of Dagestan as well. This time, a radical Chechen warlord named Shamil Basaev tried to spread anti-Russian unrest to the much larger neighboring region of Dagestan. With a small army, he took several towns in Dagestan and a month later four residential apartments were blown up in Moscow and two other Russian cities, killing and injuring hundreds. He found little support from the peoples of Dagestan and instead spurred newly appointed Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to launch a new war against Chechnya. This round of fighting was even more brutal than the first war. Extreme Chechen groups turned to guerrilla warfare in the mountains, and horrific acts of terror in Russia, including the Beslan elementary school siege that ended with 334 people dead, including 186 children. Other acts included setting off bombs in the Moscow subway system and taking an entire Moscow theater hostage. Both the pro-Russian Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and his various Chechen underground jihadist and nationalist opponents have denied any connection to the Tsarnaevs. The question of their links to any groups will be one of the most important questions for the investigation to come. In the past few years, both the Tsarnaevs excelled in sports and academics, and seem to have lived apparently normal lives. It remains to be seen whether their life experiences, nationalist or religious ideas led them to the Boston Marathon bombings -- or if their motives were more akin to the domestic mass killers we have seen far too often in places like Aurora, Newtown, Tucson, Columbine, and elsewhere. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Lohr.","The two suspected bombers of the Boston Marathon are of Chechen ethnic background .
