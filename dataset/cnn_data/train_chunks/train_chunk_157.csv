"(CNN) -- Police in Poland have arrested two men in connection with explosions at Ikea stores in several European countries, they said Saturday. The two men, both age 39, are accused of trying to force Ikea to pay a ransom of 6 million euros (U.S. $8 million). They were arrested after a joint operation involving several hundred officers from Poland's Central Investigation Bureau and investigators from other countries, police said in a statement. There were eight explosions of increasing strength between May and early September, at large stores in France, Belgium, Holland, Germany and the Czech Republic, police said. Initially the explosions were treated as individual cases in the countries where they occurred, but police now believe the plot was orchestrated from Poland, the statement said. The suspects made use of technology and traveled large distances to try to avoid detection in Poland, it added. The men have been accused of racketeering and extortion offenses, as well as endangering people's lives. One of the suspects, identified as Adam K., has no previous criminal record, is fluent in four languages and previously worked as a manager at several large corporations, giving him technical expertise, police said. The second suspect, identified as Nicholas G., has a record of past drug offenses, police said. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Polish police say the men were trying to extort 6 million euros from Ikea .

"(CNN) -- ""In my old school, they used to beat people. Like you have to bring firewood in school, carry the water and you have to carry all of that and you have to be there early in the morning. If you're late, you'll be given a punishment, you'll be caned or sent home for a week."" The memories of 13-year-old Rebecca Ikiru are crystal clear as she considers what her life was like before meeting Lee and Carole Johnson. Five years ago, she was living in an orphanage in Lodwar, the largest city in northern Kenya, and she wanted a better education than her circumstances provided. ""I told them maybe if you take me to another school, maybe I can do better,"" Ikiru recalls. It was her request for a better school that sparked a direct change in the lives of the Johnsons, who are Georgia natives. It all began with Lee Johnson's first trip to Kenya as a volunteer. Eventually Carole joined him, and the pair spent time volunteering for the same orphanage where Ikiru lived. As their relationship with the children in Lodwar grew, so did their personal desire to help . ""My husband and I both grew up in Georgia. My husband is from rural south Georgia, and I was from rural north Georgia, a very segregated society. We grew up during the Martin Luther King era, which changed our world. I never thought when I was a child growing up that I would ever be in, ever visit Africa much less come here as often as we do,"" Carole Johnson says. The Johnsons came to love each one of the six children who later came into their guardianship and a part of Kenya Education for Youth. ""We were very concerned that as the children aged out of the orphanage that they would return to the same poverty that they came from, and along about this time, one of the older girls that we had a very close relationship with told us she wanted to go to a better school. So we looked at the public school that she went to and there were over 100 children in a classroom,"" Carole Johnson says. ""We started looking into the schools for the children in Lodwar (Rebecca Ikiru, Monty Esibitar and Gershom Eurpe) that we thought would be good candidates, and about that time we met two other children (Ann Njoki and Cyrus Kirwa) who were extremely gifted. We just overnight had five children enrolled in Greensteads International School, which is in Nakuru. That was two years ago, and all five of the children are either competing (with) or exceeding the children of privilege who have been in this school for their entire education."" A sixth child, 10-year-old Beryl Mudeshi, was recently added and attends Mt. Kenya Academy, which is a day school in the same town. In the past year, she has blossomed academically and loves karate. ""I prayed to God that he might help me find a new school, a better one so that when I grow up, I can be a missionary and help the other children. I want to be a missionary because I just wanted to help the other kids how I was helped,"" Beryl says. Beryl lived in rural Lodwar before meeting the Johnsons and now says her prayers were answered. ""The new school is good, it's better, it's awesome."" Carole Johnson feels that the personal attention each child receives from their K.E.Y. sponsor is the literal key to each child's success. ""What we think really makes a difference is not just putting these children in a private school and seeing them and looking at test grades, but we feel it's extremely important to provide mentors, people in the United States who care for these kids, who are willing to contact them either through e-mail, Facebook, other social media, visit, phone calls. We think that's what sets this program apart."" Each of the K.E.Y. kids has a passion for learning. Beryl wants to become a missionary and help children like herself. Ann wants to be a forensic psychologist to better understand why people commit crimes. Gershom wants to make Kenya beautiful by becoming a civil engineer. Monty is passionate about aviation and wants to become a pilot. Rebecca would like to become a doctor. And Cyrus is planning to become a neurosurgeon. Carole Johnson says Kenya Education for Youth is committed to providing an education to each one, all the way through college graduation. High school seniors Ann and Cyrus are anxiously preparing for as their school year comes to an end. ""We're testing some uncharted waters with the two older ones. We have schools in the U.S. that are interested in them, so at this point, we are perusing student visas, and they'll be taking the SAT in January just to see where they can go. That doesn't mean we would not consider university in Kenya, it just so happens that for both of them the education that they would need to pursue the vocation they want, they would have to go outside Kenya either to the UK or to the U.S. ""And these children, the two older ones in particular, have never had the benefit of a family, and we would very selfishly like to have them in Georgia schools so they could spend their breaks with us and be part of a family because that's, I think in the end, what matters is to have the love."" ""We are a family. That is, yeah we come from far, we may be different biologically; but living together we embrace each other,"" Cyrus says with a smile. It's a sentiment echoed by each child, including 15-year-old Monty. ""They're like my brothers and sisters, like a family."" And 13-year-old Rebecca says, ""I feel like they are my mommy and my daddy. The way they take care of me [is] like I'm their real daughter, and I'm so happy for that."" It's a love that crosses two continents, an ocean and cultural barriers with an aim to impact the world one child at a time.","Growing up, Georgia natives Lee and Carole Johnson never imagined they would visit Africa .

"(CNN) -- Africa has always been a continent of contrasts. And the latest findings from an amazing team of international researchers show that when it comes to providing our children with the best chances in life, Africa once more presents a very mixed picture. In a new report, never-before-available comparative data on laws and public policies in 191 countries, covering poverty, discrimination, education, health, child labor, child marriage and parental care, reveals how millions of children across the world face conditions that limit their opportunities to thrive and reach their full potential because of governments failure to act. This new research aims to broaden global attention from solely survival to children's full and healthy development. It comes at a critical time as the global community is looking to set new goals and agree on what all the world's nations will strive for in the so-called ""post-2015"" agenda following more than a decade of efforts focused around the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Children's opportunities are not just shaped by parents and families, but also by national action in the form of laws and public policies. This may involve removing tuition fees, ensuring inclusive education for children with disabilities, enforcing minimum age requirements for labor, age restrictions for marriage so girls might have a better chance to stay in education, or assisting parents to be able to earn enough to support their children and have the time off from work they need to care for their children's health and education. Read more: Africa grows, but youth get left behind . And as the new analysis confirms, marked strides have been made across sub-Saharan Africa in areas central to our children's healthy development. Primary education is tuition free across the majority of the region (in 36 of the 41 countries with available figures) and 13 countries have removed charges for secondary education. In addition, virtually all sub-Saharan African countries (45 of the 46 countries with data) guarantee paid maternity leave (although of these 23 provide less than the 14-week minimum established by the ILO), and 41 of 45 countries have recognized the need to provide income support during periods of unemployment (although this largely does not cover the informal economy). And progress in improving children's chances does not necessarily rely on the ability to open large purses. Some low and middle-income countries have made impressive advances for children. Kenya, for example, makes education compulsory for 12 years, longer than all other countries in the region, including those with a higher GDP, and it has a higher minimum age for full-time work than its neighbors. Elimination of schools fees in Malawi in the 1990s has led to a jump in primary school enrollment from under 50% in 1991 to 99% in 1999. Read more: Elite boarding school aims to create Africa's future leaders . Madagascar provides not only paid maternal leave, but also paid leave for children's health and family needs. Progress is clearly possible when there is political will. But there remains substantial room for policy advances to transform the lives of older children, youth and the poorest. At secondary level, educational opportunities in much of the region are deeply limited -- and limiting. A greater proportion of countries in sub-Saharan Africa than in other regions -- some 61% -- begin charging tuition fees before the end of secondary school. When we look beyond the issue of accessibility to the quality of education our children receive -- after all it should be fit for purpose -- the region has among the lowest education requirements for teachers, with 50% of countries requiring lower secondary school teachers to have completed no higher than a secondary education (so teachers have barely more education that their students). Plus, while policies in the formal economy are relatively strong in terms of supporting families, those in the informal economy remain unprotected. Despite the fact that many countries have set a minimum wage, in 6 countries this wage is just $2 per day or less -- and in 20 others is between $2 an $4, leaving even a family of one adult and one dependent under the $2 poverty line. How can we expect children to thrive given this reality? What this kind of comparative data and analysis allows us to do is see more clearly where progress is and isn't occurring. It is only when we begin to call out country's names -- the leaders and the laggards -- that we'll see all children count on having a childhood where they can go to school and not labor full-time, a childhood free of marriages that require them to parent before they have grown up themselves, getting the education they need to find work that will lift them out of poverty, and not facing discrimination based on their gender or ethnicity. Africa should be a region that has high ambitions for its children and demand that the post-2015 development agenda is one that thinks big for our children and their chances.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The screech of clear, heavy-duty duct tape scratches on the ear even before the mass of mainland Chinese visitors comes into view. This is the daily soundtrack from thousands of people packing up brown cardboard boxes outside Sheung Shui train station, the last rail stop in Hong Kong before mainland China. Every day these mainlanders make a Hong Kong entrance, picking up goods on behalf of China-based agents. Every evening, they make an exodus back across the border, taking with them sundry items that include Hong Kong-made baby formula and Huggies diapers to beauty masks and bottled Starbucks frappucinos. Some call these people ""grey traders."" Others call them ""mainland mules."" Local residents call them a nuisance. Steven So, chairman of Hong Kong's North District Council for the past five years, says the daily horde makes his constituents angry. ""They're mad because these visitors make a big mess. They litter. They throw their used lunchboxes everywhere. They spit. They block the walkways. They even injure people when they bump into them with their trolleys,"" he says. So says it has as much to do with trust as it does with tariffs over the past few years. Food scandals in mainland China, including the 2008 tainted baby formula scare in which more than 53,000 infants were reported ill, have pushed many consumers to buy products made elsewhere. Hong Kong goods are considered to adhere to stricter quality guidelines. Many products in Hong Kong have also become cheaper than the same ones found in mainland China. Since 2005, China's currency, the yuan, has strengthened 25% against the U.S. dollar, to which the Hong Kong dollar is pegged. And if goods are ferried over in a piecemeal fashion by mainland day traders -- box-by-box versus traditional cargo containers -- importers can avoid commercial tariffs that average 50%. Taxes on electronic goods can reach as high as 70%, adds So. That kind of savings keeps the cross-border grey trade very much alive. ""These mainland Chinese visitors buy anything and everything -- as long as it's not 'made in China,'"" says So. About a 20-minute walk from the train station, at a non-descript but well-known warehouse for this industry, hundreds of mainlanders swarm the building as they pick up their goods bound for China. Sweaty workers wheel out pallets of boxes that advertise instant noodles and diapers made in Japan. Grey traders -- men, women, young and old -- then put them on small handcarts and walk to the train station. While no one would give their full name, one worker revealed he earns HK$100, or about U.S. $12, per round trip. He admitted it is not much money but it is enough to take care of his family. His wife, a Hong Kong citizen, just gave birth to their first baby. One lady who only identified herself by her surname of Lau said that they all face pressure at customs as well. ""If our goods get turned away at the mainland border, we just have to dump them. So there's risk in this business,"" she says. There is also risk -- and reward -- for regular border area businesses. Pharmacies, convenience stores and jewelry shops have welcomed the rise in demand. Shop worker salaries have doubled in the past two years to cater to the surge of shoppers. But rents for retail space have tripled in the past three years and inflation is a chronic concern, according to various neighborhood shop owners. Aside from the economic woes, residents cite other issues that include hygiene, environmental and crowd complaints. In recognition of rising anti-China animosity from Hong Kong, Beijing shelved a controversial plan earlier this month that would have opened the door to millions more mainland visitors to the city. Four million people from Shenzhen alone - right across the border - would have been eligible under the proposed program. Many Hong Kong citizens are upfront with their emotions about their mainland cousins. ""Angry. Annoyed,"" said local resident Gabi Liu. ""(There are) too many people around us disturbing our country. Most of them are being bad-mannered."" Steven So, the district chairman, is more nuanced. Hong Kong is an ""open"" city that does welcome conventional tourists who stay at hotels, eat at restaurants and visit the city's theme parks like Disneyland, he says. But he also holds a caveat for non-conventional tourists -- those grey traders who hold multi-entry visa holders that crisscross the border each day. ""We need to weigh the pros and cons. To us in this district, the cons outweigh the pros. We don't have room for more people."" Still, he may be talking against a tide that cannot be turned. In 2011, Hong Kong, a city of 7 million people, saw 28 million mainland visitors -- two thirds of the city's total visitors, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. That is expected to grow even more, further reinforcing the reality that Hong Kong's economy is wedded more to mainland China as the years pass for this former British colony. Vivian Kam contributed to this report.","Every day thousands of mainland Chinese go to Hong Kong to buy goods .
They're paid by agents to meet demand for non-Chinese, cheaper products .

"(CNN) -- While much of the talk has been about Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray ahead of this week's Australian Open, Roger Federer has been happy to slide under the radar. World No. 1 Djokovic won an exhibition in Abu Dhabi and reached the final of the Hopman Cup teams event in Perth despite a surprise defeat to young Australian Bernard Tomic, while third-ranked Murray impressively retained his Brisbane title. By contrast, Federer, the most successful male player in tennis history, has been largely inactive. His last serious on-court action was an exhibition tour of South America in December. ""It's been very relaxing, the last one and a half months,"" the 17-time grand slam champion told reporters ahead of his bid for a fifth Melbourne crown. ""I arrived really early -- two, three days earlier than in the past -- which has been quite nice. ""I purposely didn't play a lead-up tournament so that I'd be fresh for the beginning, hopefully going deep into the tournament. That's the goal, obviously."" The 31-year-old last won the season's opening grand slam in 2010, and was beaten in the quarterfinals 12 months ago before going on to win Wimbledon for a record-equaling seventh time and surpassing Pete Sampras' milestone of total weeks at the top of the rankings. ""I'm ready to go and eager. That, to me, right now dominates,"" the Swiss star said. ""I think as long as that's the case, that means I love it very much. ""Today I take much more pleasure out of doing the gym work than I ever have. Today things for me make sense. I know why I'm doing them. I know they're necessary."" Having surrendered the No. 1 ranking to Djokovic at the end of last season, Federer was revived by his trip to Brazil, Argentina and Colombia -- largely untapped markets for tennis. ""It was one of the most fascinating trips of my life,"" Federer said. ""I was deeply impressed by the atmosphere, by the love for the game, for the appreciation they showed for me showing up."" He will start his 53rd grand slam tournament against 46th-ranked Frenchman Benoit Paire, and as second seed he cannot meet two-time defending champion Djokovic until the final. ""I know I won't win all the tournaments I enter,"" Federer said. ""But it's important that I enjoy it and I try as hard as I can and put myself deep in the tournaments like I did last year. I play to win every match right now."" Djokovic is one of nine players who have won successive Australian Open titles, and the Serbian is seeking to be the first to make it three in a row. ""I like playing here because it's after probably five, six, seven weeks of break with no official tournament,"" he said at his pre-tournament conference. ""So you get time to recover, regroup, recharge your batteries mentally, physically, try to get ready for the new season with four, five weeks of good practice. You come here fresh. You're motivated and inspired to play some good tennis."" The 25-year-old will also start against a Frenchman, playing Paul-Henri Mathieu on Monday, and his run to the final could see him face Federer's 15th-seeded compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka in round four, then Czech No. 5 Tomas Berdych and Spanish No. 4 David Ferrer. Two-time finalist Murray, who beat Djokovic in the U.S. Open final to win his first grand slam, is in Federer's half of the draw while 2012 Melbourne runner-up Rafael Nadal is not yet ready to make his comeback. ""It is definitely a loss for the tournament, for tennis, for sport in general not to have Rafa playing still on the court. It's been, what, seven months since he's played his last official match,"" Djokovic said. ""I'm sure if he felt he was ready enough to play this tournament, best-of-five in the Australian summer that can be brutal and difficult to play, then he would come. He probably felt he needs more time to recover. I wish him a speedy recovery.""","World No. 2 Roger Federer seeking his fifth Australian Open title in Melbourne .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Pentagon official said Tuesday that a former Navy SEAL who helped kill Osama bin Laden included classified material in his new book and did not follow protocol for pre-publication review. Also, on the same day the much-anticipated memoir hit book shelves, CNN obtained a copy of message written by the SEALs' commander to members of his unit. In it, Rear Adm. Sean Pybus, head of the Naval Special Warfare Command, said he was ""disappointed, embarrassed and concerned"" that troops are now openly speaking and writing about their secret work. ""We do NOT advertise the nature of our work, NOR do we seek recognition for our actions."" The emphasis is the admiral's. Pre-orders put ""No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden"" at No. 1 on Amazon's bestseller list for two weeks. But the Pentagon was not as as eager to see the release of the book. Pentagon press secretary George Little told reporters that officials believe the book contains sensitive and classified material. The Pentagon's determination, to a large extent, centers around several instances where author Matt Bissonnette, writing under the pen name ""Mark Owen,"" describes how SEAL units are organized, trained and operate, said a U.S. official, rather than solely on specifics of the bin Laden mission, which are largely known. Describing the instances in a very broad sense, the official said, ""does this compromise national security today, probably not, but do we talk about this stuff, no."" The official declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information. Opinion: Sense and nonsense about Obama and Osama . Last week, the Pentagon's general counsel threatened legal action against the man who wrote the revealing book. In a letter addressed to ""Mark Owen,"" General Counsel Jeh Charles Johnson alleged the writer violated secrecy agreements and broke federal law. ""In the judgment of the Department of Defense, you are in material breach and violation of the nondisclosure agreements you signed. Further public dissemination of your book will aggravate your breach and violation of your agreements,"" Johnson wrote. Bissonnette's lawyer responded in a letter last week saying the author ""sought legal advice about his responsibilities before agreeing to publish his book and scrupulously reviewed the work to ensure that it did not disclose any material that would breach his agreements or put his former comrades at risk."" Officials are concerned about protecting classified information, and not preventing the telling of a story, according to Little. The Defense Department is reviewing what options it may have, according to Little. ""When you have special operations units that perform these missions, there are tactics, techniques, and procedures, not to mention human life, that are in play,"" Little said. ""And it is the height of irresponsibility not to have this kind of material checked for the possible disclosure of classified information."" Pre-release of copies of the book and the Pentagon's lack of sufficient time to act made it impractical to ask the publisher to not release the book, Little said. The Pentagon has not banned copies of the book from military exchanges. Publisher Dutton had originally planned to release 300,000 copies, but after fevered hype, it increased the number to 575,000, according to Publisher's Weekly. Buzz ramps up over SEAL's bin Laden book . In the 336-page book, Bissonnette wrote about his concerns that bin Laden would put up a fight, after the SEALs' helicopter crashed near bin Laden's compound. ""Roughly 15 minutes had passed and bin Laden had plenty of time to strap on a suicide vest or simply get his gun,"" he says in the book. Bin Laden was not wearing a vest when he died. His two guns, according to Bissonnette, were on a shelf in his bedroom, apparently untouched. After the helicopter crash and a hard fight to get through the compound's defenses, Bissonnette and several other SEALS were near the top floor of the compound, where intelligence predicted bin Laden would be. ""We were less than five steps from getting to the top when I heard suppressed shots. BOP. BOP. ""The point man had seen a man peeking out of the door on the right side of the hallway about 10 feet in front of him. I couldn't tell from my position if the rounds hit the target or not. The man disappeared into the dark room."" The man who peeked out the door had been shot, but was still moving when the SEALs entered the room. Bissonnette described the end. ""In his death throes, he was still twitching and convulsing. Another assaulter and I trained our lasers on his chest and fired several rounds. The bullets tore into him, slamming his body into the floor until he was motionless."" Excerpts from SEAL's book about Osama bin Laden killing . But there was still the question of whom they had killed. One of Bissonnette's roles was photographing the body. ""It was strange to see such an infamous face up close. Lying in front of me was the reason we had been fighting for the last decade. It was surreal trying to clean blood off the most wanted man in the world so that I could shoot his photo. I had to focus on the mission, right now we needed some good quality photos."" Bissonnette said he had mixed feelings about President Barack Obama, who ordered the operation. ""None of us were huge fans of Obama. We respected him as the commander-in-chief of the military and for giving us the green light on the mission,"" wrote the former SEAL, who was a 36-year-old chief petty officer when he left the Navy as a highly decorated commando in April.

"(CNN) -- Immediately after my Christmas tree is decorated and the tree lights plugged in, I turn off all the other house lights and sit on the stairs, staring at my gleaming achievement. I could stare for days, hypnotized by the shiny allure of the decorations. The simple, white lights I prefer for the tree sit neatly among what has become an all-out, no-holds-barred glitter explosion. Of course, the glitter is not only on my tree. As many crafters and Christmas decor lovers will testify, if you handle glitter, it goes everywhere with you. After a day of decorating, flakes of glitter stick in my hair and on the tops of my cheekbones, so that I notice them glinting out of the corner of my eye for hours to come. Read more: Making unique holiday . I'm not the only glitter lover out there. We are legion and the holiday season our pinnacle. Glitter fads have come and gone, but what remains consistent is the power of the crafting supply to bring joy and wonder to any setting. What's more, it's gaining in popularity. ""Glitter has really exploded this year,"" said Jo Pearson of Michael's craft stores. Pearson is the manager of Where Creativity Happens for Michael's, was a judge on the television show ""Craft Wars"" and calls herself the ""glitter queen."" A resurgence in the popularity of the product makes her heart sing. It wasn't always this way. A decade ago, blown-glass and hand-painted ornaments ruled the retail shelves, said Pat Brill, a product manager for ornament maker Kurt Adler. But as the millennium dawned, glitter began to change, and a new breed of crafters got in touch with their inner magpie. This is not the stuff you used in grade school -- unsophisticated and stuck to construction paper with white glue. This is glitter that crafters seek out as they become more confident in their abilities. These days, everyone from creative kids to top designers uses glitter, Pearson said. It's on T-shirts and tote bags, in makeup and body lotion, and even in the form of interior paint. The applications are endless. Read more: Mistletoe 101 . Manufacturers offer a myriad of new glitter delivery methods as well as different sizes, colors and textures. The newest glitters, according to Brill, are made with lasers and have a more brilliant reflective quality than glitters of the past. Martha Stewart glitters, for example, now include neon colors. Pearson's favorite new product is called Glitter It Glue. This year her crafting team used it to transform the empty, plain-glass ornaments sold in Michael's stores into glittering globes. What's unique about this glue, Pearson said, is that it is the only one she's ever used that holds glitter to an object with a consistent thickness. None of the glitter shakes off, so there is substantially less errant glitter left behind. ""I think glitter has the innate ability to elevate ordinary things,"" said Marcie McGoldrick, editorial director of holiday and crafts at Martha Stewart Living. She calls it a ""crafter's magic wand."" ""In an economy like this, where people want things to feel special and fancy, but they don't necessarily have the resources they did in the past, or are just trying to be economical, it's such a great way to do that,"" she said. ""And to do it yourself."" A sense of invention and experimentation with glitter also thrives among the artists who design and create the ornaments at companies such as Kurt Adler. Read more: 5 real-life wonderlands . ""Glitter has become a science,"" Brill said. ""As a chef would use spices, artists use glitter, and they might mix different sizes in one product."" Ornament artists use glitter to create depth in the same way painters create perspective on canvas. Big chunky glitter gives off a different kind of light than finer glitter. Mica glitter, an age-old source of sparkliness, is often used to impart a snowy or vintage look, Brill said. Glass glitter, from Germany, has been used on Christmas ornaments, but unlike plastic or mylar-based glitter options, glass glitter requires careful handling. While glass glitter has a unique look, because of the silver content, it can tarnish. Plastic foil glitter, Brill said, was developed in the United States after World War II because German glass glitter was difficult to obtain. This is mainly what's available in stores today. Speaking by phone from Kurt Adler's New York headquarters, Brill struggled to find the words to describe the magic that glitter adds to an object. It's a kind of fairy dust, she said from her cubicle, surrounded by Santas, angels, elves and nutcrackers. Quiz: Curious Christmas traditions . Glitter is also used to embellish decor during the year's other holidays: Halloween, Easter, Valentine's Day and the Fourth of July.

"(CNN) -- Josh and Jenni Johnston already have photos and memories of 4-year-old Anastasia, the HIV-positive Russian orphan they met in November and hoped to welcome into their family. Now they don't know what the future holds after Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed a controversial law that bans the adoption of Russian children by American families. The new law creates uncertainty for 46 American families who have already met prospective adoptees, according to the U.S. State Department. The agency, which helps facilitate foreign adoptions, hopes Russia will lift the ban altogether, but in the meantime is working to resolve pending adoptions. Read more: Russia's Putin signs anti-U.S. adoption bill . As far as the Johnstons know, their dossier was submitted to a Russian court on Friday, one month after meeting Anastasia in a children's home outside Moscow. Otherwise, they have no idea where their case stands or how the new law will affect them. ""We just hope everything works out so we can bring her home,"" Josh Johnston said in a phone interview from his home in Dover, New Jersey. ""We told her we were going to be back for her and she said she would wait for us,"" he said. ""Now we're in limbo."" The couple already has one adopted child, 4-year-old Jack from Ethiopia, and two biological children. But they wanted to continue growing their family, and their Christian faith led them to again consider adoption, Josh Johnston said. Jenni Johnston's experience volunteering for an international nonprofit had also opened their eyes to the difficulties orphans with medical conditions face in finding a family, leading them to specifically request a child who was HIV-positive. ""We knew that there was an overwhelming need for children to be adopted, especially children with special needs,"" Josh Johnston said. ""We had means and love to give, so we figured that would be the best way to serve the Lord and the world."" They completed about 90 hours of online and classroom training on cultural awareness and raising a special-needs child before arriving in Moscow at the end of November. They met with an official from the region's Ministry of Education, who gave them an information packet with Anastasia's picture, Josh Johnston said. They accepted the referral and drove about 70 miles (115 km) east of Moscow to the children's home, an imposing facility surrounded by high fences topped with barbed wire. Inside, they found a clean and safe environment for children ages 4 to 16. They first saw Anastasia from a distance in the audience of a talent show and later met her face-to-face accompanied by a nurse and doctor, Josh Johnston said. She seemed shy and unsure at first. But when the nurse explained that they were there to take her home, her face flushed and she smiled, he said. ""She captured our hearts,"" he said. ""We went there guided by the Lord, and she was the one the Lord put in front of us."" Americans tend to seek adoptions abroad because of the perception that it's easier and that there are more children in need in other countries than in the United States. In the past 20 years, Americans have adopted about 60,000 Russian children, according to the U.S State Department. In 2011, Americans adopted 970 children from Russia, making it third to China (2,589 in 2011) and Ethiopia (1,727), according to the U.S. State Department. Still, most adoptions are domestic. U.S. citizens adopted 17,416 children from foreign countries in 2008, accounting for 13 percent of adoptions that year compared to approximately 136,000 children in the United States, according to a 2011 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Children's Bureau. ""Generally, it's perceived that orphans have far greater challenges abroad than they do in the United States, so when it comes to adopting a child, families typically want to raise a child out of a desperate situation,"" said Kim de Blecourt, founder of Nourished Hearts, a faith-based support network for those connected to adoption and foster care. Another common perception is that it costs less to adopt internationally. But estimates show that variables such as travel, visa and attorney fees can drive up the cost. International adoptions also offer families who don't want open adoptions more distance from biological parents -- geographically, psychologically and logistically. When Dominique Love found out she couldn't have children, she and her husband started looking abroad to avoid potential conflicts with birth parents. She knows that stance might draw criticism, but at the time it was a very real fear. ""I was scared of the birth mother having a role in our lives, or taking the child back or changing her mind,"" she said. ""When you're standing on the edge of adoption, every angle of it is scary. Until you're in those shoes and faced with the decision you really can't judge."" The couple came across Russia as an option and ultimately found the experience to be so positive that they planned to return there to adopt a daughter. The process was relatively quick, from the moment they submitted paperwork in August 2008 to when they left the country on February 7, 2009, with the 20-month-old boy they later renamed Hampton Burchfield Love Greto. He knows he is adopted and where he's from, she said. She and her husband try to instill in him an awareness of Russian culture through maps, books and TV shows about Russia. They have also become part of a community of Russian-American families in Atlanta in an effort to stay connected to his roots. ""He's Russian-American. It's part of his story, and we don't want to erase that,"" she said. She remembers the day her son thanked her for ""choosing"" him. It broke her heart and reminded her of the other children still waiting for a family to choose them, which is why she was eager to return to Russia for Hampton's sister. If the ban holds up, she and her husband will pursue a domestic adoption. She sympathizes with Russians who want their children to stay in the land where they born but thinks the children are the ones who will suffer. ""Our son had been in that baby home for 12 months when we came along,"" she said. ""You don't understand the need until you see it. We walked into that baby home and saw the number of children that need homes."" Follow CNN Living on Facebook and Emanuella Grinberg on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of protesters were injured Sunday by Yemeni security forces as thousands packed into anti-government demonstrations, witnesses and medical personnel said. Witnesses said some others were arrested, but officials said they were released within hours. In Sanaa's Change Square, Yemeni security forces shot live ammunition at protesters, injuring 11, witnesses and field medical teams said. All 11 had gunshot wounds, witnesses said. Two of the injured are in serious condition, medical staff at the square said. ""We were being shot at directly,"" said protester Abdullah Kulaibi. ""Security forces were trying to kill us and not disperse us."" Yemeni officials have repeatedly denied accusations of targeting peaceful protesters. Witnesses said at least 20 protesters were arrested Sunday. A security official said they were released about two hours later. The official asked not to be identified, as he is not authorized to speak to the media. Field medical teams in Sanaa said some of the releases came because the detainees needed medical treatment after inhaling tear gas. One medical team member, Osama Qurashi, said those who were seriously impaired were taken to nearby hospitals, while the rest were taken to a field medical hospital set up in Change Square. For weeks, demonstrators have taken to the streets calling for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down. In Dhammar province on Sunday, more than 45 anti-Saleh protesters were injured when security forces sprayed tear gas to disperse them, eyewitnesses said. Security forces also attacked some demonstrators with batons, injuring at least five, according to the medical staff at Change Square in Dhammar. The latest marches against Saleh's regime came as the opposition Joint Meeting Parties sent a delegation to Saudi Arabia, where mediators are hoping to broker an agreement. Opposition officials told CNN their delegation was traveling to hear the ideas of the mediators, not to make an offer to the Yemeni government. Some protesters in Yemen said whatever transpires at those talks won't change their stance. ""Any negotiations that does not force Saleh to leave office will be rejected,"" said Shaef Saboor, a human rights activist in Sanaa. Sanaa's main roads were flooded with crowds estimated by eyewitnesses as being in the tens of thousands pushing for a revolution -- most of them women, according to eyewitnesses. ""Every day the number will grow. Today more females than males are protesting, thanks to Saleh's attack on women protesters,"" said Ameera Abdul Jabbar, a female activist in Sanaa. In a speech given Friday, Saleh said women who were protesting were violating Yemeni cultural norms that prohibit women mixing with men who are not direct relatives. His comments angered many activists.","11 protesters have gunshot wounds, witnesses said .

"(CNN) -- The Vatican has rejected criticism that church leaders sought to cover up extensive abuse of young people by priests in Ireland, in a lengthy statement sent to the Irish government Saturday. The Vatican response follows a biting attack by Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny in the wake of the Cloyne report, published in July, which investigated abuses in the diocese of Cloyne, near the southern city of Cork. Addressing lawmakers, Kenny claimed the report exposed the Vatican as trying to hinder an inquiry into child sex abuse for its own benefit and said it revealed the ""dysfunction, the disconnection, the elitism that dominate the culture of the Vatican to this day."" Irish lawmakers then passed a motion deploring ""the Vatican's intervention which contributed to the undermining of the child protection framework and guidelines of the Irish State and the Irish Bishops."" Tthe Vatican responded to the criticism by Kenny and other Irish lawmakers by recalling its envoy to Ireland, Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza. Saturday's 25-page statement is the latest development in a row that has seen an unprecedented rift open up between the Vatican and Ireland, a heavily Roman Catholic country. The Vatican response takes issue with Kenny's statement to lawmakers, saying ""the accusation that the Holy See attempted to frustrate an inquiry in a sovereign democratic republic is unfounded."" It also says that many of the criticisms and allegations made against it in the Cloyne report appear to result from the way a 1997 letter to the Irish Bishops' Conference from the then-papal nuncio was read -- although it acknowledges the letter is open to ""misinterpretation"" if taken out of context. Detailing letters and reports issued by the Vatican, it questions the conclusions drawn by investigators as to the Church's approach to dealing with complaints of by priests. ""The Holy See does not accept that it was somehow indifferent to the plight of those who suffered abuse in Ireland, as Mr Kenny implied in his speech"" to lawmakers, the statement says. Rather, it says, the Holy See ""devoted considerable attention to the Irish situation,"" through meetings with Irish bishops and directions given by the Pope to Irish church leaders. The Vatican also expresses its regret for the abuses committed, acknowledges instances were sometimes mishandled and says it is confident new measures brought in in Ireland and elsewhere will prevent such ""deplorable acts"" recurring. ""In a spirit of humility, the Holy See, while rejecting unfounded accusations, welcomes all objective and helpful observations and suggestions to combat with determination the appalling crime of sexual abuse of minors,"" the statement says. The Vatican response was welcomed by the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Cardinal Sean Brady. ""The reply conveys the profound abhorrence of the Holy See for the crime of sexual abuse and its sorrow and shame for the terrible sufferings which the victims of abuse and their families have endured within the Church of Jesus Christ, a place where this should never happen,"" he said in an online statement. Released July 13, the 421-page report into the handling of abuses in the diocese of Cloyne -- near the southern city of Cork -- demolished claims by the Catholic Church in Ireland that policies it put in place in 1996 had enabled it to get a handle on the problem. It also accused Bishop John Magee, who was responsible for policing abuse in his diocese, of not backing the policies himself and failing to take action against abusers. The report detailed how complaints against 19 clerics in the diocese were dealt with between 1996 and 2009 by church and state authorities.","NEW: The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland welcomes the Vatican's response .

"(CNN) -- A Florida woman accused in the death of a lottery millionaire pleaded not guilty at a court hearing Monday in Hillsborough County, CNN affiliate Bay News 9 reported. Dorice ""Dee Dee"" Moore is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Abraham Shakespeare, a truck driver turned lottery millionaire. She was arrested in February. Police said she befriended Shakespeare after he won a $31 million Florida lottery prize in 2006. She was named a person of interest after Shakespeare, 43, went missing. Deputies found his body outside a home in Plant City in late January after receiving a tip from an associate of Moore's. Moore might have committed fraud to obtain parts of Shakespeare's fortune, and she bought lime to deal with his body and was trying to find someone to move the corpse before authorities could find it, police said. Shakespeare was killed on April 6 or April 7, and Moore has admitted trying to convince Shakespeare's family members that he was still alive, Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee has said. Her attempts included writing a letter to Shakespeare's mother, claiming to be him, and getting people to call his family members, using his cell phone and claiming they were Shakespeare, Gee said. Moore proclaimed her innocence before her arrest. She told reporters said she was planning to help Shakespeare write a book about the challenges of winning millions and that she was helping him manage the money.","Dorice ""Dee Dee"" Moore, arrested in February, is charged with first-degree murder .

"(CNN) -- In a Connecticut elementary school, 26 people, including 20 children, were killed by a gunman Friday morning. This comes on the heels of a shooting rampage on Tuesday in Oregon, where a masked man opened fire into crowds at a mall, killing two before killing himself. Tragic images flash across our television screens and computer monitors, as they have so many times in recent memory. These events will once again set in motion a predictable cycle of ineffectual chatter about gun violence in America. We will be told that now is not the time to discuss policy. By tomorrow, a well-funded gun rights propaganda machine will move into action. For the adherents of this ideology, the solution to the problem of gun violence is not better regulations but more guns. School shootings? Arm the teachers. Movie theater shootings? Arm the moviegoers. Analysis: Why gun controls are off the agenda in America . Contemporary gun rights ideology makes a mockery of the Enlightenment ideals of the Framers of the Second Amendment. The Founders obviously supported gun ownership, but they favored strong gun regulation. America has the former, but nobody seems willing to talk rationally about the latter. We all need to take a cue from the Founding Fathers. Some have interpreted the Second Amendment's affirmation of the right to bear arms as a barrier to reasonable regulation. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Second Amendment does not pose a barrier to gun regulation, it requires it. As long as there have been guns in America they have been regulated. It would have been impossible to muster the militia to fight the British if we applied today's gun rights ideology to the American Revolution. Registration, mandatory inspection of firearms and frequent training were all essential to a well-regulated militia. In America today, we have many more guns, but far less government regulation of firearms. Our ideas of armed self-defense are at odds with the Founders' vision. At the time the Second Amendment was written, the common law view of the right of self-defense inherited from England was very limited. Indeed, returning to the original understanding of the right of self-defense would require repealing ""stand your ground"" laws that some states have adopted. Under English common law one had a legal duty to retreat, not stand your ground. As early as 1328, Parliament acted to limit armed travel, with the notable exception that members of the nobility were allowed to travel with armed retainers, a legal recognition of the privileges of aristocratic birth. The American Revolution did not usher in a new era of expansive gun rights. Thomas Jefferson, one of the most pro-gun voices among the Founding generation, proposed but failed to secure a robust individual right to have arms included in the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776. 10 ways to put brakes on mass shootings in schools . Individual states did recognize a right to travel armed with a musket to meet the legal obligation to attend militia musters, but states and localities regulated the exercise of this right and in some cases prohibited traveling with a loaded weapon or discharging a weapon at or near a muster. In 1835, Massachusetts passed a law that severely limited the right to travel armed: ""no person may go armed with a dirk, dagger, sword, pistol, or other offensive and dangerous weapon, without reasonable cause to apprehend an assault or violence to his person, family, or property."" The key legal concept here is reasonable cause for fear, precisely the standard that gun rights advocates wish to overturn and a federal court in New York recently upheld. Supporters of gun regulation won an important victory when the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld New York State's requirement that one show ""proper cause"" to obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun in public. The court rejected the idea that one had a right to carry arms in the absence of a reasonable fear of imminent violence. The lead plaintiff in the case, Alan Kachalsky, said that the court's emphasis on reason is a ""ridiculous interpretation of the Second Amendment."" Sadly, the idea of reason has become ridiculous to some. Polls: Your thoughts on gun control . But champions of gun control were handed a defeat when on Tuesday, in Illinois, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state's ban on carrying a weapon in public is unconstitutional. In contrast to New York, and against the advice of experts, Illinois did not rewrite the law to include an exception for arming oneself when there was a reasonable fear of imminent danger. The Court of Appeals' ruling in the New York case has put us in the right direction; Illinois ought to follow New York's example. It is time to inject more sense and reason back into America's debate over guns. Not talking about changing our default gun policy will guarantee more tragedies. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Saul Cornell.","In a Connecticut school, at least 26 were killed, including at least 20 children .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- From the time her daughter was very young, Briana Vartanian knew something was wrong. Lola Vartanian, whose autism was diagnosed two months ago, is already doing better with therapy, Mom says. Lola didn't smile. She didn't laugh. When she and Lola took walks in the park, Vartanian noticed how the other babies loved to be held by their mothers. Lola hated being touched and even more being held. But there was something even more devastating to Vartanian, who lives in Ladera Ranch, California. ""Lola never looked at me -- she looked through me. She had no idea who Mommy was,"" Vartanian said. ""And other kids love it when someone comes up to them and smiles. She'd freak out if someone approached her -- even if it was me or my husband."" Vartanian told her pediatrician she was worried, the doctor told her Lola was fine. ""She kept telling me wait and see, wait and see, and that really annoyed me,"" Vartanian said. At first she took the took the doctor's advice but then decided to seek a second opinion. A couple of months ago, when Lola was 14 months old, she saw a pediatric neurologist, who diagnosed autism. Lola immediately started receiving special therapy. ""You always wonder if it would have made a difference if they'd caught it earlier,"" Vartanian said. The American Academy of Pediatrics is making a push to have every child screened for autism twice by age 2. The academy's new report gives explicit instructions for the warning signs of autism at various ages. Parents should watch for signs, including not making eye contact, not recognizing a parent's voice, not babbling by age 9 months and not using pre-speech gestures such as waving, pointing and showing.  Watch for other autism signs to look out for » . Autism encompasses a range of developmental disabilities that affects communication and social interaction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates as many as one in 150 8-year-olds has a form of autism. Dr. Pauline Filipek, a child neurologist at the University of California-Irvine, said she hears much too often that even when parents push pediatricians, the doctors miss the signs of autism. ""I hear this from parents all the time, that the pediatrician said, 'Don't worry,' or 'You're imagining things' or 'Let's wait,' "" Filipek said. ""When I give lectures to pediatricians, I tell them, 'Get these phrases out of your lexicon. Get them out of your vocabulary.' "" Earlier diagnosis is crucial, she said, because it means earlier treatment. ""The research is very clear -- the earlier a child is treated, the better,"" according to Dr. Ami Klin, Harris associate professor of child psychology and psychiatry at the Yale Child Study Center. ""It's never too early to start treatment."" Usually autism is diagnosed at around 3, Klin said. The new American Academy of Pediatrics report tells pediatricians how to screen for the disorder in babies. For example, the report said a child at around 6 months should have a ""to-and-fro pattern of vocalizations between infant and parent"" instead of ""vocalizing without regard for the parent's speech."" The academy's Web site links to videos of children with autism alongside those of ""typical"" children. For example, one video shows a ""typical"" child at 20 months playing make-believe games with two adults and trying to feed a bottle to a Big Bird stuffed animal. The accompanying video shows a child of the same age with autism in the same setting, ignoring the adults and stuffed animal and becoming aggravated when someone reaches out to him. (The video, part of a visual autism ""glossary"" on the Web site of the advocacy and education group Autism Speaks, requires registration.) Alison Singer, executive vice president of Autism Speaks, said she hopes the academy's report will help families get an earlier diagnosis than the one she received for her daughter Jodie, 10. ""I often think Jodie's life would be different right now if she'd been diagnosed earlier,"" Singer said. ""She was diagnosed when she was 2 years and 8 months old. What if she'd been able to have early intervention when she was 12 or 18 months old?"" Singer said she also missed the signs, including echolalia, a tendency to parrot back large chunks of words a child has heard. ""She could recite entire lines from the 'Madeline' books, so we thought she was advanced,"" Singer said. ""So when the doctor asked if she could put two words together, I said, 'She speaks in full sentences.' "" Vartanian said she'll always wonder whether Lola would be different if her autism been diagnosed at 6 months, when she first expressed concerns to her pediatrician, instead of more recently. But the child has had therapy for about two months, and Vartanian is thrilled with her progress. At 16 months, Lola can crawl and hold a bottle by herself, Vartanian said. She doesn't talk but is starting to coo and babble. And last month, for the first time, Lola looked at, rather than through, her mother. Vartanian cried as she described how it happened: ""She was in her highchair, and I asked her what she wanted to eat. She looked at me and smiled. It was so exciting. I said 'Mommy, you see Mommy.' She smiled, so I knew that she knew it was me."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A woman who Australia deems to be a national security risk has given birth to a child who is likely to spend the early months, if not years, of his life in detention. Baby Paari was born on Tuesday to Ranjini, a 33-year-old mother of two other boys aged six and nine, who was granted refugee status by Australia in 2011 after fleeing violence in Sri Lanka. Read more: Australia's 'overwhelmed' asylum centers slammed . Since May, they've been living in residential housing within the walls of the Villawood Detention Center, a secure facility in suburban Sydney where asylum seekers remain while their cases are processed. Ranjini's husband Ganesh clearly remembers the day in May 2012 when his wife and two children were summoned to a meeting with immigration officials to be told that the country's security intelligence organization, ASIO, had given Ranjini a ""negative assessment."" ""We don't comment on any individual cases, but it means that an assessment by our security intelligence organization has identified that person may be of risk, and we need to take seriously that it's our job to make sure that the community is safe,"" Australian Attorney-General Nicola Roxon said recently when asked about the case. Read more: Australia grapples with policy on asylum seekers . Ganesh says they were not told why she is considered a national threat. In any case, she had no legal right to appeal. She and the boys were given five minutes to say a tearful goodbye to Ganesh before they were flown from Melbourne to Sydney and into indefinite detention. He says the very next day they found out that she was pregnant. Ganesh told his and Ranjini's story to CNN but has received legal advice not to be quoted. He has requested their surnames aren't used as they still have family living in Sri Lanka. CNN is unable to verify details of Ranjini's story with the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) because it will not comment on individual cases. ""It's a very difficult situation -- I understand why people are agitated about it -- but it is important for people to remember that we do have an obligation as a government to keep the country as safe as we can. Where these fairly rare security assessments are made, it's very difficult for us to do anything other than to act upon them,"" Roxon said. Ranjini's supporters say they suspect her detention has something to do with her former husband, a Tamil who was killed during fighting in Sri Lanka, though that is also unable to be confirmed. Ranjini's story . Ganesh tells CNN that in 2008 Ranjini was living as a widow with two young children in Sri Lanka as the country lurched toward the brutal end of a civil war between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) Her first husband had been killed in 2006, leaving his young family at the mercy of fighting in the Vanni area, where the United Nations alleges both sides murdered civilians, according to a report released in March 2011. Ranjini first sought refuge in India before boarding a boat that she was told could take them to a new life in Australia. Their vessel arrived in Australian waters in April 2010, long after it had run out of food and fuel. Ganesh says Ranjini told him the Australian Navy brought his wife and children ashore and took them for processing by immigration authorities on Christmas Island. Three more moves followed, to detention centers in Perth, Adelaide and then Brisbane where they were released to community detention in April 2011. Five months later, they were granted refugee status. There was just one more security check to go through before they were granted permanent visas. Ganesh's story . Ganesh says he met Ranjini at a friend's house in Brisbane during the Christmas of 2011. Her two young boys were polite and well-behaaved and Ranjini seemed to like him. Ganesh was three years older and from the same region of Sri Lanka before he left in 2004 to study information technology in Australia on a student visa. He finished his degree course in June 2009, just as the Sri Lankan government was declaring victory over rebels in the north. It was not safe to return. He applied for a protection visa and was later granted permanent Australian residency. He says he will soon qualify for Australian citizenship. In April of 2012, life was good. He was working as an IT consultant, had just married Ranjini, and she and her sons had moved in with him in Melbourne. They started calling him ""dad,"" or ""appa"" in Tamil. The law . Ranjini is not the only refugee who is being indefinitely detained in Australia. There are 56 whose cases are being reviewed by the country's first independent reviewer, retired Federal Court judge Margaret Stone. Stone was appointed in October 2012, six months after an Australian Senate Committee report into the country's Immigration Detention Network concurred with the government's stated view that cases of indefinite detention should be subject to review. The committee's final report, released in April 2012, said that it ""resolutely rejects the indefinite detention of people without any right of appeal. Such detention, effectively condemning refugees who have not been charged with any crime to detention for the term of their natural life, runs counter to the basic principles of justice underpinning Australian society."" Because she has already been found to be legitimate refugee, Ranjini can't be deported. And her high risk status prevents her from being released. ""It's still the government's strong view that non-Australian citizens who have been given an adverse security assessment should not be permanently settled in Australia. We ensure appropriate arrangements are in place for the care and support of people detained due to an adverse security assessment,"" a DIAC spokesman told CNN. ASIO has not revealed the criteria it uses to decide if someone is a security risk. The organization's Director-General David Irvine told the Senate Committee that ""once the criteria for making assessments are known, then you will find very quickly that all the applicants will have methods of evading or avoiding demonstrating those characteristics."" He said the decision to issue an adverse assessment ""was not taken lightly."" ""Nor are we contemptuous of or blasÃ© about the human rights of the individual's involved. ""We take very seriously our responsibility to behave ethically and professionally and, obviously, with the utmost probity,"" he added. Still, the process undertaken by Stone has offered a glimmer of hope to those in indefinite detention that their status could change. Letters dated December 4, 2012 were sent to all 56 detainees who are considered a national risk. So far, 54 have requested their cases be reviewed, according to Stone's office. During the review process, detainees will be allowed to see an ASIO summary explaining why they are considered a risk to Australia. However, according to the terms of reference, information will only be included ""to the extent able without prejudicing the interests of security."" Stone's office has confirmed to CNN that Ranjini's case has been given priority, along with a number of others. Life in detention . Ranjini and her sons are being held in a ""lower security"" section of Villawood Detention Center in Sydney with other families who are waiting for their claims to be processed. The boys are not free to leave. Ganesh says that they were given refugee status but had not been granted permanent visas when their mother failed the security test. He says he's trying to secure them a visa but until then they must stay in detention. Very soon they'll be joined by Baby Paari. Because his father has permanent residency, Paari qualifies as an Australian citizen and will be allowed to leave the center, just not with his mother. ""The situation is deplorable,"" said Ranjini's lawyer, David Manne, executive director of the Refugee and Immigration Legal Center. He called on the government ""as a matter of basic decency, humanity and common sense"" to use its powers of discretion to release Ranjini and her children ""so they can reunite and live in freedom with their husband and father as a family."" More than a dozen children now live in Villawood Detention Center, according to ChilOut, an advocacy group that campaigns against the detention of minors. A DIAC spokesman declined to confirm how many, but said the children have access to play areas and are taken on regular excursions outside the center, swimming and to the park. Every day, the older children are escorted to and from school by officials from Serco, the company contracted to run Australian detention centers. Their parents are also allowed to accompany them, the DIAC spokesman said. ChilOut's campaign director Leila Druery says that despite efforts to support the children they are clearly traumatized by their surroundings. ""They feel that they're bad people and that they're being punished which means they have very low self esteem,"" she said.

"London (CNN) -- A journalist at the News of the World, the UK newspaper that was closed by Rupert Murdoch last year, once said: ""This is what we do. We go out and destroy people's lives."" The British press, combative and uncompromising, has been a feature of national life for many years. But now a high court judge, Lord Justice Leveson, has decided the government must intervene to ensure it behaves itself. Will this prove a watershed moment for tabloid newspapers? Or will they revert to type? The British press has vowed to clean up its act before, only to end up back where it started. When Princess Diana was killed in Paris, with freelance photographers in hot pursuit, the Daily Mail vowed never to use paparazzi shots again. Yet its popular website, MailOnline, now depends on paparazzi images for its success. Leveson was appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron to carry out a year-long inquiry into press standards when it emerged in July 2011 the News of the World possibly intercepted voicemail messages left on a cell phone belonging to Milly Dowler, a murdered schoolgirl, in pursuit of stories. It emerged the practice of phone hacking had been widespread at the paper. The revelation prompted a wave of public revulsion and left Cameron in a difficult position. He had employed the paper's former editor Andy Coulson as his communications director and had a warm personal relationship with another former editor, Rebekah Brooks, who ran Murdoch's powerful stable of British titles. Both have since resigned. The Leveson report, published on Thursday, is 2,000 pages long and runs to nearly 1 million words, but its main recommendation is simple enough. The government should pass a law giving Ofcom, a body that already overseas British broadcasters, the power to approve a new regulatory system that will be independent of the newspaper industry. The old system, the Press Complaints Commission, was dominated by editors and proved ineffective, Leveson said. Cameron immediately sparked controversy by declaring he would not pass a law that would give parliament a say in how newspapers are run for the first time in nearly 300 years. A glance at Friday's headlines shows that his stance has transformed the PM overnight into a hero in the eyes of newspaper editors and owners. In the short-term, the newspapers themselves may be the biggest winners. The report says they should continue to regulate themselves, paying for a new complaints body that will be staffed by people from outside the industry. It will have the power to levy fines of up to Â£1 million and the funds to launch investigations into wrongdoing. Ofcom could yet be handed the right to oversee it. But in truth a more onerous system could have been imposed. The much-maligned police will also find comfort in Leveson's report. Scotland Yard was criticized for failing to fully investigate phone hacking but the judge accepted its claim it was too busy dealing with possible terrorist threats to prioritize the case. Some senior police officers were too close to journalists but he found no evidence of corruption. Politicians were roundly criticized by Leveson for schmoozing newspaper editors and proprietors for more than 30 years, attending their weddings and birthday parties, enjoying intimate dinners and forming close friendships. But none were singled out. They too will be relieved Leveson didn't couch his criticism in stronger terms. Rupert and James Murdoch did not get off so lightly. Leveson saved some of his strongest words for the media mogul and his son, a senior executive at the company founded by his father. The judge expressed amazement that Murdoch Sr. had not sought more information about the likely extent of phone hacking at the News of the World, one of the company's flagship titles. His failure to read a damning high court judgement about the conduct of News of the World ""says something about the degree to which his organization engages with the ethical direction of its newspapers"". Referring to Murdoch's claim he did not remember visiting then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to discuss his 1981 takeover bid for the Times of London at her official country residence, Leveson said: ""It is perhaps a little surprising that he does not remember a visit to a place as memorable as Chequers in the context of a bid as important as that which he made for Time newspapers. However, perhaps that is all I need to say."" James Murdoch, who ran News Corp's European and Asian businesses until earlier this year, claimed his own executives had failed to tell him hacking went further than a single reporter at the News of the World. But Leveson said his evidence did not stack up. ""There are aspects of the account of Mr Murdoch that cause me some concern,"" he said. He did not go further because a major police investigation into phone hacking is ongoing, but the criticism may prove strong enough to damage Murdoch's chance of succeeding his father. Editors, past and present, are also criticized. Rebekah Brooks, who edited the News of the World and its daily sister title The Sun, was condemned for claiming former PM Gordon Brown wanted the fact his young son suffered from cystic fibrosis to be made public. In fact, the opposite was true, but the Sun ran a front-page story revealing the news anyway. The British public, who already hold journalists in low regard, are unlikely to be surprised by any of this. Nearly 20 years after Diana's death, which elicited expressions of remorse from editors, some British papers printed naked pictures of Prince Harry in a Las Vegas hotel room. Weeks later, the same papers reacted with fury when a French magazine carried topless photo of Kate Middleton. As Leveson wryly observed, newspapers apply restraint selectively, and only when it suits them. In the meantime, the British public grumble about journalists, just as they grumble about the weather, but carry on buying their papers anyway, albeit in smaller numbers. As Leveson might also have said, we all get the press we deserve. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Robinson.","After Lord Leveson's report on press ethics, James Robinson asks what will change .
Robinson: British press has vowed to clean up its act before, after Diana's death .

"(CNN) -- Relations between the United States and Iran, already strained by U.S. sanctions on Iran's central bank and Iranian naval exercises in the Strait of Hormuz, are on the verge of spinning out of control. What can push the two nations into a military confrontation is the fate of a former Marine, Amir Mirzaei Hekmati. A Revolutionary Court in western Iran sentenced the dual U.S.-Iranian citizen to death on January 9, claiming that he is a CIA spy. It is not often that the fate of entire nations hinges on that of a single individual, but the execution of a Marine by Iran will almost certainly inflame public opinion and tilt the balance toward war. But perhaps what will save the day is an incident that placed friendship and trust, rather than enmity and paranoia, between Iranians and Americans. Days before the death sentence was passed on the Marine, American sailors rescued 13 Iranian fishermen held hostage for several weeks by Somali pirates who had seized their fishing vessel off the coast of Oman. Those Somali pirates may have pulled off a diplomatic stunt that has eluded American and Iranian politicians for more than three decades. For a brief moment, the pirates healed the wounds of history. Two nations split since the hostage crisis of 1979 found their fishermen and sailors forced into each other's arms by a turn of fate. It was a most embarrassing embrace, with both governments trying to figure out how to handle the threat of friendship. Even the pretense of hostility came down. It fell upon one of the rescued fisherman, Fazel Ur Rahman, to revel in the twists and turns of fortune. As devout seamen are wont to do, he interpreted his miraculous rescue by the Americans as an act of God. ""It's like you were sent by God,"" he told the American sailors. ""Every night we prayed for God to save us. And now you are here."" Like Sinbad the Sailor, Rahman and his shipmates vanished in time. But then they found themselves returned to an Iranian port. They will no doubt relate their encounter, not with predator drones but a giant and gentle American whale. One can already hear the peels of laughter and shrieks of disbelief as Rahman tells the story of how they were disgorged out of the belly of the Somali shark because the American whale spoke Urdu. It may be that our fate is determined by crusty histories and fixed ideologies. But given the gulf separating Iranians and Americans, this metaphor is worth reflecting upon. The rescue of the fishermen also evokes memories of a distant past and dreams of a hopeful future. While the Islamic Republic's ideologues portray America as a belligerent and hostile power, most Iranians recognize that if it were not for America's defense of Iran's sovereignty in 1946, Joseph Stalin would have devoured northern Iran. Many ordinary people in Iran, far from seeking a war with the United States (or Israel), silently pray to God for an end to their hardships. They dream of an Iranian Spring. Sadly, in the modern Middle East, divine interventions -- God's creativity and compassion -- have taken on an ugly tone. If God favors this tribe or that faith, then must it mean that other faiths and tribes are to be destroyed? The acts of God -- earthquakes, floods, plagues, famine and such -- veer from the minor to the massive. Add nuclear weapons to God's arsenal and there is very little room left for tiny fishermen and their benevolent God. But what if the fisherman Rahman was right? With a Marine's life and so much else at stake, what if the whole rescue incident was an act of God, his way of shaming world leaders by showing how even the most clueless of pirates can turn sworn enemies into friends, however temporarily? For helping the hapless Iranians and the Americans find common ground, even if it's at sea, the pirates deserve a toot, a hoot and quite possibly a salute. Whether the future of U.S.-Iran relations will be stormy or turn hopeful, only God knows. Centuries before, Hafiz, the greatest of Persian poets, may have captured the essence of the fishermen rescue incident in describing what it means to offer friendship and show humanity. His wisdom can perhaps draw Iranians and Americans together: . ""Plant the Tree of Friendship for It Brings Forth Boundless Joy. Uproot the Saplings of Enmity for It Summons Countless Sorrows.""

"Monterrey, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities are asking for DNA samples from families of missing persons nationwide in their efforts to identify 49 decapitated bodies, an official said Wednesday. That will be the only way to identify the victims -- whose killers cut off their heads, hands and feet -- Nuevo Leon state security spokesman Jorge Domene told reporters three days after investigators found the remains abandoned along a highway. Officials in El Salvador may also request access to the DNA data authorities in Nuevo Leon have compiled, to compare it with samples from family members of Salvadoran migrants who have gone missing in Mexico, Domene said. While investigators work to identify the victims behind closed doors, parts of the case have played out quite publicly. Banners hanging in locations throughout the country, purportedly from the Zetas, claim that the notoriously ruthless cartel had nothing to do with the gruesome crime. But another message purportedly signed by the Zetas and found Sunday at the crime scene -- a roadside near the industrial city of Monterrey and about 80 miles southwest of the U.S. border -- told a different story, threatening members of rival cartels and Mexican authorities. Domene told reporters Wednesday that investigations to find those responsible would focus on scientific proof and not on the banners. On Monday, Mexico's interior minister said the 49 decapitated bodies were likely the result of a fierce feud over territory and power between the Zetas and members of the allied Gulf and Sinaloa cartels. The Zetas started with deserters from the Mexican army and quickly gained a reputation for ruthless violence as the armed branch of Mexico's Gulf cartel. The partnership ended in 2010. Now, analysts say the Gulf cartel is allied with the Sinaloa cartel, one of the nation's most powerful drug-trafficking groups. Interior Minister Alejandro Poire stressed Monday that the Mexican government would not retreat from its efforts to crack down on organized crime -- an effort that is facing increasing criticism as Mexico's presidential campaign season heats up. ""I know very well that these acts worry society, but the solution is not to let our guard down,"" Poire said. President Felipe Calderon, seen as the chief champion of Mexico's crime-fighting strategy, is not running for re-election. But opposition candidates have criticized his administration's approach. More than 47,500 people have died in drug-related violence in Mexico since December 2006, when Calderon announced plans to deploy troops in efforts to combat cartels. According to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission, more than 5,300 people have disappeared throughout the country in that same time period. And the bodies of 9,000 dead have not been identified. Officials fear the total number of missing could be far higher, because many disappearances go unreported.

"(CNN) -- ""To My friends at Sandy Hook Elem. You are in my prayers. Love, Mason B. 2nd Grade, Texas."" Mandie Balderaz's 8-year-old son placed his memorial to the lost children of Sandy Hook Elementary on a child-size lawn chair in his yard, decorated with stuffed animals and balloons and held down by rocks. Knowing he would hear the news from someplace else, Balderaz figured she had to tell Mason what had happened on Friday in Newtown, Connecticut. In response, Mason decided he wanted to make his own tribute. ""I kept it together and I ran to the store,"" she said. ""When I was buying the stuff, it hit me ... it was real. You have to keep that straight face in front of your kids and you have to keep that mom face because I don't want my 8-year-old living in fear."" Stunned by the loss of innocent life in Friday's massacre, children and adults around the country were moved to pay tribute to the Sandy Hook schoolchildren, teachers and administrators who lost their lives. People crafted memorials and school sports teams paid homage to lives cut short. Some offered prayers, and others promised never to forget the names of the dead. A child's condolence letter . Although Stephen Kales and his wife would have preferred not to tell their 9-year-old daughter about the shooting, the Kensington, Maryland, parents figured she would eventually hear about it. So he and his wife decided to tell her themselves. ""She was noticeably sad and went into her room to do her homework and eventually came out with those cards,"" which she posted on her bedroom door, he said. ""I am Sorry to all the parent's of those kid,"" read one note. ""It was her idea and was her natural way of acknowledging those lost and their grieving families,"" Kales said. ""She realized that they were just like her -- and their families just like ours. "" No birthday candles this year . Jennifer Wallace knew her 12-year-old son was too old for her to protect him from the news. When she picked him up at his Dallas, Texas, school, he'd already heard about the shooting. Instead of celebrating his 12th birthday over the weekend with candles in his birthday pie, he decided that he wanted to pay tribute with candles for the Newtown victims. ""It was his decision,"" said Wallace, who also has a child in kindergarten. ""He said he wanted to do something to honor those victims, and I said I had 27 tea lights, so we lit those."" Redoing his Christmas lights display . Suffolk University college sophomore Ryan Emrich photographed the light display he created to honor the Newtown school shooting victims as well as the shooter, who he believes was a victim of mental illness. Using white Christmas lights, the 19-year-old arranged the lights to the number 27 on his front lawn in North Reading, Massachusetts. ""I look at these lights and that number 27 and think of 27 lives, all which were prematurely ended. All of which who were in the process or one day would give back to society in so many ways,"" he said. ""My family's thoughts and prayers are with the families impacted by the tragedies that have occurred over the last week or so, including (the) Oregon mall shooting."" Art finds a way . Recent college graduate Deepthy Alias of Orlando wrote a poem within an hour of learning about the Newtown shooting. ""Sometimes we can't process things as it is -- then painting or poems come to our rescue -- to help us mourn, to heal and to hope, and to try to hold on(to) the optimism that there must be some goodness still left in the world,"" she said. ""I was trying to think like one of the young victims who had to leave way sooner than they should have,"" said Alias, 27. ""They left behind empty homes, heartbroken parents and dreams that can never be fulfilled again. They did nothing wrong to deserve it. And as a society we must answer to each of their lives, to their pain and to their loss."" A promise to remember . Mike Kirouac and his wife were so saddened while watching the news that they decided to immediately create an ongoing tribute for the victims using American flags. The Acworth, Georgia, couple started calling stores that night until they found one that had 27 flags and drove 20 miles the next morning to pick them up. ""We felt one American flag for every life lost would be very meaningful,"" he said. ""We made a personal commitment to set these flags out every December 14 until the day we meet these angels in heaven."" Many people simply promised to remember the victims and pray for them. ""I will remember the children and teachers who were killed, and pray that they rest in peace,"" wrote CNN commenter Erlinda Sheryl Brent. ""I also pray for the families of the victims. I don't want to suggest that they will find comfort in memories of their loved ones, but I will acknowledge that the fabric of their families is changed forever, and that they are blanketed with love and support."" ""I hope these angels are sent somewhere special for all they have done,"" wrote CNN commenter Elise. ""I look at all these beautiful faces and see such promise in their lives. Our prayers go out to all these families that have lost such precious people.""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The International Criminal Court demanded Saturday the immediate release of a lawyer and three other staff members who were detained while visiting the son of deposed Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Defense lawyer Melinda Taylor was detained in the city of Zintan after she was discovered carrying documents and letters Libyan authorities said jeopardizes Libyan national security, said Ahmed Gehani, a Libyan lawyer who serves as a liaison with the criminal court in The Hague, Netherlands. He said guards first confiscated a camera pen on Taylor and allowed her to go in to interview Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, who was captured in hiding last November. A later search by female guards found documents and letters written by former regime members, Gehani said. They included a letter from Mohammed Ismail, Saif Gadhafi's former right-hand man. Taylor was also carrying three blank papers signed by Saif Gadhafi, Gehani said. Taylor is not in jail, but was placed under house arrest in Zintan, along with a translator. Gehani said Libyan authorities are looking into whether she was spying and communicating with the enemy. The two other court members from the registry office were free to go but chose to remain with Taylor and the translator. Gehani said a criminal court delegation is scheduled to arrive in Tripoli Sunday to try to resolve the situation. Judge Sang-Hyun Song, the president of the criminal court, said the staffers have immunity while traveling on an official court mission. ""We are very concerned about the safety of our staff in the absence of any contact with them,"" he said. Court spokesman Fadi El Abdallah said the court has had no contact with the four staff members. Nor has it received any official information from the Libyans as to why they were detained. ""We lost contact with them on Thursday, and since then we have had no opportunity to clarify the reasons for their detention,"" Abdallah said. ""When we got a hold of the Libyan authorities they only said that they would be released soon, but they didn't say the reason for why they had been detained,"" he said. Both the International Criminal Court and Libya's new authorities want to put Saif Gadhafi on trial. The criminal court has demanded that Libya hand him over immediately to face accusations of crimes against humanity. Libya appealed the decision, saying that he should be tried at home. The criminal court issued an arrest warrant for Saif Gadhafi, who stands accused of having a role in the deaths of Libyans who protested his father's 42 years of dictatorship. Taylor and lawyer Xavier-Jean Keita said in April that Saif Gadhafi has been mistreated and ""physically attacked"" since his capture. In a strongly worded statement, the lawyers described Gadhafi as being in a legal black hole, held in total isolation except for visits from officials. He also suffers dental pain because he hasn't had treatment, and Libyan authorities have given him nothing to remedy the pain, the lawyers said. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","NEW: Libyan authorities investigating lawyer Melinda Taylor over documents .

"(CNN) -- Security forces raided a northern Syrian city amid explosions and gunfire early Thursday and casualties have been reported, activists said. The forces clashed with gunmen believed to be dissidents in the city of Binnish in Idlib province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, another activist group, said 14 people had been killed, including 12 in Binnish and one each in Homs and Daraa. Among those dead are at least two young children, the group said. ""Syrian military forces supported by tanks and armored personnel carriers stormed the city early this morning,"" Syrian Observatory said. ""Heavy machine guns and shelling have been heard around the city."" The group said some houses were damaged and casualties have been reported. Explosions rang out as forces pounded the city, according to the group, which said military forces also stormed the village of Taoum east of Binnish. Oudai Al Sayed, an opposition activist, said he fled the town through olive groves to escape a Syrian military attack. He said he saw 30 tanks and an armored personnel carrier enter the town. Standing on a rooftop in a nearby town, al Sayed said he saw smoke rising from Binnish. He said a couple of months ago, military defectors took shelter in Binnish. He said some of the defectors are fighting Syrian troops. The LCC said security forces made arrests in Binnish and Banias. Security forces also raided Al-Qusor in Homs province and arrested 19 people, the Syrian Observatory said. The LCC said pro-government militia members and security forces burned down the houses of an activist's relatives in Homs after they failed to find and arrest him. They also kidnapped members of a family. CNN cannot independently confirm events in Syria, which restricts international journalists from accessing many parts of the country. Protests in Syria erupted seven months ago, with demonstrators demanding an end to President Bashar al-Assad's regime, as well as democratic elections. Al-Assad has been in power since 2000. His father, Hafez al-Assad, ruled Syria for three decades until his death that year. The Syrian Observatory estimates that more than 3,100 people have died since the uprising began in mid-March. The death toll includes about 2,400 civilians, the group says. Opposition activists have accused officials of killing protesters, but the government has said it is going after armed groups.","NEW: At least 14 people have been killed, an activist group says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two men were arrested in southern Pakistan this week on suspicion of trying to smuggle a batch of heroin disguised as onions out of the country, authorities said. Officials seized 125 kilograms (276 pounds) of heroin Wednesday during the incident in Karachi, said Meraj Mohammad Channa, a customs official. The suspects made the drugs look like onions by using paint and plastic and then stashed them in bags of real onions, Channa said. The drugs and vegetables were set to be shipped to Malaysia until customs officials inspected the shipment. Two men were arrested and authorities were looking for one more suspect, Channa said.","Customs officials seize 125 kilograms of heroin in Karachi .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Residents of a town in southern Yemen say it has been seized by Islamists connected to al Qaeda. People in the town of Shaqra contacted by phone said al Qaeda fighters drove out local tribesmen defending the town Wednesday. They told CNN that the militants now control the harbor at Shaqra and its fishing zone, the main source of income for the town. Shaqra is on the Arabian Sea some 100 kilometers (about 60 miles) to the east of Yemen's main port, and occupies a strategic position on the coastal road east toward Oman. ""The attacks happened quickly,"" said Abdul Salam Mansoor, a resident of Shaqra. ""One hour our government was in control and an hour later militants control everything."" Government officials in the capital, Sanaa, and in Abyan in the south declined to comment on the reports. But a local security official confirmed Shaqra was in the hands of the Islamists. All government buildings in the town had been taken, he said. The government was unprepared to fight, he said, and that was the reason the militants took over so quickly. ""The government is sending reinforcements to the town and hopes to retake it"" soon, he said . The tribal militia defending the town had light artillery, but residents said a group of no more than 50 militants was able to seize Shaqra, along with the government artillery and equipment. Other residents said there was little fighting and the government had not used air support against the attacking Islamists. ""We are pretty sure the town was handed over to the militants like Zinjibar was in late May,"" Mansoor said. Zinjibar, the provincial capital 35 kilometers away, is still largely in the hands of Islamist militia fighters calling themselves Partisans of Sharia. Yemen's opposition has accused the government of allowing towns to fall to al Qaeda in an effort to show that the turmoil in the country is being exploited by Islamist extremists. Mansoor said he would try to leave Shaqra, fearing attacks by militants. At the end of last month there were several days of clashes around Shaqra between tribal fighters and militants. ""As soon as we controlled the city and kicked out the militants we handed the city to the Yemeni military,"" said Mohammed Abu Jalil, a tribal fighter in Abyan. The southern provinces of Yemen have seen growing activity by Islamist militant groups said to be affiliated with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula since unrest began across the country in February.","Al Qaeda fighters drove out local tribesmen, Shaqra residents tell CNN .

"(CNN) -- Forces loyal to Alassane Ouattara took control of state-run television and attacked the residence of Laurent Gbagbo on Friday as Ivory Coast's bloody, four-month battle for political power appeared to enter its final stages . Artillery and mortars joined the cacophony of gunfire Friday in Abidjan, the nation's commercial center and largest city, witnesses said. French and United Nations troops beefed up their presence on the streets to fill a security vacuum. ""The situation on the streets has deteriorated to such an extent that it's just become too dangerous to go outside,"" said Henry Gray, a field coordinator with the humanitarian medical group Doctors Without Borders, who called his organization while in lockdown. ""There's a lot of pillaging and looting going on, and if you're out on the streets, you're basically a target."" And the violence isn't isolated to Abidjan. At least 800 people were killed Tuesday in the fight for control of Ivory Coast's western city of Duekoue, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday. The whereabouts of Gbagbo, who refused to cede power after a disputed November election, were not known. The French ambassador to Ivory Coast said on France Info radio that Gbagbo's residence was empty. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said the U.N. mission in Ivory Coast has been in contact with both Ouattara and Gbagbo in an effort to ensure a peaceful resolution. ""I cannot confirm anything about any exit of Laurent Gbagbo,"" Haq said. Gbagbo adviser Abdon Bayeto blamed the United Nations and global leaders including France and the United States for Ivory Coast's bloodshed by recognizing Ouattara as the legitimate president. Ouattara knows he lost the election, Bayeto said, adding that Gbagbo is a true democrat. ""For 30 years there was no trouble in the country,"" he said. ""We are going to be victorious."" The chances for that victory appeared slim Friday after pro-Ouattara forces launched a massive offensive in a final push to oust Gbagbo. Gbagbo had been expected to appear on state-run television, but the embattled president has not been seen in public for days and the TV network -- accused of having incited post-election violence -- went dark Friday after pro-Ouattara forces attacked the building and took control. Ouattara, the internationally recognized president, had been confined to a United Nations-protected hotel in Abidjan. Gbagbo's siege of the hotel ended Thursday after pro-Ouattara forces carried a nationwide offensive to Abidjan. Ouattara declared evening-into-morning curfews for Friday and Saturday in Abidjan. Ouattara's interior minister also announced on radio that the air and sea borders of the country would be sealed until further notice. It will be only ""hours, maybe days"" before Gbagbo falls, predicted Ouattara's spokesman, Patrich Achi. ""The army does not want to fight for Laurent Gbagbo."" The African Union called again Friday for Gbagbo ""to immediately hand over power."" ""Gbagbo's days are numbered because he overstayed his welcome,"" Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga told CNN. Odinga has served as the African Union's main negotiator in Ivory Coast. ""The will of the Ivorian people must finally prevail."" Events in Ivory Coast are sure to have critical implications for the immediate region and all of Africa. The nation had been on the rebound from a 2002 civil war and the elections last year inspired expectations that the cocoa-producing nation would embark on a new chapter that would take it closer to becoming a stable democracy. But the post-election chaos does not bode well for other African nations struggling to become stronger democracies. And thousands of people have crossed into neighboring nations including Liberia, which is trying to hold onto its own fragile peace. An Abidjan resident told CNN that most of the city's 4 million residents were huddled inside their homes Friday with no access to information since national broadcasting was off the air. The resident was not identified because of security reasons. ""Armed gangs are out on the street and there is a real atmosphere of fear out in the community, particularly in the poorer areas,"" Gray said. ""It's weird, because Abidjan is actually a really nice city with well-maintained roads and nice bridges and big buildings."" Documentary filmmaker Seyi Rhodes said Abidjan, a city that never slept before the turmoil erupted, was empty and bleak. International journalists covering the conflict did not dare venture out from their hotel Friday. Abidjan has become a city divided where it is difficult to decipher loyalty, Rhodes said. ""There is nothing now,"" said Rhodes, who had visited the city before the conflict. ""Abidjan is a shadow of its former self."" The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported an exodus of more people Thursday. ""Heavy fighting, widespread human rights abuses and fear of war have already forced up to 1 million people to flee their homes in Abidjan,"" the report said. Some 500 foreigners, including 150 French citizens, sought refuge Thursday at a French military camp, said a spokeswoman for the French Defense Ministry. A Swedish employee of the United Nations was killed in Thursday's fighting in Abidjan, said Joakim Larsson, a spokesman at the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ""She was in her home when she was hit by a bullet which killed her,"" Larsson said. Before Friday's revelation of the 800 or so deaths in Duekoue, human rights monitors had documented the deaths of 462 people -- some in heinous fashion -- and warned Abidjan is on the brink of catastrophe. ""The international community must take immediate steps to protect the civilian population,"" said Salvatore Sagues, Amnesty International's researcher on West Africa. Republican Forces wrested control of much of Yamoussoukro and other key cocoa-producing and port cities earlier in the week before marching to Abidjan, the commercial center of Ivory Coast. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights reported Friday that the agency had received ""unconfirmed but worrying reports"" that Republican Forces have been committing human rights violations in their advance to Abidjan, especially in the Guiglo and Daloa areas in western Ivory Coast. Among the complaints were arbitrary arrests and ill-treatment of civilians. Similar abuse accusations have been leveled at Gbagbo's men in Abidjan, the agency said. Concerned about the rising tide of violence, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to impose sanctions on Gbagbo, his wife and three associates, as well as give U.N. peacekeepers more authority to protect civilians. The U.N. resolution demands that Gbagbo step down immediately and that all state institutions, including the military, accept Ouattara as president. It also authorizes U.N. peacekeepers ""to use all necessary means to carry out its mandate to protect civilians under imminent threat of violence."" CNN's Zain Verjee, Carey Bodenheimer, Christabelle Fombu and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 800 people were killed Tuesday in the Ivory Coast, the Red Cross says .

"(CNN) -- Most of us have done it. At Google's Gmail Labs work area, employees' e-mail ideas are made into reality. Instead of hitting ""reply"" to an e-mail, we accidentally push ""reply all,""  sending a potentially embarrassing or insulting message to those we didn't intend to see it. To address this problem, Google Inc.'s Gmail Labs has launched an experimental feature called ""Undo Send"" that gives users a chance to rewrite their message, correct settings or simply fix typos. When a Gmail user who enables this feature sends an e-mail, a button that says ""Undo"" will pop up on their screen for five seconds. If the user hits the button within that time, the service will retrieve the e-mail in draft form -- allowing the user to make changes or cancel the message altogether. ""Sometimes ... I send a message and then immediately notice a mistake,"" said Michael Leggett, a Gmail Labs designer and the creator of the ""Undo Send"" feature, in the Gmail blog. ""I forget to attach a file, or e-mail the birthday girl that I can't make her surprise party. I can rush to close my browser or unplug the Internet -- but Gmail almost always wins that race."" Leggett added that he's had ""Undo Send"" turned on for a while ""and it's saved me several times."" This may be good news to Gmail's tens of millions of users as people in the digital era look to connect with others over the Web in a more efficient manner. ""Undo Send"" is also just the latest example of the dozens of creative -- and sometimes downright wacky -- online features developed at Gmail Labs to address common e-mail problems. Launched in June, Gmail Labs is an optional program. It offers an assortment of tools, ranging from a service that stores e-mails onto a user's desktop so the user can access mail offline to a feature that prevents users from firing away drunken e-mails during late-night hours. Gmail users can enable the Gmail Labs settings by going to their settings tab. Then they can customize their account by turning on features of their choosing. Since the Gmail Labs program began, the features have grown in popularity among users, Google officials said. The number of lab features has more than tripled, to more than 36, as Gmail celebrates its fifth birthday next week. Google's Gmail Labs also typifies the Mountain View, California-based company's reputation for innovation and brainstorming. At Google, Gmail engineers can allocate 20 percent of their workweek to their own projects, which can include creating Gmail Labs features. Google hopes the labs create an environment that will find out what Gmail users like and dislike. ""There is no screening process,"" said Todd Jackson, a Google product manager. ""It's up to whatever people want to build internally."" Jon Perlow, a Gmail engineer, introduced the practical idea of ""Mail Goggles"" to help users, including himself, stop sending ""mail you later regret."" Perlow created the function last fall when he found himself sending messages to an ex-girlfriend -- late at night -- asking to get back together. With Perlow's Mail Goggles, users can specify which hours they would like to enable the feature. If a user tries to send an e-mail during the self-selected time -- say, midnight to 3 a.m. -- a screen pops up forcing the user to solve a series of simple math problems before the message can be sent. Theoretically, this gives time for the intoxicated or emotional e-mailer to reconsider. Gmail Labs also recently developed a feature that helps users who forget to add photo or document attachments to their e-mails. Users can turn on a ""forgotten attachment detector""; if the program finds the word ""attachment"" in the e-mail text, a box pops up reminding the user to add an attachment. Gmail engineer Michael Davidson was celebrating St. Patrick's Day last year at a bar when he came up with a feature to help e-mail addicts. Davidson realized he was wasting valuable work time checking e-mails. ""Someone joked that it would be a great feature of Gmail to keep you from checking e-mail,"" Davidson said. So he created a program that locks people out of their Gmail accounts for a set period of time. After spending two afternoons coding it, Davidson launched the ""E-mail Addict"" feature, which forces users to take a break from e-mailing by blocking Gmail for 15 minutes. Company officials say the best lab ideas will eventually become standard features in Gmail. For example, the idea of Google Maps started as a lab concept. ""The best thing you can do is to put your product and team in a position where you can move fast and get feedback from users to find out what sticks in the marketplace,"" Jackson said. Gmail is the third most popular e-mail site, following Yahoo! Mail and Windows Live Hotmail, according to Experian's Hitwise.com, a site that tracks Web traffic. Google declined to comment on Gmail user growth. Other e-mail services also are trying to enhance the electronic messaging experience. Windows Live Hotmail added a ""What's New"" feed in February that allows users to see what their friends and family are up to as well as pictures or posts they may have added. In 2006, Google added a chat feature. Last fall the company added a video function allowing users to see each other when they e-mail. Google officials hope to continue adding features regularly. That'll be good news to Doug Baruchin of Plainview, New York, who uses Gmail at least 16 hours a day between work and personal communication to family and friends. Baruchin runs the Web company MyWorkster.com, a professional development portal for colleges and universities, where his 15 employees are required to use Gmail. The video and chat functions also help workers stay connected when they are traveling, he said. Baruchin especially likes ""Superstars,"" a Gmail Labs tool that lets him prioritize e-mails with star icons and colored labels. Because his company receives thousands of e-mails a day, he said he and his coworkers would not be able to effectively manage their company without Gmail. ""With the way the economy is going, our company is growing very quickly,"" Baruchin said. ""So the more organization we have, the better it is for us.""","Google's new Gmail feature, ""Undo Send,"" lets users rescind messages .

"(CNN) -- A seismic shift is taking place in the Greek political system. The series of bailouts and austerity measures implemented during the last two years has led to a fundamental political crisis affecting both the function of government and the standing of key politicians and political parties. Sunday's debate in parliament regarding the latest austerity and bailout package was marked by unprecedented scenes of tension both inside and outside the building. The bill passed but left both historic buildings in central Athens, as well as both major parties of the interim coalition government, in tatters. Yet, it would be a mistake to attribute Sunday's destruction to the austerity measures -- similar events took place in December 2008, well before any talk of a debt crisis had reached Greece. What these events symbolize is the mainstreaming of extremism in Greece and the rejection of the rule of law. Extremism -- both from the far left and from the far right -- is visible throughout the public sphere: it has permeated the political rhetoric; it has polarized social groups against each other; it is present in the everyday discourse of ordinary citizens who single-handedly condemn not only individual politicians but the institutions of representative democracy altogether. What the politics of extreme austerity does is to offer the ideal excuse -- the perfect cover -- for the further breeding of extremism. It looks as if public opinion in Greece can tolerate the continuous and widespread destruction of central Athens, but would not accept any police or state action that would contain those few extremist groups that cause mayhem. The reasons for this self-destructive pattern are historical and cultural. They stem from the long divide between left and right in Greece, which in fact goes back almost one century. Right-wing governments -- either elected or imposed -- dominated Greek politics for much of the 20th century. The army and the police were instrumental in containing communism and suppressing the left, culminating in the 1967-1974 military junta which scarred the Greek psyche. In the minds of many Greeks, police action is associated with the suppression of fundamental civil liberties. However, what many don't see is that Greece has now reached the other extreme, in which the lack of law and order hurts those who need it the most. Widespread tax evasion, which creates huge deficits, hurts pensioners and the working classes. Ongoing strikes and protests hurt commuters, workers and tourists. Greeks have a love-hate relationship with the state -- they have historically depended on it, while always trying to undermine it. The role of the state and of the public sector is usually at the heart of political debates between left and right. Yet, for the first time in recent memory, the political battle lines in Greece are not drawn between left and right, but between the modernizers and the populists existing in most political parties across the spectrum. The modernizers support Greece's position within the eurozone at all costs and favor radical reforms, including a smaller and more efficient role for the public sector. The populists reject the austerity packages arguing that they will eventually lead to a default anyway. The former camp has so far failed to prove that austerity works. However, the latter camp has not offered an alternative. On Sunday night, Greek TV carried two live feeds. The first feed was from inside the parliament building, showing a disconnected political class engaging in their usual micro-political infighting and self-congratulation; the other feed was of ongoing semi-apocalyptic destruction in the streets of Athens. The juxtaposition could not have been more telling. It bore a chilling resemblance to the last days of Germany's Weimar Republic in the 1930s. One thing is certain -- the political system in Greece is changing and the repercussions may well be felt across Europe and the world. Sunday's vote led to the expulsion of 45 MPs from the caucuses of three parties. No political party now holds an absolute majority on its own. In addition to international skepticism, the Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos is facing a power vacuum at the heart of the political system. While unelected, he has a unique opportunity to reframe the political debate and realign the political system utilizing an emerging social movement in support of stability, rationality and reform. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roman Gerodimos.","For many Greeks, police action is associated with the suppression of civil liberties, says Roman Gerodimos .

"Washington (CNN) -- After several days of rumors and denials, the Justice Department finally made it official on Wednesday -- Lanny Breuer is leaving. The assistant attorney general of the Criminal Division announced he will leave government service on March 1. Breuer, best known for his defense of President Bill Clinton against impeachment efforts, has been a target of Republican critics throughout his term. Despite their best efforts, the critics were unable to pry Breuer from his post. In fact, his nearly four years in the job makes Breuer one of the longest serving Criminal Division chiefs. ""Serving as assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division has been the greatest privilege of my professional life,"" Breuer said in a statement. ""From my first day on this job nearly four years ago, I have loved it, and I am so proud of what the Criminal Division has accomplished over the past four years,"" Breuer said. The announcement came the day after Breuer celebrated a victory in the criminal investigation of BP in the 2010 Gulf oil disaster. A federal judge in New Orleans on Tuesday approved the largest package of criminal fines and penalties in U.S. history, which will cost BP $4 billion. Attorney General Eric Holder had named Breuer to oversee the Deepwater Horizon Task Force in 2010. The record amount in the guilty plea allows Breuer to depart on a high note. The chief criticisms against Breuer had focused on Wall Street prosecutions -- or lack thereof -- and the ATF's Operation Fast and Furious. In regards to white collar crime, Breuer faced extensive criticism for the Justice Department's failure to bring major prosecutions against the nation's largest financial institutions responsible for financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. But Breuer insisted that the banks and their employees needed to be protected against an implosion that could cause greater problems. In several cases, he relied on deferred prosecutions that allowed the financial leaders to avoid going to jail in exchange for exhibiting good corporate behavior. In the case of Fast and Furious, Breuer was the top administration official stung by the investigations. Breuer apologized for an inaccurate letter to a senator in which the Justice Department denied the ATF allowed guns to be smuggled to Mexican drug cartels. Breuer's announcement Wednesday gave no hint about his plans.","Justice Department confirms March 1 will be his last day on the job .

"(CNN) -- When the Pentagon decided last week to delay the deployment of aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman to the Persian Gulf because of looming budget cuts, some military families found their already unpredictable lives thrown into even more uncertainty, victims of the ugly budget battle in Congress. One military wife, Jenelle Hatzung, said she heard on the news, rather than from the Navy, that her husband's deployment was canceled just days before he was set to leave on the USS Truman. ""I never thought Congress' inability to pass a budget would so intimately affect my personal life,"" she said. She and her husband had plannedthe adoption of a baby to coincide with the time he would be home; now, those plans are in peril as her ensign husband faces a new schedule that will probably interrupt the proceedings. ""It isn't right,"" wrote Navy wife Jill Qualters on her blog. ""I know that this whole thing comes down to the one thing that runs the world: money. And I know it is completely naive of me to think that families would come first. But this kind of emotional whiplash takes a toll."" All military families are living under the shadow of upcoming sequestration budget cuts. Although we hear congressional leaders extol their support for military families -- they even wear their alleged patriotism on their smart striped suits -- it's clear from inaction on the budget that their support is as empty as the USS Truman's deck. Panetta warns of degraded military readiness from cuts . You see, not a lot of Americans serve in the military; it's only a tiny slice of the pie. According to a Pew Research study, about one-half of 1% of American adults have served on active duty at any given time in the past decade. So when the wind dies down and the flags stop flapping, military families are truly forgotten. We are no longer ""special"" interests. A bit of Sequestration 101: When legislators raised the debt ceiling in 2011 but couldn't agree on a deficit-cutting plan, they passed the Budget Control Act, which called for huge automatic spending cuts -- or sequestration -- to start in January 2013 unless a plan for balancing the budget was drawn up. That didn't happen. If nothing changes, $1.2 trillion in automatic defense and nondefense spending cuts, divided evenly, will kick in over the next 10 years. On military installations across the United States and around the world, operations have been hurt. Troops and brass are waiting for the ax to fall. Again. Commanders are paralyzed, unable to schedule training or order equipment because they don't know their budgets. Troops preparing for combat deployments aren't getting the training that is essential for them to survive their missions. Service members in Afghanistan are already seeing the effects of anticipated budget cuts in everything from the equipment they are issued, or not issued, to the hours the chow halls are open. We don't know what will happen to funding for the programs designed to tackle this war's ugly twins, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, not to mention the rising suicide epidemic among veterans and military family members. The fact is, we are losing about 22 veterans to suicide every day, with no evidence that the deadly tide is retreating. By the Numbers: Recent defense spending . Military pay is exempt from sequestration cuts, but pay raises aren't. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta will also ask Congress to limit next year's military pay increase to just 1%, even though the Labor Department's expected Employment Cost index for 2014 is higher. Translation: an effective pay cut. Congress, it seems, is banking on our patriotism once again. They are taking for granted that the less than 1% who responded after the worst terrorist attacks in our nation's history -- and then responded again by staying in the fight for 11 years and counting -- will respond yet again by standing by stoically. We understand that sacrifice is required of everyone in order to reduce our national debt, but the sacrifice should be shared by all. We cannot perpetuate this fiscal mess. So this time around, we will pour our hearts and souls into compelling government leaders to feel, if only for a moment, what playing politics with people like Hatzung truly means. Military families will take to social media to write, tweet and post about the fiscal cliff's dangerous slide. They will write their members of Congress to remind them that relying on 1% of Americans to shoulder a nation's burden is preposterous. And don't think our problems don't really affect most Americans. According to Panetta, ""rough estimates suggest after 10 years of these cuts, we would have the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest number of ships since 1915, and the smallest Air Force in ... history."" Americans will be more vulnerable to emerging threats than ever, and with less training and equipment to respond. In other words, when the wolves come back to our door, there will be fewer, and noticeably weaker, dogs to keep them at bay. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers: Military families live with uncertainty as sequestration cuts loom .

"(CNN) -- How do you say ""scoop"" in Latin? It's a good bet that Giovanna Chirri -- the journalist who broke the story of the pope's resignation -- can tell you. Chirri's knowledge of Latin gave her the edge to understand the magnitude of the pope's announcement. A reporter for ANSA, Italy's state-run news agency, Chirri was among a few reporters at what appeared to be a routine papal announcement Monday. Most media outlets chose not to cover the event, which began with 20 minutes of announcements concerning other church matters, ANSA reported. But then, in Latin, Pope Benedict XVI said he would resign at the end of the month ""because of advanced age."" The news would surprise the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, but someone had to inform them first. Chirri has ""polished"" Latin skills, her employer said, but it took confidence to trust that she heard what she thought she heard. The pope's resignation, explained . ""(The news of) his resignation didn't seem real to me,"" she told ANSA. ""I told myself 'you misunderstood.'"" The pope's Latin is ""very easy to understand,"" Chirri said, but it wasn't until the announcement was repeated that the reporter filed an urgent bulletin for ANSA, which was subsequently picked up by the rest of the world. A devout Catholic, Chirri told ANSA she tries to keep her faith separate from her work covering the Vatican, but Monday's announcement made her cry because she was upset. ""I fought to keep my nerve despite my knees feeling weak,"" she told the news agency. While Catholic services today are celebrated in local languages, Latin remains the official language of the Roman Catholic church. For this reason, all official acts of the church are announced in Latin, as was the case Monday.","Italian news agency reporter Giovanna Chirri broke the pope resignation story .

"(CNN) -- Former South African freedom fighter-turned-president Nelson Mandela made a rare public appearance Thursday as the nation's parliament met to honor him on the 20th anniversary of his release from prison. ""President Mandela united this country behind the goal of a nonsexist, nonracial democratic and prosperous South Africa,"" President Jacob Zuma told lawmakers. Mandela, 91, is known in the country as Madiba, his clan name. He and his wife, Graca Machel, were present to hear Zuma speak. His former wife, Winnie Mandela, also attended. ""We should reflect on how far we have traveled as a country,"" Zuma said. ""Honorable members, we recall the words of Madiba on his release when he said, 'I stand before you not as a prophet, but as a humble servant of you, the people. Your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here today. I therefore place the remaining years of my life in your hands.' ""These words inspire us not to rest until we achieve the ideals of a society free of poverty and deprivation. In the two decades since the release of Madiba, our country has changed fundamentally."" Mandela was already in prison when he was convicted of treason in 1964 and given a life sentence. He was a living symbol of the struggle against South Africa's racist apartheid system, enacted when he was 30 years old. Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years for opposing South Africa's government, which enforced its strict segregation laws through brutality. Following his release, he worked with South Africa's white president, F.W. de Klerk, to end those policies. De Klerk also was in attendance Thursday. The African National Congress -- once again legal after being banned in 1961 -- elected Mandela as its president, and he won South Africa's presidential election in a landslide in 1994, the country's first black president. In his last public words before he was jailed, Mandela said, ""I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony, and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for, and to see realized. But if need be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."" Zuma said Thursday, ""As we celebrate Madiba's release today, let us recommit ourselves to building a better future for all South Africans, black and white. Let us pursue the ideal for which Madiba has fought his entire life: The ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities."" Mandela is not remembered simply for ending apartheid. He also was behind reconciliation, a painful and lengthy process that attempted to hold those responsible for the brutality accountable for their acts without alienating other white South Africans. He also was instrumental in bringing soccer's World Cup to South Africa. It will be held there this year, six years after soccer's world body awarded the event.","Visit to parliament is rare public appearance for Nelson Mandela .

"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -- The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously on Tuesday to authorize up to 26,000 troops and police in an effort to stop attacks on millions of displaced civilians in Sudan's Darfur region. A Sudanese boy at the Sheria Camp for Internally Displaced People in southern Darfur in July. Expected to cost more than $2 billion in the first year, the combined United Nations-African Union operation aims to quell violence in Darfur, where more than 2.1 million people have been driven into camps and an estimated 200,000 have died over the last four years. The resolution allows the use of force in self-defense, to ensure freedom of movement for humanitarian workers and to protect civilians under attack. But the measure, which has been watered down several times, no longer allows the new force to seize and dispose of illegal arms. Now they can only monitor such weapons. Gone also is a threat of future sanctions, but British Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned on Tuesday that ""if any party blocks progress and the killings continue, I and others will redouble our efforts to impose further sanctions."" ""The plan for Darfur from now on is to achieve a cease-fire, including an end to aerial bombings of civilians; drive forward peace talks ... and, as peace is established, offer to begin to invest in recovery and reconstruction,"" he said on a visit to the United Nations. Specifically, the text authorizes up to 19,555 military personnel and 6,432 civilian police. The resolution calls on member states to finalize their contributions to the new force, called UNAMID or the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur, within 30 days. UNAMID would incorporate the under-equipped and under-financed 7,000 African Union troops now in Darfur. Rape, looting, murder and government bombardment drove millions from their homes in Darfur, where mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms in early 2003, accusing Khartoum of neglecting their arid region. The rebels have now split into a dozen groups, many fighting each other. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- Thailand's capital was braced for unprecedented flooding Tuesday, amid the monsoon rains that have overwhelmed much of the country and neighboring Cambodia in recent weeks. So far 269 people have been killed in Thailand, according to the country's Flood Relief Operations Command. Some 60 of the country's 76 provinces have so far been affected, impacting some eight million people. In Bangkok officials beefed up flood prevention measures as waterways, including the main Chao Phraya River, became bloated by rising water. On Monday, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered canal dredging and reinforcement of flood-prevention embankments to protect the city, state-run news agency MCOT reported. In addition, three new flood-prevention walls were being built at two locations in Rangsit, in northern Bangkok, and in Taling Chan, in the western part of the city. Tourists warned as floods continue to wreak havoc in Thailand . The government needs another 1.5 million sandbags, MCOT reported. The prime minister called on the private sector to supply them, but said the government will buy all the needed sandbags by Wednesday, the news agency said. Meanwhile, around 1,200 people have taken shelter in a gymnasium at Bangkok's Thammasat University. Most of them are from neighboring Ayutthaya province and other flood-affected areas around the capital, said Thanawat Srisuwan, a volunteer at the makeshift shelter. The authorities have set up almost 200 other temporary shelters around the city to receive flood victims. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said plans were in place to evacuate people from nine areas, mainly in eastern Bangkok, if needed. Elsewhere, patients in two hospitals in Thailand's Ayutthaya and Nakhon Sawan provinces had to be evacuated after water reached the first floor, the flood operations command said. Multiple tropical weather systems have moved over the region in recent weeks, enhancing monsoon rains and leading to the flooding. Another low pressure system is forecast to move into Southeast Asia on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Brandon Miller, senior meteorologist for CNN International. According to the government website Thaiflood.com, water from northern Thailand has finally reached lower parts of central Thailand, penetrating dykes in Pathumthani and Nonthaburi provinces and flooding outer areas of Bangkok, including the market in Nonthaburi and Chiang Rang road. The giant Rojana Industrial Park has halted operations for the time being, director Amara Charoengitwattanagun told MCOT, and the facility may be further damaged if the flooding worsens. One plant in the park, Single Point Parts, evacuated all workers from the premises and built flood prevention embankments around its building. Honda also confirmed operations at its Rojana plant have been halted and it will remain closed at least until October 12. The Japanese automaker says the closure of the plant has already affected the manufacture of 4,500 vehicles. Meanwhile the UNESCO-listed Ayutthaya historical park, which includes the ruins of the old city of Ayutthaya, has been submerged since last week, according to local authorities. ""This is the worst flood in our historical site in 16 years,"" said Somsuda Leeyawanich, from the Thai Fine Arts Department. She said the water level in the park is almost three meters, compared to levels of around 80-90 centimeters during the floods of 1995. ""We are very concerned that if the site is under water more 30 days it may cause serious damage,"" she added. ""The temples are over 400 years old."" CNN's Kocha Olarn in Bangkok contributed to this report.","Flood Relief Operations Command: 269 people have been killed in Thai flooding .

"(CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Tuesday that his country has ""been able to control"" the U.S. drone that Iran claims it recently brought down, Venezuelan state TV reported. ""There are people here who have been able to control this spy plane,"" Ahmadinejad told VTV. ""Those who have been in control of this spy plane surely will analyze the plane's system. Furthermore, the systems of Iran are so advanced also, like the system of this plane."" Ahmadinejad did not elaborate or specify what precisely he meant when he referred to people ""who have been able to control"" the drone. He spoke in Farsi, which VTV translated into Spanish. The Farsi portion of the interview was not audible. President Barack Obama said Monday that the United States has asked Iran to return the drone aircraft that Iran claims it recently brought down in Iranian territory. ""We've asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond,"" Obama said. Ahmadinejad's comments to VTV seemed to suggest that Iran did not plan to return the aircraft. ""The North Americans at best have decided to give us this spy plane,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""In the unpiloted planes, we have had many advances, much progress and now we have this spy plane."" Defense Minister Brigadier General Ahmad Vahidi said the drone no longer belongs to Washington. ""The U.S. spy plane is among the assets of the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" Vahidi told reporters Tuesday, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. ""Our country will decide what to do with it."" The United States owes Iran an apology and needs to admit its crime, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said Tuesday, the Iranian Students' News Agency report. ""The U.S. should know that what it did regarding violation of our air space can put international peace and security in danger,"" he said. ""The U.S. should take responsibility for the consequences of the measure."" American officials have not confirmed that the drone shown in a video released last Thursday by Iranian media is a U.S. aircraft. But Pentagon spokesman George Little has said that an American drone is missing and had not been recovered. Two U.S. officials have confirmed to CNN that the missing drone was part of a CIA reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in Afghanistan. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the country's armed forces had downed the drone near Kashmar, some 225 kilometers (140 miles) from the border with Afghanistan on December 4. The Ahmadinejad interview was aired in Venezuela Monday night. Officials say the fall of this drone is not related to an incident Tuesday in which a U.S. drone crashed upon landing at an airport in Seychelles. For one thing, they seem to be two different kinds of drones -- the one over Iran was apparently a sophisticated stealth-type vehicle while the Seychelles one is of more conventional design.","The spy plane belongs to Iran, defense minister says .

"Memphis, Tennessee (CNN) -- Police in Tennessee and the Amateur Athletic Union have launched separate investigations after two former basketball players alleged that the leader of a youth sports organization molested them during the 1980s when they were boys. The former players were interviewed by the ESPN show ""Outside the Lines"" for a story broadcast Sunday. They allege that Robert ""Bobby"" Dodd sexually abused them in hotel rooms during tournaments when they were 12 to 16 years old. CNN could not reach Dodd, 63, for comment. ESPN said it also had been unable to reach him. The former players say the alleged incidents occurred when Dodd was a YMCA director in the 1980s. Calls placed Saturday to the Memphis YMCA were not immediately returned. But a public relations firm representing the AAU outlined Saturday the timeline of events that led to Dodd's dismissal last month, noting that the AAU has opened an independent investigation and contacted local law enforcement in Memphis, Tennessee. Dodd has been diagnosed with colon cancer and will not return as president and chief executive officer of the youth organization, the statement said. Louis Stout, who replaces Dodd as acting AAU president, said the organization has provided the Memphis Police Department ""with the limited information we have up to this point"" and begun to review such safeguards as screening and training for staff and volunteers. ""While we believe our network of programs has significant safeguards in place, we will never be complacent about doing all we can to protect the young people in our programs,"" he said. Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong said, ""Although this case has its challenges due to the amount of time that has passed, it will be thoroughly examined; and if the investigation reveals the law was violated, the person responsible will be held accountable."" The allegations were made amid child sex scandals at Penn State and Syracuse universities; both men told ESPN that the publicity from the scandals prompted them to act. One of Dodd's accusers, identified by ESPN as Ralph West, said he was 14 at the time of the alleged abuse. West said he was on a basketball team run by Dodd, who he said would sometimes slip into his hotel room. He recalled one incident to the network. ""Must have been 3 in the morning. I was dead asleep and I don't remember anything but waking up and he has his, he's trying to put his hand in my boxer shorts. And I jumped up straight out of the bed and he's not there, but he's laying on the floor next to me down by the bed. And of course I was freaked out,"" West told ESPN. Asked how Dodd could have entered the hotel room, West said, ""He had a key. He always somehow had a key to whatever room I was in."" West said he tried to find ways to keep Dodd out of his hotel room when they were at out-of-town basketball tournaments. ""I was afraid to even fall asleep when he was around. And it got to where I would barricade my, if I had a hotel room, I would take the table and chairs and I'd block it all against the door,"" West told ESPN. ""And it got to where he couldn't assault me, but he would push his way in the room and then end up, I'd see, I wouldn't see him, I would hear him, he'd lay at the floor of the bed masturbating. And you just lay there horrified. But you don't know what to do. What, are you going to blow the lid off of this at 14 years? All you want to do is pretend it didn't happen and not address it at all. You want to hide and bury it."" Asked what evidence he has, West said, ""I'm the evidence. I'm not trying to gain anything out of it. It's not like, 'Oh, wow, here, let me go on national TV and humiliate myself and possibly embarrass my family and stuff so I can tell everybody this deep, dark secret that I've had.' The guy shouldn't be around kids any more."" West said Dodd abused him or tried to abuse him six times. West showed ESPN an e-mail he said he sent to the AAU's compliance department on November 9 accusing Dodd of being a pedophile, the network reported on its website. He said he got no response to the e-mail. But the head of the Florida-based media relations firm hired by AAU to manage the crisis offered a detailed account of how the organization learned about and then responded to the accusations. The AAU headquarters in Orlando, Florida, began to receive ""brief, cryptic, anonymous e-mails on November 7, 8 and 9 that alleged, in very general ways, acts of child sexual abuse by Bobby Dodd,"" said Ron Sachs of the Florida-based Ron Sachs Communications. ""One of them referenced the year 1984 with nothing further, another referenced the 1970s,"" he said. Those messages were sent to AAU's compliance office and to the organization's general counsel, Sachs said. After business hours on November 9, the AAU office received similar anonymous, brief messages on its telephone answering machine that were retrieved the following day by staff members, he said. AAU officers were told of the allegations on November 11, and flew to Orlando to meet at AAU offices with Dodd on November 14, Sachs said. ""Dodd informed the officers that he had also received calls making these kinds of general allegations during the same time period of the first half of November,"" Sachs said. ""During the meeting on the 14th, he repeatedly denied the allegations to the officers."" He was then told ""to take leave from the office and his post and not to return to the office and, in fact, he has not returned since."" The officers initiated an internal investigation and hired a private investigator to whom they turned over the accusatory phone messages and e-mails, Sachs said. He described the messages as ""brief, cryptic and anonymous."" The phone messages did not leave call-back numbers and the e-mails were not in the name of a person, he said. ""What the organization did was take very seriously the allegation, general as it was, by acting directly through their compliance office, general counsel and engaging a private investigator,"" Sachs said. The other accuser, whom ESPN did not identify, said Dodd gave him alcohol before taking him to a bedroom and touching him inappropriately. ""We were at his house and he provided us with some alcohol and, looking back on it now, I know for a fact that he put something in my, my drink that night, because the last thing that I can really remember was him carrying me into his bedroom and I can remember him, you know, touching me in ways that I, I didn't uh, I didn't want another man touching me,"" the accuser said. The man said he called Dodd on Nov ember 11 and confronted him. Dodd, he said, then apologized for the alleged abuse. The network said it examined the man's phone records and verified an eight-minute phone call to Dodd's number. Both men said they had never reported the alleged incidents to police and had only recently told their families, ESPN said. About the same time that the accusations were unfolding, Dodd learned that he had colon cancer and underwent surgery, Sachs said. On Friday, December 9, the AAU notified the Memphis Police Department about the allegations and offered to cooperate with any investigation, Sachs said. ""It is my understanding that, until that time, the Memphis police had not been contacted by any complainant"" about the allegations, he said. The AAU has directed its private investigator to stand down ""for the time being"" in order not to interfere with any law enforcement investigation of the matter, he said. But it is undertaking its own investigation into the matter by reviewing its policies, procedures and protocols, he said. The AAU has 80,000 adult volunteers involved in coaching and working with hundreds of thousands of young people, he said. CNN's Joe Sutton, Meridith Edwards, George Howell and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","NEW: Dodd denies the accusations during a meeting with AAU officials .

"Palo Alto, CA (CNN) -- It does not make for pleasant dinner conversation. But we have a global sanitation crisis. More than 40% of the world's population does not have access to a toilet. These 2.6 billion people, most living in low- and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa, face the daily challenge of finding a bush, train track or empty lot where they can urinate and defecate in relative privacy. Between 1990 and 2008, the share of the world's population that had access to basic sanitation increased only 7%, to 61% of the world's citizens. In many developing countries, mobile phone penetration is expanding at a faster rate than sanitation. In Tanzania, for example, half the country's citizens have mobile phones, but only 24% use an improved sanitation facility. Saturday marks the 10th anniversary of World Toilet Day, a day set aside not simply as a celebration of this most venerable and useful of technologies, but as a way to draw attention to the crisis and some possible solutions. This sanitation crisis is not only an affront to dignity. It results in the release of hundreds of tons of feces and urine each day directly into rivers, lakes, landfills and oceans, creating an immense human and environmental health hazard. Every day more than 4,000 young children die from sanitation-related illness. Fully half of the hospital beds in the developing world are occupied by people whose ailments can be traced to poor sanitation. A small but dedicated community that includes governments, NGOs, donors and research institutions is working to expand access to basic sanitation services in developing countries. They employ a range of innovative strategies, including ""naming and shaming"" community members who defecate in the open, constructing public toilets operated by entrepreneurs, and providing subsidies to help households build their own facilities. In most cases these sanitation champions promote or deliver ""on-site"" services such as a pit latrine or a toilet with septic tank. These facilities capture feces and urine in a chamber under or next to the users' dwelling. When adopted on a wide scale and maintained properly, these solutions can dramatically improve household and environmental sanitation. On-site solutions are also popular because they cost less to build, and require much lower volumes of water than a conventional sewer system. In addition, some on-site sanitation facilities allow for the possibility of generating biogas for cooking and lighting, and for re-using composted excreta as fertilizer for agriculture. Given all these benefits from improved sanitation, why has it proven so difficult to expand access to this essential service? One answer may be that the kinds of sanitation facilities offered to developing country households are not terribly appealing. As sanitation guru Professor Sandy Cairncross of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine noted two decades ago, ""For those accustomed to a contemplative squat in the open air in the cool of the early morning, who among them would choose a dark, damp, smelly and possibly precarious cubicle?"" Efforts to keep sanitation as low-cost as possible may also be part of the problem, at least for some consumers. Researchers from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill working recently in Southeast Asia found that households prefer and are willing to pay for higher quality toilets, particularly when they are marketed as a symbol of prestige and modernity, rather than just a preventive health measure. This shift toward aspirational marketing is one important step toward generating greater household demand for improved sanitation services. In order to turn the tide on the global sanitation crisis, however, efforts are also needed to develop models for low- and no-water sanitation systems at scale, models to which municipal and national governments themselves can aspire. In cities across the United States, the transition from outhouses and privies to sanitary sewers occurred more than a century ago, when metropolitan populations numbered in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Today there are more than a dozen cities in developing countries that have at least 5 million inhabitants, most of whom rely on latrines or toilets with septic tanks. Municipalities with limited resources struggle to regulate, much less manage, the emptying and safe disposal of sludge from these facilities. It is estimated that only 15% of domestic waste in developing countries undergoes any form of treatment before being discharged to the environment. In the United States, our prevailing urban sanitation model has changed little in the past century, with the typical American flushing more than 12,000 liters of potable water down the sewer every year. Despite declining per capita fresh water availability, increasing frequency of municipal water rationing and the need to replace a large share of the country's aging wastewater infrastructure, there is little discussion as to how domestically we might transition to a sustainable sanitation future that reduces freshwater requirements and lowers energy costs. Waterless and composting toilets are niche technologies, marketed to ""ultra-green"" consumers and those living in remote locations. Indeed, the recycling of grey water, even for nonpotable uses such as watering landscapes, is still controversial in many places. Certainly, most people don't want to talk about poop, much less debate whether and how it might be recycled in their communities. But it is precisely this debate that is needed. We need to trigger sanitation innovations that can benefit citizens of wealthy and poor countries, and also instigate systems that help protect the resource base they depend on for development. Wouldn't that be something to celebrate?

"Atlanta (CNN) -- It began with scant details released by the military about a heinous allegation: A soldier slipped away from a remote outpost in southern Afghanistan and went on a shooting rampage at nearby villages that left 17 people dead. The questions were immediate: What was his name? What was he doing at the outpost? Where did the military take him? The answers from the American military were slower in coming, and the dearth of information fueled angry accusations by Afghans of a cover-up, with President Hamid Karzai at one point accusing the U.S. military of withholding details and refusing to cooperate with Afghan investigators. ""The U.S. military justice system is unfamiliar territory to most Americans. So we should be hardly surprised that Afghans view it with skepticism,"" said Eugene Fidell, a former judge advocate who teaches military justice at Yale Law School. Part of the issue is differing cultural and social practices. But the larger problem, Fidell and other legal experts say, is perceived missteps in a number of high-profile war crimes cases and the closed culture of the military itself have led to a lack of confidence -- whether justified or not -- in the military justice system. Critics are questioning the military's ability to conduct the transparent, speedy investigation demanded by Afghanistan in the case, which has roiled relations between the two countries and intensified the debate about withdrawing troops ahead of the 2014 deadline. One way to improve people's perception of the system, Fidell said, ""would be a greater transparency for some of the decision makers."" The military's blackout on details surrounding the Afghan case is typical of the lack of transparency. It was through media leaks the world first learned the identity of the accused soldier and that he had been whisked out of Afghanistan. The military initially refused to release the information, citing security concerns. Only after the leaks did the military confirm that Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, 38, was being held in connection with the killings. ""That's not the military justice system. That's some administrative decision unrelated to the justice system,"" said Gary D. Solis, a retired Marine Corps judge who teaches military justice at Georgetown University Law Center. Solis believes the military's actions were an attempt, ""however wrong-headed,"" to do the right thing. But it is that very attempt that has made it more difficult for the military. As it begins legal proceedings against Bales, the military is under the most intense scrutiny it has faced since soldiers were accused in 2004 of abusing Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison, and a squad of Marines were charged with killing two dozen civilians in Haditha, Iraq, in 2005. Eleven soldiers were court-martialed for their roles in Abu Ghraib, though only three received prison sentences of more than a year. In the Haditha case, charges were dropped, dismissed or reduced against all but one Marine, Sgt. Frank Wuterich, who was convicted of one count of dereliction of duty after a plea deal was reached in January in the case. In Afghanistan, the negative perception of the U.S. military has been exacerbated by a video that surfaced in January showing Marines urinating on the bodies of slain Afghans. The Marine Corps at the time said it would investigate the actions, and news reports last month indicated Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was briefed on the findings, but the Pentagon has yet to release any details. Cases like these define the U.S. military for many Afghans, said Sarah Holewinski, executive director of the Washington-based Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict. ""I was talking with Afghan officials a few weeks ago about how they view the U.S. military. They said they understood that the U.S. tries not to kill civilians, but all of them noted three things that stand out to them: Haditha, Abu Ghraib and urination on dead bodies,"" Holewinski said. ""It's a shame,"" she added, because the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force ""has gotten much better about civilian casualties, but these are incidents that civilians remember. And understandably so."" Fidell said Haditha, Abu Ghraib and other high-profile cases have a ""cumulative effect"" for the public, even though the cases are very different from one another. ""The mere fact that prominent cases are perceived to have several times fizzled or all but fizzled, it is not surprising that it leaves people in other countries less than fully nourished,"" he said. Attorney Colby Vokey, who participated in the defense of Wuterich, dismissed criticism in the United States and abroad that there is an appearance the military protects its own. ""The military will prosecute cases that nobody else will touch,"" said Vokey, a retired Marine lawyer who now works as a civilian defense attorney. ""There are no financial constraints, no political constraints. They are insulated from that."" At the same time, however, military courts are insulated from the transparency the public demands from state and federal courts. In civilian cases, everything from the police investigation to the naming of a suspect to the release of court transcripts is often available for public consumption. In the military, the same material is sometimes withheld because of operations or security concerns, though more often than not it's more a matter of the military's discretion. ""It's easy for those of us who have worked in the system to have a lot of confidence in the system. We're looking at it as insiders to our own system,"" said Victor M. Hansen, a retired Army judge advocate lawyer and vice president of the National Institute of Military Justice. Military justice is designed to be a tool for a commander to maintain good order in the ranks, Hansen said. It's the commander who will decide the charges, where a case will be tried and other details. The problem of perception arises, he said, when commanders do not explain ""their actions, their reasoning, their processes, their thoughts on a particular case."" ""That's a culture that's beyond military justice. That's a military culture,"" he said. Retired military judge Solis said it is that very reason that ""the mentality in the military"" must change so that clarity and transparency are viewed as a benefit rather than an obstacle. ""And yes, sometimes it means we are going to take our hits,"" he said.","The dearth of details from the military about the case is fueling Afghan anger .
Legal experts say the military needs to be more transparent with the case .

"(CNN) -- A man was arrested and charged in Thursday's deadly armored car robbery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, police said Saturday. Bank surveillance video shows a gunman in a yellow cap firing at armored-car guards. Mustafa Ali, 36, was charged with two counts of murder, robbery and other related offenses in the shooting deaths of two Loomis armored car guards and theft of cash at a bank ATM. Ali was picked up on Friday and questioned overnight before he was charged. Ali, who is not expected to get bail, was to have a preliminary arraignment within 24 hours. Police also seized his vehicle. The victims were identified as retired police officers Joseph Alullo, 50, and William Widmaier, 65. Each had more than 20 years on the force. Alullo retired in 2003 and Widmaier retired in 1999. A third guard was wounded in the robbery. The gunman took an undetermined amount of money, police said. They were searching for a man who fled the scene dressed in a black shirt and blue jeans with a yellow cap and traveling in a black Acura TL with tinted windows and a sunroof. The guards were attacked shortly after 8 a.m. as they were servicing an ATM outside a Wachovia Bank branch near Roosevelt Mall in northeast Philadelphia, police said. The gunman fired at two guards who were outside the armored car and at the third guard, who was inside.  Watch video images of the gunman at the scene » . The third guard was hurt by flying glass when a bullet shattered one of the vehicle's windows, said Mark Clark, a spokesman for Loomis, the company that owns the armored car. Police said they found an empty black duffel bag behind an off-track betting parlor near the scene of the crime that may have been taken from the armored car after the shootings. Several elementary schools in the area were briefly locked down after the incident. The nearby Roosevelt Mall was also shut. The bank branch is located near entrances to I-95 and I-76, either of which, police said, could have served as an escape route. Police were reviewing security tapes from the bank's cameras.

"(CNN) -- In spite of ever rising tuition and ballooning student loan debts, a large majority of students still desire to attend college. Traditional notions are deeply engrained in the public's mind. College is considered the path to a better, higher paying job, the best way to make connections and propel a career, and a status symbol, especially for those who go to elite universities. However, given the dismal reality facing college graduates, perhaps the future of higher education will have to change. In some cases, a college diploma may no longer guarantee the high potential lifetime earnings it once did. An online salary ranking system called PayScale.com calculates a student's 30-year return on investment at the top 1,300 colleges nationwide based on average alumni salary and tuition costs. Their recently issued 2012 report suggests that out of the 4,500 colleges and universities in the nation only the top 800 to 850 give you an annual return on investment greater than 4%. In pure financial terms, students might be better off investing their tuition money in stocks rather than four years with one of our nation's many colleges. But this does not stop an overwhelming number of students from paying an exorbitant amount of money or taking on huge amounts of debt in order to attend college. It seems like such conventional wisdom. ""A diploma wasn't a piece of paper. It was an amulet,"" as columnist Frank Bruni wrote in the New York Times. That may no longer be the case. A college degree does not hold the status and significance it once did. Recent data from the Census Bureau and Department of Labor found that almost 54% of recent graduates were unemployed or underemployed. As our world becomes more globally integrated and competitive, economic status now turns on many other things, like intellectual capital and skills training, things which colleges are supposed to instill, but many don't. According to a recent world economic study, about 10 million manufacturing jobs worldwide are going begging because of a lack of skilled workers. In the United States alone, at least 600,000 manufacturing jobs cannot be filled. Meanwhile, legions of arts and humanities majors occupy the unemployment rolls. Many students are ill prepared for the labor market, whether by fault of their own or by colleges and universities that are out of sync with the needs of a skilled work force. However, technology may just transform everything. Better, smarter, more adaptable and cheaper education will soon be available to all. Initiatives like the ED-X partnership between Harvard and MIT promise to give non-traditional students elements of a world-class education online, and for free. Coursera, recently founded by Stanford professor Andrew Ng, will offer not only free online courses, but also a great deal of individualized instruction in the form of grading, testing, student-to-student help and certificates of completion. What Salman Khan and his Khan Academy did for elementary and secondary education, offering world-class instruction online for free, will soon be replicated throughout academia. These new ventures will no doubt challenge the traditional four-year residential, physical university model. In the future, access to college may be nearly universal, with little or no tuition costs. We may be on the cusp of a higher education revolution. College may look very different 20, 10, or even five years from now. In the meantime, the national and kitchen table conversation over higher education should no longer be looked at in the isolation of student loans. It's time for parents and students to look at the entire enterprise of higher education and ask -- how, when, where, for whom, in what studies and at what cost is a college education appropriate? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: Despite costly tuition, most students still desire to go to college .

"(CNN) -- Two Missouri River levees broke Monday along the swollen Missouri River near the Iowa-Missouri border, a local official and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said. The first breach, which was some 300 feet wide and growing, was a ""full breach,"" the Army Corps of Engineers said in a statement. The break was in Atchison County, Missouri, just south of Hamburg, Iowa, it said. The National Weather Service warned that flooding could affect Interstate 29 and the town of Hamburg. ""The concern is that anybody ... near the river would see some floodwaters that could impact either their road or homes,"" said David Pearson with the National Weather Service in Omaha, Nebraska. The second breach was located just south of Atchison, in Holt County, Missouri, said Holt County clerk Kathy Kunkel. She said flooding was affecting farmland. A breach earlier this month prompted the evacuation of hundreds of people in the Hamburg area as a precaution. No evacuations were immediately recommended or ordered as a result of Monday's breaches, officials said. However, ""people's safety is our number one concern, so we want to stress how important it is for the public to stay off these levees as we continue to assess the risk,"" said Omaha Corps District Commander Col.

""The next step is to attempt to mitigate the flooding with another levee between the one that failed and Hamburg."" State and local emergency management officials were notified, the corps said, and were working with the corps, the National Weather Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It was too early to determine the cause of the breach near Hamburg, the corps said. But it follows weeks of high flows and record releases from dams in Montana and the Dakotas. Heavy rains and snowpack runoff could result in near-record flooding along parts of the Missouri this year, officials have said. This year's flooding is putting levees to the test along much of the 1,700 miles of the Missouri. Temporary levees are being built in several locations.

"(CNN) -- For a second straight day, President Barack Obama touted proposals from his State of the Union address at a campaign-style event outside of Washington, this time visiting a Georgia preschool where youngsters on a winter break showed up to mimic a regular day. Obama's visit to the College Heights Early Childhood Learning Center, in the city of Decatur just outside Atlanta, followed his call in Tuesday night's speech to Congress for investments in high-quality early childhood education programs. The president spent time in a classroom where he hugged some students -- who told him they saw him on television -- and praised the teachers he said were giving their students a boost into the educational system. ""This isn't baby-sitting,"" he said. Children who take prekindergarten classes are more likely to read at their grade level, graduate from high school and hold a job down the road -- but fewer than 30% of 4-year-olds are enrolled in prekindergarten programs like those at College Heights, he said. ""Hope is found in what works. This works. We know it works,"" he said. ""If you are looking for a good bang for your educational buck, this is it right here. That's why, even in times of tight budgets, states like Georgia and Oklahoma have worked to make a preschool slot available for nearly every parent who is looking for one for their child."" In the classroom, Obama sat in a small chair and helped children with tablet blocks at one table. He then moved to another to engage in a brief game of I Spy, peering at little faces through a magnifying glass. And he took a moment to warn the parents of the young children that ""they grow up to be, like, 5'10"" -- and even if they're still nice to you, they basically don't have a lot of time for you during the weekends."" ""They have sleepovers and dates,"" he said to laughter. ""So all that early investment just leads them to go away."" Friday, he will head to Chicago to continue his campaign for the main proposals of the State of the Union address, which emphasized themes of his re-election campaign last year, including equal opportunity and middle-class growth. On Wednesday, Obama toured an auto parts plant in Asheville, North Carolina, and urged Congress to support the jobs agenda in his address the night before. In Chicago, he'll speak about the economy and the city's rampant gun violence. Obama and congressional Democrats are locked in a fierce political debate with Republicans over government spending and federal deficits, with a showdown pending on mandatory spending cuts set to take effect March 1. In his State of the Union address and again Thursday, Obama said making an early commitment to education saves money later for local governments and boosts graduation rates. He also spotlighted studies showing children who attend preschool have lower teen pregnancy rates and are less prone to engage in violent crime. The Thursday stop required some scheduling changes at the school, which had yet to fully return from a winter holiday. Parents with children enrolled there received an e-mail this week with the offer of a ""one-day experience"" Thursday for the president's visit. ""This day would resemble a normal school day: same bus routes and times, same school beginning and end times, regular instructional day with the same staff, and breakfast and lunch offerings,"" the school's principal, Suzanne Kennedy, wrote. ""President Obama's visit promises to be an amazing opportunity for our students to expand their worlds and for Decatur to celebrate its exemplary teaching and learning."" The White House did not immediately respond to an inquiry for an explanation on the timing of the visit. Obama's emotional plea might lead to vote on guns .

"(CNN) -- Should you tell your kids? This is the question all of us are grappling with this morning. The horrific Newtown school shooting is inescapable on the news today, and will be for a while -- a constant thrum of horror in our hearts and our souls. But we're grown ups. We'll grieve and process and move on. Still that one nagging concern remains for many of us: Do we tell our kids what happened or not? If the news is a steady presence in your home, chances are they'll glom on to the fact that something is up. If we don't tell them and get the facts straight, they'll probably hear some version of the truth at school. But to tell them this? How? ""Adults like to have all the information and try to make sense of the horribleness. But for kids, it's too much,"" says Dr Gwenn O'Keeffe, pediatrician, author, health journalist, and CEO of Pediatrics Now. ""We have to balance our need to keep up with our need to protect our kids."" When will these school shootings stop? Bearing that in mind, O'Keeffe, a member of Parenting's Editorial Advisory Board, has a handful of tips on whether -- and how --- to talk to your children about what happened yesterday. The ages of your kids will drive whether, and what, you tell them about Newtown. ""The first rule of thumb, though, is never lie to your kids,"" says O'Keeffe. ""If they come home and ask you about it, no matter what age they are, tell them the truth. If they're 4 or 6 or 8 and they ask 'was there a school shooting and did people die?' Your answer has to be yes."" Then you reassure them. Tell them that their school is safe, that your community is different, that there are protections in place and it will never happen to them. ""Even if you're not sure that's true, you have to make sure that they believe it. They have to go to school every day."" How to help survivors of the Sandy Hook shooting . Ask your kids what they've heard. Even if they don't ask you about Newton, they do go to school with older kids. Children catch wind fairly quickly when something serious is up. Some kids will luck out and not hear anything at all. But the news flows like water -- it gets through cracks you don't even know are there. And facts get twisted on the playground. ""The only way you're going to know if your kids have heard something is if you ask them,"" says O'Keeffe. When they're as young as 4, don't bring it up. But a 7-year-old will possibly have heard something. Approach her during a quiet moment or at snack time, says O'Keeffe. Gingerly broach the topic. Say something like ""there's been a lot of talk in our country that about something that happened at a school in Connecticut that was very upsetting. Has anybody talked about that at school?"" If they haven't heard, let them know they can ask you anything they want. A Hurricane Sandy survivor, thankful for how much she still has . Remain calm. If you do tell them what happened, make sure you're coming from your calmest, most reassuring place. ""Don't overload them. Don't go on a whole speech about gun control or school safety,"" says O'Keeffe. And give them space. They're children and they may not know how to respond right away. They may look at you and go out of the room and do something else. Maybe they'll come back and ask questions later, maybe they won't. ""Allow them to have whatever response they have unless it's interfering with their ability to go through the day, it's all expected,"" says O'Keeffe. If the news is interfering with your kids or anyone in your family, ""seek help right away,"" O'Keeffe advises. This will usually manifest in a lot of anxiety and a lot of grief, anxiousness about the safety of their family. In more serious cases, physical symptoms could include headaches, stomach aches, inability to function as usual or a reluctance to go to school. ""This isn't something you'd want to wait out."" How to deal with nightmares . Monitor the media intake for everyone in the family. Even if you only watch CNN when the kids are in bed, there's the chance they may not be able to get to sleep and can hear the newscaster, the interviews. Coverage of events like this can range from incredibly tactful to incredibly sensational. Be aware of who is watching what around the home, says O'Keeffe. That goes for grown-ups too. ""You don't need to watch the news 24/7,"" she adds. ""That creates overanxiety in all of us. Resist that temptation. Go about your life. That's the best thing you can do to honor these people.""

"(CNN) -- China has relaxed its strict birth-control restrictions for families that lost children in a mudslide that killed hundreds in the northwest last year, state media reported Friday. Women in the Zhouqu area who underwent procedures to prevent further pregnancies such as having their fallopian tubes tied can now have a free reverse operation, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported. Liang Jianjun, head of Zhouqu's family planning bureau, said women from 27 families have had such operations. ""Some of these women are pregnant now,"" he is quoted as saying by Xinhua. China enforces a strict family-planning policy that limits most families in urban areas to only one child, although those in the countryside and certain ethnic areas are allowed more. In Zhouqu, rural families can have two children, while those in five Tibetan-dominated towns and villages can have three, Xinhua reported. The easing of government restrictions means families who lost children in the mudslide can now have more to fill the ""quotas,"" a government official told the news service. The mudslide in August last year left more than 1,700 people dead or missing in Zhouqu County, in northwestern Gansu province, Xinhua said. Thousands of homes collapsed or were damaged in the disaster, which followed weeks of heavy rains and flooding. China's three-decade-old population control policy is controversial. Some critics have urged Beijing to relax it, saying it has skewed China's population and that better-off families have been able to bribe officials into allowing them more children.","Restrictions are eased so families that lost children can have more, Xinhua says .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams once again battled through the pain barrier to advance at the Australian Open on Thursday, but this time the American third seed's injury was entirely self-inflicted. After rolling an ankle during her first round win the 15-time grand slam champion hit herself in the face with her racket as she brushed aside Spanish teenager Garbine Muguruza 6-2 6-0. It left her anxiously checking her mouth for damage. ""I think it happens to everyone, but I have never busted it wide open like that,"" the five-time Melbourne winner told reporters after setting up a third-round meeting with Japan's Ayumi Morita. ""So, yeah, I was like, 'Oh, no. I can't have a tooth fall out.' That would be horrible."" Williams allayed any fears her ankle would hinder her progress at the tournament, saying she felt no discomfort -- although she did take painkillers. ""I didn't feel anything today,"" the 31-year-old added. ""Obviously when you go out to play you're heavy on adrenaline and you're really pumped up. ""Usually I feel injuries after the match, but so far, so good. I felt pretty, much better than I ever dreamed of expecting to feel. ""I feel everybody in the tournament probably is on some sort of pain relief ... I don't do injections. Just tablets."" Williams remains on course for a semifinal showdown with world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka after the Belorussian took just 55 minutes to beat Greece's Eleni Daniilidou 6-1 6-0. If the top seed seemed like she was a woman in a hurry, it was because she was trying to avoid getting sunburned in the scorching Australian heat. ""I was trying to play fast,"" said the 23-year-old, who will play American Jamie Hampton in the third round. ""The first match I got a little bit sunburned. You don't want to make that mistake again. ""I was prepared for it, you know. I think everybody knew few days before that that it's going to be really hot. Even at 11 a.m. you could really feel it. I wasn't sure if we were playing with closed roof or open roof. ""Right before the match I saw it was closed. I thought, 'Wow, good.' It wouldn't be so hot. It wasn't a problem."" Eighth seed Petra Kvitova was stunned by world No. 53 Laura Robson, going down 2-6 6-3 11-9 in a match which lasted three hours at finished at 00:30 local time. Britain's Robson recovered from 0-3 down in the final set to reach the third round of the event for the first time, and she will next meet American 29th seed Sloane Stephens. Former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki continued her bid for a maiden grand slam title with a 6-1 6-4 defeat of Croatia's Donna Vekic. The Danish 10th seed's next opponent will be unseeded Ukrainian Lesia Tsurenko. Roberta Vinci has never been beyond the third round in Melbourne but the No. 16 from Italy will have a chance to address that against Russia's Elena Vesnina after recording a 6-3 6-2 victory over Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan. In the men's draw, second seed Roger Federer and world No. 3 Andy Murray both continued their strong starts to the tournament with emphatic victories. Switzerland's Federer, looking for an Open era-record fifth Melbourne triumph, was rarely troubled as he beat experienced Russian Nikolay Davydenko 6-3 6-4 6-4. Next up for the 17-time grand slam winner is Australian rising star Bernard Tomic, who Federer beat in the fourth round of last year's tournament. ""I think there's always excitement about Aussies playing here,"" Federer, 31, told reporters. ""I played him here last year. The crowd was great. I played him in Davis Cup. Crowds were fair there, too. I expect something similar. ""Hopefully we're going to live up to the expectations and live up to the match. Hopefully it's not going to be a bad match. I don't want that to happen."" Murray was beaten by Federer in the 2010 final, but having clinched his first grand slam title at last year's U.S. Open the Briton will be hoping to win in Melbourne having twice been a runner-up. He set up a third round encounter with Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis after a comfortable 6-2 6-2 6-4 win against Portugal's Joao Sousa. Sixth seed Juan Martin del Potro eased past German Benjamin Becker 6-2 6-4 6-2, while French seventh seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga battled to a straight-sets win over Japan's Go Soeda. Meanwhile, former world No. 1 Rafael Nadal will make his long-awaited return to action at the Chile Open in Vina del Mar early next month. Spain's 11-time grand slam winner has not played since injuring his knee at Wimbledon last June, and had to delay his planned comeback in Melbourne after suffering an illness in December. Nadal will also play in another South American clay-court tournament, the Brazil Open starting on February 11, as he seeks to regain fitness ahead of his French Open title defense.","Third seed Serena Williams wins despite hitting herself in the face with her racket .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 30 people were killed in Karachi on Monday night and Tuesday, the latest deaths in cycle of ethnic and political violence in Pakistan's commercial capital. On Sunday, 60 motorcycles and five vehicles were burned in the city, said Murtaza Ali, a Karachi police official. The violence has killed more than 1,000 people this year, according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. Nearly 200 people were slain in July alone. The rampant violence appears to have little to do with the Taliban and other Islamist extremist groups that are viewed by western leaders as Pakistan's most pressing security problem. Rather, police and government officials say the violence is fueled by bitter ethnic rivalries and political parties vying for power in this mega-melting pot, home to roughly 15 million people from at least a half-a-dozen ethnic groups. Three political parties are usually at the center of the fight for power in Karachi: the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), the Awami National Party (ANP), and Pakistan's People Party (PPP). The PPP, led by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, considers Karachi its political base, but politics here is dominated by the MQM, which represents ""muhajirs,"" the descendants of immigrants from India decades ago. In recent years, the MQM's power has been challenged by the ANP, a secular party that represents ethnic Pashtuns. Hundreds of thousands of ANP supporters have migrated south to Karachi because of the militant violence in their home region of northwest Pakistan. Analysts say a general lack of law and order has allowed supporters of these parties to adopt a gang mentality. Like gangs, the factions often control different regions of Karachi that are usually off-limits to rivals.","60 motorcycles were burned Sunday, police say .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Indian activist Anna Hazare began a public hunger strike in the country's capital Friday, accompanied by thousands of cheering supporters. The 74-year-old campaigner, who is seeking stronger anti-corruption measures in India, was greeted by crowds as he left a jailhouse in New Delhi earlier to make his way to the city's large Ramlila Grounds. He will stage the two-week protest there after police relaxed their conditions. Supporters say he began fasting while still in jail. Hazare traveled from the jail in an open-top truck decorated with Indian flags, as thousands of citizens marched along. Before arriving at Ramlila Grounds -- known mostly as a venue for massive political rallies, demonstrations and religious festivals -- the campaigner visited the shrine to Mahatma Gandhi, the man who led the nation's independence struggle, to pay homage. Flanked by admirers, he dropped petals and bowed at the memorial in a traditional Indian gesture of respect. Once at the rain-lashed Ramlila Grounds, Hazare sat on a makeshift podium with a large Gandhi backdrop as crowds carrying umbrellas hailed his arrival. Addressing the crowds, he called his campaign India's ""second fight for independence."" He said, ""We got independence in 1947 and the white (the British rulers) left our country. But there's no end to corruption, crime and looting. This is now our second fight for independence. Whether or not I live, this fight will go on."" Speaking earlier outside the jailhouse, dressed in his usual plain cotton attire, Hazare had also made references to India's freedom movement, with passionate cries of ""hail revolution and hail motherland."" His brief address at the gates of Tihar prison, from which he was officially released three days ago, was almost drowned out by the crowd's noise. Anti-corruption campaigners have rejected legislation prepared by the federal government to create a citizen ombudsman, saying the bill, now in Parliament, is too weak to tackle endemic graft in the system. Led by Hazare, they have been demanding a stronger institution that they say should be capable of tackling corruption Indians encounter in their daily lives. Supporters see the elderly anti-corruption crusader as a second Gandhi. His hunger strikes are also modelled after the protest mode Gandhi used in his movement against the colonial rule that ended in 1947. However, Indian leaders say Hazare's demands undermine democracy, through his use of a protest tactic Gandhi used in very different circumstances. ""I acknowledge that Shri (Mr.) Anna Hazare may be inspired by high ideals in his campaign to set up a strong and effective Lok Pal (citizen ombudsman),"" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told parliament on Wednesday. ""However, the path that he has chosen to impose his draft of a bill upon parliament is totally misconceived and fraught with grave consequences for our parliamentary democracy."" Hazare was sent to jail on Tuesday because he planned to stage his strike at a different public place without official permission, police said. But as support swelled for the activist, with thousands of people hitting the streets in Indian cities, authorities ordered his release within hours of his arrest. Yet, in a rare show of protest, he refused to depart the jail until police agreed to allow him to stage his hunger strike in the open air as planned. The protesters' call has sparked a debate in India over the role of democratic institutions. Hazare's arrest also prompted televised discussions over the right to protest.","NEW: Anna Hazare begins a hunger strike in front of big crowds in New Delhi .

"(CNN) -- After ""will-they-or-won't-they"" comes, ""what now?"" Over five seasons, viewers of ABC's ""Castle"" have gotten to know Richard Castle, a mystery writer paired up with Detective Kate Beckett, and they've solved one murder after another, all the while fans were hoping these two would finally get together. At the end of last season, they got their answer. After TV Guide readers voted them the favorite TV couple (not to mention the show placing in the top five favorites for CNN.com readers), it's clear that audiences are invested in just where the writers plan to take Castle and Beckett. CNN.com spoke with ""Castle's"" creator Andrew W. Marlowe to find out why this couple and this lighthearted show have struck such a chord in a dark TV landscape. Plus, we found out what's to come leading into this spring's 100th episode. CNN: How has this show evolved over five seasons? Marlowe: Any show evolves. Hopefully we've retained our core values. We've had two characters who were forced together and there was friction, and sparks flew. Of course, over time they got to know each other and a different story emerged -- this love story that's tentative and goes in fits and starts. It's been fun to mine that, but we've maintained the basic core of the show - delivering a great relationship story through the device of the procedural with fun, interesting cases at the heart of it. But over five years, your characters do have to grow and evolve, otherwise it doesn't stay fresh and it's not honest, it's not true. Since this was always supposed to be a ""will-they-won't-they"" romantic arc, the characters have to grow together, and go through the natural process of a courtship that everybody does. CNN: To what extent did you map out the course of the show's romance? Marlowe: Initially, you're always hopeful just to stay on the air, and once you're confident you'll stay on the air, you start to chart it out. It was always our intention to get these characters together eventually, but part of the fun is how can you keep them apart naturally? I didn't have a firm date [for the relationship to start] when we launched into it. You kind of feel your way through and see what the rhythm is and how the show is evolving. At a certain point I believe you start testing your viewers' patience when they have a vested interest in it. I've never believed in the ""curse of 'Moonlighting'"" or all those concerns people had about getting them together. CNN: Why do you think audiences love this couple and this show? Marlowe: Anybody who's been in a relationship understands the give and take. There's always some fun friction there. You're also attracted to the things you aren't, so the things that you love are sometimes the things that drive you crazy. In a universe of procedurals that are pretty dark, the fact that you can deal with this form in a more lighthearted way is a relief for people. After a hard day's work, you turn on ""Special Victims Unit,"" you're in the darkest place possible with people trying to solve this crime. I was getting to the point when I was conceiving this, thinking I don't want to bring that into the universe. I wanted to bring in something joyous even though we're dealing with murder. I go back to a show like ""M*A*S*H"" where it's life or death stakes in the operating room, but there's also that gallows humor and that humanity. Hopefully we're finding that tonal balance in ""Castle."" CNN: Has Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic's chemistry surprised you over the years? Marlowe: Nathan was generous enough to sit with us as we read 125 or 130 actresses. There was something special in the connection that he and Stana had. There was a tension that was fun and interesting -- it was that lightning in a bottle chemistry that you look for, and we were fortunate to get it. We were thrilled with what we had. CNN: What made Nathan right for the role? Marlowe: The reason I thought he would be good here is this would be a character that would allow him to play everything he's good at. This would allow him to be dramatic; this would allow him to be funny; this would allow him to be charming. The role is written to show the different aspects of what it means to be a man: to be a lover, a long suffering son, a tremendous father, a man's man, to hang out with the boys. The role is written to see all those facets. If we only saw him annoying Beckett, or the narcissism he has, he would come across as very unattractive. The nice thing about the show is we get to see all the facets of the diamond. CNN: What do you have coming up? Marlowe: We're currently working on the 100th episode, but we have some big storytelling before then. Traditionally we have a two-parter this time of year. Castle's daughter ends up being kidnapped and put into a very difficult situation. We play a lot of it from Castle's point of view, trying to get her back. It's a tremendous performance by Nathan. After the two-parter, we're doing a little nod to the horror genre, centered around a haunted videotape. Castle sees it and is convinced he's going to be dead in 48 hours. It's a ride; it's a lot of fun. We find out Ryan has a past going undercover in narcotics, and he ends up having to go undercover again. It turns out he's a very different person undercover. Later on this season, we have a murder where it looks like the only credible suspect is Bigfoot, which sends us on a Bigfoot hunt. We like to lean into the genre and end up with a real world explanation. For the 100th we wanted the quintessential 'Castle' show -- something that was fun, something with great Castle-Beckett stuff in it. We're really excited with the direction it's going in.","""Castle"" fans have hoped to see a romance between Richard Castle and Kate Beckett .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A South African military plane crashed in the mountains as it headed to an airport near the rural hometown of Nelson Mandela, authorities said Thursday. A military spokesman declined to comment on the plane's mission or the number of people aboard, but said rescuers are searching for survivors. Local media reported that the plane, which had taken off from a Pretoria airbase Wednesday night, was carrying a team of doctors responsible for the former president's health care. However, two sources close to Mandela said the passengers aboard the plane were not doctors for the anti-apartheid icon. Rescue crews found the wreckage around the Drakensberg mountains, but it is too early to tell what happened, said Siphiwe Dlamini, the spokesman for the defense department. It was headed to an airport in Mthatha, the spokesman said. The small town is about 20 miles (30 kilometers) from the Qunu village where Mandela now lives. Mandela, 94, has not appeared in public since the 2010 World Cup hosted by South Africa. The former president gets round-the-clock care after abdominal surgery this year and an acute respiratory infection in 2011. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate spent 27 years in prison for fighting against oppression of blacks in South Africa. He became the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed from prison. Despite his rare appearances, Mandela retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation.

"(CNN) -- American Airlines is making Karen O'Laughlin a little nervous. O'Laughlin, a longtime fan of the airline, already bought her American plane ticket to fly from St. Louis to New York to visit her grandsons next month. ""I choose American because it's a straight flight, no stops, and it's the right time, (but) I do have some angst about my flight being canceled,"" she said. Who wants to fly American? The troubled airline has been beset by labor troubles, delays and flight cancellations and, most recently, two aircraft that couldn't keep several seats in place. American, which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year, persuaded a judge to throw out its contract with the pilots union last month. Since then, the pilots have been engaging in what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket. Broken coffee pots and reading lights, torn seat pockets and precautionary maintenance checks that lead to nothing wrong: Those are some of the complaints by pilots that are slowing American flights, according to spokesman Bruce Hicks. American Airlines plane makes emergency landing . ""Clearly, our operation is nowhere near where we want it to be, where it has historically been and the kind of quality operation American Airlines runs day in and day out,"" Hicks told CNN in an interview two weeks ago. ""We are working as hard as we can to try and mitigate this and do all we can to resolve it. We certainly understand; we very much do apologize for any delay or cancellation that we have seen."" The solution, Hicks said, is for the pilots to stop their slowdown. The airline threatened last week to seek an injunction in court, if the pilots union doesn't ""take steps to end the disruption of American's operations by some pilots,"" according to a letter to the union from Denise Lynn, American's senior vice president/people. Customers are piling on . Stories of American employees making choices that upset their customers are starting to proliferate, possibly driving existing customers away. In his ""Friends Don't Let Friends Fly American Airlines"" blog post on Slate, Matthew Yglesias wrote of a delayed first flight turning into a missed connection because the pilot chose to leave rather than let a group of passengers on board two minutes before his scheduled departure time. At least that flight left on time. Gary Shteyngart described a trans-Atlantic flight that should have taken a few hours turning into a 30-hour Kafkaesque ordeal that included a stop in a third country. Aeroflot came off looking good in his absurdly humorous New York Times tale. Travel agents shying away . Travel agents say they can't count on American flights to depart -- or those that do depart to land on time. So they started directing their customers away from American after the troubled airline began canceling flights last month. In the past month, more than 1,000 American flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed. ""It's just getting too risky with the threat of probable cancellations on the horizon,"" said Jay Johnson, president of Coastline Travel Advisors, a Virtuoso travel agency in Garden Grove, California, that temporarily halted sales of American tickets until ""we have confidence that there will not be widespread cancellations."" ""It's an unfortunate situation, as we really don't have a lot of other options, especially to the Caribbean, where they dominate the market,"" he said. ""To be proactive, we are in the process of looking for alternative flights for those passengers who have booked refundable tickets."" Why did aircraft seats get loose? Passengers already feeling the bumpy impact of that labor dispute had another concern over the weekend when a row of seats dislodged during a flight and prompted an emergency landing, the airline said Monday. A Boeing 757 from Boston to Miami carrying 175 passengers diverted to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport on Saturday when three seats in row 12 came loose shortly after takeoff. A second American Boeing 757 returned to JFK on Monday morning after a similar seats issue was discovered. ""An initial internal investigation into why a row of seats became loose on two American Airlines Boeing 757s has indicated that there could be a possible issue with a certain model of seats and how they fit into the tracking used to secure the seats,"" the airline said in a statement. ""Out of an abundance of caution, American has decided to proactively reinspect eight 757s today that could possibly have this same issue. The seats were installed by American maintenance and contract maintenance. The issue does not seem to be tied to any one maintenance facility or one work group. ""This afternoon, the company flew engineers, tech crew chiefs and inspectors from its Tulsa maintenance base to New York to evaluate the aircraft and determine the next course of action to correct the problem."" The Allied Pilots Association, the largest independent pilot union and a certified collective bargaining agent for the 10,000 American pilots, said the interior overhaul of the Boston plane was performed by third-party maintenance workers, according to spokesman Gregg Overman.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A school bus loaded with children came under rocket and small arms fire near Peshawar Tuesday, killing the driver and three children and injuring 16 others, police said. The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan group claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the group's regional spokesman, Mohammad Talha, who said it was in response to growing support for local resistance groups against the Taliban in the region. Attackers fired a rocket at the bus and then opened fire. Three of the wounded children have serious injuries, according to Rahim Jan Afridi, chief executive at Lady Reading Hospital. The attack lasted about three minutes, said Naeem Khan, a teacher accompanying the students. Similar attacks have occurred recently in the area, as locals have put up resistance to the Taliban, said Sajjad Khan, a local police official. Talha said attacks on civilian targets would continue until residents end their resistance to the Taliban.

"(CNN) -- Pictures taken shortly after the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden show three men lying dead in pools of blood and the wreckage of a U.S. helicopter abandoned during the assault. One of the dead men bears a family resemblance to bin Laden, but there was no confirmation of his identity. The al Qaeda leader's adult son was among those killed in Monday's attack by U.S. commandos, according to American officials. The pictures were published Wednesday by Reuters. The news agency says they were taken by a Pakistani security official about an hour after U.S. forces left bin Laden's compound and that it is confident of the authenticity of the purchased images. Clad in a T-shirt, the man who resembles bin Laden lies in a large pool of blood that appears to spread from the back of his head. Two other men, dressed in Pakistani clothing, appear to have died from extensive head and chest wounds. Sources have named the courier who lived at the compound as al Qaeda veteran Sheikh Abu Ahmad -- a Kuwaiti citizen of Pakistani descent. Other photos, taken at dawn on Monday show the wreckage of the helicopter the U.S. Navy SEAL team had to leave behind after a crash-landing. Analysts believe it to be a stealth aircraft; the tail assembly is different from known helicopter types and could indicate some kind of previously unknown capability to avoid radar. A senior U.S. official tells CNN that a tail portion of the helicopter was not destroyed, and that, to the best of his knowledge, that wreckage remains in the hands of the Pakistani government. In particular, the tail features a cowling that might have been designed to reduce rotor noise levels, they said. Pakistan has already said that the helicopters used in the raid took advantage of blind spots in radar coverage to penetrate deep into its territory undetected.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Police detained about 40 gay-rights activists in Moscow on Sunday, alleging they attempted to hold an unauthorized demonstration during Moscow gay pride events, the police press service said. State-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that prominent gay rights activist Nikolai Alexeyev and several others were among those detained during an authorized picket near Moscow's city hall. ""The picket was devoted to the anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in Russia and was not sanctioned by the authorities,"" RIA Novosti said. Activists have held similar gay pride demonstrations in previous years, but usually disperse before police arrive, according to the news agency. Incumbent Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin and his predecessor, Yury Luzhkov, have both spoken against public gay-rights rallies, with Luzhkov calling them ""Satanic,"" according to RIA Novosti.

"London (CNN) -- Five centuries ago, King Richard III lost his life in the Battle of Bosworth -- the last king of England to die on the battlefield. Now, days after his long-lost remains were confirmed as those found beneath a parking lot, a new fight is shaping up: What city will get to be his final resting place? The dueling rivals to be the final resting place of the 15th-century king are the central England city of Leicester, where his body was disinterred, and York, in northern England. Richard III: My kingdom for a hashtag . The competition marks a significant change in the fortunes of the king long remembered -- thanks largely to William Shakespeare -- as a notorious villain, hunchbacked and hateful, accused of killing his own nephews, the ""Princes in the Tower,"" to usurp the throne. His unlikely exhumation from beneath the parking lot in Leicester, once the site of a church, Greyfriars Friary, has sparked calls for a revision of his murderous reputation and prompted global interest in his story. Amid the furor, the city of York, home to the breathtaking York Minster, has staked a claim to rebury him there on the grounds that Richard had strong local links. Read more: Is this the face that launched 1,000 myths? The last English king to die in battle, he was also the last monarch of the House of York, and as such holds a special place in the hearts of Yorkshire residents, the city council argues. The councilors plan to write to Queen Elizabeth II and the Ministry of Justice to press their city's claim. ""City of York Council and all its political leaders are united in the belief that York is the most fitting burial place for Richard III, one of the city's most famous and cherished sons,"" said Kersten England, chief executive of the council. Council archaeologist John Oxley argues that Leicester was ""certainly not where Richard wanted to be buried"" after his death in August 1485. Read more: Body found under parking lot is King Richard III . During his late teens and early 20s, Richard built up considerable property holdings in northern England, Oxley said, and the late king's son is believed to be buried in the small village of Sheriff Hutton, a few miles north of York. ""His links with Yorkshire and in particular with the City of York were deep and are well-documented,"" Oxley said of the erstwhile monarch. ""Throughout this period of time there was within the City of York well-articulated support for Richard. There is today within the contemporary city very strong support for Richard."" Richard III: The mystery of the king and the car parking lot . The City of York Council has gone back to the city's centuries-old archives to find evidence for that historic affection. Records from a city council meeting in August 1485 speak of ""grete (great) treason"" in the death of a king who had reigned ""mercifully"" over them. Richard, the document states in the late medieval English of the time, was ""pitiously slane and murdred to the grete hevynesse of this citie."" As a city archivist points out, these were strong words at a time when Henry Tudor had just taken the throne and would expect the loyalty of his subjects. An online petition submitted to the government is testament to the rather more contemporary support for Richard III. It already has more than 5,000 signatures -- though it would need to cross the 100,000 mark before it came to the attention of the House of Commons. Read more: Will Richard III discovery rewrite history? But Leicester is unlikely to give up its newly discovered king without a fight. A rival online petition calling for his reburial at Leicester's cathedral had garnered almost 2,000 signatures as of Wednesday afternoon. And local lawmaker Jon Ashworth pressed Justice Minister Chris Grayling on the issue in the House of Commons on Tuesday. ""Will the Minister confirm that under the terms of the licence, it is up to the university to decide what to do with the remains and that the university has handed them to Leicester cathedral and that Richard III will be buried there?"" he asked. Grayling, who declined to answer another lawmaker's question about possible outstanding parking fines incurred by the king, assured Ashworth that he hoped ""everyone will come together for a proper service to mark the occasion, and for a formal interment in the cathedral."" Opinion: Richard still the criminal king . Leicester City Mayor Peter Soulsby stated Monday that the king's remains would be reinterred at Leicester's St. Martin's Cathedral, just a stone's throw away from where the skeleton was discovered. And he also emphasized what may prove to be the chief obstacle to York's claims -- that the license granted by the Ministry of Justice to the team of experts who disinterred the monarch anticipates his reburial in Leicester. According to the mayor, the terms of the license state: ""The remains shall, no later than August 31, 2014, be deposited at Jewry Wall Museum or else be reinterred at St Martin's Cathedral, or in a burial ground in which interments may legally take place."" ""Having lain in the shadow of Leicester Cathedral for over 500 years, it is fitting that he should now finally be laid to rest here,"" Soulsby said of Richard III. The Jewry Wall Museum, only a short distance from the cathedral and the Greyfriars parking lot, houses medieval relics and ancient Roman ruins on its grounds. Speaking Tuesday in London, as a lifelike reconstruction of the monarch's head was revealed, the chairman of the Richard III Society said the design for a tomb would be revealed in the next couple of weeks. Chairman Dr. Phil Stone said that it was based on Richard's life and that a team of ""Ricardians,"" as people interested in rehabilitating his reputation are known, had been involved. The society has received two donations for the tomb so far, he said -- one worth 10,000 British pounds. The society, which believes the monarch has been unfairly maligned by history and in particular the Tudors who ousted him, backed the efforts to find Richard's remains, spearheaded by member and screenwriter Philippa Langley. Their dream came true when scientists announced Monday that DNA testing had established that the skeleton was indeed that of Richard III. CNN's Erin McLaughlin, Susannah Cullinane and Bryony Jones contributed to this report.","The city of York says it should be the final resting place for the remains of Richard III .

"(CNN) -- From the Arab Spring to a global economic crisis to the killing of Osama bin Laden, 2011 has been defined by historic and dynamic events that will shape the world in the years ahead. A revolt across the Middle East and North Africa began with the self-immolation of a struggling merchant in Tunisia and spread across the region. Egyptian protesters toppled the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak, and rebels in Libya battled against supporters of long-time strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Gadhafi was eventually killed in October after months on the run from rebel forces and NATO bombardments. The significance of the Arab Spring is indisputable, but was it the biggest story of the year? The earth shook off the coast of Japan in March, triggering one of the worst tsunamis in years, destroying nearly everything in its path and sending millions fleeing for high ground. Beyond the utter calamity from the 9.0-magnitude earthquake, Japan found itself dealing with the worst nuclear crisis since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility was knocked offline, resulting in a meltdown of three reactors, with radiation leaking into the air and contaminated water spilling into the sea. The long-term effects from the stricken plant remain unknown. Natural disasters hit the United States hard, too. The largest tornado outbreak ever recorded swept across across the South, Midwest and Northeast -- with a record 207 touching down on April 27 and killing 346 people. Alabama bore the brunt of the destruction, with a massive twister turning the college town of Tuscaloosa into a disaster zone. Three weeks later, a mile-wide tornado ripped through Joplin, Missouri, killing more than 150 people and wreaking havoc across the blue-collar town at the edge of the Ozark Mountains. It marked the deadliest single tornado in 60 years. From Washington to New York residents in August braced for Hurricane Irene, a powerful storm that forecasters feared would cause catastrophic damage. The storm weakened before landfall, but it still was blamed for at least 20 deaths in eight states. On the battlefield, Navy SEAL Team Six became part of American military lore when the elite unit raided a compound in Pakistan, killing Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda and the most-wanted terrorist in the world who had orchestrated the terror attacks of 9/11. For President Barack Obama, the bin Laden raid marked a high point of his presidency. Sometimes considered soft on terror, Obama achieved something his predecessor failed to do: bring the terror mastermind to justice. The killing came ahead of the 10-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, which was marked by the opening of several memorials, including an outdoor tribute at Ground Zero in New York. The United States also marked a decade of war in Afghanistan, a conflict that began in the months after 9/11 aimed at rooting out al Qaeda terrorists. While the Afghanistan war rages on, the United States is preparing to pull out the last of its troops from Iraq. The year also was defined by economic turmoil. Prime ministers in Greece and Italy quit amid a slow-motion fiscal disaster unfolding in Europe, while Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time after it said Congress failed to do enough to stabilize the country's debt situation. The downgrade, which came after an eleventh-hour agreement to raise the debt ceiling, damaged an already-stagnant economy. As the U.S. saw unemployment hit 9 percent, the Occupy Wall Street movement -- a grassroots protest against policies favoring the richest 1% -- spread to dozens of cities across the country and Europe. Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidates looked to seize their campaign to retake the White House in 2012. In October, former VP candidate Sarah Palin and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie disappointed supporters by saying they wouldn't run, and by early December the GOP field seemed to be down to two serious contenders: Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. In July, the world was reminded of man-made tragedy with near-simultaneous terror attacks in Norway. A car bomb exploded in Oslo targeting government buildings, while miles away, an armed man opened fire on a youth leadership camp, killing 77. Months earlier, Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot in the head as she met with constituents at a supermarket near Tucson, Arizona. Six people were killed in the attack, including a young girl and a federal judge. Giffords has awed the nation in her recovery. Married to astronaut Mark Kelly, the congresswoman traveled to Kennedy Space Center in May to watch as her husband commanded the final launch of space shuttle Endeavour. A few months later, NASA launched the final space shuttle mission, retiring the fleet of historic spacecraft after 30 years. The mission, STS-135, ended on July 21 when Atlantis arrived back at Kennedy. Other stories dominated the headlines, too. Casey Anthony was found not guilty in Florida in her daughter's death, while Conrad Murray was convicted in the death of superstar Michael Jackson. Charlie Sheen's raging narcissism captivated the nation for a couple weeks as his bizarre behavior prompted his TV bosses to fire him from ""Two and a Half Men"". Other bad boys popped into the news: Rep. Anthony Weiner of New York tweeted a picture of himself in his underwear and soon was forced to resign, and Maria Shriver filed for divorce from Arnold Schwarzenegger after a family housekeeper came forward about her love child with the former California governor. Scandal struck far and wide in 2011. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, once seen as a future leader of France, quit as head of the International Monetary Fund after he was accused of sexually assaulting a hotel housekeeper in New York -- a charge that was later dropped. British tabloids run by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch were hit by a phone hacking scandal that resulted in the flagship News of the World folding. In the United States, child sex abuse scandals tainted athletics programs at Penn State and Syracuse universities basketball team. Jerry Sandusky, a former Penn State assistant football coach, was charged with multiple counts of sex abuse against children, and legendary head coach Joe Paterno was fired in the scandal's aftermath. In Syracuse, assistant basketball coach Bernie Fine was fired after three people, including two former ball boys, said he molested them for years. No charges have been filed against Fine, but multiple investigations have been launched. Yet not all news was bad in 2011. The world got a brief respite from doom-and-gloom headlines in April when Prince William and Catherine Middleton wed at Westminster Abbey. Their wedding was one of the most-watched events of the year -- from TV to the Internet. On the streets of London, many captured royal images on their mobile devices and instantly shared them with friends. Some of those images might never have been shared if it hadn't have been for the creator of the iPhone: Apple founder Steve Jobs, the genius who led the home computer revolution and inspired some the world's most popular mobile devices. Jobs died of pancreatic cancer in October. His final words, according to his sister, were ""Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow!"" Fitting words for 2011.","Arab Spring, economy, Japan quake, bin Laden raid define 2011 news events .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greece is set to press ahead with new taxes, public-sector job cuts and the sale of everything from airports to gaming licenses after Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou narrowly survived a confidence vote early Wednesday. Papandreou is planning to cut 150,000 government jobs, slash the salaries of those who keep their posts, and slap new taxes on property, yachts and swimming pools. He's trying to win confidence from international lenders in order to get a second bailout package to keep the government from defaulting on debts. But the austerity package is very unpopular. Weeks of protests forced Papandreou to shuffle his cabinet last week, leading to the confidence vote, which he won 155-143. European markets were slightly down Wednesday morning, though it was not clear if that was in response to the Greek vote. International lenders have demanded Greece cut spending, lay off public workers, increase taxes and raise 50 billion euros ($71 billion) through selling off state-owned enterprises in exchange for another bailout deal for the cash-strapped nation. Analysts warn that a Greek default could cripple the euro, the European Union's common currency, and send shock waves throughout the world economy. ""If Greece were to default, I think the idea that you could contain that would be fanciful,"" former British finance minister Alistair Darling told CNN Wednesday. ""It's a bit like saying, 'Let's let Lehman's go bust again and wait and see what happens,"" he said, referring to the investment bank that collapsed in 2008, adding fuel to the global recession. An acute crisis in Greece would lead to a chain effect that ""probably wouldn't stop in Europe,"" he warned. ""It would have a feedback to American banks and so on."" Greek lawmakers are slated to vote on the privatization plan and further tax increases, pension cuts and layoffs on June 30, and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso warned Greece risks being abandoned by both Europe and the International Monetary Fund if it fails to act. ""There is no alternative to this program. Let's face it,"" Barroso told CNN on Tuesday. ""And that's why it has to be clear. We need Greece to deliver, and if Greece wants this program of support, Europe is ready to support it."" Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said Tuesday he was encouraged by support he received from main opposition leader Antonis Samaras on the austerity plan, which Venizelos said he would take to Eurogroup ministers July 3. Harsh reforms designed to help reduce Greece's enormous budget deficit have so far led to tax hikes and public-sector job losses alongside already record-high unemployment. Papandreou faces opposition from within his own ruling socialists over the austerity measures. Airports, highways and state-owned companies as well as banks, real estate and gaming licenses will all go on the auction block. On June 9, the Cabinet approved a tough five-year plan for 2011-15 and introduced a bill in Parliament to put austerity measures into effect. The government proposes reducing the public-sector workforce by 150,000; workers will also face changes in working hours, practices and wages, and the plan also sets out changes to social benefits, including pensions and unemployment aid. Protests against those plans turned violent June 15 as demonstrators threw gasoline bombs at the Finance Ministry and police fired tear gas at protesters, police said. But Papandreou did not change course, telling lawmakers over the weekend, ""The government must stop spending more than it takes in."" According to the Finance Ministry, these measures will help achieve 28.3 billion euros ($40.5 billion) in cuts from 2012 to 2015 and shrink Greece's public deficit to less than 3% of gross domestic product, in accordance with the EU target. CNN's Diana Magnay and Richard Allen Greene and journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","Papandreou's government survives a confidence vote .

"(CNN) -- Family members of the deposed Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali are reportedly in Canada, a development now being denounced by some in the Tunisian community there. French-language media in Canada first reported that as many as 10 members of the Ben Ali family arrived in Montreal by private jet on Thursday. Canadian Immigration Minister Jason Kenney seemed to confirm their arrival by pointing out that some members of the Ben Ali family have permanent residency status in Canada and therefore have the legal right to enter and stay without a visa. Privacy legislation does not allow the government to disclose who is in the country. But Canadian officials also stressed to CNN that Canada would not become a refuge for Ben Ali or his family. ""Mr. Ben Ali, deposed members of the former Tunisian regime and their immediate families are not welcome in Canada. Visas are only issued by our officers when they are satisfied that the individual will leave Canada once the visa expires. Given that members of the regime cannot return to Tunisia, that would be a challenge."" said Melanie Carkner, a spokesperson for Citizenship and Immigration Canada. Permanent residency in Canada can be revoked if it is determined that a person falsely represented themselves, committed fraud or concealed material circumstances when they applied for citizenship or permanent residency. Still, the fact that members of Ben Ali's family, possibly including his daughter and son-in-law, may have the legal right to stay in Canada did not sit well with some members of the Tunisian expatriate community. A Tunisian business leader in Montreal who declined to be identified told CNN he believed it was time the Canadian government took a tougher stand with Ben Ali's extended family. ""Even permanent residents shouldn't be protected if they are criminals. And Canada needs to investigate their affairs here. What about freezing their assets?"" There are reports in Canada that the former president's daughter, Nesrine, and her husband, Sakhr El Materi, still own a Montreal mansion that they acquired in 2008 for more than $2 million. CNN could not confirm that the couple still own the property. In an e-mail, Canada's Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed to CNN that there are a range of options that allow for assets to be frozen, including through the United Nations, or at the request of a foreign government. ""If there is evidence that assets exist in this country, or if they were acquired illegally, our government will act."" said Lynn Meahan, press secretary to Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon. On Monday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy stressed that his country would track down any assets in France that were stolen during Ben Ali's time in power and return them to Tunisians. A prosecutor in Paris also confirmed that the country was opening an investigation into Ben Ali's French assets.","Canadian media report Tunisian ex-president's family in town .

"(CNN) -- Nearly five years into its war against drug cartels, Mexico on Wednesday was rebuked by a human rights organization that found a pattern of abuses by security forces. Human Rights Watch released a report based on interviews with victims, government officials and documents, concluding that the military and federal police offensive has resulted in a growing number of human rights violations that are not investigated adequately. Mexican President Felipe Calderon deployed the first of more than 45,000 troops in 2006 to combat drug cartel violence, but, according to Human Rights Watch, instead of solving the problem, it has ""exacerbated a climate of violence, lawlessness, and fear in many parts of the country."" The human rights organization conducted its research in five states in distinct parts of Mexico affected by the drug violence -- Baja California, Chihuahua, Guerrero, Nuevo Leon and Tabasco. So the study included hot spots like Ciudad Juarez, which is in Chihuahua, while excluding other fronts in the drug wars, like Sinaloa or the border state of Tamaulipas. In short, the organization found in those five states more than 170 cases where there was evidence of torture, 39 ""disappearances"" with evidence suggesting the involvement of security forces, and evidence of 24 cases of extrajudicial killings. The pattern that emerges, according to Human Rights Watch, is that these are not isolated acts, but rather ""examples of abusive practices endemic to the current public security strategy."" Likely aware of the upcoming report, Mexico's Defense Ministry last week gave a robust defense of its record and self-policing ability with the announcement of the convictions of 14 servicemen, including two officers for homicide. A military tribunal found the soldiers guilty in the 2007 shooting deaths of five people at a military checkpoint in Sinaloa. The Defense Ministry, known as SEDENA, said its army is ""always ensuring adherence to the law, observing human rights, and in those cases where there is a presumed violation of individual rights, the start of investigations to find the responsible party."" Since the beginning of the campaign, SEDENA has kept a constant open channel of communication with Mexico's National Commission on Human Rights, the ministry said. During that time, 89 complaints against the military resulted in recommendations to SEDENA by the human rights body, the ministry said. ""That is, only 1.53% of all the complaints"" filed have resulted in action by the human rights commission, the ministry said. But Human Rights Watch found something more pervasive. In the more than 170 torture cases it found, the tactic was mostly used to extract information about organized crime and to elicit confessions, the organization said. Common types of torture recorded included beating, asphyxiation with plastic bags, waterboarding, electric shocks, sexual torture and death threats,"" the organization said. In the case of the 39 disappearances, Human Rights Watch depended on the testimony of witnesses who saw people being taken by security forces, but who state officials deny arresting or ever having in custody. In one of several testimonies gathered by Human Rights Watch, a widow tells of how she; her husband, Arnulfo Antunez, 37; and two children were driving in Ciudad Juarez last year when they were pulled over by federal police. According to the wife, the police yanked Antunez out of the car ""in a bad way"" and then went to the couple's home, which they ransacked. According to the organization, the police tore the place up and left with documents. The wife filed complaints with several state and federal police bodies, providing the plate numbers of the police cars that took her husband. Two weeks later, Antunez's body was found in an abandoned house, with syringes around his body. Human Rights Watch said that while it looked like an overdose, examinations showed that Antunez had died from blows to the head; prosecutors dragged their feet on the investigation; and to date, there is no progress in the investigation. This was an example of the 24 suspected cases of extrajudicial killings carried out by security forces, according to the organization. In all, the group conducted more than 200 interviews with government officials, security forces, victims, witnesses, human rights defenders and others. The report also criticized Calderon for generalizing that the majority of victims were involved in organized crime themselves. Calderon has said that up to 90% of victims had ties to the drug underworld, but Human Rights Watch found that figure to be unreliable. Among the report's recommendations, it suggests ensuring civil trials for all alleged military misconduct and enforcing due process to guarantee detainee rights. Eric Rojo, a security analyst, said the report's findings are not surprising. ""You cannot have 45,000 soldiers around the country, fighting this battle, and claim that there are no violations of any kind. That would be impossible,"" he said. However, he said, the organization falls short of proving its allegations. ""The thing I find interesting is that (in) all of these years, Human Rights Watch has yet to raise a human rights violation against the Zetas, the Gulf Cartel, the Sinaloa Cartel, the Juarez Cartel and all of these people who have violated the human rights of many thousands of Mexicans, a large number of which are dead by their own hands,"" he said. CNN's Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","A new report says Mexican security forces are behind some abuses .

"Berlin (CNN) -- Germany's parliament voted Thursday to increase the powers of Europe's bailout fund, as Greece's debt woes fuel fears of a wider financial crisis. The vote passed by a large majority -- 523 in favor to 85 against, with three abstentions -- which should boost confidence in European markets. Expansion of the European Financial Stability Facility -- Europe's bailout fund -- so it can increase its lending capacity from around â‚¬250 billion to â‚¬440 billion must be ratified by a number of European countries. Germany's parliamentary approval follows votes in favor this week from Austria and Finland. But the vote in Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, was seen as particularly crucial because it is the eurozone's biggest economy, and its Chancellor Angela Merkel is a key figure in attempts to pull the bloc out of its crisis. The bailout fund is being increased after the initial fund, which was put in place after Greece's â‚¬110 billion bail out last May, was tapped by Ireland and Portugal, before Greece returned for more help. The original fund was meant to stem the crisis but this has not happened. Instead, the crisis has intensified, feeding global instability and driving the eurozone to the edge of recession. The new powers will allow the fund also to buy sovereign bonds in the capital markets, a strategy designed to prop up debt prices and help struggling eurozone countries fund themselves. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Rick Noack and Irene Chapple contributed to this report.","Germany's lawmakers passed the measure by a large majority .

"(CNN) -- Q: This week the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued preliminary guidelines for ovarian cancer screening. It recommends against routine screening saying that the risk of false positive diagnoses outweighs the benefits. How can this be and why is it so hard to find a good screening test for ovarian cancer? A: The U,S. Preventive Services Task Force is a group of medical experts who assess the scientific literature on an issue, such as ovarian cancer screening, before making a recommendation. They do influence how doctors practice medicine. The statement recommends against routine ovarian cancer screening because they find the evidence of harm associated with screening is greater than the evidence of benefit. Unfortunately we do not have a good screening test for ovarian cancer, the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women. We need something as effective for ovarian cancer screening as pap smears are for cervix cancer screening. It is a surprise to many that a screening test could be considered more harmful than helpful. The problem is routine ovarian cancer screening starts a cavalcade of medical procedures associated with harms that are greater than the ultimate benefits. Importantly, it is not that there is no benefit to ovarian cancer screening. The problem is there is not a ""net benefit."" The blood test CA 125 is elevated in about half of women who are known to have ovarian cancer. If effectively treated by surgery or chemotherapy, the CA 125 level in the blood goes down. It has been used for nearly three decades to follow progress in treatment. This test was suggested for screening in the late 1980s. Screening is doing a test in asymptomatic patients who are not suspected of having the disease but are at risk because of age and gender. Very early on, many thought CA 125 would not work well as a screening test. A teacher gave me this example more than 20 years ago and it still holds. It is dense in numbers, but I think it is followable. It illustrates how a public health physician thinks of a screening test and the trouble with CA 125. A group of investigators tested the CA 125 blood test for screening in a group of 915 women average age 55, and a total of 36 or 3.9% were abnormal (a level greater than 35 U/ml). These women were evaluated for ovarian cancer and followed. Ultimately none had ovarian cancer. What if one was to screen 100,000 women? That means 3.9% of the 100,000 or 3,900 women will have false positive findings. Using U.S. cancer incidence data, 13 women in the 100,000 would have ovarian cancer in a given year. Given that most of the 13 women will be diagnosed with incurable advanced ovarian cancer, a fair assumption is six of the 3,900 will be diagnosed with a potentially curable ovarian cancer. Given that CA 125 is positive in half of ovarian cancer patients, one would reasonably estimate that three of the six women with curable disease would be identified. That is three potential cures in the more than 3,900 women screened. Of the 100,000 women, we expect 148 will die of cancer and nine of the 148 will be die because of ovarian cancer within a year of the screen. That might sound worthwhile at face value, but lets look at the harms of screening. Most of the 3,900 women will get further testing. This consists mostly of ultrasounds and CAT scans. Several hundred will need to get laparoscopy or more invasive abdominal surgery for evaluation. This is the area of greatest concern. One survey shows 14% of women over the age of 65 have complications after abdominal surgery. Surgical complications cause death in 1% to 2% of women over 65 and one-half of 1% of women over 50, Several hundred women will get abdominal surgery. When done as a routine test it is quite easy to see that ovarian cancer screening could actually cause the death of more women than the number of women saved. Most of the women who have bad outcomes will not have ovarian cancer. The gold standard for proving effectiveness of a screening test is a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing a screened group to a group that is not screened over time. The U.S. National Cancer Institute began such a study in 1993 and published the result in 2011. The trial included 78,216 women aged 55 to 74. It randomly assigned 39,105 to screening and 39,111 to usual care. After an average of more than 12 years of follow-up, the groups had no difference in the ovarian cancer death rate. This means that the trial showed no evidence of routine screening saving lives. CA 125 is not a good test for ovarian cancer screening, and ovarian cancer may not be a good cancer for screening. What we need is a test that flags fewer people who do not have the disease as suspicious of having the disease. It would be even better if the test found more than half of the women who have the disease. Screening also works better in cancers that tend to stay localized for longer periods of time. Many ovarian cancers spread throughout the abdomen very early in the life of the cancer when the tumor is still very small. It is important to note that the task force addressed routine screening. The test can be appropriate for screening a woman known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer because of a family history. The test may also be appropriate in assessing a woman who has lower abdominal discomforts.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons attacked and destroyed at least 22 oil tankers parked in Pakistan, carrying fuel for NATO troops in Afghanistan, a senior Pakistani police official told CNN. At least seven militants on motorcycles took part in Thursday night's attack, said police official Hamid Shakeel. All seven escaped the scene, he said. The attack took place at a terminal just outside of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, where the trucks had been parked since November 26, Shakeel said. On November 26, the Pakistani government shut down both NATO supply routes through Pakistan to Afghanistan in protest of a NATO airstrike that had killed 24 Pakistani soldiers earlier in the day. The airstrike was the latest blow to an already stormy partnership between the United States and Pakistan and plunged relations into perhaps the worst crisis since the two countries agreed to join forces in the fight against Islamist militancy after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Roughly 40% of supplies for NATO forces in Afghanistan travel through Pakistan. During the past two years militants have increasingly targeted NATO tankers and supply trucks in an attempt to disrupt two key supply routes and undermine the NATO mission in neighboring Afghanistan. The attacks have forced NATO to increasingly use alternative routes through central Asia. Police said there were no reports of any injuries immediately after the attack.","Police say 7 militants on motorcycles attacked the parked oil tankers Thursday night .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama on Sunday praised the ""historic"" House vote to pass a bill overhauling the nation's ailing health care system, and said now it is time for the Senate to ""take the baton"" and complete its work. The House passed its health care bill late Saturday night by a 220-215 vote, with 39 Democrats in opposition and one Republican supporting it. Senate approval is considered less certain due to opposition by all Republicans and some moderate Democrats. Obama called the support by many House members ""courageous"" in the face of what he called ""the heated and often misleading rhetoric around this legislation."" The overhaul legislation would be the biggest expansion of health care coverage since Medicare was created more than 40 years ago. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, or H.R. 3962, restricts insurance companies from denying coverage to anyone with a pre-existing condition or charging higher premiums based on gender or medical history. It also provides federal subsidies to those who cannot afford health insurance. And it guarantees coverage for 96 percent of Americans, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada last week indicated uncertainty over whether that will happen this year. Obama said Sunday morning at the White House that he was ""absolutely confident"" the Senate will follow suit in passing its version of the bill. Once both chambers have passed a bill, a congressional conference committee will merge the two proposals into a consensus version that would require final approval from each chamber and Obama's signature. However, Republicans and an independent senator who sits with the Democratic caucus signaled Sunday that difficulties remain for Obama on his top domestic priority. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, reiterated he would join a Republican filibuster against a health care bill if it contains a government-run public health insurance option following the chamber's amendment process. Speaking on ""FOX News Sunday,"" Lieberman called the controversial public option, which is in the House bill and the Senate version being prepared by Reid, an unnecessary provision intended to bring government-run health insurance in the future. ""If the public option is in there, as a matter of conscience, I will not allow the bill to come to a final vote,"" Lieberman said. He previously has said he won't oppose opening Senate debate on the bill despite the public option provision, and he maintained that stance Sunday. Lieberman's stance is crucial because the Democratic caucus has the minimum 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster. Senate Republicans unanimously oppose the public option, though Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine has floated the possible compromise idea of a trigger mechanism that would mandate a public option in the future if thresholds for expanded coverage and lower costs go unmet. The lone House Republican who supported the bill, Rep. Anh ""Joseph"" Cao, told CNN on Sunday he put the needs of his district over the desire of his party. Cao's ""yes"" vote ended up being unnecessary for House passage, but gave House Speaker Nancy Pelosi license to tout bipartisan support for the controversial measure. ""I felt last night's decision was the proper decision for my district even though it was not the popular decision for my party,"" said Cao, a first-term representative from Louisiana's traditionally Democratic 2nd District. ""A lot of my constituents are uninsured, a lot of them are poor. It was the right decision for the people of my district."" Cao acknowledged he extracted some White House pledges to help his district deal with the continuing impact of Hurricane Katrina in exchange for his vote. Asked about the reaction of fellow Republicans, Cao said the party's leaders ""respect my decision, and I respect theirs."" Also Sunday, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, the chamber's third-ranking Republican, said on the FOX program that Democrats were ignoring the wishes of the American public by pushing through the huge health care bill. Pence claimed the health care bill would raise costs, increase the deficit and lead to a government takeover of the health care system. ""I think the American people are deeply frustrated with the liberal establishment in Washington,"" Pence said. ""If Democrats keep ignoring the American people, their party's going to be history."" Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland responded on the same show that the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office reported the House bill would reduce the deficit. Van Hollen chided Republicans for failing to confront rising health care costs that harmed the U.S. economy during the years the GOP controlled the White House and Congress. ""We've had a great system for insurance companies,"" Van Hollen said, citing large industry profits while Americans face practices he called unfair, such as having coverage denied for pre-existing conditions. ""This is a message to the American people; we're trying to bring down your costs to help more Americans afford health insurance."" The House vote less than an hour before midnight Saturday was full of drama. With eight seconds left in the voting period, Democrats began counting down and erupted in roars when Pelosi declared, ""The bill is passed"" and banged the gavel. Read the House bill (PDF) Republican lawmakers stood silently across the floor, some with their arms folded across their chests. ""Well, it was about what I thought it would be,"" said House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio as he quickly exited. Later, he issued a statement saying the $1.2 trillion legislation would add to the country's ""skyrocketing"" debt. ""I came here to renew the American Dream, so my kids and their kids have the same opportunities I had,"" Boehner said. ""I came here to fight big-government monstrosities like this bill that dim the light of freedom and diminish opportunity for future generations."" Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, also released a statement. ""Nancy Pelosi and her liberal lieutenants made a lot of promises today to get the votes they desperately needed,"" he said. ""Make no mistake -- the Democrat leadership's assurances were based on political expediency, not principle. Anyone receiving a promise from Pelosi is guaranteed to be disappointed in the end when their votes are no longer needed."" Earlier in the day, Obama met behind closed doors with Democrats to shore up support for the bill, calling it the chance of a generation. In the run-up to the vote, Republicans and conservative Democrats joined forces to pass an amendment to the bill to prohibit federal funds for abortion services. It was considered a big win for them and for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which used its power -- especially with conservative Democrats in swing congressional districts -- to help force Democratic leaders to permit a vote on the amendment. The prohibition, introduced by Democratic members, including Rep. Brad Ellsworth of Indiana and Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan, would exclude cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger. The GOP accounted for 174 of the votes in favor of the amendment, with one Republican voting ""present."" On the Democrats' side, 64 voted for the measure, and 194 voted against. CNN's Shirley Hung, Brianna Keilar, Deirdre Walsh, Lisa Desjardins and Elaine Quijano contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama calls support by House members ""courageous""

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The death toll from the worst floods in half a century to hit Thailand continues to rise. By early Sunday morning, the number stood at 297 from two months of lashing rain, with more than 8.5 million in 61 provinces affected by the rising waters, authorities said. More rain was predicted for Sunday in some provinces and in the capital city, Bangkok. In the ancient city of Ayutthara, one of the worst-hit regions, military trucks moved slowly down the main street, cutting through a constant river of water, passing out aid to those who can get close. Anyone with a boat used it to transport aid or to help neighbors carry their possessions from flooded houses. Others used rubber tires of slabs of Styrofoam. In Bangkok, crews worked feverishly, widening canals and strengthening flood barriers to protect the city. ""I have to say here that there is a lot of water coming to Bangkok but the situation not critical yet,"" said Bangkok Governor Sukhumbhand Paribatra. Asia's wet and wild summer explained . The Bangkok suburb of Sam Kok is sandwiched between the overflowing Chao Phraya River and the 2.5-meter floodwalls that are so far successfully protecting the inner and commercial part of the capital. The water here has nowhere to go and levels are rising fast. ""In one or two days (flood waters) will pass through Bangkok, but the fact is that the impact of such flow would be less if the water was allowed to pass through, rather than concentrated in one area,"" the Flood Relief Operations Command said Sunday. Floods are an annual occurrence in the country but it has been particularly acute this year. Thais across the country are donating food, water and clothing to help the worst-hit areas. Authorities said donations have far surpassed previous years. The government said that it has received $2.07 million in donations, including from other countries, by Sunday. The United States said it is sending 26 helicopters to help the relief effort, invaluable as more roads turn to rivers and become impassable. United Nations agencies also are on standby, while the activating the World Health Organization has offered emergency health kits.

"(CNN) -- The Euro crisis is not just a Greek crisis, or an Italian crisis, or now even a French crisis. It is an American crisis, too, a crisis that may thrust the U.S. economy back into recession in 2012. If the Euro cracks up, many European banks who hold Euro-denominated bonds will discover that their bonds have lost value. The bonds won't fall to zero (hold on a second for the reason why not), but they will lose enough value to play havoc with the bondholders' capital. The banks will then either have to seek government help or stop their lending to businesses and consumers or both. The bank crisis will translate into a severe Europe-wide recession, just as the U.S. financial crisis of 2008 created a severe recession in 2009. Recessions that originate in the financial system cause more suffering and last longer than other kinds of recessions, a record painstakingly (and painfully!) documented by Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart in their now-classic study, ""This Time It's Different."" The European Union represents a bigger economy even than the United States. If the euro cracks, and euro-holding banks fails, the pain will cross the Atlantic, as the pain of the U.S. crash of 2008 crossed the Atlantic in the opposite direction. European financial institutions may lose the ability to repay U.S. creditors, inflicting more losses on an already traumatized U.S. financial system. Collectively, the eurozone countries are far and away the largest foreign investor in the United States. If the eurozone economies slump, Americans will find it harder to raise capital for new projects and businesses. As a single economy, the EU is America's largest trading partner. If it buys less, American exporters will suffer. This catastrophe could erupt almost literally at any minute. The United States is not helpless to avert this crisis. In fact, the United States could play an important role to avert the crisis, not only with money (although money may be needed), but also by standing with those Europeans willing to run the political risks to address the crisis. But the indispensable first step is to understand the crisis. Many Americans perceive the euro crisis as a crisis of government deficits and government debt. That may have been true of Greece, but it's certainly not true of France, the latest eurozone country to come under pressure in the financial markets. The German public debt is actually slightly larger than the French public debt, yet it is French bonds that the market is selling off. Why? If the euro cracks up, each country in Europe will be forced to (re)create a new currency of its own. In such a world, German bonds would probably rise in value, while French bonds would probably fall quite sharply. As the markets become more anxious that the euro may fail, they exert pressures that help rip the euro apart. Let me present some very simplified math, using made-up numbers, just to help explain the idea. Imagine you were to buy a German bond worth 1,000 euros. That bond now pays interest of 20 euros a year, equivalent (let us say) to $30 U.S. The crisis hits. The euro cracks up. Germany creates a new deutschemark equal to 1 euro. Your 1,000 euro bond is now a 1,000 new DM bond, paying 20 new DM a year. But because the euro implicitly undervalued German currency, it is highly likely that the new DM will rapidly appreciate against the dollar. In that case, your interest payment of 20 new DM would soon buy more dollars than your old interest payment of 20 euros. Result: You are very happy to own German debt, despite the fact that Germany's total debt equals 83% of GDP. Now imagine you were to buy a French bond worth 1,000 euros. That bond currently pays interest of 30 euros a year, equivalent to (say) $45. But if the euro were to crack up, and France were to adopt a new French franc, that franc would probably decline against the dollar, because the current euro arrangement implicitly overvalues French currency. Instead of buying $45, your interest payment of 30 new francs might be worth only $30, perhaps even less. Result: You are increasingly nervous about holding French debt, despite the fact that France's total debt equals only 82% of GDP. People say: ""The U.S. could become Europe if we keep accumulating debt."" Yet America's debt burden is already higher than France's, and markets accept U.S. debt with profound calm. The difference: it's not that markets are worried that France can't pay its debts. They are worried that France won't pay its debts with euros. By contrast, nobody doubts that the U.S. government can pay its debts with dollars. America has in the past faced the kinds of problems that France, Italy and the others face now. In the panic of 1893, holders of American silver certificates (the paper money of the time) suddenly panicked that gold was going to become more valuable relative to silver. They began demanding gold in return for their paper, eventually draining federal gold reserves to the legal minimum. At that point, the federal government refused to release any more gold, and the country plunged into one of the worst depressions in U.S. history, exceeded only by the Great Depression of the 1930s. The U.S. in 1893 was a very rich country, and its debt burden was really quite light. The total resources of the country more than sufficed to pay its total debts, as the resources of France and Italy more than suffice to pay their debts. This was not a debt crisis, such as you might have today in a genuinely poor African country. It was a crisis caused by issuing debt in a currency (gold back then, euros now) that the issuing government did not control. Europe's options now basically reduce to two: Either smash up the euro to restore each individual government with its own individual currency (accepting a horrific recession along the way) or else build a single new pan-European government to control the new pan-European currency (with considerable inflation risk along the way). Neither option is hugely attractive. Mistakes are easier to make than to undo. But the second choice does look seriously less ugly. Because the United States would suffer some of the pain from option one, it would be in the national interest to urge, and to contribute to support, the cost of option two. Option two will involve transition costs. The original purpose of the International Monetary Fund, to which the United States remains the single largest contributor, was to ease monetary shocks. Here at last is the biggest of them all. The IMF needs to involve itself actively, and Americans should not begrudge the cost of averting what otherwise could be a financial and economic catastrophe of global impact.

"(CNN) -- An elderly man and his granddaughter died after a bolt of lightning started a fire in a house in Louisville, Kentucky, on Thursday evening, officials said. The lightning came from powerful storms that struck the area, causing auto accidents, flooding viaducts and stranding cars. The 911 call from the people inside the house came in around 6:45 p.m., said Vince Luney, communications supervisor for EMA Metrosafe, a public safety agency. Amid a flurry of other emergency calls, firefighters were dispatched to the scene and arrived within minutes. The elderly man was bedridden and his granddaughter was trying to get him out of the house, said Gregory Frederick, the Louisville fire chief. It took ""about 10 or 15 minutes to actually locate them because of the severity of the fire,"" he said. ""We had to knock some of the fire down to get firefighters in there to effect the rescue. The fire had a pretty good head start on us."" Between them, the 30 firefighters on the scene pulled the two people out of the house. ""Those boys were brave -- the flames were going, they were running straight to it, back up a bit, and run again,"" Billy Ray Garrett, a resident of the neighborhood told CNN affiliate WAVE. ""If anybody died in that house, it ain't because of anything they could do, they were trying, they were fighting."" The elderly man died of his injuries at the scene, according to Frederick, and the woman was declared dead at a Louisville hospital. Several family members were present at the time and were notified, he said. Firefighters are investigating the blaze and are treating lightning as the preliminary cause. ""Lightning struck an 80-foot-tall tree, hit about 40 feet up, and it entered a phone wire that came in through the rear of the house,"" Frederick said. Melted wire suggested the phone line had carried the lightning's charge into the basement of the house, he added. Fire crews reported smoke in the basement upon arrival. ""It was like having a blow torch coming out the side of the house,"" Garrett said. ""It was running all the way up the side of the other house, it was all coming through the bottom window, like a massive torch."" The house is still standing, according to Frederick. ""It's got pretty severe damage to the basement and the first floor,"" he said. ""It's an older, probably 1940s-era house, so the fire traveled (through) sealed spaces and moved into other areas of the house."" Severe thunderstorms that pushed through the area included winds that topped more than 60 mph, according to the National Weather Service. The storms knocked out power in thousands of homes across Kentucky. Follow local coverage at WAVE-TV . The roof of Louisville's Crowne Plaza Hotel was partially torn off, sending debris onto vehicles in the parking lot below, officials said. No injuries were reported to EMA Metrosafe. ""We probably made somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 other runs"" to deal with problems caused by the storm, Frederick said. A multitude of those requests came within 20 to 30 minutes, he added. In nearby Oldham County, a man on a boat on the Ohio River was struck by lightning, said Don Dahl, the North Oldham deputy assistant fire chief. The young man was in speedboat with about four other people when the storms rolled in from the Indiana side of the river, Dahl said. The man appeared to have taken a direct hit from lightning and was ""hurting pretty bad,"" according to Dahl. The emergency services got the man onto land and into a waiting ambulance, which took him to a Louisville hospital, he said. The man's latest condition was not immediately available. He was taken to the hospital with ""unknown injuries,"" said Jason Smiser, Oldham County dispatcher.","NEW: A man is struck by lightning on the Ohio River .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Insurgents launched attacks Thursday on a Provincial Reconstruction Team base and a military outpost in Afghanistan, Afghan and NATO officials said. Three insurgents took positions in a home near a PRT base in Kandahar, said the region's police chief, Salim Ahsas. Officials killed two of the attackers, but one was ""still resisting in the building,"" Ahsas said. Residents reported heavy gunfire in the area. The PRT base is about 800 meters (half a mile) from the three-floor building the insurgents are in, said Haji Ahsan, acting head of the Kandahar Provincial Council. ""We can say that this a failed attack by the Taliban,"" Ahsan said. ""The Taliban have always been trying to do symbolic attacks to get more attention."" Haji Agha Lali, a member of the Kandahar provincial council, said insurgents were firing small guns and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) toward the Provincial Reconstruction Team. There were no casualties among PRT or military personnel, Ahsas said. The Taliban brought in two cars full of explosives, possibly to use in the attack, but authorities gained control of them and were working to defuse them, Ahsas said. The U.S. military describes PRTs as civil-military organizations aimed at helping improve stability and rebuild, usually following hostilities. The U.S. Embassy said the attack on the PRT base began at about 2:45 p.m. local time and was ongoing several hours later. Afghan and coalition forces responded. ""All PRT Chief of Mission personnel are safe and accounted for, but there are unconfirmed reports of a number of other injuries,"" the embassy said in a statement. ""We do not have additional details at this time."" The statement noted that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said civilians serving in Afghanistan will not be intimidated by such attacks. Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, said the fighting in Kandahar was one of two incidents Thursday. The second involved a suicide car bomb that exploded outside an ISAF base in the Panjwai region. ""There are no ISAF casualties and the base's perimeter was not penetrated,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- As severe weather moved eastward, the devastation mounted Thursday in parts of the Midwest where hundreds mourned the deaths of loved ones and clung to hopes they'd be found alive following a wave of powerful tornadoes. Severe thunderstorm warnings and watches extended from South Carolina north along the Appalachian mountains to West Virginia on Thursday evening. Tornado watches that had been issued the same night for parts of Pennysylvania, New York and Vermont, meanwhile came and went without any signs of significant damage. Two people died Thursday evening in Atlanta, at the southern edge of the storm system, after trees fell on two vehicles, said city police spokeswoman Kim Jones. There were also numerous reports of wires and trees down throughout the city, though no indication of any tornado like those that ripped through the central United States earlier this week. The worst-hit community is Joplin, Missouri. The twister that hit that city Sunday night was the single deadliest in the United States since modern record-keeping began 61 years ago. Newton County Coroner Mark Bridges told CNN on Thursday night that the death toll from the EF5 twister -- which had winds topping 200 mph -- had risen to 126 people. Those bodies were being stored in temporary refrigeration units, while they are identified and eventually released to their relatives. After flying in $2 million worth of equipment, a federal government team will head the effort to positively identify the tornado victims, according to Bridges. After the first case resulted in a false identification, authorities are now not allowing individuals in because many bodies are in such bad condition that they're difficult to recognize, the coroner said. Instead, they are relying on information like dental records, fingerprints, DNA and other such data. ""A lot have blood on their face, they don't look like they used to look,"" Bridges said of the victims. As criticism grew that authorities weren't moving fast enough, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said he asked the state's Department of Public Safety to take over the process of identifying victims on Wednesday. Andrea Spillars, the department's deputy director, led the team of 60 people who worked through the night and released a list Thursday -- published online at dps.mo.gov -- of 232 people who have been reported missing since Sunday night. The governor said that he expected the pace of the body-identification and release process to pick up significantly in the coming days. ""When I see the local folks strained beyond their limits, we move in,"" Nixon told CNN on Thursday, adding that ""now is not the time to point fingers."" ""The mourning here is not over (but) we're going to do everything we can."" Roughly 8,000 structures in Joplin suffered damage, city manager Mark Rohr said, citing a Federal Emergency Management Agency report. The southwest Missouri city feared another blow late Tuesday as storms moved through the area, but there were no reported touchdowns then. But the same storm system late Tuesday and early Wednesday left 10 people dead in Oklahoma, four in Arkansas and two in Kansas, authorities said. The numbers have fluctuated as officials scramble to deal with the disaster. The most severe damage from that round of severe weather appeared to be in central Oklahoma's Canadian County, which includes a sliver of of Oklahoma City. At least seven people were killed and more than 100 were injured, according to the sheriff's department and the county's emergency management office. Others were missing, authorities said. Cole Hamil, a 15-month-old boy, was among those killed. And on Thursday, authorities found the body of his 3-year-old brother, Ryan, floating in a lake. Their 5-year-old sister Cathleen survived, as did their mother Catherine Hamil, who is pregnant. ""I lost both of my boys,"" said a tearful Hank Hamil, the brothers' father, on Thursday. ""Ryan was my little buddy. Cole was, too. I loved them both,"" said Hank Hamil, who was out of town when the storms struck. It has been a historic tornado season in the United States. More than 500 people have been killed, according to figures from the National Weather Service and local authorities. That makes 2011 the deadliest season since 1953, when 519 people were killed in twisters. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin declared a state of emergency Wednesday in 68 Oklahoma counties hit by the tornadoes and other severe weather. Only nine counties in the state were not included in the declaration.

"Editor's Note: Tachi Yamada is the President of the Global Health Program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He writes for CNN's Vital Signs about how the  island of Zanzibar has virtually eliminated the disease over the past five years. ZANZIBAR, Tanzania -- I recently accompanied Margaret Chan, Director General of the WHO, and Ray Chambers, U.N. Special Envoy for Malaria, on a trip to Africa to see firsthand the region's fight against malaria. A hospital ward on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar stands empty. The single most memorable image of the trip was from a pediatric hospital ward on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar: a dozen beds and not a single patient in them. Imagine that.  I have searing memories of visiting wards much like this elsewhere in the world where there were as many as three children to a bed and more sleeping on the floor, deathly ill with malaria. Where have all the patients gone? After all, malaria is a big killer in much of the developing world. It is probably the most prevalent disease that mankind has ever suffered. Each year, there are over 250 million cases and almost one million deaths -- most of them young children, and the vast majority in Africa. But in many countries, malaria is also a success story. Since 2000, the number of reported malaria cases, deaths, or both has declined by at least half in 25 countries. Zanzibar -- a relatively small but striking example -- has virtually eliminated the disease over the past five years. These successes show what a combination of political will, technical resources, and financial commitment can do when applied to a strategy that works. There is no question that leaders and health officials in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world recognize the horrible toll of malaria. In fact, Uganda's Minister of Health told us that he himself has suffered from malaria three times this year. This understanding of the problem and the availability of tools to address it led the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2005 to fund the Malaria Control and Evaluation Program in Africa, which focused on malaria control in Zambia. Our investment was relatively small, but it helped Zambia create a comprehensive and aggressive national plan to fight malaria. With funding from the President's Malaria Initiative, the World Bank, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, Zambia greatly expanded the use of proven tools to prevent and treat the disease, such as the use of indoor spraying with insecticides, distribution of bednets, and effective malaria treatment in government clinics. As a result, in three short years, the malaria incidence in Zambia declined by more than 50 percent, and child mortality from all causes, including malaria, declined by 30 percent. Zambia, Zanzibar, and other success stories provide a beacon of hope for the dream of a world free of malaria, articulated by Bill and Melinda Gates in 2007 when they put out a call to eradicate the disease. Today, there are a number of outspoken people who question the value and true impact of development assistance. The example of malaria shows that with political will, advice on planning, funds to purchase sound, scientifically validated tools, and the courage to measure results objectively, development assistance can have an enormous impact in a short period of time. Where have all the patients gone? Home, where they can live happier, healthier lives. Let them be the retort to the skeptics of development assistance.","Yamada: The number of malaria cases has declined by at least half in 25 countries .

"Madrid (CNN) -- The death of an American college student last month, which investigators in Barcelona initially considered to be accidental, is now under investigation as a homicide and a suspect has been arrested, the Catalan regional police said in a statement. A 41-year-old Ecuadorian man has been arrested in the Esplugues de Llobregat suburb of Barcelona, according to the police statement released Saturday. The body of 20-year-old Dartmouth College student Crispin Scott was found January 7 in the same suburb. Scott was on a study-abroad program in Barcelona that was run by Oregon's Portland State University, Charles Inman, the coordinator of the program, told CNN on Monday by telephone from Barcelona. A judge has ordered the case sealed. Police did not provide the suspect's name. Scott arrived in Barcelona before the official start of the study-abroad program, and on January 6 he went with other Dartmouth students -- not those from the Portland State program -- for dinner and drinks in a popular nightlife area along the city's Mediterranean shore, Inman said. Scott never returned to his apartment and did not appear January 7 for a program orientation lunch, Inman said. Inman alerted authorities and was told January 8 about the discovery of Scott's body. Scott, a native of Seattle, played on the Dartmouth men's rugby team, his college newspaper reported in January.","A judge has ordered the case sealed; police don't name the suspect .

"(CNN) -- President Obama's State of the Union address predictably focused on his domestic priorities. Immigration reform, a laundry list of economic initiatives including infrastructure improvements (Fix it First), clean energy, some manufacturing innovation, a bit of educational reform and the rhetorical high point of his speech -- gun control. As in years past, foreign policy made up only about 15% of the speech, but even within that usual limited attention, Tuesday night's address pointed to few new directions. On Afghanistan -- America's longest war -- Obama expressed just a continued commitment to bringing the troops home, ending ""our war"" while theirs continues. On Iran, there was a single sentence reiterating the need for a diplomatic solution, which makes me think that a big diplomatic push is not likely. On North Korea, boilerplate promises to isolate the country further after its provocative nuclear test, and on Syria, a call to ""keep the pressure"" on the regime, which means more watching from the sidelines as the horror unfolds. Notably, China was mentioned only twice -- once in the context of jobs, and another time with respect to clean energy. Nothing about managing what could very well be this administration's most vexing but critically important bilateral relationship. Obama's call for a reinvigorated free trade agenda was his boldest foreign policy statement of the evening. He is right to note that free trade ""supports millions of good-paying American jobs,"" but his pledge to pursue a ""comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership"" -- a free trade agreement with Europe -- will run into significant opposition from organized labor, especially given ongoing weaknesses in the economy. Without fast track negotiating authority, the prospects for such a deal are minimal. Fast track authority, which allows the president to negotiate trade deals that Congress can then only approve or disapprove but not amend, expired in 2007, and it would require quite a breakthrough for Congress to approve it again. Still, despite these challenges, an agreement is worth pursuing. Aside from a free trade agreement with Europe, there was little else in this State of the Union that hinted at foreign policy ambition. But unpredictable events have a way of derailing America's best laid plans to stay above the fray of the world's messiest problems. Who could have predicted just a few months ago that Mali would get a mention in the State of the Union? Iraq -- not uttered once tonight -- could re-emerge as a formidable crisis; Iran, Pakistan and North Korea also have tremendous potential to erupt. While this administration seems determined to focus inward on getting America's economic and fiscal house in order, I doubt events in the rest of the world will be so accommodating. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Isobel Coleman .","Isobel Coleman: Obama mainly addressed domestic issues: economy, immigration, energy .

"(CNN) -- Deaths of law enforcement officers in the line of duty fell sharply in 2008, with the number killed by gunfire reaching its lowest level in more than five decades, according to a report published Monday. A tougher criminal justice system is among the reasons cited for a less deadly year for police. The statistics show 2008 has been ""one of the safest years for U.S. law enforcement in decades,"" wrote two groups: the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund and Concerns of Police Survivors. Based on preliminary data, the groups found that 140 law enforcement officers were killed in 2008 -- 86 of them accidentally and 54 intentionally. Just the year before, the group found 181 deaths -- 108 of them accidental and 73 intentional. ""Fewer officers were killed by gunfire in 2008 than in any year since 1956,"" the report says. ""Preliminary data indicate 41 officers died in firearms-related incidents this year, compared with 68 in 2007, a reduction of 40 percent."" In a statement accompanying the report, Craig W. Floyd, chairman of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, said, ""2007 was a wake-up call for law enforcement in our country, and law enforcement executives, officers, associations and trainers clearly heeded the call, with a renewed emphasis on officer safety training, equipment and procedures."" He listed reasons for the drop in officer deaths, including better training and equipment; increased use of less-lethal weapons; more officers wearing bullet-resistant vests; and an increased awareness among officers that ""every assignment is potentially life-threatening."" Floyd also cited a downturn in violent crime in general and what he called a tougher criminal justice system. ""The reduction in firearms-related deaths is especially stunning, given the tremendous firepower possessed by so many criminals today,"" Floyd added in the statement. The report's figures are different from those held by the FBI. For example, the FBI lists 140 law enforcement officers killed in 2007 -- 83 accidentally and 57 intentionally. The different figures are based on somewhat different criteria. For example, the FBI explains on its Web site that it includes only officers who were ""working in an official capacity"" at the time of the incident. Kevin Morrison, a spokesman for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, said his group may include an officer who was intentionally killed, even if he was not working in an official capacity at the time. Also, Morrison said, ""Officers who die of a heart attack while engaging in a foot pursuit -- that may not make it into their report, but it's in ours."" The FBI has not released totals for 2008. Its preliminary report on law enforcement officer deaths in 2008 is expected in the spring. While the report released Monday is largely about good news, it also includes some grim statistics. ""Deaths of female officers rose sharply to 15 in 2008, equaling the record high of 2002. For the first time, more than 1 in 10 of the officers killed in a single year were women,"" the report says. ""And while overall traffic-related fatalities declined by more than 14 percent, the number of officers struck and killed rose in 2008 -- despite the increased publicity and enforcement of 'move over' laws and other safety initiatives.""","It's been ""one of the safest years for U.S. law enforcement in decades,"" groups say .

"Krotz Springs, Louisiana (CNN) -- Residents of towns along the swollen Mississippi River on Sunday packed up their valuables and made last-ditch efforts to place sandbags and makeshift levees outside their homes, trying to protect themselves and their homes from rising waters. ""I have never experienced anything like this in my life,"" said Brett Ansley, 24, as he was hitching up his trailer home in Krotz Springs, Louisiana, to move it to higher ground. ""It's crazy. It's unreal."" These efforts occurred as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened two additional gates Sunday morning on the Morganza spillway, located about 115 miles northwest of New Orleans. This is after opening the first two bays the previous day. A collective gasp as Louisiana town braces for flood . The plan is to let out water from as many as one-fourth of the spillway's 125 bays to spare the Louisiana cities of Baton Rouge and New Orleans from severe flooding, Corps spokesman Ricky Boyett has said. But it maystill affect nearly 4,000 people who live along the river, as it sends water toward homes and farmland in the Atchafalaya Basin, according to Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. ""At this time, we are currently monitoring the river, but it is too early to know if additional gates will be opened today,"" Boyett wrote in an e-mail to CNN. Some of the spillway's gates will likely be open for weeks, and it'll be at least that long before the river falls safely below flood stage and those who have evacuated can safely return, said Col. Ed Fleming, the Corps' New Orleans district commander. Stars talk about the flooding and response . Fleming said the decision to open the spillway, along with similar decisions made in recent weeks as the floodwaters moved southward, was done to address a historic excess of water in the Mississippi River and its tributaries. While the spillways will divert water away from Louisiana cities, low-lying central parts of the state will be flooded. Across the South and lower Midwest, floodwaters have already covered about 3 million acres of farmland, eroding for many farmers what could have been a profitable year for corn, wheat, rice and cotton, officials said. Authorities in St. Landry Parish issued a mandatory evacuation that affected about 2,000 people -- including about 750 people living in 240 homes in Krotz Springs. Residents in other areas were under a voluntary evacuation, with authorities encouraging but not ordering them to leave. Don Menard, the parish's president, said Sunday afternoon that water levels in Krotz Springs appear lower than expected -- though he said he thought they'd rise considerably after midnight, and especially if and when more floodgates are opened. NBA's Grizzlies inspired by fans in flooded Memphis . ""It's the fear of the unknown,"" Menard said, noting estimates that the water could rise 10 to 15 feet in spots. ""These are predictions, no one knows for sure what will happen."" CNN iReporter Faisal Abou-Shahla posted a video of flooded homes in St. Francisville, Louisiana, about 30 miles north of Baton Rouge. He said he shot the video on Saturday, after the first gate was opened on the spillway. Abou-Shahla said he lives in Baton Rouge and was visiting his fiancee's parents in St. Francisville. Some city residents ""were waiting until the last second to leave,"" he said Sunday, while others used whatever they could to try to minimize damage to their homes for when the high waters roll in. ""There were a few seemingly futile attempts to put sandbags up,"" said Abou-Shahla. Following the opening of the spillway, the National Weather Service revised its flood forecasts and lowered projected cresting levels in some Louisiana towns. Forecasters also said the river may crest earlier than first thought in some areas. ""The river at Baton Rouge through New Orleans will crest sooner than upstream locations due to Morganza spillway operations,"" said the latest forecast, issued Saturday. ""After crests, stages will remain at the same levels and New Orleans will fluctuate near flood stage while Bonnet Carre and Morganza are operated."" Authorities previously opened gates on the Bonnet Carre spillway, located upstream from Morganza. Already on Sunday, waters in Vicksburg, Mississippi, had reached record levels of 56.2 feet , the weather service reported. This is well above the 43-foot flood stage, but still short of the forecasted crest of 57.5 feet on Thursday. Levels in Natchez, further south downriver, were two feet higher than the record set in 1937 on Sunday, but just under three feet shy of the 63-foot crest expected Saturday. The weather service said the river was also cresting Sunday in New Orleans and Reserve, Louisiana, because of the spillway operations. At Reserve, the river was cresting at 28.2 feet, above the historic 1929 flood level of 26 feet. At New Orleans, however, the crest was 17 feet, about four feet below the historic level of 1922. Spillways explained . Residents were counting on a levee for protection. In addition to the mainline levee along the river, starting near Vicksburg and extending northeast for more than 20 miles, a so-called backwater levee offers shelter. The backwater levee is designed to keep water from backing into the Yazoo River delta and is designed lower than the mainline levee so that water can flow over it. Peter Nimrod, the Mississippi Levee Board's chief engineer, said Sunday there was a ""remote"" chances the levees could be breached, though he expressed confidence they would hold. Even if it stays intact, the expectation is excess water will rush over them for several days. ""There will be a lot of sleepless nights, when this thing starts overtopping,"" Nimrod said. ""It will be a very stressful time for everyone."" CNN's Ed Lavandera, Martin Savidge, Justin Lear, Jacqui Jeras and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","NEW: A parish official orders evacuation, cites ""the fear of the unknown""

"(CNN) -- The statement: . ""We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas ... "" That was part of President Barack Obama's appeal to continue pushing for new energy technologies during Tuesday night's State of the Union address, a line in which he also praised the expansion of renewable energy technologies like wind and solar electricity. There are more high-mileage gasoline and hybrid-electric vehicles on the road. And automakers certainly have come a long way since the days when hulking, high-powered Detroit steel could pass anything but a filling station. But doubled? CNN thought that claim was worthy of a road test. The facts: . There are some impressively efficient vehicles in production these days. The Ford C-Max and Toyota Prius plug-in hybrids get a combined city-and-highway rating of 58 miles per gallon from the Environmental Protection Agency. An electric Honda Fit gets the equivalent of 118 mpg. More fact checks: Immigration | Obamacare | Wind energy . And back in August, the Obama administration issued new rules that would push automakers to make their entire fleets get comparable numbers. That regulation nearly doubles the mileage requirement for manufacturers, making them boost their corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) from the current standard of 29.7 mpg for cars and light trucks to 54.5 mpg. But the automakers have until the 2025 model year to hit that goal. And while the average car made today is more of a gas-sipper than a guzzler, 54.5 is still a long way off: The average fuel economy of passenger vehicles sold in the United States averaged 33.8 mpg as of October, up from 24.7 in 2002 and 27.1 in 2008. And the new rules have an escape hatch: If the industry has problems meeting the new standards, there's a review process that could reduce the target. Conclusion: . The Obama administration has told automakers to double their average mileage. That part's true. In terms of actual numbers, auto mileage is up, but most drivers still have a way to go before they can cut their fuel bills in half. As with a lot of things said in Washington, your mileage may vary.","Obama administration issued new rules that would push automakers to make cars more fuel efficient .

"Beijing (CNN) -- After focusing on ""green cars"" in recent years, carmakers are wowing visitors at the Auto China 2012 car show with vehicles that are big, bad and gas-guzzling. ""I would definitely be interested if the price was right,"" says Wang Xizhen as he ogled a deep purple Aston Martin DBS. Aston Martin launched its Dragon 88 China-only limited edition this week. With gold dragon emblems embroidered onto its leather seats, the car also carries a hefty price tag - more than 5 million yuan (nearly $800,000). Jeep also launched a China-inspired car -- a flashy Wrangler concept car emblazoned with a long silvery dragon across the hood. ""Jeep brand sales in China in 2011 increased 81% over the prior year and China,"" said Mike Manley, CEO of Jeep Brand, Chrysler group, at the unveiling on Monday. ""Last year, more Jeep vehicles were sold in China than in any other country besides the U.S. and Canada."" Manley said because the brand is committed to China, it's important to design and tailor vehicles specifically to Chinese tastes. But some consumers, like Wang, disagreed. ""Just because it has a dragon on it, doesn't mean Chinese people will love it. After all, we're after going after a western brand,"" said Wang. ""I like the subtlety of Aston Martin's dragon design, but to put a huge dragon across the entire car is going overboard."" Jeep and Aston Martin are among many foreign automakers hoping to woo hundreds of thousands of Chinese consumers visiting the show this week, especially as China has become the world's largest auto market amid a sales slump in Europe and tepid growth in the United States. Despite the push in green cars in previous years following government subsidies for cleaner vehicles, this year's focus turned to gas-guzzling SUVs. Crowds swooned over the new Lamborghini Urus SUV concept car -- a potential competitor to the popular Porsche Cayenne. Ford also unveiled three SUVs at the show, including the EcoSport, which is expected to be manufactured at the company's China factory in Chongqing. ""SUVs are a strength for Ford globally and here in China, the SUV segment is one of the fastest growing segments in the industry,"" said Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford's Asia Pacific and Africa region. ""So you put the two together...it's a very exciting time."" Automakers have turned their attention to bigger cars and flashier cars to attract consumers since there are fewer government-backed incentives to pursue green technology, analysts say. ""It costs automakers about the same to manufacture a hybrid versus an SUV—so it's not profitable for them to pursue green cars given the market development for SUVs right now,"" said Zhang Xin, an analyst at Guotai Jun'an Securities, based in Beijing. ""If you take into account China's widening wealth-poverty gap—it's a huge factor in luxury automakers in business."" Chinese auto sales -- which surged to 35% in 2010 -- showed signs of cooling in the first quarter of this year with just 2% growth. For high-end automakers like Rolls Royce, their bet on the China—their largest market—remains optimistic. ""It is really hard to predict growth rates, because when you look back nobody could have predicted the growth rates we've seen over the last couple of years,"" said Torsten Müller-Ötvös, CEO of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, Ltd. ""Since last year, we've seen growth rates of 50 to 60%, something I would definitely would not expect this year, but there's definitely sustainable growth to come."" But analysts like Zhang say with the demand, also comes pollution and infrastructure challenges. ""Experts here still say that China falls behind on the number of drivers it could have—whereas there are on average 140 drivers for 1,000 people in the world, China only has about 50 for every 1,000,"" said Zhang. ""But they don't take into consideration population density and infrastructure challenges."" But for drivers like Zhang, who says he can only afford a local brand now but may upgrade to an Audi SUV in the near future, owning car is about convenience and comfort. ""I don't know many drivers who would be concerned about creating more pollution,"" said Zhang, a 26-year-old law student. ""We just want travel in comfort and get to our destination on time.""","Big, bad and gas-guzzling vehicles are center stage at Auto China 2012 .

"(CNN) -- A young emperor penguin discovered thousands of kilometers away from its home might survive ingesting a bellyful of sand, New Zealand zoo officials said. The penguin -- whose gender is unknown pending DNA test results due this week -- stunned passers-by when it showed up at a beach north of Wellington last week. ""This is only the second time an emperor penguin has been seen in New Zealand,"" said Kate Baker, spokeswoman for the Wellington Zoo, where the bird was taken for treatment. Even more surprising was what the zoo found inside the penguin -- enough sand to fill its stomach to its esophagus. ""In Antarctica, they normally eat ice to cool down and to hydrate,"" Baker said. It's possible the bird mistook or tried to substitute the sand for snow or ice. It's unclear why the bird apparently swam more than 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) from Antarctica. New Zealanders have dubbed the penguin ""Happy Feet,"" a reference to the 2006 animated movie about emperor penguins. But those at the Wellington Zoo are steering clear of giving the bird a name. ""We get very fond of our patients. If you start naming them, it's really hard if the worst were to happen,"" said Dr. Lisa Argilla, manager of veterinary science at Wellington Zoo. ""We'll try to avoid (naming) until we're really happy he's going to make it."" The bird has undergone two stomach flushes, but getting all the sand out remains a challenge, Argilla said. ""Having sand in your stomach is very serious,"" she said. ""It can cause a rupture, that's my main concern. ... I would assume the sand has abraded the stomach lining."" The emperor had a ""rest day"" from procedures Sunday and will undergo an endoscopy on Monday, Baker said. The zoo currently has four little blue penguins, which are native in New Zealand, Baker said. All have been rehabilitated; one is missing an eye, and one is missing a flipper. But taking care of an emperor penguin is an entirely different story. The bird's temporary quarters include air conditioning set as cold as possible and shaved ice to keep the emperor cool. Argilla said the top priority is helping the bird recover. If all goes well, the Department of Conservation will decide where the penguin should go. In the meantime, the bird has garnered widespread attention and sympathy. ""I think people have a real soft spot for penguins,"" Argilla said. ""Everyone feels really sorry for him. He's just so lost."" CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","New Zealanders spot an emperor penguin 3,000 kilometers from its habitat .

"(CNN) -- It may have been Barack Obama's most dramatic moment as president so far, and it certainly didn't go unmentioned as he accepted the Democratic nomination for a second term Thursday night. Speaker after speaker reminded the audience in the convention hall and beyond that al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden -- the mastermind of 9/11, public enemy No. 1 for a decade -- had been gunned down by American commandos in Pakistan 16 months ago. They reminded everyone that it was Obama who had given the order. Some of them also used the opportunity to question whether Obama's challenger, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, would have made the same call. ""After more than 10 years without justice for thousands of Americans murdered on 9/11 -- after Mitt Romney said it would be 'naive' to go into Pakistan to pursue the terrorists -- it took President Obama, against the advice of many, to give that order to finally rid this earth of Osama bin Laden,"" said Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts. ""Ask Osama bin Laden if he is better off now than he was four years ago."" Fact Check: The not-so-empty factory . Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, recounted the day in the White House when Obama made the decision to launch the raid, ""and justice was done."" ""Folks, Governor Romney didn't see things that way. When he was asked about bin Laden in 2007, he said, and I quote, 'It's not worth moving heaven and Earth and spending billions of dollars just to catch one person,' "" Biden said to boos from the audience. The facts: . In August 2007, Obama explicitly warned that if U.S. authorities identify a ""high-value"" target like bin Laden in Pakistan, and if Pakistan's government doesn't act, ""we will."" Romney, then mounting his first White House bid, criticized Obama's speech a few days later. ""I mean, in one week, he went from saying he's going to sit down, you know, for tea, with our enemies, but then he's going to bomb our allies,"" Romney said during a GOP debate. ""I mean, he's gone from Jane Fonda to Dr. Strangelove in one week."" He added, ""We don't say those things. We keep our options quiet. We do not go out and say to a nation which is working with us, where we have collaborated and they are our friend and we're trying to support Musharraf and strengthen him and his nation, that instead that we intend to go in there and potentially bring out a unilateral attack."" Romney already had been pressed by his Republican rivals to clarify remarks he'd made about bin Laden that April, when he told The Associated Press that ""It's not worth moving heaven and Earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person."" But he also said that he would target the entire al Qaeda terror network, not just its leader. He defended the comments at another GOP presidential debate, saying the movement was ""more than Osama bin Laden. But he is going to pay, and he is going to die."" This May, a year after the raid, Romney complained that the Obama administration was politicizing the raid when it cited those comments. In defending his position again, Romney said it wasn't the idea of striking at bin Laden on the territory of an ally that bothered him -- it was that Obama said publicly that he would do so. ""There are many people who believed as I did that it was naive on the part of the president, at the time as a candidate, to say he would go into Pakistan,"" Romney said. ""It was a very -- if you will -- a fragile and flammable time in Pakistan, and I thought it was a mistake of him as a candidate for the presidency of the United States to announce that he would go in."" Fact Check: Clinton arithmetic holds up on jobs . During the 2008 campaign, Romney wasn't the only one critical of Obama, who had been elected to the Senate only four years earlier. Among those who called his position ""naive"" were Obama's eventual GOP opponent, Sen. John McCain; and Biden, then one of his Democratic rivals. Both used the term ""naive"" to describe Obama's counterterrorism speech. When Obama did order the raid, he did it against the advice of some of his top aides. Then-Defense Secretary Bill Gates has said he wanted to hit the compound where bin Laden was holed up from the air rather than dispatch a U.S. Navy SEAL team, while Biden said in January that he advised Obama that more details needed to be checked before sending in troops. Conclusion: . Romney was critical of Obama's position in the days following the future president's August 2007 speech. Biden's speech Thursday night left out some context about Romney's remarks, and Kerry mischaracterized Romney's comments -- Romney didn't say attacking targets in Pakistan was naive but talking about it publicly was. Also, Biden himself once characterized Obama's comments as naive. Fact Check: Would Romney bankrupt Medicare by 2016?

"Gaza City (CNN) -- Explosions rumbled through Gaza City all night into Friday, and shortly after sunup, two detonations landed just 500 to 600 yards away from CNN's team sending it running for cover inside the hotel. A litany of bombardments provided for a sleepless night of hearing and feel incoming ordinance exploding and watching rockets leaving Gaza for Israel. Falling bombs made doors clatter and sometimes even one's bones. Clouds of smoke sprouted into the sky paralleling the repetition of thunderous booms. New destruction will await Egypt's new Prime Minister Hesham Kandil, when he arrives Friday morning in Gaza to meet with Palestinian officials. Israel reported three people were killed, and Palestinians reported 19 deaths, including at least three killed late Thursday. Hamas gave conflicting information as to how many of them were Hamas militants. At least 422 rockets from Gaza have been fired into Israel since ""Operation Pillar of Defense"" began Wednesday, the Israeli military said. Israel's Iron Dome defense system has intercepted 130, the Israel Defense Forces said. The al-Qassam Brigade, Hamas' military arm, said on its Twitter feed that it had shot 527 projectiles at Israel in that time. Q&A: Gaza strikes could be beginning of ground attack . One rocket struck an open area near Rishon LeZion, an Israeli city with more than 200,000 residents just south of Tel Aviv, the IDF said. Also, air sirens went off inside and outside the Israeli Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv. The building was evacuated briefly, and employees were allowed back in when the sirens stopped. An explosion was heard far off in the distance. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in the building at the time of the evacuation, ministry officials said. Israel has targeted more than 300 ""terror sites"" in Gaza, the IDF said. The military said it targeted scores of ""medium and long range rocket launch and infrastructure sites across the Gaza Strip."" The Israeli navy has taken aim at targets along Gaza's shoreline, the IDF said. Airstrikes continued overnight, with planes striking sites in Gaza City. Sources with Hamas, which controls the government in Gaza, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad said that more than 140 strikes had hit Gaza. The al-Qassam Brigade said its operatives downed a military drone east of Gaza. An Israeli military spokeswoman told CNN that no IDF aircraft was shot down. At least three Israelis were killed and four were wounded when a rocket struck an apartment building in the town of Kiryat Malakhi on Thursday, an Israeli police spokesman said. Israeli military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich tweeted a photo that she said was a baby wounded from a rocket attack in Israel. The baby's face is blurred, but the child appears to be spattered with blood. The al-Qassam Brigade tweeted a screen shot from Hamas-run al Aqsa TV, showing the mangled body of a child. ""Israel's military kills Palestinian children in cold blood in #Gaza,"" the tweet said. Al-Aqsa TV quoted the health ministry as saying 19 people had been killed, among them six children and two ""elderly."" The channel said more than 180 people have been wounded since the Israeli strikes began this week in Gaza. Israel has reported several people wounded, including another three soldiers injured Thursday morning by rockets from Gaza. Israel denies attacks linked to upcoming election . Hamdan insisted that Israel ""started the war."" ""We are defending ourselves,"" he said, arguing that Netanyahu was looking to cement support in advance of an election in two months. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak denied that any politics are involved in the decision. Speaking to CNN, Barak said Israel has destroyed most of the ""heavy long-range rockets"" used by militants in Gaza and is working to ""systematically destroy"" installations in which other rockets are produced. ""It will take some time,"" he said. Israeli forces are going after Hamas weapons, storage bunkers, weapons labs and workshops, an Israeli official told CNN. The official has direct knowledge of Israeli plans but declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information. The Israeli army moved nearly a division's worth of troops -- perhaps 1,500 to 2,000 -- to the border, the official said. While multiple militant groups are behind the rocket attacks, Israel holds Hamas responsible ever since it took control of Gaza, Barak said. Hamas' military wing has claimed responsibility for numerous operations in the past. The U.S. government and the European Union consider Hamas a terrorist organization. Photos: Deadly attacks in Gaza and Israel . Netanyahu issued a statement Thursday saying, ""In recent days and weeks, Hamas and the other terrorist organizations in Gaza have made normal life impossible for over 1 million Israelis. No government would tolerate a situation where nearly a fifth of its people live under a constant barrage of rockets and missile fire."" He added, ""The terrorists are committing a double war crime. They fire at Israeli civilians, and they hide behind Palestinian civilians. And by contrast, Israel takes every measure to avoid civilian casualties."" Ghazi Hamad, Hamas' deputy foreign minister, told CNN that Hamas was sending rockets toward Israel's population because Israel thinks ""that it is easy to kill people in Gaza,"" enter the area and ""do everything"" it wants in Gaza. ""We send a message to them that Gaza is not an easy bone. ... You can't eat Gaza in one minute. If you do something, we will react."" Palestinian lawmaker Mustafa Barghouti said the Israeli government has ""proven that it is a government of war and not peace."" Israel is ""the oppressor,"" not the victim, he said. Concern over possibility of a ground assault . The sudden increase in violence has raised fears of a widening conflict that could lead to an Israeli ground assault. Tony Blair, envoy for the Middle East Quartet, which is working to bring about a peace agreement, said on Thursday: ""I don't think we should be of any doubt at all that if this situation continues and it escalates, it's going to be really serious and tragic -- not just for Israelis and Palestinians, but actually it will cause a huge amount of upheaval right across the region, and this is a region, as you know, that doesn't require more upheaval right now."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague issued a statement saying he is ""gravely concerned"" and calling on all sides to avoid civilian casualties. ""Hamas bears principal responsibility for the current crisis. I utterly condemn rocket attacks from Gaza into southern Israel by Hamas and other armed groups. This creates an intolerable situation for Israeli civilians in southern Israel, who have the right to live without fear of attack from Gaza. The rocket attacks also risk worsening the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, which is already precarious."" Read more: Palestinians: 13-year-old boy killed in Gaza . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who leads the Palestinian Fatah movement based in the West Bank, is cutting short a visit to Europe to follow developments of ""the Israeli aggression on the Gaza strip,"" PLO Executive Committee member Saeb Erakat said. Israel says it has called thousands of residents in Gaza to warn them of strikes and dropped leaflets in Gaza warning Palestinian civilians to ""avoid being present in the vicinity of Hamas operatives,"" the IDF said. It also uses ""roof knocking"" -- targeting a building ""with a loud but nonlethal bomb that warns civilians that they are in the vicinity of a weapons cache or other target. This method is used to allow all residents to leave the area before the IDF targets the site with live ammunition.""

A CNN crew could see trails of smoke as they reported from the Israeli side of the Erez Crossing on Gaza's northern border. The crew was forced to take cover after rockets struck near the border crossing. Later, reporting from Gaza City, the crew witnessed airstrikes and plumes of black smoke in many parts of the city.

The escalating violence is likely to further erode Israel's fragile relationship with Egypt, which recalled its ambassador to Israel on Wednesday in protest over the ongoing strikes. It also delivered a formal protest to the Israeli government. On Thursday, when asked by CNN's Hala Gorani if treaties between Egypt and Israel are in danger, the chief of the Egyptian presidential cabinet said no. ""Not at all. Because we have declared several times, repeatedly, that we abide by our international commitments,"" Mohamed Refa'a al-Tahtawi said. ""But respecting a peace treaty does not mean to stay idle or indifferent to what is going on along our borders. A spokesman for Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy said the Arab League will meet Saturday in emergency session to discuss the violence. ""Egypt is taking all diplomatic measures with all parties involved to reach some sort of immediate truce or cease fire,"" Yaser Ali added. A senior official in U.S. President Obama's administration told CNN that the White House is asking Egypt and Turkey -- two nations that have influence with Hamas -- to urge the group to de-escalate the rocket attacks. But a Hamas deputy foreign minister told CNN: ""I am in touch with the Egyptians they are very angry and very upset because they feel that Israel put a knife in their back"" by attacking sites in Gaza. Egypt's Prime Minister Hesham Kandil will travel on Friday morning to Gaza with a team of presidential advisers and ministers to meet with Palestinian officials. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon also will go to Egypt and Israel next week, because of the rising tensions between Israel and Hamas, a Western diplomat told CNN. The diplomat said the Secretary General has canceled a trip to Mozambique, Botswana, Seychelles and Mauritius to go to the Middle East. CNN's Sara Sidner and Talal Abu-Rahma reported from southern Israel and Gaza City; CNN's Josh Levs and Chelsea Carter reported from Atlanta; CNN's Jessica Yellin, Saad Abedine and Joe Vaccarello as well as journalists Per Nyberg and Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","Israel says 422 rockets fired from Gaza into Israel in past two days .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Worshippers who came to pray at Joseph's Tomb, a Jewish holy site in the northern West Bank city of Nablus, found swastikas and graffiti sprayed on the walls. Israel Defense Forces tried to cover up the graffiti with white paint, a spokesman said. It is unclear when the graffiti was sprayed on the walls. Joseph's Tomb is under Palestinian Authority rule and Jewish worshippers arrive every couple of months to pray at the holy site. The visit to the tomb is coordinated by the Israeli forces, who escorted the 1,300 people who came to pray overnight Wednesday. The Israeli Civil Administration filed a complaint with the Palestinian Authority. ""Joseph's Tomb was abandoned exactly 11 years ago after Palestinians forcefully took over the place. According to the Oslo agreements, it should be under Israeli rule and this proves that freedom of religion and worship can only be achieved if Israel controls the tomb,"" said Dani Dayan, the Yesha Council chairman, an umbrella group for settlements. The discovery of the graffiti comes a few days after the burning of a mosque in the Israeli village of Tuba Zangariyye, which led to confrontations between residents and Israeli police. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli President Shimon Peres and the chief rabbis strongly condemned the attack in the village.","It is unclear when the graffiti was sprayed on the walls of the tomb .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- At least three Thai soldiers were killed Friday in a new round of clashes with Cambodian troops in a disputed border region, a military official said. Thirteen other Thai troops were injured, Lt. Col. Siriya Khuangsirikul said. The fighting broke out near two temples in the Phanom Dong Rak of southeastern Thailand's Surin province, Thai army spokesman Col. Sunsern Kaewkumnerd said. A Cambodian foreign ministry spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. Authorities evacuated between 7,000 and 10,000 residents to temporary shelters as clashes erupted, Ong-art Klarmpaibul of the Thai prime minister's office said in an interview with the Thai Public Broadcasting System. Sunsern said the cause of Friday's clashes ""is not yet known."" At least 10 people were killed when renewed fighting flared up in another disputed border area between the two nations in February, prompting the U.N. Security Council to issue a statement calling on both sides to implement a permanent cease-fire and ""resolve the situation peacefully and through effective dialogue."" Those clashes, which lasted four days, stemmed from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. At the time, each nation accused the other of firing first, according to a statement from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Conflict over the site has taken place periodically for years. In 1962, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled that the site was in Cambodia, adding that the structure was ""an outstanding masterpiece of Khmer architecture."" But Thailand says the 1.8-square-mile (4.7-square-kilometer) area around Preah Vihear was never fully demarcated, and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th-century during the French occupation of Cambodia. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities evacuate at least 7,000 people as clashes erupt .

"New York (Financial Times) -- BP has put in place safety systems for offshore drilling that are ahead of any other company's, the UK oil group has said as it prepares for the trial over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. The company has set out for the first time details of how it has restructured its operations and invested in new technology in an attempt to show that the mistakes that led to the fatal explosion and huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico will not be repeated. Richard Morrison, who is about to take over as president of the company's operations in the Gulf of Mexico, said changes brought in since the disaster represented a greater investment in safety than for any of BP's competitors, and were ""laying the foundations for a very safe company"". BP's new safety procedures will have no direct bearing on the civil trial over the spill, which is scheduled to start on February 25. However, the company has been talking about what it sees as profound changes in its practices in order to improve its image in the US, and with other governments and companies worldwide. Mr Morrison highlighted changes such as a new unit in Houston focused on monitoring wells being drilled offshore to watch for signs of trouble: a function that he said had no parallel in other companies. BP is also setting up its own training facility to teach engineers and supervisors how to manage possible leaks of oil and gas of the kind that caused the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which an instructor described as aiming to be ""the Harvard of well control"". BP is now more active in the Gulf of Mexico than ever, with seven rigs drilling wells, and was the region's largest producer of oil and gas last year. Facing challenges in other parts of the world, and having sold its Russian joint venture TNK-BP, it sees the US as central to its plans for future growth. However, the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon still overshadows the company's prospects. In its settlement last year with the US Department of Justice of the criminal charges against it, BP admitted that negligence on the part of its employees -- along with other companies -- was a ""proximate cause"" of the accident. That led to debarment from new federal contracts, which means that BP cannot take out any new drilling leases in the gulf until the ban is lifted. The DoJ said last year in a memo filed to the court in New Orleans hearing the civil case over the spill that it planned to prove BP had acted with ""gross negligence or wilful misconduct"" that had caused the accident. BP denies this gross negligence. The Deepwater Horizon disaster followed other failures including a leak from a pipeline in Alaska in 2006 and the Texas City refinery explosion in 2005, which killed 15 people in one of the US's worst industrial accidents of recent years. After those accidents Tony Hayward, who took over as chief executive in 2007, promised to restructure the company to focus on safety ""like a laser"". Mr Morrison said the company had been pushing ahead with those changes, which had not been fully implemented at the time of the Deepwater Horizon accident, and introducing new systems and technologies as a result of the lessons it had learnt from its investigation of the disaster. For example, he said staff of BP's new Safety and Operational Risk organisation, set up by Mr Hayward's successor Bob Dudley in 2011, now had the authority to order that an operation be stopped, when the previous safety body had more of an advisory role. Another change was that the importance of process safety -- focusing on an operation as a whole, rather than small individual accidents -- was one of the lessons of the Texas City disaster and has now been emphasised in the drilling operations as well as BP's refineries, Mr Morrison said. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","UK oil group claims it has drilling safety systems ahead of any other company's .

"(CNN) -- In calmer days, the two California Department of Fish and Wildlife officers riding in a truck rolling down State Route 38 would have been thinking about squirrel hunting or fishing regulations. But on Tuesday, like everyone else in the mountainous California country known as Big Bear Lake, they were thinking about fugitive ex-cop Christopher Dorner. They were on the lookout for a purple Nissan he might be driving. Two house cleaners told police earlier in the day that a man they thought was Dorner tied them up and took their Nissan. Now police throughout the region, including Fish and Wildlife wardens, were keeping an eye out for it, . They spotted two school buses for the Bear Valley Unified School District barreling down the other side of the highway. Driving close behind them was a purple Nissan. After days of false leads, going door-to-door, searching frozen mountain passes, the officers thought this might be the break in the case. The warden at the wheel hit his brakes, trying to make a U-turn on the narrow pine-lined road. An officer radioed in the message that California law enforcement had been waiting for: We found Dorner. And then he was gone again. Dorner apparently realized he'd been spotted and floored the car, passing the buses and disappearing up the road. It almost worked. The Fish and Wildlife officers passed the buses and -- thinking the Nissan was just around the bend -- kept driving. In reality, the Nissan had turned onto another road, eventually crashing. Sometime later, Dorner came across Rick Heltebrake in a white pickup. Heltebrake instantly recognized the big man as Dorner. ""He just came out of the snow at me with his gun at my head,"" Heltebrake told CNN affiliate KTLA. ""He said, 'I don't want to hurt you. Just get out of the car and start walking.' "" Heltebrake started walking. By this time, two more Fish and Wildlife vehicles, traveling together, had joined the pursuit. An officer in the first vehicle noticed Heltebrake's white pickup moving fast and erratically down the hill and thought he spotted Dorner in the truck as it passed. But before the first officer had time to warn his colleagues or pick up the radio, Dorner rolled down his window and pumped multiple pistol rounds into the second Fish and Wildlife truck as the two vehicles passed on narrow, twisty Glass Road. One officer got out of the second vehicle and fired multiple rounds from his AR-15 rifle at Dorner's vehicle. Heltebrake, a ranger at a nearby Boy Scout camp, radioed that he heard gunfire. ""Ten to 20 rounds maybe,"" he said. Next, Dorner ditched Heltebrake's truck, ran into the woods and barricaded himself inside a cabin owned by Candy Martin. The home was built, she said, in the 1920s, to give horse-and-buggy travelers between Redwoods and Big Bear a place to spend the night. Long bursts of gunfire broke through the silence, some of it captured by a reporter working for CNN affiliates KCBS and KCAL, on a cell phone. Two deputies were shot. One of them died later at a hospital. Then the shooting apparently stopped. Dorner found himself surrounded by police, who moved in and began to tear down the walls of the cabin. ""All right, we're gonna go forward with the burn ... like we talked about,"" said a voice on a local police scanner frequency. ""We have fire in the front, he might come out the back."" A single gunshot was heard from inside the cabin. Had Dorner shot himself? Police will not yet say. At about 6 p.m. local time, the cabin was engulfed in flames, as an American television audience watched live images beamed from news choppers. The piercing sound of exploding ammunition was heard coming from inside the flaming cabin. By 11 p.m. local time, authorities entered the smoldering remnants of the cabin to find charred human remains. Is the body Dorner's? Probably. But police are taking no chances. They are waiting for an autopsy to make an announcement of the final determination. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Timeline of Christopher Dorner's final hours from reports by police, reporters and others .

"(CNN) -- In the world of economic and social development, lists are easy to come by. The class of leaders gathering in Davos are well aware that ranking nations -- by levels of freedom, ease of doing business, competitiveness, fragility -- has become a preferred sport for analysts working for governments, magazines, NGOs or think tanks around the world. But it's rare to find a surprising result. Nevertheless, that's what economists Ricardo Hausmann and CÃ©sar Hidalgo, researchers at the Harvard Center for Economic Development, have produced with their new Atlas of Economic Complexity. In their global ranking of GDP growth to 2020, Uganda comes out number one. That's a head scratcher. How could a tiny, land-locked African nation, best known for Idi Amin, lead a list predicting economic growth? There's more: Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Senegal, Malawi, and Zambia round out the top ten. Hausmann and Hidalgo project that these countries will grow faster than most others in the world, including emerging market favorites Turkey, Brazil, and China. In fact, thirteen of the top thirty countries for growth are in sub-Saharan Africa. Sweden, France and Japan rank 100, 101, and 102. Africa's 2020 growth vision . What gives? To look at the more established lists and tables for development, Africa is doing poorly -- at or near the bottom of the heap for GDP per capita, infant mortality, primary school enrollment -- you name it. To determine that the booming economies of the next decade lie in Africa, Hausmann and Hidalgo exit the traditional framework. Using international trade data since 1964, the pair developed a metric they call ""economic complexity,"" which suggests that population growth, industrial webs and networked knowledge may reveal more about future growth than conventional metrics like life expectancy, formal education or political risk. Not that these factors don't matter for everyday lives in Africa and beyond -- but I like to think of GDP as a metric useful for a certain kind of evaluation that can miss the wider, more human picture. The region's economic potential is more fully realized when complexity is the baseline. What is economic complexity? The authors explain that ""society functions because its members form webs that allow them to specialize and share their knowledge with others."" The Atlas focuses on exported goods (not services), tracking how easy it is for an economy to leap from the simple (growing cotton, or making steel) to the complex (manufacturing garments, or building cars). The easier it is for a nation to diversify exports and, in turn, produce skilled workers and pricy exports, the more complex it is. Thus economic complexity, per Hausmann and Hidalgo, ""reflects the structures that emerge to hold and combine knowledge."" Notably, this includes demographic trends and social networks -- the webs and serendipities often lost in pure GDP analysis. To derive their ranking for future GDP growth, Hausmann and Hidalgo track the gap between complexity and current income. And here is where things get interesting. Portugal (115) and Greece (126), for example, have long been outperforming their comparatively low levels of complexity. Based on the lackluster distribution of human skills and knowledge in the private sector, both countries should be a lot less wealthy -- a prediction that may come to fruition soon. Singapore (66) and the United States (88) are very complex, but very wealthy -- there's not much room for improvement. In Africa, by contrast, many economies are more complex than their levels of income suggest. Like many countries in the region, Uganda is poor and poorly governed -- but it's demographically young, and its private sector is finding its footing. Since 1988, exports have diversified from tea and coffee to soaps, oils, beer, cement, iron, steel, and machinery. The next decade will see a resulting correction in GDP -- based not just on the income from these exports, but on the leap in ""collective knowledge"" that comes from the expanded production. Africa can teach the world to innovate . The authors acknowledge that the powerhouse nations of the OECD will still drive global economic activity, but that African countries will leverage existing complexity into income over time. Africa's sunny outlook also comes from the report's privileging connections and systems over GDP. Studies suggest that up to 70% of economic activity on the continent is informal. This churning, parallel marketplace is off the map of official export statistics, but supports the development of what the Atlas authors call ""know-where"" -- a corollary of ""know-how"" that is a hallmark of growing complexity. This hidden advantage is further good news for Africa. To be sure, the Atlas ignores the service-driven aspects of the global economy. But it also rejects the analytical habit that says the Millennium Development Goals are the most useful predictors of economic development. This posture has the legitimacy of accuracy: over 40 years of trade data, the Atlas outperforms the World Governance Indicators, and is ten times more accurate than the World Economic Forum's index of competitiveness. This demonstrates the drawbacks with empiricism generally: Freedom House political rankings, the United Nations Human Development Index, World Bank reports -- not to mention analysis from Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service, and other ratings agencies that proved fallible during regent financial upheavals. These can make sweeping claims that affect public and private decision-making. This Atlas -- in which resource-poor nations like Namibia and Ethiopia outperform Italy and Israel -- gets us closer to a different truth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dayo Olopade .","Harvard researchers have a new way of predicting African countries' growth .
The new metric links the level of a country's complexity with wealth creation .
Olopade argues that Africa, therefore, may have a hidden economic advantage ."
"(CNN) -- One person aboard a single-engine plane was killed Friday after the aircraft crashed in a West Los Angeles neighborhood, authorities said. The pilot of the Cessna 210 declared an emergency for unknown reasons around 6:10 p.m. shortly after leaving Santa Monica Airport, according to Ian Gregor, a spokesman with the Federal Aviation Administration in its Western-Pacific region. The plane then went down about three miles from the airport in a residential neighborhood in West Los Angeles, a few miles from the University of California, Los Angeles, said Gregor. Overhead video from CNN affiliate KTLA showed firefighters working to douse a fire as most of the plane, including a visible part of its wing, lay in the middle of a road. The aircraft appeared to have hit at least one tree, but not any buildings directly. The Los Angeles city fire department said in an e-mail that one person died in the crash, though his or her identity was not released. ""No other patients discovered; no home damage from fire,"" the fire department said. It was not immediately clear how many people were aboard the aircraft at the time it went down, according to Gregor, and there were no reports of injuries on the ground. The FAA spokesman said the aircraft is registered to a Santa Monica resident.

"(CNN) -- The last South Korean employees left Mount Kumgang resort in North Korea Tuesday morning as the struggle over the scenic mountain facility continued. Fourteen South Koreans and two Chinese workers left after 11 a.m. Tuesday, South Korea's Unification Ministry said. The ministry said it had no idea when the workers might return. The move came a day after North Korea announced it would seize all assets in the area. The joint project at Mount Kumgang was started in 1998 to boost reconciliation between the two Koreas and to give North Korea a chance to earn money. But Seoul suspended South Korean tours to the facility after the 2008 shooting of a South Korean tourist by a North Korean soldier when the woman allegedly walked into an off-limits area. North Korea said Monday it would seize the South Korean properties that it said had been abandoned by Seoul and gave the remaining South Korean employees 72 hours to leave. South Korea has rejected the North's threats. The Unification Ministry issued a statement saying, ""We cannot accept North Korea's unilateral announcement of freezing South Korean assets in Mount Kumgang. We demand the situation be restored immediately."" South Korea says it wants security assurances from the North before allowing South Koreans tour groups to return to the resort. North Korea wanted the tour groups resumed immediately. Pyongyang has periodically threatened to seize the resort unless the tours -- a key source of foreign currency for the impoverished regime -- were resumed. Recent talks failed between the two sides and Hyundai Asan, a private South Korean business that invested millions of dollars in the project.","Fourteen South Koreans and two Chinese workers leave Tuesday morning .

"(CNN) -- A hot air balloon crash in New Zealand early Saturday killed 11 people -- the pilot and 10 passengers -- officials said. No one survived the crash, which happened on the outskirts of Carterton, a town northeast of Wellington. A fire likely started on board the balloon, sending it plummeting to the ground, said Superintendent Mike Rusbatch, Wellington District commander for New Zealand Police. It was not immediately clear what started the fire, though eyewitnesses said the balloon had hit a power line, according to police. ""This is an absolutely tragic incident and our thoughts are with the families of the deceased. We are in the process of notifying next of kin. However, we will not be releasing any names until all next of kin have been advised,"" Rusbatch said. A police spokeswoman said all the victims were from the wider Wellington area. An investigation into the cause of the accident is under way. A witness to the crash told Radio New Zealand that the balloon was on fire as it fell. He was in his garden when he heard a hissing sound and looked up to see flames climbing the sides of the basket. When the balloon hit the ground, a large cloud of smoke ascended, Radio New Zealand reported. The weather was likely not a factor in the crash, according to Jill Stringer, a spokeswoman for the Wairarapa District Health Board. ""It was a perfect morning for ballooning,"" she said. CNN's Samira Said contributed to this report.","NEW: Victims are all from the Wellington area .

"Washington (CNN) -- Imagine that some member of Congress back in the 1990s had devoted himself or herself to toughening America against terrorism. He or she had introduced legislation to require airlines to harden their cockpit doors. After years of work, he or she at last prevailed and the new law went into effect sometime in early 2000. The 9/11 plot would have been thwarted without any American ever knowing that the plot had existed. Question: Would we now remember that imaginary member of Congress as a person of wisdom and foresight who averted a national disaster? Hardly. In a world in which 9/11 never happened, the people who prevented it would have gone unremembered and unthanked. Or worse. It's very possible that they would have been laughed at as tedious people who invested ridiculous amounts of energy against a probably imaginary threat -- the way, say, some laughed at the people who solved the Y2K problem about that same time. Of all the unfairnesses in politics, the greatest unfairness is how little we reward the supreme public service: ""to provide against preventable evils,"" in the famous phrase of the British politician, Enoch Powell. The politicians who act after disaster reap the gratitude of the nation, like Rudy Giuliani amid the rubble of New York City. Officials whose warnings are ignored at least gain the credit of their prophecy if the warnings come to pass. But those who successfully mobilize public action in good time? How would we even know who they are? How do we separate the wise from the unwise, the genuinely visionary from the cranks and hysterics? For every Sheila Bair urging early action about subprime mortgages, there are a hundred Glenn Becks urging Americans to stockpile nonhybrid seeds against the coming global apocalypse. The saddest fate of all, however, befalls the official who saves the country from a greater disaster by incurring or accepting some lesser damage. The politicians who supported the financial rescue in 2008 get no applause. Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah lost his Republican primary in 2008 in large part due to his emphatic support of TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Voters see politicians rushing money to rescue high-flying bankers from the bankers' own irresponsibility and, naturally, the voters do not like it. The politicians insist that they acted to save the country from an even greater disaster. But who believes them? For that matter, who even knows what such a ""greater disaster"" would possibly look like? Suppose for example that Herbert Hoover and his administration had taken all the most exactly correct possible steps in response to the crash of 1929. Suppose they had rapidly infused the banking system with emergency credit, gone off the gold standard when Britain did in 1931, and organized the mutual forgiveness of the enormous debts and reparations left over from World War I. Suppose that -- thanks to this wise action -- the world economy had begun to recover in late 1931. In such a case, the worst year of the Great Depression -- 1932 -- would have been a year of slow economic improvement worldwide rather than radical economic collapse. In such a case, Adolf Hitler might well never have come to power. (The Nazis won their biggest political victory in the German parliamentary elections of July 1932, when they won 37% of the seats. When Germans next voted, in November 1932, the Nazis dropped 2 million votes. But by then the democratic system had nearly terminally collapsed.) Timely effective action in 1929-30 might thus have prevented World War II. Yet the timeliest and most effective action in 1929-30 would still have left the United States much worse off in November 1932 than in November 1928. Herbert Hoover would still have presided over the worst recession in 20th century history and would still have lost the 1932 election to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. No doubt Roosevelt, that supreme opportunist, would have slammed Hoover for his ""bailouts"" and ""giveaways"" to banks and foreigners. And who would ever have known what lay behind the door we did not open? Think of that limit on our knowledge, the next time you are inclined to a hasty judgment of political leaders and their measures. We know what we see. What we cannot see may be what matters most.

"(CNN) -- Syria on Monday denied involvement in last week's bombing that wounded French U.N. troops in Lebanon. The Syrian Foreign Ministry accused France of adopting conspiracy theories about the attack. The remarks came after French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said it was ""probable"" that Syria was involved. Friday's attack was one of several on peacekeepers in the region this year. The bomb went off near a U.N. patrol vehicle in southern Lebanon, wounding five French U.N. troops. A civilian was also wounded, Lebanon's National News Agency reported. Andrea Tenenti, deputy spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said the injuries suffered were light. French and Lebanese officials roundly condemned the strike, which occurred east of the city of Tyre and near the town of Burj Al Shamali. Speaking Sunday evening to France's TV5 Monde, Juppe said, ""We have strong reason to believe these attacks came from there (Syria). ... We think it's most probable, but I don't have proof."" Asked whether Syria uses Hezbollah ""for that kind of attack,"" Juppe responded, ""Absolutely."" Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group in Lebanon, receives financial and political assistance from Syria. Hezbollah said last week's attack was ""aimed against Lebanon's security and stability"" and called on ""the security apparatuses to exert all efforts to put an end to such attacks."" Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi responded Monday to Juppe's remarks, strongly denying any involvement in the ""reprehensible act,"" Syrian state-run news agency SANA reported. ""It seems that the French foreign minister is now adopting conspiracy theories, which he accuses others of doing,"" Makdissi added. Hezbollah issued a statement saying it was surprised by Juppe's ""behavior."" It called on him ""to correct his position, and pay heed to the seriousness of this kind of accusations which represent great injustice, and which Hezbollah completely reject."" U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon monitors the cessation of hostilities between Lebanon and Israel. It has been in southern Lebanon since the nation's 1978 conflict with Israel. After the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, the peacekeepers' mandate was expanded to include helping Lebanon keep the country's south ""free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons"" other than government troops. In July, an explosion in the port city of Sidon left six French troops wounded. And in May, a blast wounded six Italian troops from the 15,000-member contingent. CNN's Josh Levs, Nada Husseini, Amir Ahmed and Niki Cook contributed to this report.","NEW: Hezbollah rejects Juppe's accusation .

"(CNN) -- Love or hate Google, you probably don't expect this sort of message from one of the largest and most innovative Internet and technology companies in the world: . ""The iOS app we launched today contained a bug with notifications,"" the company wrote Wednesday on Twitter. ""We have pulled the app to fix the problem. Sorry we messed up."" That's just one of the ways Google screwed up this week, according to tech pundits and bloggers. The company also released an update to Google Reader that was described by a former employee as ""a disaster."" ""Maybe Google isn't so invincible after all,"" the site InfoWorld asked. The complaints raise two deeper issues about Google: . First is the long-aired gripe that the company develops cooler and better-functioning smartphone apps for Android devices than it does for Apple's iOS. That makes some sense. After all, Google created Android, and has a business interest in seeing that smartphone platform succeed over that of its competitors. The new Gmail app, however, is raising questions about the company's ability to put out apps that -- at the very least -- will function on Apple devices. ""The real question here is how were these problems not caught during testing, either on Google's part or Apple's? (Conspiracy theory: Apple did catch the errors, but approved the app anyway),"" the blog TechCrunch wrote. Second, this week's botched Gmail app for iOS digs at Google's image as an innovative company. If Google keeps releasing disappointing products, people may stop being excited about the company as a whole, MG Siegler, a tech pundit, wrote on his personal blog. ""They release something, and I no longer have any faith that it's going to be any good,"" Siegler wrote on Wednesday in a post titled ""Faith No More."" ""It's hard to get excited about a company like that. It's the same reason why it's hard to get excited when Microsoft and Yahoo release new things. The track record just isn't there any more. The faith is gone."" This week's controversy follows several less-than-thrilling product launches from Google. Google+, the company's effort to compete with Facebook, has seen its traffic plunge. Other Google products, from Google Offers to Google Latitude, never became break-out successes. And that's not to mention Google Wave, Google Buzz and Google Health, which the company killed. Google has had trouble with the functionality of its iOS apps, in particular. ""Previously, the company pulled its Google Voice app from the iOS App Store because of continuous crashing in iOS 5,"" the site PC World says. ""Google also had to fix several bugs in its Google+ iOS app a few months ago, but never removed the app from the store. Given Google's tendency to release products in beta form, these aren't huge surprises."" Others are less forgiving. ""Given the size and importance of the company, it's a joke really. Yes, they have Android, which they are clearly going to favor over Apple's rival mobile platform, but come on,"" Siegler wrote. ""When you release sub-par products, you look sub-par yourself. Customers don't care what platform it's on, and don't care what politics are going on behind the scenes at the company. If you release s---, you look like s---. It's much better to release nothing at all."" Tech pundits also piled criticism on the new version of Google Reader, which includes integration with the company's social network but isn't considered to be as aesthetically pleasing. ""Someone took the magic color-removing wand and drenched the whole page in grey,"" wrote Brian Shih, who is a former product manager for Google Reader. ""It's so unbelievably stark, it's hard to imagine a more desolate experience."" ""There's almost no way Google could have blundered more disastrously here,"" writes Forbes. It seems the only thing Google can get right this week is a pumpkin-carving video. If you've taken a look at the new Google Reader or the iOS Gmail app, let us know what you think in the comments. To be sure, not all reviews are as scathing as those quoted here.","Google launches Gmail app for iOS that barely functions .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- More than 200 people in South Sudan have been killed in a three-day spree of cattle-rustling attacks that ended Sunday, a state governor said Monday. Kuol Manyang, governor of Jonglei state, said members of the Murle tribe attacked several groups of ethnic Lou Nuer who were in temporary camps where they had brought their herds for grazing. ""The attack has taken place over a wide area in the marshes, the wetlands,"" Manyang said, adding that security forces were unable to deploy to the remote region of Nasir County in the state of Upper Nile, as it is inaccessible by road. Manyang, who is a member of the Dinka tribe, said the Murle crossed from Pibor County, in Jonglei, into neighboring Ethiopia, then traveled north before re-entering South Sudan to carry out the attacks. ""They took the cows and crossed back into Ethiopia,"" he said. ""They are crossing now into South Sudanese territory."" The U.N. peacekeeping mission said it is investigating the attacks, but could not confirm Manyang's report of 200 dead and more injured. ""The U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan confirmed reports of attacks on 9 March on a number of Lou Nuer camps on the border areas of South Sudan and Ethiopia,"" said Kouider Zerrouk, a spokesman for the mission. The United Nations said more than 1,000 people were killed last year in Jonglei state, mostly in clashes between the Murle and Lou Nuer. In late December, an estimated 6,000 Lou Nuer marched into Pibor County and killed hundreds of Murle in a series of attacks that lasted into January, according to the United Nations.","Members of the Murle tribe attacked groups of Lou Nuer, the governor of Jonglei state says .

"Rome (CNN) -- Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has survived political, corruption and sex scandals over the years, but on Friday, a Milan court sentenced the flamboyant politician to four years in prison for tax evasion. Berlusconi, who is likely to appeal, called it an ""unacceptable political sentence"" in an interview that aired on CNN affiliate TGCOM24. ""I was convinced that I would get acquitted of an accusation that is far from the truth,"" he said. ""This is a conviction I can easily define as political, incredible and even intolerable."" He added: ""I'm a victim of judicial harassment."" His trial, which also involved executives from Berlusconi's Mediaset television group and the head of a Swiss bank, concerned the purchase of TV rights for films that were then resold within the group at inflated prices. Prosecutors said the scheme, involving about 3,000 American films, allowed those involved to avoid a major tax bill. They may have to pay a fine of up to â‚¬10 million ($12.9 million) if the court's ruling is upheld. Under the Italian legal system, Berlusconi and his fellow defendants have the right to appeal their sentence twice, in the appeals court and a higher court. Also, because the case dates to July 2006, the statute of limitations will expire next year, meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time. Berlusconi, 76, resigned as prime minister in November amid his country's debt crisis, bringing to an apparent end an 18-year era in which he dominated Italian politics. Through the years, he was accused of embezzlement, fraud and bribery, but he was never convicted until the tax evasion case. He also faces trial on charges that he hired an underage prostitute and later tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was accused of theft. The woman involved in the long-running case is the Moroccan dancer Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed ""Ruby the Heart-stealer."" American movie star George Clooney had been expected to appear Friday as a defense witness in that case but did not show up. The actor's representative said he would not be serving as a witness for Berlusconi.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States should be making all of its electricity with renewable and carbon-free energy in 10 years, former Vice President Al Gore said Thursday. America's security, environmental and economic crises are all related, Al Gore said Thursday. ""The survival of the United States of America as we know it is at risk,"" Gore said. In a speech at Washington's Constitution Hall, Gore touched on an array of the nation's current woes, saying the economic, environmental and national security crises are all related. ""I don't remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously,"" Gore said. To begin to fix all the problems, Gore said, ""the answer is to end our reliance on carbon-based fuels.""  Watch more on Gore's answer to energy crisis » . Gore called on the country to produce all of its electricity from renewable and carbon-free sources in 10 years, a goal he compared to President Kennedy's challenge for the country to put a man on the moon in the 1960s. Gore chastised those who have proposed opening new areas for oil drilling as a solution to U.S. energy problems. ""It is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short-term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now,"" Gore said.  Watch panelists discuss Gore's speech » . New demand from places like China means oil supplies won't be able to meet increasing demand, Gore said. ""The way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of $1 a gallon gasoline,"" the former vice president and Nobel laureate said. Read Gore's full speech . After losing the presidential election to then-Texas Gov. George Bush in 2000, Gore returned to the nation's political main stage with ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" a documentary film detailing global warming's effects on the planet, in 2006. The widely acclaimed film went on to win an Academy Award for best documentary in 2007. In the movie, Gore explains how the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have grown exponentially in the last few decades and how that has led to changes in the Earth's climate, such as shrinking polar ice caps and an increase in the number of hurricanes and other violent storms. To counteract the effects of global warming, Gore has pushed for policies that would reduce the emission of carbon dioxide, such as greater energy conservation and the development of alternative energy sources like wind and solar energy. Gore has also advocated for governments to tax the emission of carbon dioxide. Gore and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for increasing awareness of the climate change issue and for advocating for policies that could potentially offset the effects of global warming. Gore's return to the political arena has drawn increased scrutiny, particularly of his energy use. In 2007, the Tennessee Center for Policy Research chastised Gore for ""extravagant energy use"" at his Nashville, Tennessee, mansion. Gore subsequently has installed solar panels, a geothermal heating and cooling system, compact fluorescent light bulbs and other energy-saving technologies in his home.","Renewable energy can bring equivalent of $1 a gallon gas, Gore says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The ongoing radioactivity releases from damaged nuclear reactors in Japan after last week's historic earthquake are creating ""one of the most challenging humanitarian operations ever conducted,"" according to Cmdr. Jeff Davis, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet in Japan. Davis said Tuesday that for the second time, U.S. helicopter crews have been exposed to elevated, albeit low, levels of radiation during flights near Japan's nuclear reactors. In addition, the Navy is moving three incoming ships to a new location because of ""radiological and navigation hazards"" at their intended destination on the eastern coast of Honshu, according to Davis. Just as in an incident on Sunday, the crew members were stripped of contaminated clothing, scrubbed down with soap and water and tested. In all cases, they no longer tested positive for radiation exposure. On Sunday, tests detected low levels of radioactivity on 17 U.S. Navy helicopter crew members when they returned to the USS Ronald Reagan after conducting disaster relief missions in Japan, the military said Monday. No further contamination was detected after the crew members washed with soap and water, the Navy said. Nevertheless, the U.S. 7th Fleet has temporarily repositioned its ships and planes away from the damaged multi-unit Fukushima nuclear plant. The Navy, however, noted that the most radiation that ship personnel could have received was less than they would receive in a month of exposure to natural radiation sources, such as the rocks, soil and sun. ""This will continue to happen,"" Davis said. He did not know how many personnel tested positive for radiological contamination in the second incident nor what ships they were on. Most of the nine U.S. Navy warships now operating off Japan are involved in helicopter operations. For example, the USS Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group flew 29 sorties on Tuesday and delivered 17 tons of supplies, including food, water and blankets. The USS Tortuga is transporting 300 Japan Ground Self Defense Force personnel and 90 vehicles. Officials expect that air crew members will continue to be exposed to increased low levels of radiation, so the Navy is telling helicopter crews to keep their sleeves rolled down and keep cabin windows closed when possible. And some air crew members, Davis said, have been given potassium iodide pills. The iodide protects a person's thyroid gland from the effects of radioactivity and can reduce the threat of thyroid cancer. U.S. Navy spokesman Capt. Danny Hernandez said the iodide pills were given as a ""precautionary measure only."" The U.S. Army's Camp Zama, about 25 miles outside Tokyo, is also taking steps in light of the potential radiation threat. According to messages posted on U.S. Army - Japan's official Facebook page, health officials have been taking ""environmental radiation readings every 3 hrs"" since Monday. ""All readings taken to date have indicated absolutely no health risk to our community,"" the message read. Nonetheless, the message noted that readings showed ""negligible levels"" that require the implementation of ""mitigating measures,"" including limiting outdoor activities, leaving windows closed and keeping children inside for playtime and school recess. The radiation exposure appears limited to Navy personnel. Representatives for the Marines and Air Force said they have not seen reports of anyone in their services testing positive for exposure. The Navy has three ships with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit on their way to Japan. They are expected to arrive on March 17. Out of concern about radiation, those ships, the USS Essex, USS Harpers Ferry and USS Germantown, will now position in the Sea of Japan on the west coast of Honshu, rather than the east coast, to aid in disaster relief.","Second incident occurs where helicopter crew tests positive for low-level radiation .

"Rome (CNN) -- The body of a mobster buried among cardinals and bishops on a Vatican property has been exhumed in an investigation into a teenage girl's disappearance. Investigators at the church of Sant'Apollinare in central Rome opened the tomb of Enrico ""Renatino"" De Pedis on Monday in the search for clues about what happened to Emanuela Orlandi, the daughter of a prominent Vatican employee. The 15-year-old vanished without a trace after leaving her Vatican apartment for music lessons on the afternoon of June 22, 1983. The mystery has captivated people throughout Italy and triggered numerous conspiracy theories. In the crypt, in addition to De Pedis' body, investigators found dozens of boxes of human bones, which they are testing. At the time of Emanuela's disappearance nearly 30 years ago, a witness reported seeing a girl who fit her description getting into a dark green BMW near the music school, which was adjacent to the Sant'Apollinare church. That lead was never corroborated. In 1981, two years before the girl's disappearance, Turkish national Mehmet Ali Agca shot Pope John Paul II. In the days after Emanuela disappeared, her parents received anonymous phone calls from someone promising the safe return of their daughter if the Vatican released Agca. Meanwhile, an anonymous caller told police that Emanuela was kidnapped to keep her father, Ercole Orlandi, quiet. That caller said Ercole Orlandi had stumbled upon sensitive documents that tied banker Roberto Calvi to an organized crime syndicate. Calvi was known as ""God's banker"" for his close association with both the Holy See and its primary banking facility, Banco Ambrosiano. Orlandi worked in the Vatican's special events office that organizes papal functions and Catholic celebrations. Calvi was found hanged in London in 1982. Speculation turned from suicide to homicide in that case. The tipster to police in Italy said Orlandi's daughter was nabbed to ensure her father's silence. Ercole Orlandi died in 2004. In 2005, another anonymous call to an Italian detective said Emanuela was kidnapped on the orders of the then-vicar of Rome, Cardinal Ugo Poletti, and that ""the secret to the mystery lies in a tomb in Sant'Apollinare basilica"" -- specifically De Pedis' tomb. De Pedis was gunned down in Rome in 1990 and his body was moved to the basilica some time before 1997, presumably either as part of a secret deal for a massive loan De Pedis made to the Vatican or to protect his tomb from being desecrated by rival gang members. In 2008, De Pedis' mistress said he was involved in Emanuela's kidnapping and that the girl was buried under the foundation of a house outside of Rome. Investigators searched that house but found that the concrete foundation was poured the year before the girl's disappearance and could not have been connected to the crime. The Vatican has distanced itself from the Orlandi controversy. In a three-page letter broadcast on RAI television, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said he asked Vatican cardinals whether the Vatican's failure to collaborate in the original kidnapping probe was ""normal and justifiable affirmation of Vatican sovereignty, or if in fact circumstances were withheld that might have helped clear something up."" The Vatican cooperated immediately with the exhumation. After opening the tomb Monday, investigators found De Pedis' body so well preserved that scientific police were able to confirm his identity through fingerprints. Also inside the crypt were the boxes of bones, according to investigators on the scene. The church has been used for burials for two centuries. Still, all of the bones will be tested to determine whether they are tied to De Pedis or to Emanuela's disappearance. De Pedis will not be reburied in the church, the Vatican said. De Pedis family lawyer Lorenzo Radogna said the remains will either be cremated or reinterred in a public cemetery in Rome.","The body of mobster Enrico ""Renatino"" De Pedis was moved to a Rome basilica in the 1990s .

"(CNN) -- A Las Vegas resort is warning some former guests that they may have come in contact with high levels of the legionella bacteria, which causes Legionnaires' disease, a form of pneumonia, the hotel announced Thursday. The Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas is telling guests who stayed at the Aria from June 21 to July 4, 2011, that they may need to be tested for the bacteria, according to a letter to guests from Paul Berry, the hotel operations' vice president. Water tests at that time indicated high levels of the bacteria in several guest rooms. The hotel -- part of a vast collection of hotel rooms, condominiums and its own shopping center in Las Vegas' CityCenter -- has been connected in the past with six cases of Legionnaires' disease, said the Southern Nevada Health District. The district identified the six cases beginning in the spring of 2010, said Jennifer Sizemore, a manager at the health district. The hotel regularly inspects their water supply with a series of tests; the health district only gets involved when there are cases of illness or elevated levels of bacteria reported, said Sizemore. The health district contacted the hotel after the first reported case and ""inspected their water system ... they had everything in place that needed to be,"" said Sizemore. ""There wasn't evidence at that time that indicated they had (the bacteria)."" From the six reported cases of Legionnaires' disease, all six had healthy recoveries, said Sizemore. Guests before the reported window of June 21 to July 4 are past the incubation period of the bacteria, so any symptoms they would've shown are past, said Sizemore. The usual symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include fever, chills, muscle aches and headaches, which are similar to pneumonia, so the disease may be difficult to diagnose, according to the health district. The hotel advised guests who have experienced these symptoms to seek medical attention. Symptoms show up between two to 14 days after exposure and it is contracted through exposure to contaminated water or when an individual breathes in a mist or vapor, the health district said. The health district said the bacteria is found most usually in water, such as hot and cold water taps, hot water tanks and water from air-conditioning systems. It can't be acquired through contact with people, said the health district. ""We're working to replace fear and anxiety with facts and information,"" said Gordon Absher, vice president of public affairs for MGM Resorts International, which runs the Aria resort. The most recent tests indicate the bacteria was not present in any detectable way, but tests will continue, Berry said. The Aria, completed in 2009, is a 4,004-room, 568-suite resort that also has an on-site casino and spa.","A Las Vegas resort is contacting guests who may have encountered bacteria .

"(CNN) -- Three Pakistani paramilitary soldiers were killed this week in a cross-border firefight between Pakistan and India, officials said Thursday. The soldiers were moving from one post to another along the border when they came under fire by Indian forces, said Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, Pakistan army spokesman. Since a cease-fire is in effect, the firing by Indian forces was unprovoked, Abbas said. But Pakistani forces retaliated after the shots were fired, he said. It was unclear whether the incident took place late Tuesday or Wednesday, as Pakistani and Indian officials provided different times. Lt. Col. J.S. Brar, Indian defense spokesman for the disputed Kashmir region, said there were two violations of the cease-fire on the Line of Control, the de facto border between Indian- and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. In the first, fighting continued for about an hour, he said. A second violation took place Thursday morning, he said, and one Indian soldier was injured. Brar said he could not comment on Pakistani casualties. Pakistani officials said severe weather conditions in Kashmir, a Himalayan region, hampered removal of the soldiers' bodies. Pakistan has asked the Indian local commanding authority for a full report on the incident. India and Pakistan have have fought three wars since the partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947. Two of them were over Kashmir, which is claimed by both nuclear powers. On August 20, an Indian army officer and five militants were killed in clashes along the Line of Control. India has accused Pakistan of aiding infiltration into Indian Kashmir, which has battled separatist violence for more than two decades. Islamabad has denied the accusations. More than 40,000 have died in the violence, officials say. CNN's Sumnima Das and Mukhtar Ahmed and journalist Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","The incident occurred along the Line of Control .

"(CNN) -- Answers have been elusive on what may have contributed to the February 15, 2011, ambush that killed a U.S. agent and injured another while on assignment in Mexico. Was Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata's death due in part to negligence by his supervisors? Do the U.S. gun shops that sold the weapons used in the attack share some responsibility? What about the armored vehicle company whose SUV failed to protect the agents? Now, the family of the slain agent, in a $75 million lawsuit filed Tuesday, alleges that all these and more were responsible for Zapata's death. The court docket originally listed a $75 billion demand, but was amended on Thursday. A second immigration agent, Victor Avila, was wounded when he and Zapata were ambushed on a highway in San Luis Potosi. The two were traveling to Mexico City in an armored car with diplomatic plates. They were run off the road and attacked from two vehicles by gunmen who fired indiscriminately, Mexican authorities said. Avila is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit. The lawsuit names more than 20 defendants, including the U.S. government, the straw purchasers who acquired the weapons used, and the federal firearms officials who oversaw the flawed ""Fast and Furious"" operation aimed at tracking the flow of weapons across the U.S.-Mexican border. Some people, including Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, have asked whether a ""gun-walking"" program similar to Fast and Furious played a role in Zapata's killing. Is Mexico becoming the new Iraq for American agents? The lawsuit alleges that as early as 2010, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had identified brothers Otilio and Ranferi Osorio and Kelvin Morrison as straw purchasers for Mexican cartels, but did not act to stop them from purchasing more weapons, a pair of which ultimately found their way to the crime scene in Mexico. ""ATF had an opportunity and probable cause to arrest the Osorio brothers and Morrison but failed to do so,"" the lawsuit states. It names the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, as well as the supervisors of Fast and Furious, as the group that developed the strategy of letting guns ""walk"" that was allegedly also used in Texas. The government ""placed weapons in the hands of a dangerous criminal organization and failed to warn, thereby placing agents Zapata and Avila in harm's way,"" according to the lawsuit. Tuesday's filing follows a similar lawsuit filed two months ago by the family of slain Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. His killing in Arizona, near the Mexican border, brought the strategy of gun walking to light. Terry's family sued federal officials and the owner of a gun shop. The Zapata suit goes further, blaming the agents' supervisors for sending them on the risky trip to pick up a package. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico had issued a warning to avoid driving in certain regions, and there were other options for delivering the package, the lawsuit states. ""Despite opposition by Avila and despite having full knowledge of the dangers present with the package pick-up, (the supervisors) instructed Avila and Zapata to proceed with the directive,"" the court document states. The company that built the armored Chevrolet Suburban that the agents were in also shares responsibility for ""faulty safety features"" on the vehicle, the lawsuit alleges. After Zapata was forced to pull over after being boxed in by his assailants, he placed the vehicle in ""park,"" which automatically unlocked the doors, creating the opportunity the attackers needed to breach the vehicle, it says. Finally, the lawsuit says the gun sellers should have been aware of false statements made by the straw buyers whose gun purchases ended up in Mexico. ""All of these illegal firearm purchases occurred under extremely suspicious circumstances,"" according to the lawsuit. One of the gun sellers named in the suit, JJ's Pawn Shop in Beaumont, Texas, says it did nothing illegal. The president of the pawn shop, Jim Hedrick, said he was not aware of the lawsuit, but remembers the gun purchase in question. The ATF and FBI both went through the buyer's paperwork and approved the sale, he said. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency continues to mourn Zapata's loss and honors his sacrifice, but it does not comment on pending litigation as a matter of policy, spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez said. Responses were not immediately available from the other named defendants. One of the suspects in Zapata's killing, Julian Zapata Espinoza, also known as ""Tweety,"" was arrested in Mexico and extradited to the United States in late 2011. He is charged in a four-count indictment with murdering an officer or employee of the United States; one count of attempted murder of an officer of employees of the United States; one count of attempted murder of an internationally protected person; and one count of using, carrying, brandishing and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence causing death. Zapata Espinoza pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial.","NEW: The court docket is amended to state that the lawsuit is for $75 million .

At least 35 survivors have been rescued, said local police chief Shahabuddin Khan, who is supervising the rescue operation. Khan could not say how many people were on the ferry when it sank early Tuesday in southern Bangladesh. The MV Shariatpur-1 sank in the Meghna River after colliding with a cargo ferry while passengers slept, a survivor said. ""We were seven in a cabin in the ferry, and six of my family members are still missing,"" Mohammad Dulal Dewan told CNN Tuesday. ""Everything happened before I could understand anything."" The 55-year-old survivor said he ""jumped into the river and was rescued by people in another passing ferry."" Dewan and his family were traveling to Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, to see his brother-in-law off to the United States. Shamim Fakir was scheduled to fly on his U.S. trip early Wednesday, Dewan said. He was still missing Tuesday evening. Khan, the police chief, said Tuesday that divers from the Bangladesh navy and the Fire Service and Civil Defence took part in the operation alongside police and the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority. About 30 people were initially rescued after the ferry collided with the cargo boat on the river in Munshiganj district, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Dhaka. The ferry was traveling to the nation's capital from Shariatpur district. Ferry accidents are common on Bangladesh's vast river network. Hundreds of people die in such accidents every year as the operators often ignore rules. Nearly 4,000 people are estimated to have lost their lives in ferry accidents since 1977.","At least 112 bodies have been recovered, the police chief in charge of the rescue says .

"(CNN) -- One of two teenage students stabbed at a Chicago school has died, police said. The incident occurred Thursday morning inside the front door of the city's AMIkids Infinity School and prompted authorities to rush the teens to a nearby hospital, according to police spokesman Mike Sullivan. ""It is a tragedy for us,"" said school Vice President Shawna Vercher. ""Our hearts are with the families involved, and we are going to make sure our priorities are with those families. ""We will offer our support to help them get through this crisis,"" she said, noting that the facility has a screening process to keep weapons out of the school. The process, which includes the use of an electronic wand to screen entrants, takes place between the first and second set of school doors. The alleged attacker, a 17-year-old boy, is suspected of stabbing his victims inside the front door but prior to going through the wand screening, authorities said. The student who died was also a 17-year-old boy who had been previously listed in critical condition after the attack. Another 17-year-old boy was listed in serious condition, Sullivan said. School officials say AMIkids operates 56 facilities across the nation and works with local school districts to educate students who have been expelled or suspended from schools elsewhere. Teachers at AMIkids schools are trained in crisis control, officials said.","NEW: Alleged attacker had not yet gone through wand screening .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Thousands of people are taking part Saturday in a march through the Northern Ireland city of Belfast that many fear could inflame tensions between Catholics and Protestants. Over the course of the day, up to 30,000 people were expected to join the Ulster Covenant parade, held to mark the 100th anniversary of the signing of a pro-union document which helped shape Northern Ireland's history. The parade left from Belfast City Hall Saturday morning, headed for the grounds of Stormont, beside the Parliament Buildings. Concerns over potential disorder along the route center have focused on an area near St. Patrick's Church, where violence flared up between Catholics and Protestants earlier this month. The parade passed near the flashpoint Roman Catholic church, near the city center, without incident Saturday morning but must still return along that route in the evening. Hundreds of police officers are stationed along the route in that area, with many more elsewhere in the city, as the Northern Ireland police service braces for possible trouble. About 2,000 people took part in the morning parade feeding into the main demonstration, in which tens of thousands are expected to take part. The parade, a special event for the Ulster Covenant centenary, is expected to be one of the biggest held in years. Hundreds of parades take place across Northern Ireland each year, the majority involving the Protestant Orange Order and associated organizations, although pro-Irish nationalists also have marches. The Northern Ireland Parades Commission rules on which marches are allowed to take place and which are banned, in an effort to keep friction to a minimum. Most parades pass off peacefully, but when members of one community march near or through neighborhoods dominated by another, violence sometimes occurs. The rioting in Belfast earlier this month, which left dozens of police officers injured, was some of the worst seen by the city in years. Tensions have been high all summer, and behind-the-scenes talks over Saturday's highly symbolic parade did not succeed in brokering a compromise between the Catholic and Protestant communities over the staging of the event. The Ulster Covenant was a document signed in 1912 by nearly half a million people in opposition to steps by the government in Westminster to introduce ""Home Rule,"" or self-government, in Ireland within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The majority of the island gained independence in 1921, following two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles. The three decades of ensuing violence between the Irish Republican Army and loyalists claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people, most of them north of the border. While the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 effectively ended the conflict, suspicions between Catholics and Protestants remain. Under the terms of the landmark accord, terrorist groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the IRA, now work with pro-British politicians in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government. Journalist Peter Taggart and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Thousands of police are deployed in Belfast to prevent possible outbreaks of violence .

"(CNN) -- ""Be sure that buttocks and female breasts are adequately covered."" ""Thong type costumes are problematic."" ""Avoid sheer see-through clothing."" Is this the new edict of a religiously conservative government that wants to make sure that men -- and especially women -- are covered up? Could it be the dress code for visiting the Vatican, the Wailing Wall, the Dome of the Rock or other holy sites? Nope, these words are actually part of the wardrobe advisory e-mail that CBS sent to attendees of this Sunday's Grammy Awards. Yep, CBS, the network that brought you a promo during last week's Super Bowl for its show, ""2 Broke Girls,"" featuring the show's young female stars writhing on a stripper pole, is now concerned about sending the wrong message. The language that CBS used in explaining its clothing recommendations is actually hilarious -- it seems to have been written by a cross between an elderly lawyer and Goody Procter from ""The Crucible."" Predicting the 2013 Grammy winners . Here are some of the highlights: Talent should, ""avoid exposing bare fleshy under curves of the buttocks and buttock crack."" What exactly is ""fleshy under curves"" and why does it sound so oddly hot? (And by frowning upon the showing of buttock cracks, does this mean that many of the union plumbers working at the Grammy venue may also have wardrobe problems?) CBS wants attendees to avoid outfits that could ""expose female breast nipples."" And the network also put its foot down on clothes that expose the ""bare sides"" of breasts, aka, the famed and increasingly popular ""sideboob."" However, the most bizarrely worded wardrobe line is that talent must, ""be sure that the genital region is adequately covered so that there is no visible 'puffy' bare skin exposure."" What exactly is ""puffy"" bare skin? Is that code for some word I don't know about? And why did CBS put the word ""puffy"" in quotes? It sounds even dirtier that way. My big question is this: What caused CBS to be so concerned that this year it issued a written wardrobe advisory? CBS has aired the Grammys for more than 40 straight years, dating back to 1973. Obviously over that time we have seen some pretty risquÃ© outfits. Could it be because CBS wants to appease conservatives who freaked out over the outfit Beyonce wore while performing in the Super Bowl halftime show? 21 questions for the 2012 Grammys . Right-wing radio host Laura Ingraham protested Beyonce's outfit with a sarcastic tweet: ""Very family-friendly dancing S&M by Beyonce. What every girl shd aspire to. #waronwomen."" A writer at ""The National Review"" penned a column entitled, ""Put a Dress on,"" demanding that Beyonce not wear a ""black teddy"" on stage but something less revealing. (Of course, if similar language was espoused from people in the Muslim world, these same conservatives would denounce it as Muslims attempting to oppress women, but it's somehow OK when they do it.) The real reason is unclear. CBS declined to officially comment but sources there stated that a similar verbal wardrobe warning had been given in the past. What is clear is that this wardrobe advisory is not gender neutral. Its very language tells women what they cannot wear. ""Female breasts"" must be adequately covered. ""Female breast nipples"" must not be exposed. Even where there's no specific gender reference, we all understand that no one is concerned that Bruce Springsteen, who is nominated for a Grammy this year, will show up exposing the, ""bare fleshy under curves"" of his buttocks. No, CBS is more concerned with making sure that women are properly covered. 'Boss' auctions guitar, lesson . Beyond the apparent sexism of the wardrobe advisory, we also need to keep in mind that freedom of expression is not just words. Freedom of expression also includes expressing yourself through the clothes you wear, especially for the talented musical artists attending the Grammys. These performers should be able to dress any way they choose, both men and women. A big part of the Grammys is enjoying the range of outfits worn, from the glamorous to the provocative to ones that make you wonder what was the bet the person lost that made them wear that outfit -- I'm looking at you Nicki Minaj, who last year dressed like a bright red version of ""The Flying Nun"" and was accompanied by a man dressed like the pope. And of course, if someone wears an outfit that truly violates FCC regulations, then CBS should not allow that person on camera. That is not only CBS' right, it's CBS' obligation. But the CBS wardrobe advisory note goes too far -- it both hampers creativity and imposes restrictions that are sexist. I hope that at Sunday's Grammys we see people dressed as creatively and provocatively as they choose. Part of me even hopes that Bruce Springsteen wears an outfit that exposes his ""puffy"" bare skin -- whatever that may be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","CBS sent a wardrobe advisory e-mail to Grammy attendees to cover up well .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- When Joe Saenz walked up to a Whittier, California-area home in the summer of 2008, a surveillance video shows he was smiling, rubbing his hands together and greeting associates, according to authorities. On the streets he was known by the nickname ""Smiley,"" and his demeanor that day fit that handle -- right up until he reached the front yard of the home. That's when, the FBI and police say, he drew a gun and shot one man several times in the head, execution-style. The slaying, caught on video, was over drug money, authorities believe. It was not the first murder Saenz was accused of. Authorities also say that in 1998 he killed two rival gang members and kidnapped, raped and killed his girlfriend. The FBI placed Saenz on its 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list in 2009. Authorities suspect he later became a hit man for a Mexican drug cartel. Despite being featured on the ""America's Most Wanted"" television program and on the websites of the FBI, the Los Angeles Police Department, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Saenz eluded arrest for 14 years. On Friday, authorities announced his capture in Guadalajara, Mexico, after a tip led officers to his location. ""The adage that you can run but not hide speaks truthful here,"" said Bill Lewis of the FBI's Los Angeles field office. During a news conference Monday, Lewis said Saenz was arrested by Mexican authorities without incident on the second story of a modest apartment building above a beauty salon. He said the $100,000 reward that had been offered for information leading to Saenz's arrest will be paid but he declined to identity the source of the tip. ""Surveillance of the vicinity and attempts to arrest him went on for several weeks,"" Lewis said. ""With the assistance of our Mexican law enforcement partners, we were able to take him into custody."" Saenz was flown Friday to Los Angeles, where he faces the multiple murder counts. Before authorities discovered the video of the 2008 killing, Los Angeles police detectives theorized Saenz might be dead. The grisly crime scene in Whittier, about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, indicated to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Detective Traci Gonzales there were drug and gang ties to the slaying, so she showed the video to Los Angeles Police Department Detective Ron Chavarria, a veteran on the gang beat. With that, the videotape broke open a case that had frustrated local and federal authorities for more than a decade. Now detectives knew Saenz was still out there. Police say Saenz was a member of the Cuatro Flats gang in the Hollenbeck area of Los Angeles, where he grew up and where 34 gangs fight over turf and drug trafficking. He stepped into police cross-hairs in 1998 after the fatal shooting of the two rival gang members at a housing complex. AC360Ëš revisits Hollenbeck gangs . Then, police say, he was a fresh-faced 22-year-old with a dark side. ""Just gruesome, gruesome, cold-blooded,"" detective Chavarria said. ""Just walks right up to these guys, shoots them and then just walks over and stands over them and shoots them each in the head and casually walks away."" Police made his capture a priority. ""We had pictures of him constantly on our dashboard so that there was no question if we saw this guy we knew who he was,"" said Chavarria, who spent time with a gang patrol unit in the neighborhood. Within two weeks, Jose Luis Saenz -- known as Joe, Louie Louie and more than two dozen other aliases -- was wanted for a third murder. Investigators say that on July 25, 1998, after hearing that Sigreta Hernandez, the mother of his child, would turn him in for the double killing, Saenz kidnapped, raped and murdered her at his grandmother's house. ""He leaves a note indicating that his grandmother has nothing to do with the murder and that he left the scene. And from that point on he became a fugitive,"" Gonzales said. Authorities believe Saenz moved up the hierarchy from local gangs to international drug trafficking, crossing the border with falsified documents. Los Angeles County Sheriff's authorities said Monday the motive for the 2008 murder was $500,000 in cash earmarked for Saenz that authorities seized during a traffic stop involving an alleged associate of Saenz. As a fugitive, Saenz is suspected of traveling through Mexico, Central America, Canada and the United States while trafficking in narcotics. ""He was quite an affable character who masked his identity to elude authorities, Lewis said. While he avoided capture for years, Saenz reportedly made statements that he planned to kill a police officer if they ever found him and arrested him, according to the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitive website. During his flight from Guadalajara to California over the weekend, authorities say, Saenz bragged about his extensive travel, including to the Los Angeles neighborhood where he was first indoctrinated into a gang, and to Los Angeles Laker pro basketball games. ""We heard rumors that not only citizens were afraid of him, but also his own gang members were afraid of him,"" detective Chavarria said. The arrest of Saenz involved a multiple-agency task force that includes the Mexican National Institute of Immigration, the Mexican attorney general, the FBI's legal attache in Mexico City and its sub-office in Guadalajara, Mexico, the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department and the Los Angeles Police Department. ""It was in the endless perseverance of the hunt and continued efforts over the past decade that led to his capture,"" said LAPD Deputy Chief Michael Moore. At Monday's news conference, Chavarria described Saenz as a calculated cold-blooded murderer who is more intelligent than most gang members. But it was the chilling video that put him on the FBI's Most Wanted list, the detective said. ""He always seemed to stay one step ahead of us,"" Chavarria said. ""It looks like he really enjoys what he does, he enjoys killing people."" Saenz was scheduled to be arraigned Monday in Pomona County, California, for the 2008 slaying and the 1998 death of Hernandez. On Wednesday he will be arraigned for the two other 1998 shooting deaths, authorities said. CNN's Kara Finnstrom contributed to this report.","A fugitive arrested in Mexico is suspected in four slayings .

"Madrid (CNN) -- The Las Vegas Sands Corp. finally made it official: Madrid will be the site of its next multibillion dollar casino and hotel complex and not Barcelona, which just hours before the announcement said it would build its own, smaller gambling resort. ""Barcelona is an outstanding tourism destination and choosing Madrid over Barcelona was not an easy selection,"" Las Vegas Sands chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson said in statement late Friday in Las Vegas. Spaniards have dubbed the project ""EuroVegas"" and news media have focused almost daily headlines on the fierce competition between Madrid, the nation's capital, and Barcelona, the second-largest city, to win the project. The battle came amid the nation's deep economic crisis, with an unemployment rate of more than 24% overall and more than 50% for Spanish youth. The Las Vegas Sands project promised to generate up to 250,000 jobs, reports say. Plans indicate the project would be an approximately 18 billion euros ($22 billion) development with 12 hotels including 36,000 rooms, six casinos and three golf courses to be built over a decade. But Las Vegas Sands Corp. would provide only up to 35% of the equity, and the company said the final size of the project, its specific location in Madrid and financing options still need to be determined. Spain is in the process of receiving up to a 100-billion euro bailout from European authorities for some of the country's weakest banks, which ran up huge debts when the decade-long property boom crashed. Even at the healthiest banks here, credit is still tight. Critics of the gambling complex say it's the wrong kind of development model for a country trying to pull out of recession. The hotel and casino jobs, critics say, would be mainly low-skilled and low paying, besides attracting organized crime to Spain, which is already one of the world's top tourist destinations. Earlier Friday, the Catalan regional government, whose capital is Barcelona, announced its own gambling resort, called Barcelona World, to be built near the city around an existing amusement park. Barcelona World would be a 4.5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) investment, with six hotels and six casinos, enough to generate 20,000 jobs, about a fourth of the investment of EuroVegas in Madrid. Weeks ago, Las Vegas Sands indicated it would say in early September whether it had chosen Madrid or Barcelona for the project. A Madrid opposition politician Tuesday got a jump on his adversaries in the Madrid regional government and the Las Vegas Sands Corp. announcing that he was certain the casino resort would come to Madrid. That set off several days of official denials and no comments. On Thursday, Catalan officials in Barcelona revealed that their offer to host the Las Vegas Sands project expired on August 31. And it came down to Friday, with Catalan officials first, and hours later the Las Vegas Sands Corp., announcing their gambling resorts for Barcelona and Madrid, respectively. Adelson, a major donor to the Republican Party, has built Las Vegas Sands Corp. into a leading global developer of gambling, entertainment and convention resorts. The company has The Venetian and The Palazzo gambling resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, and has expanded into Asian markets, with the Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore. On Macao, through its majority-owned subsidiary Sands China Ltd., it has the Venetian Macao and Sands Macao properties.","""Barcelona is an outstanding tourism destination,"" official says .

"(CNN) -- A leading human rights organization accused NATO on Monday of failing to investigate civilian deaths caused by its airstrikes in Libya that aided in the downfall of Moammar Gadhafi. In a 20-page report titled ""Libya: The Forgotten Victims of NATO Strikes,"" Amnesty International laid out allegations that NATO and the new Libyan government failed not only to document the deaths but also has not paid reparations to the victims and their families. The report said that ""scores of Libyan civilians who did not directly participate in hostilities were killed and many more injured as a result of NATO strikes,"" adding that the 28-member nation alliance has yet to address the incidents in the months since it ended the air campaign. In a statement Monday, NATO defended its campaign, saying the alliance ""carried out our operations with utmost care and precision."" ""NATO has looked into each credible allegation of harm to civilians which has been brought to our attention and will continue to do so,"" NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said. ""This involves an assessment of all NATO records, from target selection to any other data gathered following the strike. This review process has confirmed that the specific targets struck by NATO were legitimate military targets, selected in a manner consistent with the U.N. mandate."" A letter sent by NATO this month to Amnesty International in response to the report said the alliance ""deeply regrets any harm that may have been caused by those airstrikes."" ""While NATO did everything possible to minimize the risk to civilians, in a complex military operation that risk cannot be reduced to zero,"" the NATO letter said, according to the report. The report also faulted the new Libyan government for failing to conduct impartial and thorough investigations, and it recommended it ""ensure that victims of violations of international human law, and their families, receive full reparations."" The Libyan uprising began days after a popular revolution in Egypt forced President Hosni Mubarak from office in February 2011. Gadhafi forces responded brutally to the uprising in Libya, drawing worldwide condemnation for the killing of civilians. NATO began bombing military targets in Libya in March 2011 following the approval of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force by whatever means necessary -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- to protect civilians after Gadhafi's forces. NATO ended its air campaign in October following the death of Gadhafi, who was killed in his hometown of Sirte after more than two months on the run. The report documents that more than 100 civilians, including dozens of children, were killed in NATO airstrikes in Tripoli and elsewhere. It also found that the airstrikes hit private residences, ""possibly due to wrong intelligence, erroneous GPS coordinates or weapons system malfunction."" The report recommends NATO take immediate steps to investigate the casualties and pay reparations for damages. Amnesty International's criticisms of NATO and Libya's government parallel concerns raised by Russia, which approved the Security Council resolution that authorized enforcement of a no-fly zone to protect civilians and then criticized it when it led to widespread bombing of Libyan military forces. Russia and China, which both approved the Libyan resolution, have vetoed a similar one aimed at protecting Syrian civilians in an uprising aimed at ousting President Bashar al-Assad.","NEW: NATO ""carried out our operations with utmost care,"" the alliance says .

"Wilmington, Vermont (CNN) -- Residents of Hatteras Island, N.C., can begin going home Sunday morning, more than a week after most of them evacuated ahead of Hurricane Irene. The staged re-entry through Tuesday will include the villages of Buxton, Hatteras and Frisco, Dare County Energency Management announced Thursday. ""Conditions, utility service and other supporting infrastructure in those villages is the most conducive for re-entry at this time,"" the county said in a statement. ""As conditions improve in the remaining villages, re-entry will be established and announced as soon as possible."" Visitors will not be able to go to Hatteras Island. Instead, they can stay north of Oregon Inlet, the county said. About 2,500 residents of the island who did not take part in a mandatory evacuation have been receiving vital supplies and services. The storm washed out a critical stretch of Highway 12, a road that runs parallel to the Atlantic Ocean and connects Hatteras Island to the other barrier islands on North Carolina's Outer Banks. Causeways from those barrier islands connect them to North Carolina's mainland. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama declared a disaster in Vermont, making federal grants and aid available to those who suffered losses from Tropical Storm Irene. The money can be used by individuals in Chittenden, Rutland, Washington and Windsor counties for temporary housing and home repairs, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Low-cost loans are available to cover uninsured or under-insured property losses. Counties eligible for federal funding to do emergency repairs and work are Addison, Bennington, Caledonia, Chittenden, Essex, Franklin, Lamoille, Orange, Orleans, Rutland, Washington, Windham and Windsor. The president issued disaster declarations earlier this week in North Carolina, New Jersey and New York. Irene killed 43 people from Florida to New England as it marched up the Eastern Seaboard over the weekend, dumping torrential rain. Some of the worst flooding struck Vermont, New Jersey and upstate New York. Ten-foot-high floodwater poured through Eileen Ranslow's 40-year-old flooring business in Wilmington when Irene struck Vermont over the weekend. The family business, where revenue has dwindled in the economic downturn, now faces at least $300,000 in damage. ""It's devastating. It's devastating,"" Ranslow said, her voice cracking. She is not alone, as the effects of Irene continue to be felt in flood-ravaged communities along the U.S. East Coast. Flood advisories remained in place Thursday for portions of New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Virginia and South Carolina. In the days since Irene, the extent of the damage has become more evident in upstate New York, where the storm battered a cluster of communities 50 miles southwest of Albany. ""There is a lot of damage left to clean up. I know the town of Prattsville has been almost completely condemned,"" said Jacob Hubbell of neighboring Margaretville. ""Fleischmanns isn't doing too well either, and Main Street (in) Margaretville has been closed."" ""It's safe to say that we probably won't be back to normal in the Catskills for at least a month."" In northern New Jersey, the Passaic River has begun to settle back into its banks, the National Weather Service said. Most locations are expected to drop below flood stage during the weekend as the high water works its way downstream. The development will be welcome news in the towns of Wayne, Totowa, Little Falls, Paterson and Woodland Park, where about 1,700 residents were evacuated from their homes this week. Obama will travel to Paterson on Sunday to view the damage, the White House announced. The full extent of Irene's destruction won't be known for some time. The federal government estimates that the cost from wind damage alone will exceed $1 billion. Analysts have put the total expected cost of Irene much higher. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Thursday the storm also took a toll on agricultural production. ""I had an opportunity to take a look at fields in North Carolina,"" he said. ""I have never seen anything like it. The corn was just totally destroyed. Tobacco hit hard, cotton hit hard."" It remains to be seen how some other crops, such as soybeans and tomatoes, fared, he said, but ""it's very clear that farmers in North Carolina, Virginia, along the East Coast have suffered pretty significant losses."" But, he said, it's unlikely that higher prices will result, as ""we have such a diverse agriculture in the United States and we have so many acres planted and so many different crops. I don't think this is going to affect much of anything."" The federal government's tab for the storm could exhaust the $800 million left in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief fund before the fiscal year ends on September 30. With conservative House Republicans, led by Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, calling for spending cuts to offset any increase in emergency funds -- a measure opposed by many Democrats -- the ability of Congress to act quickly on the issue remains uncertain. Mayor Jeffery Jones of Paterson said he was ""outraged"" about the funding dispute. ""Mother Nature has a mind of her own, a will of her own, and we can't have the petty wrangling going on when we have folks in dire need,"" he said. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie echoed those sentiments during a news conference Wednesday, saying, ""We don't have time to wait for folks in Congress to figure out how they want to offset this stuff with the budget cuts. Our people are suffering now. And they need support now."" More than 1.1 million customers remained without electricity Thursday from North Carolina to Maine, the U.S. Department of Energy said -- a decrease from the 1.7 million reported Wednesday. Vermont transportation officials made emergency repairs on roads to previously isolated towns, officials said. Replacing washed-out bridges will take more time. In Wilmington, volunteers from across the state descended on the community to help with the cleanup. ""I couldn't sit at home. I had to come help,"" said Sarah Boisbert, as she worked outside Ranslow's gutted flooring shop. Ranslow was touched by the gesture of so many helping hands. ""They're just people,"" she said, pausing. ""They're neighbors and in Vermont we're all neighbors."" CNN's Ed Payne, Phil Gast, Amber Lyon, Nicole Saidi and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","NEW: Hatteras Island, North Carolina, residents start going home Sunday .

"(CNN) -- An ex-girlfriend of slain murder suspect Christopher Dorner said the former L.A. policeman worked in a pressure cooker and she was afraid he would target her after she heard he was the object of a manhunt. ""It was very scary, and, you know, I made a decision to speak out because if anything had happened to me, I'd want my family to at least have an idea about maybe who it was,"" Arianna Williams told CNN on Thursday. Authorities say Dorner launched a guerrilla war against the Los Angeles Police Department over what he considered his unfair dismissal in 2009. He allegedly fatally shot four people and was killed in a fire at a cabin in Big Bear Lake, California, when he was cornered after a manhunt. Christopher Dorner's body positively ID'd . If she stayed silent, her family would never have known what happened to her, she said, though she noted that she wasn't singled out or named in the manifesto he wrote detailing his grievances. Hearing that Dorner was a murder suspect shocked her, Williams said. But at the same time, she ""sort of expected it"" from the man she dated in 2006. ""When you have a profession where you worked your whole life to really obtain something, that level of success, and I think, when you go into that environment where everyone else is not, maybe, lined up with the way you believe and the way you think, after ... time ... the stress could probably wear on you,"" she said. ""I don't think it's in any way justifiable, someone going out and killing anyone because they're stressed out at work. There are ways and outlets of releasing stress. Chris, unfortunately, was one of those people, he bottled up a lot of his emotions and wasn't very good at expressing himself. "" Dorner is thought to have been proficient and comfortable with firearms. ""He would come over to my house and sometimes there would be firearms laying around. I just attribute that to him being a peace officer and protecting himself at that time, you know,"" she said. ""There would just be, like, a firearm in the kitchen, there would be one by the bed. I guess just maybe for easier access in case something happened.""","Arianna Williams says hearing Dorner was a murder suspect was ""sort of expected""

"(CNN) -- The death toll climbed to 10 in Japan as the remnants of former Typhoon Roke raced into the northern Pacific on Thursday, government officials said. Four people are missing, according to local government officials. Roke hit the Japanese mainland Wednesday morning as a powerful Typhoon, packing winds of up to 167 kph (103 mph). The storm caused widespread flooding and disrupted transportation throughout the island nation a day earlier. The storm hit as Japan is still recovering from the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck in March, killing more than 15,000 people. Ahead of the storm, there were fears that it would affect Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s Fukushima Daiichi plant, which went into a nuclear crisis after the March disaster. TEPCO officials canceled outdoor construction at the plant. Plant officials said Thursday that they have not seen any major problems at the plant due to Roke. At one point before the storm made landfall, about 1 million people were urged to evacuate from vulnerable areas as heavy rain pounded central and western Japan. Some downpours came up to 50 millimeters (2 inches) an hour, and some regions received more than 450 millimeters (17 inches) over a day, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Junko Ogura contributed to this report .","Roke is no longer a tropical storm .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Government troops in southern Yemen on Sunday attacked al Qaeda hideouts, killing two dozen suspected militants in the latest push to clear the area of the terror organization, local security officials said. Four members of the military were also killed in the clashes, which began early in the morning in the Abyan districts of Zinjibar and Jaar, the officials said, while nine troops were wounded. Government warplanes aided in the assault. ""We succeeded in taking over three strategic posts near Jaar and our forces will continue to go forward,"" said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Al Qaeda fighters are evacuating areas previously under their control due to the intensive government bombardment,"" the official added. Yemen's government has been fighting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for years with mixed results. Suspected al Qaeda militants seized Abyan last year during Yemen's political stalemate after government troops evacuated most military posts in the province. Recently, the government sent thousands of troops to Abyan in its latest assault against the militants, vowing not to retreat until al Qaeda is defeated. The clashes took place the same day White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan met with President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi in Sanaa. The two discussed efforts to eradicate al Qaeda and build a ""modern civil state,"" according to a statement from the Yemeni Embassy in Washington. Brennan also met with major military figures to discuss training, equipment assistance and the sharing of information, it said. On Saturday, a pair of U.S. drone strikes killed 11 suspected al Qaeda militants in Yemen's Mareb province. The strikes occurred nearly a week after a senior operative of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was killed by a CIA drone strike and less than three weeks after a Yemeni-linked terror plot to bring down a U.S.-bound jetliner was foiled. Fahd al Quso, 37, was killed while riding in a vehicle in the Rafdh district in Shabwa province a week ago Sunday, according to officials. Al Quso was indicted by a federal grand jury in New York in 2003 on 50 counts of terrorism offenses for his role in the October 12, 2000, bombing of the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen. The bombing killed 17 U.S. sailors. The terror plot revealed last week has been described by U.S. officials as involving a device that is an evolution of the bomb smuggled aboard a U.S.-bound plane on Christmas Day 2009 by a young Nigerian, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab. The device originated in Yemen and was brought to authorities' attention by a mole who infiltrated al Qaeda, a source in the region told CNN. The man works for Saudi intelligence, which has cooperated with the CIA for years, the source said. Information from the mole also led to the drone strike against al Quso.","Four members of the military also were killed, officials say .
The violence is part of the latest push to clear the area of the terror organization .

"Boston (CNN) -- Whisked to Boston to face dozens of charges, including murder and racketeering, captured fugitive James ""Whitey"" Bulger made a court appearance Friday and said he could afford a lawyer ""if you give me my money back."" Bulger, 81, appeared before two federal magistrate judges because he faces two 100-plus-page indictments featuring a litany of allegations dating back to the early 1970s. The accused mobster, who authorities said was the leader of the Winter Hill Gang, ""looks forward to facing the charges against him,"" his provisional attorney, Peter Krupp, said after the proceedings. Bulger, arrested after being on the lam 16 years, was transported from California in a private jet, along with his longtime girlfriend, Catherine Elizabeth Greig. They were quickly driven to the courthouse. Bulger, Greig lived good life in Santa Monica . Relatives of some of Bulger's alleged victims were in the packed courtroom. Bulger, shackled when he entered court, did not seek bail or enter a plea Friday. He may ask for bail later. ""He's a murderer and a destroyer of families,"" said Tom Donahue, who said Bulger is responsible for the death of his father, Michael. Donahue and his mother, Patricia Donahue, said the FBI should have found Bulger before this week. ""(Bulger) seemed like a very meek man, spoke very softly, was more concerned about what he had, rather than what's going on in his life,"" Patricia Donohue told reporters. Bulger told a judge he has the money to pay for a lawyer ""if you give me my money back."" The FBI said it found more than $800,000 in cash at the suspect's California apartment. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Kelly said that, based on a conversation with Greig, prosecutors believe Massachusetts political figure William Bulger will help pay for his brother's defense. The prosecutor said he believes the reputed mob boss has significant resources. ""He didn't earn $800,000 working a paper route along the Santa Monica Boulevard,"" Kelly said. William Bulger, former president of the Massachusetts State Senate, smiled at his brother during the proceedings. William Bulger had no substantive comment when he left the courthouse. Bulger vanished in 1995 into lore and became the inspiration for the 2006 Martin Scorsese film ""The Departed."" He was nabbed by the FBI on Wednesday night in Southern California. Bulger was arrested with Greig, who is accused of harboring a fugitive. She made an initial appearance before a judge in a separate hearing in Boston on Friday. Greig will have a hearing for counsel Tuesday. Bulger faces 19 counts of murder, along with conspiracy to commit murder, extortion, narcotics distribution and money laundering charges, the FBI said. He could receive a life sentence if convicted on the more serious charges. Bulger had been living in a Santa Monica apartment and was arrested outside it, the FBI said. Neither he nor Greig put up a fight, authorities said. After the arrests, members of the Fugitive Task Force, which included the FBI and police, searched the apartment. In addition to the cash, 30 firearms and fake IDs were found, the FBI said. A neighbor of the couple, Catalina Schlank, said Greig once confided in her that Bulger was in the early stages of Alzheimer's. A general manager at Michael's, a Santa Monica restaurant, said the pair had dined there a few times. They made their reservations under the name of ""Mr. Gasko"" through an Internet reservation service, Andrew Turner said. The couple, who lived two blocks away, kept to themselves and always sat at table 23 in the corner of the garden patio, lush with trees and plants, Turner told CNN. In September 2009, Bulger and Greig allegedly ordered two Grey Goose vodka cocktails, two Chardonnays and foie gras as an appetizer. For an entree, Bulger ate a 10-ounce, 28-day aged New York strip streak, and Greig ate lobster, Turner said. The bill: $192, plus tip, Turner said. ""They were pleasant but they kind of kept to themselves and certainly did not have, as far as I can tell, any interaction with any other guests,"" the manager added. The fugitives' run from the law ended Wednesday. A tipster called the FBI's Los Angeles office on Tuesday, and the information led authorities to the apartment, said Steven Martinez, FBI assistant director in charge in Los Angeles. He would not divulge the city from which the call came. The end of the manhunt came within days of the FBI launching a publicity campaign, airing ads about Greig in 14 markets across the country where the couple was known to have ties, authorities said. The arrests were a ""direct result"" of the media campaign, authorities said. But some law enforcement officials outside the FBI say that the media campaign explanation could be a cover for something else. These non-FBI sources said it seems too easy that after so many years on the run and so much exposure, suddenly a public service announcement that doesn't even appear in Los Angeles leads to a tip. They hinted that maybe the explanation was a smokescreen to protect the real tipster from any harm. Tom Fuentes, former FBI assistant director, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the agency is capable of protecting the tipster no matter how the information came in and there is no reason for a ruse. The version that Fuentes heard from investigators in the case and others is that ""the person that called in the tip did not see the direct announcement but saw the media coverage that the FBI had done an announcement on one of the cable network channels, and they wouldn't tell me which one."" A law enforcement official with knowledge of the case verified that version of events. A ""tipster was watching national coverage of the FBI campaign, went to fbi.gov, where they saw additional photos, then called the FBI with the tip,"" the official said. The Boston FBI officially buttressed that assertion Friday. ""Any claim that the FBI knew Mr. Bulger's whereabouts prior to the FBI's publicity efforts this week are completely unfounded,"" FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers said in a statement. ""When we learned his location, he was arrested promptly."" Carmen Ortiz, U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said she believes the death penalty is not an option in the federal charges Bulger faces in her district, but that she believes he could face the death penalty for two cases outside the district -- in Florida and Oklahoma. Dick Lehr, who wrote a book about Bulger, described him as a cold-blooded killer whose gang went to lengths to avoid detection. ""When they killed someone -- this is pre-DNA -- they pulled the teeth out, cut the fingers off, tried to make it so the victims, if they were discovered from their graves, couldn't be identified. There's just no bottom. It doesn't get much uglier than someone like Whitey Bulger,"" Lehr told Cooper. CNN's Deborah Feyerick, Sheila Steffen, Michael Martinez, Drew Griffin and Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report.","NEW: Restaurant manager recalls the pair's fancy meal .

"(CNN) -- If competing in the Europa Leage for the first time since 2002 came as a culture shock to European champions Chelsea they didn't show it. This time last year they were embarking on an adventure that would culminate in a first ever Champions League triumph but after falling in the group stages this season they find themselves battling it out in Europe's second tier club competition. Roberto Di Matteo, who led them to victory over Bayern Munich in May 2012, has since departed, to be replaced by former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, who is yet to convince many supporters he's the right man for the job. But Benitez's introduction of Brazilian midfielder Oscar proved a masterstroke as he scored with his first involvement after coming on with nine minutes remaining to hand Chelsea a 1-0 victory over Sparta Prague in the first leg of their last 32 tie. Oscar played a one-two with Belgium international Eden Hazard and applied the finish to give Chelsea a crucial away goal. Benitez told ESPN after the game: ""It was difficult game, we started really well, in the first 20 minutes we were in control. We were under pressure in the last 20 minutes of the first half but changed things at half time and played well in the second half. ""Oscar made a difference but the team was better in the second half."" Fellow English club Liverpool didn't fare so well, suffering their second successive 2-0 defeat after being beaten by Zenit St Petersburg in Russia. Two goals in two minutes turned the tie, Hulk -- a multi-million signing from Portuguese club Porto -- scoring a brilliant opener from range before Sergei Semak turned home a cross at the back post. There had been fears before hand that some of Liverpool's players would be targeted by a section of Zenit's fans who posted a manifesto on their website that said an absence of black players in the club's squad was an ""important tradition."" But after the game Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told a press conference: ""I want to thank the people of St Petersburg for their hospitality and how we've been received here."" On their defeat he said: ""I thought we looked solid and a threat going forward and could have been in the lead at half-time. ""In 6 to 12 months' time, we won't be making those mistakes. This is part of our growing pains as a group. We have to be more clinical. But we gave away two poor goals tonight. We ended up losing the game when we should have won it."" Europa League holders Atletico Madrid face an uphill task to stay in the competition after being beaten 2-0 at home by Russian side Rubin Kazan. Gokdeniz Karadeniz put the away side in front before Roman Sharonov was sent off just before half time, yet Rubin added a second in stoppage time through Pablo Orbaiz. Czech side Viktoria Plzen recorded a shock 3-0 win at Napoli, who are currently second in the Italian league. Vladimir Darida, Frantisek Rajtoral and Stanislav Tecl found the net. Two goals from Rodrigo Palacio put Inter Milan in a commanding position against CFR Cluj-Napoca before the second leg in Romania. Two free kick goals from Gareth Bale -- the second in the last ten seconds of the match -- helped Tottenham to a 2-1 victory over French side Lyon in London. Fellow English side Newcastle saw two Papiss Cisse goals dubiously ruled out for offside as they drew 0-0 with Metalist Kharkiv from the Ukraine. Borussia Monchengladbach shared six goals with Italian side Lazio during their first leg in Germany, Libor Kozak scoring a 94th minute equalizer for the visiting side. Anzhi Makhachkala won the first leg of their clash with Hannover 96, of Germany, 3-1 in Russia. Anzhi, managed by former Netherlands and Chelsea coach Guus Hiddink won 3-1 thanks to goals from Samuel Eto'o, Odil Ahmedov and Mbark Boussoufa. Dutch champions Ajax beat Romanian club Steaua Bucharest 2-0 thanks to goals from Toby Alderweireld and Ricardo Van Rhijn. Portuguese international Raul Meireles was sent off for Fenerbahce as the Turks drew 0-0 away at Bate Borisov in Belarus. Oscar Cardozo's delicate chip earned Portuguese outfit Benfica a precious 1-0 victory away at Bayer Leverkusen in Germany. Oleg Gusev missed a late penalty as Ukrainian club Dynamo Kiev had to settle for a 1-1 draw with French side Bordeaux. Ludovic Obraniak canceled out Lukman Haruna's opener for Dynamo. Goals from Pedro RÃ­os, Jose Barkero and Obafemi Martins helped Spanish side Levante to a comfortable 3-0 victory over Olympiakos, from Greece. Swiss side FC Basel beat Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, of Ukraine, 2-0 while VfB Stuttgart drew 1-1 with Belgian side Racing Genk in Germany.","European champions Chelsea defeat Sparta Prague 1-0 in Czech Republic thanks to Oscar .

"(CNN) -- NASA put its newest Landsat satellite into orbit on Monday, extending a long-running program that has been beaming back dramatic images of Earth for more than 40 years. The Landsat Data Continuity Mission -- to be designated Landsat 8, once it's up and running -- lifted off from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base atop an Atlas V booster. The $855 million platform, about the size of a sport-utility vehicle, has been in the works for years amid concerns about maintaining the U.S. suite of geoscience satellites. The first Landsat mission went into orbit in 1972; the last working mission, Landsat 7, was launched in 1999. It's still sending back images long after its five-year life expectancy, but suffers from a scanner problem that leaves black diagonal streaks across them. Landsat 5 sent back its last images in January after nearly 29 years; it had been designed to last three. The new mission's solar panels deployed successfully after Monday's launch, and the satellite should be fully operational after about three months of trials, NASA said. ""Everyone's very relieved. We've got good telemetry coming back from LDCM, so all is well so far,"" Dunn told NASA TV. In 2012, the National Academy of Sciences warned that a combination of budget pressure, program delays and a pair of launch failures in 2009 and 2011 left the United States facing a ""rapid decline"" in its capability to monitor land and seas from space. An asteroid is coming, but don't sweat it . The Landsat program is managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, which has been distributing the data for free since 2008. The imagery has been used to monitor urban growth, water use, farm production and a variety of natural disasters, from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens to the historic earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in 2011. ""Landsat is a centerpiece of NASA's Earth Science program, and today's successful launch will extend the longest continuous data record of Earth's surface as seen from space,"" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement.","The Landsat 8 satellite went into orbit Monday .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people have fled fighting between Thailand and Cambodia over the past week, 30 people have been injured, and five Thai soldiers have been killed, the Thai Ministry of Public Health said Tuesday. About 27,000 people are living in 33 temporary shelters in Thailand, the ministry said. Clashes between the two sides began last Friday, with each country accusing the other of trying to seize two ancient temples. Thai Foreign Minsiter Kasit Piromya visited the province and said in a statement Tuesday that Cambodia is still attacking Thais. There was a brief exchange of fire between Cambodian and Thai troops Tuesday afternoon, but it was calmed quickly, Thai Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd said. There were no new casualties from the incident, which he said resulted from a misunderstanding stemming from a routine Air Force exercise. Both sides claim the disputed temples are in their country. Thailand calls them Ta Kwai and Ta Muen, while Cambodia calls them Ta Krabey and Ta Moan. Much of the border between the two countries remains in dispute. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that the United States ""remains deeply concerned about clashes between security forces along the Thailand-Cambodia border."" The U.S. government is speaking directly to Thai and Cambodian officials, and also supports efforts by Indonesia, the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to work with both countries on a resolution, Clinton's statement said. The fighting on the ground has been coupled with a war of words in recent days. Cambodia said Monday that Thai warplanes had entered its airspace and that the Thai military had shelled populated Cambodian territory. Cambodia's government has said three of its troops have been killed in the fighting. On Sunday, Sansern accused Cambodian troops of opening fire first and said Thai troops responded to protect their country's sovereignty. In February, at least 10 people were killed when fighting flared up in another disputed border area between the two nations, prompting the United Nations Security Council to issue a statement calling on both sides to implement a cease-fire. Those clashes, which lasted four days, stemmed from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. At the time, each nation accused the other of firing first. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Fresh clash breaks out Tuesday but is calmed quickly, a Thai official says .

"(Wired.com) -- Acclaimed Public Radio International program ""This American Life"" has retracted an entire episode about working conditions inside Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturer that builds much of Apple's most popular hardware, after learning the reporter ""partially fabricated"" information about his visit to the factories. In the episode, PRI aired a monologue from reporter Mike Daisey, a self-proclaimed performer whose one-man show, ""The Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs,"" detailed alarming labor practices which he claimed to witness during his time visiting Foxconn. Among the many facts Daisey fabricated, according to PRI, were the number of Foxconn factories he visited, the number of workers he spoke with, as well a major lie about meeting with a number of workers who claimed to have been poisoned by chemicals used on iPhone assembly lines. ""Daisey lied to me and to ""This American Life"" producer Brian Reed during the fact checking we did on the story, before it was broadcast,"" the show's host, Ira Glass, wrote in a blog post on Friday. ""That doesn't excuse the fact that we never should've put this on the air. In the end, this was our mistake."" The retraction came even as consumers lined up Friday to buy Apple's latest iPad amid protests over its treatment of workers -- protests that did little to dampen sales. Public debate rages on about working conditions inside of Foxconn's Chinese factories, which have for years been the subject of reports that employees endure long hours and unsafe working environment. Wired dug into the subject more than a year ago in a cover story after 17 Foxconn employees committed suicide. More recently, The New York Times reported a series of investigative pieces further detailing the undesirable jobs of Foxconn employees. In an unprecedented response from the normally stoic Apple, the company responded to the reports publicly by cooperating with the Fair Labor Organization for audits of its entire supply chain. An entire page dedicated to Apple supplier responsibility can now be found on Apple's website. Daisey issued a statement about the incident on his personal blog: . ""I stand by my work. My show is a theatrical piece whose goal is to create a human connection between our gorgeous devices and the brutal circumstances from which they emerge. It uses a combination of fact, memoir, and dramatic license to tell its story, and I believe it does so with integrity. ""Certainly, the comprehensive investigations undertaken by The New York Times and a number of labor rights groups to document conditions in electronics manufacturing would seem to bear this out."" ""What I do is not journalism. The tools of the theater are not the same as the tools of journalism. For this reason, I regret that I allowed THIS AMERICAN LIFE to air an excerpt from my monologue. THIS AMERICAN LIFE is essentially a journalistic -- not a theatrical -- enterprise, and as such it operates under a different set of rules and expectations."" ""But this is my only regret. I am proud that my work seems to have sparked a growing storm of attention and concern over the often appalling conditions under which many of the high-tech products we love so much are assembled in China."" PRI's ""This American Life"" website was bombarded with traffic upon news of the retraction, buckling the site under the torrent of traffic. Apple, Public Radio International and Daisey did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Wired confirmed that none of Daisey's U.S. performances of The Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs were canceled after news of the retraction, save for one special broadcast: the April 7 show slated for performance at the Chicago Theater, which was originally sponsored by This American Life and Chicago public radio station WBEZ 91.5FM.

"Lilongwe, Malawi (CNN) -- Twelve people have died in national protests that erupted in Malawi, government officials said as demonstrations continued for a second day Thursday. Nine people died in Mzuzu, in the northern part of Malawi, on Wednesday, Ministry of Health spokesman Henry Chimbali said. Another died in Karonga district, also in the northern region. It was not immediately clear how the 10 died, but officials were investigating, Chimbali said. Sources at Mzuzu Central Hospital who requested anonymity said the victims had been shot. Two other people were fatally shot in Blantyre in the southern part of the nation, police spokesman Superintendent Davie Chingwalu said. Amnesty International called for an immediate investigation into the Mzuzu deaths, asserting that security forces were responsible. ""At least 44 other people, including six children, are being treated for gunshot wounds at Mzuzu Central Hospital,"" the human rights organization said in a statement. The protests began Wednesday as people demanded immediate action from the government on Malawi's economy and government issues. The East African nation is facing persistent fuel shortages, foreign exchange reserve shortages and frequent power blackouts, among other problems. In addition, anti-government demonstrators have accused President Bingu wa Mutharika of dragging the nation back into the dictatorship era, citing the passage of bills they say impinge on citizen rights as well as the expulsion in April of British envoy Fergus Cochrane-Dyet. The expulsion has cost Malawi dearly, as Britain has suspended direct budget support for the nation. According to the BBC, Cochrane-Dyet was told to leave Malawi in April after he was quoted in a leaked diplomatic cable as saying Mutharika was ""becoming ever more autocratic and intolerant of criticism."" Mutharika spoke Thursday as the protests continued. ""As a leader, I am ready to have a roundtable discussion with you,"" he said in an address. ""I call upon everyone to stop vandalizing people's property and beating up others. Get yourselves organized and notify us so that we can chart the way forward."" In a statement, organizations that had planned the protests also appealed for calm, noting that the demonstrations were meant for Wednesday and that continued protests Thursday were illegal. The country's army was assisting in quelling the protests Thursday, leading to relative calm. More than 200 people arrested in the Malawian capital of Lilongwe face charges ranging from arson to property damage. Police were seen harassing and beating civil society leaders, opposition political leaders and journalists, leading to injuries. ""When the police use firearms, they must minimize injury and respect human life,"" Erwin van der Borght, Amnesty International's director for Africa, said in the organization's statement. ""It is high time that President Mutharika's government addresses the wider human rights and political concerns that gave rise to this situation."" The United States condemned Wednesday's use of force by Malawian authorities to prevent peaceful demonstrations and a ban on private radio stations reporting on the demonstrations. In a statement, U.S. State Department Acting Deputy Spokeswoman Heide Bronke Fulton said U.S. officials were also ""disturbed by reports of violence targeting individuals based on their political or social affiliations.  The government's attempt to prohibit its citizens from marching, and the Communications Regulatory Authority's ban on independent media coverage undermine democracy and the rule of law that Malawians cherish."" She urged restraint from both sides. ""We call on the people and the Government of Malawi to remain committed to the principles of democracy and to express disagreements through peaceful means,"" she said.","NEW: United States urges restraint from both sides .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A good friend of mine recently learned she has breast cancer. Even though I spend most of my time writing for a living, I was at a loss for the right words to comfort her. Dr. Bernadine Healy, a brain tumor survivor, urges extra sensitivity in talking to cancer patients. It wasn't until I interviewed Dr. Bernadine Healy, a brain cancer survivor, that I discovered there is such a thing as cancer etiquette. ""I found as a patient, sometimes people are awkward, and they'll say the strangest things to you,"" said Healy, former head of the National Institutes of Health and the American Red Cross. She recounted in her book ""Living Time"" a conversation with a female acquaintance who declared, ""You look great. It's amazing how good you can look when you're dying."" In another instance, Healy recalled a woman grabbing her hair and feeling the texture and asking, ""Is that your hair, or is it a wig?"" Not surprisingly, Healy said, such remarks aren't good cancer etiquette. Healy suggested that friends and loved ones can be more sensitive by imagining for a moment that they're the patient. ""It's not bad to say wait a minute -- what would I want someone to say to me?"" She recommended starting out with some tenderness. ""This is a tender time,"" she said. ""It can be, 'Hey, you know you're great. I care about you. I love you and I'm here for you.' "" Healy said it is important to offer plenty of encouragement either in person or in a letter. ""I know you can do this. Having cancer isn't fun. You're going to face some difficult times, but I know you can do this. You're strong."" She cautioned people to ""think before they speak"" to someone with newly diagnosed cancer. ""One thing you don't want to do is instantly assume it's terminal. ... Often there is a feeling that people are going to write them off, or they're going to count them out."" Health Minute: More on cancer etiquette . In her book, Healy wrote, ""Banish the following from your vocabulary: terminal, incurable, hopeless and salvage."" ""How you think and talk will influence how you relate,"" she said. Shelley Lewis, a former CNN executive producer and co-creator of Air America Radio, agreed. Her stage 1 breast cancer was diagnosed four years ago. In her new book, ""Five Lessons I Didn't Learn From Breast Cancer (and One Big One I Did),"" Lewis scolded what she called the attitude police. ""They are your friends and family, very well-meaning people, who tell you to be careful and upbeat, but it puts you in a defensive position,"" Lewis said. Like Healy, Lewis said she encourages people to think before they say something inappropriate. She said she believes it is even more important to spend time listening to a cancer patient rather than doing all the talking. Lewis said that is especially true when it comes to offering advice. ""If you're not a doctor, don't tell me how seven of your friends were treated, because you don't know my specific situation,"" Lewis said. She said she prefers positive conversations. ""I liked hearing that I seemed like myself again. It meant that I was in control, and I was able to believe it,"" she said. If you want to help a friend, Lewis recommended making specific gestures that are thoughtful. Healy added if you're uncertain how your words or actions will be received, then it may be better to stick with something simple. She said, ""A hug or 'thinking of you, dear friend' note can mean a lot, too.""","Cancer survivors say there is an etiquette for talking to people with cancer .

"(Financial Times) -- Warren Buffett has teamed up with one of Brazil's richest men to serve up the biggest takeover of the year, agreeing to take US ketchup maker Heinz private in a $28bn deal. The deal, which is the fourth-largest food and beverage acquisition of all time, underscores the rising tide of dealmaking around the world and has raised the hopes of bankers that merger and acquisition activity will accelerate. The cash deal, which has been approved by the Heinz board, has brought together Mr Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway with 3G Capital, a private equity firm backed by Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, which led the 2010 leveraged buyout of Burger King. Berkshire, a conglomerate with more than 70 businesses amassed over four decades by Mr Buffett, has been seeking large deals to put its $48bn cash pile to work. Teresa Heinz not a big winner in Buffett deal . Berkshire and 3G will contribute $4bn of equity each, and Berkshire will buy another $8bn to $9bn of preferred stock paying a 9 per cent coupon, according to people familiar with the transaction. Mr Buffett told CNBC on Thursday that he was ""ready for another elephant so if you see one walking by just tell me"", suggesting he remains on the lookout for further acquisitions of similar scale. Investors said the involvement of 3G in a Berkshire deal was unusual, and pointed to the challenge Mr Buffett, who last year said he passed on two potential $20bn deals due to price, faced in finding companies to buy. Known as the ""Sage of Omaha"" for his investment success, Mr Buffett has historically left existing management in place, preferring good businesses with what he calls a ""moat"", a persistent competitive advantage, to prospects for a turnround. Mr Buffett said executives at 3G would be the ""operational guys"" at Heinz if the deal was finalised. After Thursday's acquisition by Buffett and 3G, James Mackintosh pulls up a list of similar stocks for those who missed Heinz (and its 20% share price pop). In a sign of the rising prominence of 3G and Brazilian dealmakers, Mr Lemann suggested buying Heinz to his friend, Mr Buffett, in December. Does Warren Buffett still hate private equity? The two men met while serving on the board of Gillette, and Mr Lemann played a major role in the 2008 takeover of beer maker Anheuser-Busch by InBev. He now sits on the board and Berkshire is a large shareholder in the combined company. Heinz said shareholders would receive $72.50 a share from Berkshire and 3G, a 20 per cent premium to Wednesday's closing share price. Shares in the group were trading at the offer price at lunchtime in New York. Shares of other food companies in the sector also rose amid speculation that the Heinz deal could trigger a wave of mergers. The bid values Heinz at $28bn, including $5.1bn of net debt, and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, the company said. In addition to the buyers' cash, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have committed debt financing for the deal, Heinz said. John Kerry, US secretary of state, owns $3m of Heinz stock and up to $750,000 of Berkshire stock, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. He is married to Teresa Heinz Kerry, heir to her late husband H. John Heinz III. The proposed deal is the latest in a series of recent takeovers and trumps the $24bn leveraged buyout offer by Michael Dell, along with Microsoft and Silver Lake Partners, to take private the computer maker he founded three decades ago. Last year the value of global M&A deals fell, and investment banking fees slumped. So far this year the total value of deals globally is up 14 per cent on the same period last year at $269.3bn, according to data provider Thomson Reuters. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said the Heinz deal could trigger a pick-up in M&A activity in the food sector, but noted that Heinz's purchase price appeared relatively high and financial buyers would generally have more limited synergy opportunities. The company's performance has improved following pressure from billionaire investor Nelson Peltz, who in 2006 took a stake in the company and joined its board. Mr Peltz has pushed Heinz to slash costs and invest in marketing. Mr Buffett said he would not pay more than the $72.50 a share on offer. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Warren Buffett teams up with Brazilian billionaire to buy U.S. ketchup maker Heinz .

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Kirkland says she caught her 6-year-old son Ethan just staring at a school bus the other day. He was mesmerized, his eyes locked on the yellow vehicle. He didn't say a thing, and she didn't know what to say to him. The last time he was on a bus, he was sitting just behind the driver -- as he always did -- waiting for his stop so he could go home. But the ""bad man"" got on, and killed the driver, his buddy Mr. Poland. Appearing on the ""Dr. Phil"" show, Kirkland told Phil McGraw she was worried how her little boy was going to react the next time she tried to put him on the bus to school. After being kidnapped, the recovery ahead . Ethan has been having a hard time sleeping, she told the psychologist turned syndicated daytime talk show host. He thrashes his arms, tosses and turns and sometimes he calls out. It has only been almost 10 days since the FBI sent a rescue team into the bunker in Midland City, Alabama, where Ethan was held hostage for nearly a week by Jimmy Lee Dykes. His mother hasn't asked Ethan what happened when he was there. ""I have not talked to Ethan about it,"" she said in an interview aired Wednesday. ""I don't know how to. As a mother I want him to know that I'm there if he needs to talk. I don't know how to respond because I have never been through this."" Inside the bunker: From storm shelter to boy's prison . Ethan has seen two people shot to death. Dykes shot bus driver Charles Poland several times before he carried Ethan, who had fainted, off the bus and into an underground bunker Dykes had built on his property. Then the FBI killed Dykes when negotiations broke down and authorities felt they had to rescue the boy before Dykes, who had a handgun, did something rash. ""The Army came in and shot the bad man,"" Kirkland said Ethan told her. Kirkland said she had hoped Dykes wouldn't be harmed. ""From the very beginning, I had already forgiven Mr. Dykes even though he had my child,"" she said. ""I could not be angry through this. My job was to be the mother."" She thinks Dykes had a soft spot for Ethan because he has disabilities. Dykes took care of her boy as best he could, she said. He even fried chicken for the boy. Still, as the crisis continued, she worried that Dykes might be spooked by something her child did -- or that he had enough supplies to stay down there for months. She worried her boy would think she had abandoned him. She asked authorities to let her speak to Dykes. ""That's my baby. He's my world. He's my everything,"" she said. ""Everything I do I do for him. And I was afraid I wasn't going to get him back."" When she did get him back, he was in the hospital, putting stickers on everyone in sight. ""Hey, bug, I sure have missed you,"" she recounted. ""I missed you, too,"" he answered. FBI: Bombs found in Alabama kidnapper's bunker . Now she worries that even though he seems like the same playful little boy, there is an emotional storm ahead. McGraw told her to talk to Ethan about his feelings, not what happened to him in the bunker. ""Let that decay in his young mind,"" he said. McGraw asked Ethan a few questions, but as 6-year-olds are apt to do, he answered most with a ""Yes"" or a ""No."" But when the doctor asked him how he got to school, Ethan said, ""On my bus, but my ..."" Then he walked over to his mother and as if telling a secret, whispered in her ear, ""But my bus driver is dead."" Kirkland told McGraw that it was Poland who helped Ethan conquer his fear of descending the steep school bus steps. Poland would cheer Ethan on and one day when the child hesitated and the mother went to help, the driver said, ""Let him do it."" Since then, Ethan has had no problem. But now his cheerleader won't be there, and Kirkland is anguished about her boy. ""Mr. Poland put him behind him so he could keep a good eye on him,"" she said. Ethan hasn't been back to school yet. He's been busy opening birthday presents and playing with his favorite toys. On Wednesday, he made a new friend in Gov. Robert Bentley. There's a picture from the event where little Ethan is sitting underneath the governor's desk. The child is beaming. ""Ethan is a loving, forgiving child,"" Kirkland said. ""He is easy to go up to a perfect stranger and say, 'Can I have a hug?'"" That was the boy who went into that bunker. She is concerned it's not the child who came out.","Phil McGraw speaks with mother of former Alabama child hostage .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- More than 40 al Qaeda militants infiltrated Yemen's port city of Aden seeking to free imprisoned fighters, the defense ministry said Saturday. The ministry said the militants entered through neighboring al-Thale province, and that the country is on high security alert. ""The same group of militants already attacked a government prison in al-Thale province seeking to release members of the terror network arrested in a military operation earlier this week,"" a senior Defense Ministry official told CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media. Dozens reported killed by al Qaeda land mines in Yemen . The militants were heavily armed and attacked the governmental complex with rocket-propelled grenades and a barrage of bullets. ""After failing to free prisoners in al-Thale, they headed towards Aden. Our forces are ready and will ensure the safety for Yemen's business capital,"" the official said. Hundreds of reinforcement troops were deployed to Aden since Thursday. Prison breakouts are not new for Yemen. Last week, 24 al Qaeda militants escaped a highly secured prison in the southwestern province of al-Hodieda, security officials in the province confirmed to CNN. Top Yemen commander killed; al Qaeda claims responsibility . Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry said Saturday that its forces seized control of all government buildings in the town of Azzan, Shabwa. The town was the last al Qaeda stronghold in Yemen. Al Qaeda took over numerous towns in southern Yemen last year, benefiting from the political instability in the country. The crisis resulted in a transfer-of-power deal forcing longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down from power. Newly elected President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi intensified the fight against al Qaeda and vowed to continue the assault on militant hideouts until the group is defeated. Over the past month, more than a dozen militants were arrested throughout Yemen, including prime suspects behind deadly suicide attacks against government forces.

"Washington (CNN) -- The burst of enthusiasm for the ""Gang of Six"" debt reduction plan as a way out of the debt ceiling crisis has appeared to fade as Democratic and Republican lawmakers studied and found fault with the details of the proposal. Most notably, both sides highlighted well-worn party-line divisions: conservatives complained the plan would raise taxes while liberals warned it would cut entitlement benefits. ""It would be irresponsible for us to try to rush through such a complex package without time for meaningful review,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Budget Committee who said his staff has already identified ""serious flaws"" with the proposal. ""This great 'Gang of Six' would save $4 trillion over 10 years,"" Rep. Peter DeFazio, a liberal Democrat from Oregon, said sarcastically. ""Seniors will pay more. Working people will pay more. Veterans will pay more. Rich people not so much. But it would save $4 trillion over 10 years."" Despite some strong pushback from liberal groups and labor unions to the proposed changes to entitlement programs, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi seemed to leave the door open to the plan, telling reporters, ""We haven't seen it but it has some good principles in it."" House GOP aides acknowledged some of the ideas for tax reform and spending cuts are similar to Republican-backed plans. But the aides privately cringed when President Barack Obama endorsed the proposal on Tuesday, because his very public embrace makes it even tougher to sell to House conservatives. Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, leader of a large block of House conservatives, dismissed the proposal. He pointed to House passage of the ""cut, cap, and balance"" bill, which would make raising the debt ceiling contingent on congressional passage of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. ""Forget the 'Gang of Six,' let's go with the 'Gang of 234,' "" Jordan said, referring to the winning number of votes for the measure. He said the ""Gang of Six"" plan was a nonstarter for him and for the members of the Republican Study Committee. ""In simple terms: Our guys don't like it,"" he said. With growing signs that the monthslong work would not provide the key to avoiding default, Democratic and Republican leadership aides in the Senate sought to turn attention back to a last-ditch plan developed by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. That plan, which is still not finalized, would allow the president to seek an increase in the $14.3 trillion debt limit without the approval of Congress, set up a special committee to recommend ways to reduce the debt and possibly include a trillion dollars or more in immediate spending cuts. However, as the August 2 deadline approaches, even that backup proposal appeared in trouble as Republicans continued to say it would not get the votes needed to pass the GOP-controlled House. House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor met Wednesday with the top two House Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer. Congressional aides said the leaders talked about the McConnell-Reid plan, among other proposals. While House leaders met to consider next steps in the debt impasse, Republican freshmen continued to insist they were in no mood to compromise. South Carolina Republican Trey Gowdy said he and others want to pass something that's ""transformative,"" not something that kicks the can down the road to another committee to study how to reduce the debt. Asked about the McConnell-Reid plan's prospects in the House, Gowdy told reporters bluntly, ""If there a state or condition worse than death, that's what it is. I can't think of one, so we'll just go with death for now."" Some senators said they would like to tie elements of the ""Gang of Six"" proposal to the McConnell-Reid measure as a way to salvage the group's work and to keep open the possibility of deeper reductions in the debt. Conrad said one idea is to allow a vote on the gang's work if the special committee set up under the McConnell-Reid bill fails to reach agreement on ways to reduce the debt. ""What I would like to see is that this plan gets a vote,"" Conrad said. Maryland Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin said it makes sense to tie the McConnell-Reid plan with elements from the ""Gang of Six"" proposal. ""That seems to be the most likely formula for a successful completion,"" Cardin said. Rep. Steve LaTourette, a moderate Republican from Ohio, said he was encouraged by the ""Gang of Six"" proposal but has concerns about how parts of it would work. Joking with reporters, he said both Senate compromises aren't exactly being embraced by House Republicans. ""The McConnell plan is less popular than the ""Gang of Six"" plan, but both of them come in at about the approval rating of the United States Congress,"" he said.","Conservatives don't like plan's tax increases,while liberals don't like proposed entitlement cuts .

"(CNN) -- A teen and a police officer died in Bahrain clashes as protesters hit the streets Thursday on the two-year anniversary of a failed uprising in the nation, authorities said. Authorities are investigating the Thursday morning death of a 16-year-old and trying to determine how it occurred, according to a government statement. Read more: Bahrain strips Shiite activists of citizenship amid unrest . ""We encourage people to remain calm and not spread unfounded rumors until more information becomes known,"" the statement said. ""We reiterate the call ... upon parents to supervise the whereabouts of their children at all times in order to ensure their safety. We urge parents to keep their children at school and go about their daily routine."" Al-Wefaq, Bahrain's main Shiite opposition party, said the teen was killed when he was hit by bird pellets shot by Bahraini security forces. Police officer Mohammed Asif died late Thursday after he was hit by a ""projectile"" thrown by a group of protesters, according to Bahrain's interior ministry. Major-General Tariq Hassan, chief of public security, said an investigation has been launched to find those responsible. Protesters demonstrated in several villages around Manama, the nation's capital Thursday. Two years ago, on February 14, protests began with many demanding political reforms and greater freedoms in the Sunni-ruled, Shiite majority nation. Bahraini wins human rights seat amid protests, teen's death . The unrest was spurred by movements in Tunisia and Egypt. But demonstrations in Bahrain failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown by authorities in the island state. The crackdown was backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In November of that year, Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry issued a report critical of authorities' reactions to the protests. The independent commission, set up by the king, concluded that the police had used excessive force and torture in their response to the protests in Sunni-ruled, Shiite-majority country. Abuse of detainees in the crackdown included beatings with metal pipes and batons, and threats of rape and electrocution, according to Mahmoud Cherif Bassiouni, the commission chairman. The report recommended reforms to the country's law and better training of its security forces, as well as other measures.

"Brad, Texas (CNN) -- High winds whipped up a spreading wildfire in northern Texas on Wednesday as firefighters battled several blazes across the tinder-dry state. A raging grass fire in Oklahoma City, meanwhile, claimed several structures, including a barn, affiliate KFOR reported. Homes in the area were evacuated. The 101 Ranch fire in Palo Pinto County grew to about 7,500 acres on Wednesday afternoon, and it was unclear how much had been contained, the Texas Forest Service reported. The fire was centered around the south side of Possum Kingdom Lake outside Brad, about 50 miles west of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area. Observers on the opposite shore were forced to pull back when winds around 20 mph carried embers across the lake. The fire had destroyed at least 39 homes, according to the Forest Service, and another 125 households were evacuated. Firefighters were getting support from aerial tankers and helicopters that were dropping water on the blaze. Nine RVs were burned. On Wednesday morning, firefighters reported they had ""hooked the heel"" of the fire, which means they established an anchor from which they can begin extending lines along its edge. The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear. Texas is up against its worst fire season in state history, according to officials. A record 3.5 million acres have burned since the start of the season last November as hot and dry weather, coupled with a historic drought, have made conditions ripe for rapid fire growth. Firefighters are now battling a total of nine wildfires, which have consumed about 16,000 acres, the Forest Service says. Jerry and Silvia Overton were among the residents who were forced to flee as the 101 Ranch fire closed in on their homes. The fire ""got away"" from the firefighters, and ""the only escape route we had at that time was the marina,"" Jerry Overton said. He and his wife got on their boat, let others without boats onboard, and watched the thick, black smoke for a bit before going across the lake to the harbor. On Wednesday, he inspected the house and saw that outside of some possible smoke damage, it appeared unharmed. Yet the experience of evacuating -- the second time they had to do so since April -- was a frightening one. ""The first time back in April (was) scary, but this was horrific,"" Silvia Overton said. ""This time I really felt we could lose everything."" ""There's still a lot of work going on and a lot of stuff that's being threatened and they are doing the best they can to protect structures,"" said John Nichols with the Texas Forest Service. Boats such as the Overtons' were used to ferry some evacuees across Possum Kingdom Lake, he said. ""I don't think I have seen it this bad anywhere,"" Nichols said. ""Walking across somebody's yard that just crackles under your feet because the grass is so dry. It's just a tough, tough situation."" Firefighters in Huntsville, in east Texas, battled a 100-acre fire. Two structures were lost and 10 homes were threatened. Texas and Oklahoma are the worst-hit of several states in a band of severe drought that stretches from Arizona to sections of the East Coast. More than 90% of the state is suffering from ""extreme"" or ""exceptional"" drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln.

"(CNN) -- A five-week strike by a New York City school bus drivers' union is ending, with nearly 9,000 drivers heading back to work next week and some 150,000 students getting their rides to class again. The strike -- the first for school bus drivers in New York City since 1979 -- began after Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in a cost-cutting move, put nearly 1,100 bus routes worked by the union drivers up for bids. Michael Cordiello, president of the drivers' union local, said in a conference call Friday the union decided to end its strike after five current Democratic candidates for New York mayor pledged to ""revisit the school bus transportation system"" if elected. Drivers, who were demanding job security, will report for work next Wednesday morning, Cordiello said. For his part, Bloomberg said Friday, ""I urged the union leaders to end the strike and made clear that the City would not be held hostage ... Tonight, they agreed.""

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- A U.N. human rights official is calling for ""immediate, impartial"" investigations over reports of attacks by armed forces of Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara against civilians in areas known to support former President Laurent Gbagbo. The mission is ""particularly concerned about the increase of violent incidents and attacks carried out by elements of the RFIC (Republican Forces of Ivory Coast) against several villages,"" Guillaume Ngefa, acting director of the Human Rights Division of the U.N. Mission in Ivory Coast, said at a press conference Thursday. ""The alleged perpetrators of these serious human rights violations must be identified, pursued and punished in accordance with the law."" Recent attacks in southern and western Ivory Coast have left at least two people dead and dozens hurt. The United Nations denounced the use of heavy weapons to maintain order and called for the RFIC to be given sufficient and appropriate means to maintain law and order. ""The government and the RFIC authorities should initiate training for RFIC elements, especially on human rights and the basic principles on the use of force and the use of firearms by those responsible for applying the law,"" Ngefa said. Nina Toure, spokesperson for the Ministry of Homeland Security, said the government is taking note but expressed some reservations about allegations of human right violations. ""Most of these allegations are supported by only interviews. If provided with solid proof, we will take immediate actions. We are committed to sanction any human rights violation, no matter the perpetrator,"" Toure said. Sworn in after a six-month post-election crisis that left hundreds dead, Ouattara vowed to investigate the alleged atrocities, promote reconciliation and restore security and order. But so far the government is having a hard time getting police back into the streets and stations. In the months after the November vote, violence between forces loyal to both sides left hundreds dead, and cases of enforced disappearances and sexual violence were reported. Human rights investigators said last month that they had found 10 mass graves near the commercial capital of Abidjan. The U.N. accusations Thursday come on the heels of a similar admonishment by International Federation of Human Rights President Souhayr Belhassen, who said Tuesday that abuses were still going on in the West African country. The new government must ""commit to legal action against those responsible for serious violations of human rights from both sides,"" Belhassen said. Human Rights Watch last week accused forces of both Ouattara and Gbagbo of atrocities. Minister of Homeland Security Ahmed Bakayoko, expressed doubts about the reports, but promised investigations and eventual legal action.","U.N. human rights official cites attacks by Ouattara forces against certain villages .

"London (CNN) -- Britain cut all financial ties Monday with Iran over concerns about Iran's nuclear program, the first time it has ever cut an entire country's banking sector off from British finance, the British Treasury announced. The move comes days after an International Atomic Energy Agency report highlighted new concerns about ""the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program,"" the Treasury statement said Monday. The IAEA's governors approved a resolution last week expressing ""deep and increasing concern about the unresolved issues regarding the Iranian nuclear program. Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and has called the U.N. watchdog's report ""unbalanced"" and ""politically motivated."" ""The IAEA's report last week provided further credible and detailed evidence about the possible military dimensions of the Iranian nuclear program,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. ""Today we have responded resolutely by introducing a set of new sanctions that prohibit all business with Iranian banks."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner will ""outline new steps the United States is taking to increase pressure on Iran"" on Monday afternoon in Washington, the State Department said. The United States will name Iran, as well as its central bank, as a ""primary money-laundering concern"" but will not place sanctions directly on the central bank, a senior Treasury Department official told CNN. The Obama administration plans to impose fresh sanctions against Iran's petrochemical industry, diplomatic sources familiar with the plans said Friday. U.S. sanctions already prohibit American companies from doing business with Iran. The British sanctions underline ""the severity of the government's concerns about Iran's activities,"" the statement issued by Britain's chancellor of the exchequer said. All British credit and financial institutions must end their business relationships and transactions with all Iranian banks, their branches and subsidiaries by Monday afternoon, it said. ""Iran's activities that facilitate the development or production of a nuclear weapon pose a significant risk to the national interests of the UK and countries across the region,"" it said. ""Iranian banks play a crucial role in providing financial services to individuals and entities within Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, as companies carrying out proliferation activities require banking services."" The chancellor's statement said other ""partner countries"" will make similar announcements about banking sanctions against Iran. ""We believe that the Iranian regime's actions pose a significant threat to the UK's national security and the international community,"" Chancellor George Osborne said. ""Today's announcement is a further step to preventing the Iranian regime from acquiring nuclear weapons.""

"(CNN) -- Russian premier Vladimir Putin has criticized plans by European leaders to boycott next month's Euro 2012 football finals due to the treatment by Ukrainian authorities of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. German chancellor Angela Merkel has raised her concerns at Tymoshenko's treatment, while European Union president Herman Van Rompuy, European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and the governments of Austria and Belgium have all said they will not be attending any matches in Ukraine in protest. But Putin has waded into the row, telling journalists in Russia that sport and politics should be kept separate. ""In absolutely every case, you can't mix politics, business and other issues with sport,"" Putin told Russian news agency Novosti. ""I stick to the principle professed and supported by the International Olympic Committee -- sport is outside politics."" Putin's statement echoes the sentiments of Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone, who defended the elite motorsport's decision to race in Bahrain last month despite widespread concerns over human rights issues. Tymoshenko, the heroine of the Orange Revolution that swept the country in 2004 and 2005, has been in prison since last October for alleged abuse of office. Her supporters claim that the charges were politically motivated -- drummed up by current president Viktor Yanukovych, who beat Tymoshenko in Ukraine's 2010 presidential election. It was alleged voter fraud by supporters of Yanukovych during the 2004 presidential elections that originally sparked the revolution. Her party was expected to be a formidable foe in next October's parliamentary elections. Last week pictures of Tymoshenko released by her family appeared to show bruises she claims came from a beating by a prison guard. She has since gone on hunger strike in a bid to secure medical treatment she says she is being denied. Taking place a little over a month before the Euro 2012 opening ceremony in Poland, which is co-hosting the tournament, the row is just one of several controversies that have threatened to overshadow what the Ukrainian government had hoped would be a showcase event for the country. Despite huge investment in Ukraine's aging transport infrastructure, the country has struggled in its preparations. Stadium delays had initially put Ukraine's hosting of the tournament in jeopardy, but now new problems have emerged. Hotel prices during the tournament have risen so sharply due to profiteering that Michel Platini, head of European football's governing body UEFA, was unusually critical when visiting Ukraine last month for the opening of a new airport terminal. ""It's annoying to have made a lot of investment and then say to people that they can't come because there are bandits and crooks who want to make a lot of money during this Euro,"" he told the assembled press in Lviv. Security concerns were raised when multiple bombs exploded in the city of Dnipropetrovsk, close to Donetsk where the England team will be playing some of its matches. More than 20 people were injured in the blasts. The authorities have so far blamed criminal gangs rather than terrorists for the attack. And earlier this week Amnesty international warned football fans traveling to Ukraine that they will face a ""criminal"" police force mired in so many abuse scandals that its behavior threatens to ruin the showpiece tournament. The Amnesty International report ""Ukraine: Euro 2012 jeopardized by criminal police force"" details how security forces have been implicated in numerous cases of torture and extortion in cities due to host matches. According to the report, one recent case in the eastern city of Lviv -- where Germany, Portugal and Denmark will play -- details how two men were beaten, robbed and then imprisoned by six police officers after a disagreement in a bar. Prosecutors originally refused to open a criminal case until CCTV footage emerged of the incident after one of the men's lawyers gave an interview to a local TV station. ""The Ukrainian government must take action now to stop widespread police criminality,"" said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's director for Europe and Central Asia. ""Failure to do so will encourage them to continue acting as a law unto themselves and put Euro 2012 fans in danger from a force that is out of control."" The Ukrainian foreign ministry responded to the avalanche of negative press stories this week in bellicose terms. ""The Foreign Affairs Ministry considers destructive the attempts to politicize sporting events, which have played an important role in the process of establishment of intergovernmental mutual understanding and unity since the earliest times,"" it said in a statement posted on the website of the Ukrainian News Agency. ""The calls to boycott the championship would in practice amount to undermining the image of a grand sports event and damage to the interests of millions of ordinary Ukrainians that vote for various political parties or are not interested in politics at all."" Poland is split on the controversy, with opposition leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski calling for a boycott of the event and suggesting that matches be moved to Warsaw. But president Bronislaw Komorowski dismissed those calls as ""inappropriate."" Meanwhile Merkel, a keen football fan whose comments earlier this week on the fate of Yulia Tymoshenko sparked the media furor, says that she will wait until the very last minute to decide whether to attend the tournament. ""I always decide on such things at short notice,"" she told Koelner Stadt Anzeiger, a regional newspaper in Germany..","Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin criticizes political boycott of Euros .

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony is responsible for the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee, a report released Thursday by Florida's Department of Children and Families concludes. A month after a jury acquitted Anthony on murder and child neglect charges, the state agency found that Anthony ""is the caregiver responsible for the verified maltreatments of death, threatened harm and failure to protect"" in her daughter's death. Carrie Hoeppner, a spokeswoman for the Department of Children and Families, said the report was issued this week as a ""professional courtesy"" after the sheriff's office and prosecutors finished their work on the case. She added that the state agency is mandated to conduct reviews when there are allegations that a child dies as a result of abuse, abandonment or neglect. The agency had no contact with the Anthonys prior to the girl's disappearance in the summer of 2008, Hoeppner added. The Orange County Sheriff's Office will not take any further action as a result of the report, Capt. Angelo Nieves said Thursday. ""This closes out the DCF case, and it does not create additional follow-up on our part,"" he said. The report said: ""The Department of Children and Families concludes that the actions or the lack of actions by the alleged perpetrator ultimately resulted or contributed in the death of the child."" The report was signed by officials in the department Wednesday. Anthony is now free. While she was cleared on murder and aggravated child abuse charges, the 25-year-old Orlando woman was convicted on four counts related to misleading law enforcement authorities. She was sentenced to four years in jail on those convictions, but was given credit for the time she had already served between her arrest and the end of the seven-week trial and was released from jail in mid-July. Prosecutors cannot appeal the acquittals. The report does not address, or substitute for, judgments regarding the guilt or innocence of the caregiver -- in this case, Casey Anthony -- DCF spokeswoman Hoeppner said. The state report found that Anthony's ""failure to act"" in the 31 days between the time the girl was last seen and when police were alerted about the case ""delayed and interfered with a law enforcement investigation and best efforts to safely recover the child."" The agency report noted there were ""no indicators"" that Caylee's death was caused by physical injury, and it was ""not substantiated"" that she died of asphyxiation -- both points of great contention during the trial. An autopsy performed in December 2008 by the local medical examiner determined ""that the exact cause of death cannot be determined with certainty."" Prosecutors tried, unsuccessfully, to convince jurors that Anthony used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious and then duct-taped her mouth and nose to suffocate her. In its recommendations section, the report said that ""the maternal grandfather"" -- in this case, George Anthony -- ""should have been interviewed for the missing person report."" Casey Anthony's defense lawyer had claimed, in the opening argument of the murder trial, that George Anthony knew Caylee had died accidentally and helped cover up her death. Casey Anthony had been investigated by the agency, when state child welfare investigators determined on September 14, 2008, that there were ""verified findings"" indicating that Anthony was responsible for ""inadequate supervision and threatened harm"" of her child, although it found ""no indicators of physical injury."" Exactly a month later, a grand jury indicted Anthony on murder and other charges, and the case was eventually reopened by the Department of Children and Families. No further detail was immediately offered as to why or exactly when the department chose to review the case, or why it came out this week. The report released Thursday officially closes the department's investigation in the case.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A bomb went off near a U.N. patrol vehicle in southern Lebanon Friday, wounding five French U.N. troops in the latest attack on peacekeepers in the region this year. The soldiers received treatment on the scene before being evacuated for further medical attention, said Andrea Tenenti, deputy spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which monitors the cessation of hostilities between Lebanon and Israel. Tenenti said that the injuries suffered were light. French and Lebanese officials roundly condemned the strike, which occurred east of the city of Tyre and near the town of Burj Al Shamali. Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said such incidents are aimed at putting pressure on peacekeepers to pull out of Lebanon and open the way for the return of terrorist activity. Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the attacks ""do not only target UNIFIL troops only but also target Lebanon's security and stability, as well of the security of all Lebanese."" French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said his country ""demands that light be shed on the attack. We call Lebanese authorities to make every effort to ensure that those responsible are prosecuted."" Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group regarded as a terror organization by the United States and Israel, said the act was ""aimed against Lebanon's security and stability, and aimed at the stability of Southern Lebanon more specifically,"" and added that Hezbollah ""calls upon the security apparatuses to exert all efforts to put an end to such attacks."" A civilian was also wounded in the attack, Lebanon's National News Agency reported. UNIFIL has been in southern Lebanon since the nation's 1978 conflict with Israel. After the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, the peacekeepers' mandate was expanded to include helping Lebanon keep the country's south ""free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons"" other than government troops. In July, an explosion in the port city of Sidon left six French troops wounded. And in May, a blast wounded six Italian troops from the 15,000-member contingent. CNN's Nada Husseini and Niki Cook contributed to this report.","NEW: The blast is condemned by France, Lebanese officials and Hezbollah .

"(CNN) -- Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara called for calm Monday after forces stormed the president's residence and arrested Laurent Gbagbo, whose refusal to accept the results of a presidential election last year plunged the West African nation into civil war. ""Finally, we have reached the dawn of a new era of hope,"" Ouattara said in a televised address. ""We had hoped this transfer had been different, but we have to focus on today."" He urged his countrymen to lay down their weapons and said he has asked the justice minister to start legal proceedings against Gbagbo, his wife and his colleagues. Gbagbo is being held at the Golf Hotel, the headquarters of both Ouattara and the United Nations. Fighting appeared to quickly end after Gbagbo's arrest, said Alain Le Roy, under-secretary-general of the United Nations' Department of Peacekeeping Operations. ""To my knowledge, most of the fighting has stopped,"" he said, adding that ""there are pockets of resistance here and there."" Gbagbo asked for and is receiving U.N. protection, according to Le Roy, who said forces are also ensuring the security of the former leader's wife. ""I understand from President Ouattara that he wants President Gbagbo to go on trial in Ivory Coast,"" said the U.N. official. The former president ""is well and alive and will be brought to justice,"" said the country's ambassador to the United Nations, Youssoufou Bamba. He and the French Embassy said forces loyal to Ouattara made the arrest. But a Gbagbo adviser, Ahoua Don Mello, said earlier that the French military had stormed Gbagbo's residence. The French Ministry of Defense rejected Don Mello's claim, saying no French troops entered the residence. Authorities are trying to move carefully and follow legal procedures to bring Gbagbo to trial, said a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the events, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. The arrest is a ""step in the right direction to return Ivory Coast to normality,"" the source said, adding that the city of Abidjan is a wreck, with ""death squads, militias roaming (and) burning bodies on the streets, which is posing a major humanitarian challenge."" Speaking from inside the Golf Hotel, Gbagbo told his supporters to stop fighting. ""I hope that people lay down their weapons and return to a normal state of civil rule so that the crisis can conclude as quickly as possible,"" he said. U.S. President Barack Obama cheered news of the latest developments in the Ivory Coast. ""This represents a victory for the democratic will of the Ivorian people, who have suffered for far too long through the instability that followed their election,"" he said in a statement. Obama urged Ouattara and the people of the Ivory Coast to begin now the ""hard work of reconciliation and rebuilding."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Gbagbo's capture ""sends a strong signal to dictators and tyrants. ... They may not disregard the voice of their own people. ""There will be consequences for those who cling to power,"" Clinton warned. United Nations forces were not involved in the raid on Gbagbo's residence, said U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure. He had earlier said the United Nations' mission did not extend to extracting the former president from his stronghold. But United Nations and French troops have pounded Gbagbo's forces, citing their mission to protect civilians in the country. The fighting left Abidjan with sporadic power and sanitation, and residents said dead bodies were left on the streets. At least tens of thousands of people have fled into neighboring Liberia to escape the fighting, according to Oxfam, the international aid organization. The International Committee of the Red Cross said that 800 people had been shot dead in the western cocoa-producing town of Duekoue during the conflict. A U.N. official put the death toll at 330 in the incident. In his televised address, Ouattara said he would set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate allegations of human rights violations. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week predicted that the outcome of the crisis in Ivory Coast would set the tone for other nations in Africa. ""What happens in Cote d'Ivoire has huge implications for the continent that will have 16 presidential elections this year,"" he said, using the French name for the country. CNN's Jack Maddox, Sarita Harilela, Carol Jordan, Mariano Castillo, Niki Cook, Matthew Hoye, Alan Silverleib and Zain Verjee contributed to this report .","Ouattara declares the ""dawn of a new era of hope""

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Scores of youths attacked police in Northern Ireland for a second consecutive night Tuesday in an expression of rage over a parade in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast. Nationalist youths threw stones, gasoline bombs, golf balls and fireworks at police attending the Orange Order parade -- held on a date often marked by sectarian violence. After the march passed, the rioters grew in number and ferocity; police responded with plastic bullets and water cannon. Outbreaks of violence also ignited in East Belfast, Derry and other parts of Northern Ireland. Police appealed for calm on Tuesday. ""Whilst I commend the bravery and leadership of many within the community who worked tirelessly to reduce the disorder and calm tensions -- we need everyone to keep working to build and maintain calm across all local areas,"" Assistant Chief Constable Alistair Finlay said in a statement. He said a number of officers were injured during the disorder. ""We have unfortunately witnessed first hand this evening how violence damages people's homes and businesses, it sets back relationships and leaves wounds which take time to heal,"" Finlay said. ""It is not representative in any way of the vast majority of people here who want to get on with their lives."" Tuesday's incident came a day after at least 22 officers were injured amid similar attacks elsewhere in Belfast. On Monday night, police fired more than 50 plastic bullets and used a water cannon to disperse rioters, who threw more than 40 gasoline bombs, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said. A number of arrests were made, police added, without specifying how many. Monday's violence was centered in Catholic areas of Belfast ahead of the main day of the Protestant marching season, when loyalists parade through the streets. A spokeswoman said the trouble started late Monday and continued into Tuesday. The most serious disorder was in the Broadway area of west Belfast and involved 100 to 200 people. Police were investigating reports that gunshots were fired during the disturbances. Police said several vehicles were hijacked and set afire in the area, while crowds attacked officers with missiles ""including masonry and petrol bombs."" At one point, a bus was hijacked and driven toward police lines but crashed a short distance away. Ahead of the march, Assistant Chief Constable Dave Jones had called for community restraint. ""We would appeal for everyone to do everything they can to help ensure all areas are calm and peaceful over the next 48 hours. Violence does not need to be inevitable,"" he said after Monday night's rioting. In recent years, public disorder has followed the annual parade. The province suffered decades of violence known locally as the Troubles, in which more than 3,500 people were killed before a 1998 peace accord known as the Good Friday Agreement. In each of the last three years, violence organized by people opposed to the peace process has erupted around the parade. The Troubles pitted mostly Catholic republicans, who want the province to become part of the Republic of Ireland, against pro-British loyalists, who are mostly Protestant. This year has been one of the most violent since the Good Friday Agreement.","Fresh violence breaks out at Orange Order parade in north Belfast .

"Washington (CNN) -- The militant group Hezbollah is actively plotting with the opposition in Bahrain to overthrow the country's ruling family, the government said in a confidential report to the United Nations. ""Evidence confirms that Bahraini elements are being trained in Hezbollah camps specifically established to train assets from the Gulf,"" the report reads. Bahrain has long made claims that Iran and Hezbollah have sought to fuel instability in the nation. In the report sent to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Bahrain's government claims that Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been training opposition figures at its camps in Lebanon and Iran in an effort to destabilize the Khalifa monarchy. The report also says the militant group has trained militants for activities in neighboring Gulf countries, according to diplomats who have reviewed it. The government report urges the United Nations to curb Iran and Hezbollah's interference in the country. Both Iran and Hezbollah have previously denied involvement in the protests. The Bahraini government has launched a violent crackdown against the protesters, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have deployed troops to Bahrain to support the regime. The report details meetings between Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other senior officials of the group with members of Shiite organizations in Bahrain, such as Wefaq, one of the country's major opposition parties, and the banned Haq group. In the report, Bahrain alleges that Shiite groups coordinated political strategy inside the country and used Hezbollah's television channel, Al-Manar, to mobilize opposition protests. Abdul-Jalil Khalil, a Wefaq member of parliament, denied the claims. ""We believe the problem is a political issue and an internal issue, and we have no support from the outside,"" he said, adding that Wefaq has no formal or informal relationship with Hezbollah and does not use Al-Manar to aid the movement. ""The movement is a peaceful movement,"" according to Khalil, who said Wefaq is interested in serious political reform and not in overthrowing the ruling family. Hassan Mushaimaa, the secretary-general of Haq, has been detained and was unavailable to comment on the report. Bahrain's ruling Khalifa family is Sunni Muslim, but about two-thirds of the country's people are Shiite. The State Department has said it believes that Iran's role in Bahrain has been minimal and that the protests in Bahrain were the product of home-grown frustrations of the country's Shiites, who want greater economic and political participation. A U.S. official said Iran would ""like to meddle if it could,"" but there is ""no evidence they've been able to do much."" The opposition in Bahrain is huge, and the protests began without Iranian organization or involvement, the official said. Iran has contact with some in Bahrain and might give ""some advice,"" but that's all, the official said. The Obama administration has criticized the Bahraini crackdown and called for the government to enter political dialogue with the opposition. CNN's Jenifer Fenton and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","Opposition denies claims of outside help .

"Washington (CNN) -- The heart of President Barack Obama's speech Tuesday was the same focus on jobs and middle-class economic uncertainty that's driven every State of the Union of his presidency. But that was far from the only ground he covered. The president reeled off a laundry list of small-bore proposals: He called on Congress to hike the minimum wage to $9 an hour and invest $50 billion on rebuilding roads and bridges. He proposed universal preschool for 4-year-olds and linking some federal grant decisions to research schools on their ability to keep tuition costs in check. And he urged Congress to put his full gun control agenda up for a vote. 5 things we learned from the State of the Union . Nearly every idea in his speech had a couple of things in common: Virtually all of them are core Democratic priorities presented in language that delighted the base. None of them were shoot-for-the moon ambitious. They were either old ideas repackaged or markedly modest new ones. And few if any of them are likely to become a reality under the current Congress. State of the Union: More same old, same old . In a sharp contrast to his first address to Congress four years ago, the president paid lip service to bipartisanship, but he made clear that it was a luxury, not a driving priority. He invited Republicans to join him in a bipartisan effort... to back the Democratic policy vision. If the speech came across more like a wish list than an action plan with a good chance of making it past the House, that's because it was. Just laying the exhaustive string of liberal policy priorities seemed to be the point -- a companion to the ideological offensive in his inauguration speech. The top priority Tuesday wasn't necessarily jobs, or guns, or climate change, or voting rights. It was the sum of all those parts, a liberal vision that Obama clearly hopes will nudge the country in that direction. What Obama said . ""It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country -- the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead,"" the president said. ""It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few."" The framing in Tuesday's speech was designed to help the president score two wins: in the long term, a progressive legacy, and in the short run, an advantage in the budget battles and debt ceiling drama. With the GOP laying responsibility for a looming sequester at the White House door, the president pointed to Republicans' emphasis on the need for entitlement reform as proof that they're laying the burden for deficit reduction on cops and teachers and seniors instead of ""the wealthiest and most powerful."" ""Deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan,"" he said. ""A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs -- that must be the North Star that guides our efforts."" Obama dares Congress to get the job done . It's a message designed to resonate with working-class voters, and the Republican Party's standard-bearer for the evening, Sen. Marco Rubio, countered with a mirror-image appeal to the same demographic. ""Mr. President, I still live in the same working-class neighborhood I grew up in. My neighbors aren't millionaires. They're retirees who depend on Social Security and Medicare,"" Rubio said. ""I don't oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich. I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors."" Rubio says Obama would hurt the middle class . The approach was much the same as the president's, an ideological vision unweighted by grand, ambitious plans to make it a reality. In fact, for an exhaustive speech, Obama's State of the Union was notably short on some key specifics. The White House has so far brushed off calls for a price tag for the proposals in Tuesday's speech, promising a full accounting when the president sends his next budget to Congress. But in the end, the policy details may be less important than the political timing. The White House and congressional Republicans remain locked in a brutal message war over the sequester, now just over two weeks away.

"(CNN) -- Syria's leading opposition movement warned Friday of an impending government ""massacre"" designed to crush activists in the city of Homs, which has emerged as a center of anti-regime unrest. The Syrian National Council said military troops and vehicles had surrounded the western city and thousands of troops were manning more than 60 checkpoints just inside the city. ""These are all signs of a security crackdown operation that may reach the level of a total invasion of the city,"" the council said in a news release. It said that a ""massive number of casualties"" could occur. ""Evidence received from reports, videos and information obtained by activists on the ground in Homs indicate that the regime is paving the way to commit a massacre in order to extinguish the revolution in Homs and to discipline, by example, other Syrian cities that have joined the revolution,"" the council said. At least 17 people were killed Friday in Homs and at least 29 were killed elsewhere across Syria, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition group. It said women, children and dissident soldiers were among the dead. The United Nations said last week that more than 4,000 people have died in Syria since a government crackdown against protesters erupted in mid-March. The regime's actions have outraged world powers and sparked sanctions by the Arab League, Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The council said the Bashar al-Assad regime is ""driving violent sectarian incidents to justify this potential murder."" More than 30 corpses -- all thought to be victims of sectarian violence -- were found Monday in Homs. The city of Homs is in a province of the same name. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria says it is the ""amalgamation of the national Syria identity combined: urban, country, and Bedouin."" It says ""Muslims in Homs are Sunni, Alawite, Ismaelis and Druze. Christian in Homs are Orthodox and Catholic."" The city also includes Kurds, Armenians and Turkmens, the LCC says. Sunnis make up the majority of the country and Alawites hold sway in the military and government. ""The regime has tried hard to ignite the sectarian conflict using many dirty methods, which have included bombing and burning mosques, torturing and killing young men, and kidnapping women and children,"" the Syrian National Council said in its news release. ""The regime also took a significant step today ... in burning oil pipelines in the neighborhood of Baba Amr to blame what the regime calls 'armed gangs' in an attempt to crush the peaceful uprising on the pretext of a war on terrorism."" A strike on a pipeline was reported on Thursday. The council likens what the regime may be planning to the 1982 government assault on the city of Hama, an operation that left thousands dead. Syria was led at the time by then-president Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father. ""We hold accountable the regime, and behind it the Arab League and the international community, (for) what could happen to innocent civilians in the next few hours or days, and the implications for the region as a whole in the near future,"" the council said. The LCC says Homs has been suffering ""from a suffocating siege and heavy, continuous security campaigns that are resulting with tens of casualties and wounded every day. This is why it deserves to be declared as a crisis zone."" The LCC said the regime is trying to foment sectarian feuds. It said the anti-government Free Syrian Army, made up of army defectors, has been standing up to the regime's army and pro-regime shabiha, whom they call ""thugs."" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland expressed concern about developments Friday. ""It is extremely concerning that in places like Homs we have a huge number of reports that they are preparing something large scale,"" she told reporters. ""It's a perfect example for them to prove that they are not the propagators of this violence. And obviously they've chosen not to do so. And they are not going to be able to hide who's responsible if there is a major assault on the weekend."" She added that U.S. officials hold al-Assad responsible for the violence. ""We think he needs to go; that that is how peace is going to come to Syria."" British minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said his government ""is deeply concerned by reports of a build-up of Syrian security forces and armored vehicles in the besieged city of Homs,"" also the ""scene of disturbing crackdowns in recent months."" Human Rights Watch last month issued a report detailing ""the systematic nature of abuses against civilians in Homs by Syrian government forces."" The International Crisis Group issued a report on Syria in July, saying ""Homs had become a miniature Syria, a microcosm of its numerous problems."" ""Its economic dynamism benefited only a narrow circle of people,"" the report said. The swelling number of migrants who lived on the city's outskirts suffered from declining services and living standards, it said. The security services, predominantly controlled by and staffed with Alawites, earned a particularly bad reputation. ""If the picture appeared reasonably positive to one who visited the center of the city, for most of its underprivileged residents it was appalling,"" the report said.","The Syrian National Council warns a government operation appears imminent in Homs .
At least 46 people died in Syria on Friday, 17 of them in Homs, activists say .

"(EW.com) -- ""Star Trek"" helmer J.J. Abrams told EW in November that he wouldn't be taking the reins of another intergalactic franchise: Disney's upcoming ""Star Wars"" extension. But a new interview in Empire Magazine reveals that initially, Abrams did entertain the idea of putting his stamp on ""Star Wars."" The ""Lost"" creator said that he and Kathleen Kennedy, the series's new overseer, had ""very early conversations"" about how he might be involved in ""Star Wars: Episode VII's"" development. Ultimately, though, the longtime Lucas trilogy admirer decided against picking up a lightsaber of his own. ""I quickly said that because of my loyalty to 'Star Trek,' and also just being a fan, I wouldn't even want to be involved in the next version of those things,"" Abrams told Empire. ""I declined any involvement very early on. I'd rather be in the audience not knowing what was coming, rather than being involved in the minutiae of making them."" Fair enough. Abrams has made no secret of his affection for ""Star Wars."" By contrast, he had no such nostalgic attachment to ""Star Trek"" before signing on to direct it -- which may have made it easier for him to revamp that franchise. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" screenwriter Michael Arndt has already signed on to pen ""Episode VII,"" which is scheduled to hit theaters in 2015. ""X-Men: First Class"" director Matthew Vaughn was rumored to be in talks for the film last month; since we know Abrams is out of the picture, confirmation of Vaughn's â€” or another director's â€” involvement may come soon.

"(CNN) -- Mark Webber and Red Bull judged their race strategy perfectly to pip Fernando Alonso to the checkered flag during an action packed British Grand Prix at Silverstone. The Australian maneuvered expertly through 52 immensely tactical laps to record his second victory of the season, though Ferrari's Alonso did maintain his lead in the drivers' championship. With the torrential rain that had affected the build up absent for the entire race, Webber hunted down Alonso in the closing stages as the Spaniard's tires began to wear, eventually overtaking on lap 49. Defending double world champion Sebastian Vettel, also of Red Bull, came third while Alonso's Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa finished fourth. Silverstone support: Does home advantage help in F1? ""It was a very interesting race. Fernando Alonso had very good pace,"" Webber told a press conference after his victory. ""We had the better strategy in the end. We never gave up, kept pushing and it did not work out in the end for Fernando. ""I've had a few wins, but this one is taking a little bit to sink in. It didn't look like a spectacular race between us initially, but it was one -- pacing the stints on the tires, Fernando starting on the harder tire. ""After the first stint Fernando had I thought he was in good shape to close the win out. But it came our way and I am absolutely over the moon. ""I had a single opportunity to pounce and I wasn't going to let that slip. Fernando, with the front-left tire, if you lose balance around this place, the speed is very high in that second sector and it's very hard for the driver to do something. ""It was obvious he was pushing as hard as possible but the balance wasn't with him."" It was Webber's second win at Silverstone in three years and helped him cut Alonso's lead at the top of the drivers' standings to 13 points. Alonso has 129 to Webber's 116, with Vettel third on 100 points. Alonso said: ""It was very close today but at the end Mark was much quicker than us and deserved the victory. Now we are fighting for victories in the last three or four grands prix. ""I hope the fans enjoyed the show today. I'm still leading the championship and that's the main target for us, we lost seven points with Mark winning but we gained some more points on the rest of the field."" World champion Vettel added: ""Mark deserved to win. Thanks for all fans out there -- it's been horrible weather for them, not just for us. But today the sun came out and British summer showed its best."" Starting on pole, Alonso protected his lead even after a pit stop on lap 16 but the hard tires on Lewis Hamilton's McLaren car set up a tussle for first place on lap 19. The lead changed hands several times as the former McLaren teammates battled round the circuit. Eventually, Alonso came out on top and Webber moved up to third when Hamilton pitted. The Spaniard was forced into his own stop for a set of compulsory soft tires as a furious round of strategic stops took place around lap 38. And try as he might, Alonso couldn't hold off Webber as his tires faded fast, allowing the Australian to make his decisive move three laps from home. There was also controversy further down the field as Sauber's Sergio Perez blasted his Williams counterpart Pastor Maldonado for a crash that put the Mexican out of the race. Perez said of the Venezuelan: ""He doesn't respect other drivers. I was already in front and he should have given space not to crash, but he tried to push me all the way. ""I don't understand why he drives like that and I hope the stewards do something. It is not first time he has damaged my weekend. This guy will never learn if they don't do something. He could hurt someone. Everybody has concerns about him."" Maldonado was later reprimanded and fined $12,000 by the sport's governing body, the FIA, for the collision while Sauber driver Kamui Kobayashi from Japan was fined $30,000 for injuring three three mechanics during a pit-stop. The next race in the Formula One calendar is the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim on July 22.","Australian Mark Webber wins the Formula One British Grand Prix for Red Bull .

"(CNN) -- The blue clay used at this year's Madrid Masters which was severely criticized by world No.1 Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal has been banned from all ATP World Tour events in 2013. The announcement was made after a meeting of the ATP Board of Directors in London on Saturday. ""After careful consideration, I have decided that blue clay courts will not be allowed next year. I very much believe in innovation and exploring ways to enhance our sport. While the blue clay may have offered better visibility on television, there were clearly issues with the quality of the courts in Madrid this year ..."" Executive Chairman and President Brad Drewett said in a statement. ""Regardless of color, we must first ensure that courts are safe and fair for players,"" he added. Kvitova: 'Tennis without pressure is boring' It brings an abrupt end to the use of the surface pioneered by former Romanian tennis star turned businessman Ion Tiriac as a way of improving visibility for television viewers. ""Ion has been a great supporter of the game for many years and I continue to encourage his ideas, including the testing of blue clay at non-ATP World Tour events. At this time, however, it's clear that further development is required before it can be considered for use at the ATP World Tour level,"" Drewett said. Can Djokovic and Kvitova emulate Wimbledon greats? The move ensures that both Nadal and Djokovic will return to play in Madrid next year after threatening to boycott the event if the blue clay was retained. After losing to fellow Serb Janko Tipsarevic in straight sets on the surface last month, Djokovic said he wanted to ""forget this week"" and move on to ""real"" clay courts. 'You cannot be serious!' Tennis' top tantrums . ""It took me at least a week to try to get used to this surface and somehow find a way to win matches and play a decent level of tennis. There is no discussion in my eyes, it's very simple. No blue clay for me,"" Djokovic said. Ukrainian player Sergiy Stakhovsky also joined the chorus of disapproval tweeting in May that the ""blueclay court 6"" was ""the worst court of @ATPWorldTour."" ""Ha! Blue clay.. It looks like something Smurfs would play on,"" ran another tweet from Croatain Ivo Karlovic.","Blue clay used at Madrid Masters this year has been banned by the ATP for all 2013 World Tour events .

"Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- Bob Skuba is a whirl of energy. Outspoken, loud and opinionated, he's the embodiment of East Coast bravado. He's got a new distinction now: He was Adam Lanza's barber. ... I used to cut the killer's hair ... It's hard to process. Skuba was clipping hair on Friday at Robert Anthony's Hair Salon, the shop he, his mom and sister have run for the last 13 years. First one police car drove by. Then two. Then five. Then 10, followed by 10 undercover police cars. Then, word came of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School -- and who had carried it out. That kid used to sit right here, in this barber chair. You're sitting in the chair where he used to sit and get a haircut, he tells a visitor on Tuesday. Skuba puts his hand on the black barber chair. That sick, son of a ... The barber shakes his head. Read more: New details surface . Lanza would sit with his head straight down, his eyes adrift, never making eye contact. Skuba would run clippers through his hair like a buzz saw. The kid was about 12 when he first came to the shop. His mom would bring him in, every four weeks, over the next five years. People would tell the barber not to talk with the kid, that he was a strange bird. But Skuba's not one to keep his mouth shut. He can't stop talking for more than 15 seconds. How you doing? How's school? What you been up to lately? His mom, Nancy Lanza -- who Lanza killed at her house before his school rampage -- would jump in and answer for her son. He's not in school. I'm homeschooling. Lanza would not say a word. Every now and then, he'd mumble something. His mother was the boss. She'd pipe up when the barber asked Adam if he liked his haircut. I don't like it, Mom would say. Cut it shorter, trim his sideburns. When the haircut was done, the barber would tell Lanza it was time to get up. But he'd just sit there, like he was still getting clipped. His mom would grab him by the arm and yank him up. It's time to go, Adam. Your haircut is done. The boy would listen to his mother. Always, always, always. Never would he disobey her. Friends: Mom was nothing like son . The barber would stand there, his eyes raised at the weirdness of it all. What the f***? The barber's sister would tell him there was something wrong with Lanza, that he wasn't right. Skuba never knew what exactly was wrong. Lanza never looked like he was dangerous. He didn't seem like the type, a nerdy teen with oversized dress shirts buttoned to the top. Never, never did he think the kid would do this. He had to be possessed by the devil. I don't care how messed up you are. No one shoots a child 11 times. About three years ago, the haircuts stopped. The barber thought Adam must have moved to a different town. His mom was always punctual with setting up his haircuts, a real regular. The salon is just across the street from St. Rose of Lima, a Roman Catholic Church. On Tuesday, the church bid farewell to 6-year-old Jessica Rekos. Skuba stood out front and watched as the hearse, under heavy police escort, pulled out and the funeral procession headed to the cemetery. Distraught, he shook his head. Never could he have imagined. Remembering the victims . Inside his shop, he stood at the chair where he'd cut Adam Lanza's hair so many times over the years. ""It's just weird that I actually touched him. That's the worst part about it -- that he was in one of our chairs. I'd try to joke with him. He wouldn't even look at me."" Admittedly, he has a terrible thought. He wishes he'd have killed Adam. ""I wish I would've killed him then,"" he says. ""Or he should have killed himself a long time ago. He would've saved us all the trouble. ... He should've run in front of a bus, or some other type of terrible death he should've done to himself. ""It would've saved all those kids and parents the trouble. I should've slipped and stabbed him by accident. It would've been a lot better for those people."" Skuba's not sure if he cut the hair of any of the slain children. He hasn't let his mind go there. I don't really want to talk about that. He's lived in Newtown for more than 30 years. He puts down his clippers. Then, he sighs.

"Washington (CNN) -- It should come as no surprise that prominent union leaders are among the first group President Barack Obama courts as he seeks support for overhauling immigration policy. It was organized labor that helped ensure defeat of a bipartisan effort to reform the nation's immigration laws five years ago. At that time, the AFL-CIO and other prominent union groups came out against the initiative, fearing a proposal for a temporary guest worker program for seasonal workers would weaken union membership and bargaining clout. That led to a handful of liberal-leaning Democrats to vote against the bill, including Sens. Sherrod Brown, Tom Harkin and Debbie Stabenow. Mindful that a potential split in the Democratic coalition this time around could again prove fatal to the passage of an immigration bill, Obama met on Tuesday with more than a dozen labor leaders. They included AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, Eliseo Medina of the Service Employees International Union, and Arturo Rodriguez of United Farm Workers. Castillo: Five reasons why time may be right for immigration reform . The purpose of the hour-long, closed-door meeting was to engage in a ""dialogue"" about ""immigration reform and how it fits into his broader economic agenda,"" the White House said. In comments to reporters following the meeting, there was evidence the president had sought to ensure that the union leaders were in his corner before he unveils an immigration proposal. ""It was an excellent conversation,"" Trumka said outside the White House. ""I think we are all on the same page."" The White House has long been hopeful that the labor movement get on board. Despite a contentious relationship at times with labor, the president's agenda has largely been supported by the major union leaders. Trumka also notably attended Obama's immigration speech last week in Las Vegas. Nonetheless, the same sticking points that turned labor against immigration reform five years ago remain. 'Now's the time' to move on immigration, Obama says . Conservatives, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, are again pushing a temporary guest worker program that is favored by the business community and agricultural interests that depend on seasonal employment. But the major unions remain opposed to such a measure. In 2009, both the AFL-CIO and the SEIU jointly released guidelines on an immigration reform package they would support. Those guidelines called for ""improvement, not expansion"" of temporary worker programs. Obama has so far not mentioned a guest worker program in his broad outlines of an immigration reform plan. The burden of attaining citizenship is another trip wire. Both the AFL-CIO and SEIU are lobbying for an easier path to citizenship than was proposed by the 2007 effort. That is in part because union membership has declined significantly over the past two decades along with contraction of U.S. manufacturing. A surge of new citizens, many of whom will seek unionized jobs, could boost their numbers. ""We were talking about trying to fix a broken system,"" Trumka said after the White House meeting. ""We were talking about commonsense reform that has an inclusive and broad path to citizenship that allows us to bring people in and take advantage of that."" America's brain drain dilemma: immigrant students who leave . Trumka declined to specify the kind of path to citizenship the president suggested he would support. Another leader said she thought there was agreement between the labor groups and Obama. ""There was joint agreement by everybody in this room and the president that there must be a pathway to citizenship and it must be meaningful and real,"" said Janet Murguia of the National Council of La Raza, also a participant in the meeting. ""It's our job to get the kind of solution that will reflect that meaningful path.""","Obama sits down with labor leaders to discuss immigration reform .

"(CNN) -- Congolese rebel leader Laurent Nkunda was arrested by Rwandan authorities early Friday, a development that raised hopes for peace in the war-ravaged country, representatives from both countries said. Laurent Nkunda, seen here last November, was reportedly arrested in Rwanda. Congolese forces first tried to capture the Tutsi rebel leader late Thursday evening near Bunagana, a village in eastern Congo. Rwandan authorities then captured Nkunda around 2 a.m. Friday, Omalanga added. The two countries were discussing efforts to extradite Nkunda back to the Congo. ""We think this is a major development in the peace process,"" said Madnodje Mounoubai, a spokesman for the U.N. Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Hear how Nkunda tried to flee capture » . The arrest could cause the estimated 1,500 rebel soldiers still loyal to Nkunda to join government forces and put a halt to most of the fighting in eastern Congo, said Mounoubai. ""It is also amazing that the two governments are working together,"" Mounoubai said. Rwanda and Congo traditionally have been on different sides of the ongoing conflict in eastern Congo, which pits ethnic Tutsis supported by Rwanda against Congo-backed ethnic Hutus. The war is effectively an extension of the Rwandan genocide of the early 1990s, when hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were killed in ethnic battles between minority Tutsi and majority Hutu. Renewed fighting broke out in eastern Congo at the end of August between rebels under the command of Nkunda and government forces. At the time, Nkunda said his forces were fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from Hutu militants who escaped to Congo. Nkunda declared a unilateral cease-fire on October 29, but it failed to stop the fighting and reports of atrocities. The fighting in the area in the province of North Kivu in eastern Congo, has displaced more than 250,000 people since August, the United Nations reported.  See photos from Mia Farrow's trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo » . A scathing report by a U.N. Security Council panel last month said that Rwanda and Congo are, in effect, fighting a brutal proxy war for territory and precious natural resources in eastern Congo, and all parties involved in the conflict are using execution, rape and child soldiers as tools of war. The report ""found evidence that Rwandan authorities have sent officers and units of the Rwanda Defense Forces"" into Congo in support of Congo rebel leader Laurent Nkunda's fighters. Francois Grignon of the International Crisis Group said it may still be hard to quell violence even after Nkunda's arrest. ""Laurent Nkunda had developed a parallel administration in North Kivu, so it might be a challenge to push the remaining members of (Nkunda's forces) to join with the Congolese army and give up that power,"" said Grignon, whose organization has studied the conflict.

"(CNN) -- A soldier missing in action since a failed attempt to rescue a French hostage in Somalia is most likely dead, France's defense minister said Monday. The hostage, Denis Allex, also apparently was killed, Defense Minister Jean-Yves le Drian said. French officials had previously confirmed that one soldier died in Friday's failed attempt to rescue Allex from Islamist militants. On Monday, le Drian said it was likely that a total of two French soldiers were killed. ""Everything points to the fact that the hostage was murdered and that the missing soldier has been killed,"" le Drian told CNN affiliate BFM. Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamist movement that has been holding Allex, said Monday that the hostage remained alive in an undisclosed location. The militants also said Monday that a French soldier who had been injured in the attempted rescue had died of his wounds. A Twitter post from Al-Shabaab on Monday showed a purported photograph of that soldier with a message to France's president: ""Was it worth it?"" On Friday, French forces engaged in a fierce gunbattle with militants in their attempt to rescue Allex, who was a member of the DGSE, France's equivalent of the CIA and a part of its Defense Ministry. The clashes in Bulo Marer, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) northwest of Mogadishu, the capital, ended with 17 Islamist fighters dead, according to the French Defense Ministry. On Monday, le Drian said the failure of the rescue mission was ""extremely regrettable."" ""The operation almost succeeded,"" he told BFM. ""They are very complicated and risky missions, because we are behind enemy lines."" French bid to rescue hostage fails . Allex was abducted on July 14, 2009, while on a mission in Mogadishu in support of the transitional Somali government, the French Defense Ministry said. French media reports suggest that Denis Allex is a pseudonym for the military serviceman. French officials said they launched the rescue attempt after the terror group failed to negotiate for the hostage's release for years while holding him in inhumane conditions.

"(CNN) -- A leading football agent fined by FIFA for using social media has taken to Facebook to question the fairness of soccer's global governing body. In December Brazilian agent Paulo Teixeira was handed a two-month suspension and a $8,600 fine by FIFA for breaching its code of professional conduct as well as its disciplinary code for a number of Facebook postings. Teixeira has used his Training Compensation page on the website to expose what he says is the unequal relationship between Europe's leading clubs and smaller clubs in South America and Africa in the way teams from developing countries are compensated for discovering and training young talented players. Unbowed by FIFA's sanction, Teixeira returned to Facebook on Monday to ask why the disciplinary committee that had handled his case -- involving 215 pages in total of evidence and the decision itself, 80% in French -- had comprised four officials, only one of whom speaks French. ""And in came the judges -- four. A Swiss, an Irish, a Venezuelan and a Chinese. It took a full month to write the 31-pages long decision, again in French. At the end of the day, I had been suspended for two months and fined,"" Teixeira posted on Facebook. ""How could football executives of this caliber -- bosses of their respective associations -- have reached such a decision without having full knowledge of the contents of the case? ""Or was is presented to them in the universaI language ... Esperanto?"" In a statement to CNN, FIFA insisted: ""The members of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee were aware, took note and understood all the elements of the case, which were available and presented to them in a language they understand, in order to be in a position to take the decision."" Teixeira, who once represented former Brazil international Roberto Carlos, has been using Facebook to discuss governance issues surrounding sport, but primarily football, after being inspired by the way social media was used by revolutionaries during the Arab Spring. ""European clubs are ready to pay millions on transfer fees, but when it comes to settling training compensation to African or South Americans clubs, it becomes a problem,"" said Teixeira. ""Clubs know that they will have to pay once the cases reach FIFA, but until then they buy time."" His disciplinary action came after two European powerhouses, Italy's AC Milan and Anderlecht of Belgium, complained that Teixeira had defamed them in Facebook postings when he claimed the clubs failed to pay the true cost of training a player to the development team, based on FIFA's formula. However, advocacy group changeFIFA, which seeks greater transparency within the ruling body, suggested the Teixeira case raised important questions. ""Given the serious allegations of Teixeira, it's odd that FIFA would target the person making the allegations of impropriety and not address the alleged impropriety itself,"" a changeFIFA spokesman told CNN. ""Any sincere search for truth by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee should involve investigating the allegations themselves and not silencing the person making them."" Teixeira is football's equivalent of a bounty hunter, taking a hefty commission from the teams he represents in cases he takes before FIFA to claim training compensation from larger clubs. He has extensively detailed his disputes with a number of those European clubs on Facebook, and when Teixeira was suspended in December, FIFA released a statement saying ""this was the first time a member of the football family has been suspended/fined for using social media.""","Football agent Paulo Teixeira takes to Facebook to question workings of FIFA justice system .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of women and at least five children were arrested on Saturday after demonstrations were held in two Saudi cities, Riyadh and Buraida, according to human rights activists. The women were demanding the release of relatives they say have been held for years without access to lawyers or a trial, the activists said. Mohammed Al-Qahtani, a prominent activist currently on trial in Saudi Arabia on charges that include breaking allegiance to the Saudi king, told CNN the women who were protesting are ""female relatives of political prisoners."" ""They are asking the authorities to either take these prisoners to court,"" said Al-Qahtani, ""or set them free."" In the capital city of Riyadh, one activist who was part of the demonstration said it was held outside a building that houses one of the country's government-backed human rights groups. The activist, who requested anonymity for fear for her safety, said she had to quickly flee the scene to avoid arrest. About 50 women demonstrated there, and at least two of them had been arrested as police tried to disperse the crowd, she said. ""They went out there today to ask that their relatives be freed,"" said the activist. ""They have been in prison for a long time and have had no lawyer and no trial."" According to two other activists, three of the women arrested in Riyadh were the wife and daughter and granddaughter of Suleiman al-Rashudi, a political activist who was arrested in December after giving a lecture in which he said protests were permitted in Islam. Al-Rashudi previously spent five years in detention and was found guilty last year of, among other things, financing terrorism, incitement against the king and attempting to seize power. One amateur video purportedly shot at the scene shows women, some who brought their children, chanting, ""The people call for the liberation of the prisons."" In Buraida, the provincial capital of deeply conservative Qassim Province, activists say at least 26 women protested and were arrested outside the city's Board of Grievances on Saturday -- the scene of a similar protest in early January. Many of the women brought their children, who they say were also arrested. One of the female protesters, Um Abdullah, spoke to CNN by phone as she was being held in a police station in Buraida. ""I demonstrated for the release of my husband, Abdulmalek Al-Muqdin,"" explained Um Abdullah, ""who has been in jail without charge for 12 years."" According to Um Abdullah, whose son was detained alongside her, the police told her and the other women that they would be released if they signed a piece of paper that would compel them to show up at any government office if summoned to do so, but the women refused to do so. One amateur video posted online purports to show several of the women, and some of the children, in the back of a police bus after having been detained. In the video, the women express solidarity with the political prisoners in Saudi Arabia. Despite repeated efforts, CNN has been unable to reach Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry for comment. Protests are prohibited in Saudi Arabia. In early January, a small group of women held a demonstration in the same part of Buraida, calling for the release of detained family members. Their arrest, a short time later, caused great outrage and sparked several days of small protests in various cities. Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry confirmed to CNN later in the month that the women were eventually all released. When asked in late January about demonstrators' claims that their relatives are political prisoners who should be released, Interior Ministry Spokesman Major Gen. Mansour Al-Turki told CNN that Saudi government officials would not comment on cases currently being ""looked at by the courts.","Activists report arrests of women in Saudi cities .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Many are nominated, but only a few carry home hardware during Hollywood's awards season. For the rest, the gift bags and beauty suites in the days leading up to the Oscars promise the biggest rewards. A-list Academy Award nominees get thousands of dollars in gifts from companies hoping to associate their products with their celebrity, while D-listers get bags of swag valued in the hundreds of dollars. ""It's something they anticipate from year to year,"" said Lisa Gal of Hollywood Baskets, who puts together a high-end gift bag that goes to 30 Oscar nominees and presenters who stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. The Academy Awards are Sunday night. Stars checking into the Four Seasons will find a KitchenAid mixer set up in their room, customized with 22K gold paint and Swarovski crystal by Nicole Dinardo and valued at $1,500, Gal said. A Traveler's Choice luggage bag sits nearby, filled with 20 other gifts valued at $7,000, ranging from a $25 pack of Sunny Sleevz -- to protect their arms at the beach -- to $500 worth of Intelligent Nutrients, a line of certified organic beauty products. Some products come from established companies -- such as the high-end Norman Love chocolates -- while younger, smaller ones get into Gal's bag -- including Symone Prince Beauty. ""They can be in there with the big guys,"" Gal said. The key to being selected for the bag is quality, she said. ""We have to make sure this is up to par on the celebrity's level, so it's very exclusive,"" she said. Getting in the Oscar bag can be a big boost for a product, said Asha Blake, whose Goldenheart Media partners with Gal. ""It's great exposure for the companies in media press releases, not just about being in front of celebrities,"" Blake said. ""It's a different way of doing advertising in this day and age."" Gal can't reveal which stars get her bags until they check out of the hotel Monday, but her SAG Award and Golden Globe gift list included Glenn Close, Colin Firth, Michelle Williams, Morgan Freeman and Ryan Seacrest. ""Only the most recognizable, important people staying at the hotel"" get her gift bag, but sometimes there are more big stars than bags. Gal scrambled to put together an extra bag one year when ""Avatar"" director James Cameron was left out. One gift bag is set aside for donation to a charity, which can then auction it off, Gal said. Publicist Roger Neal pioneered the practice of connecting the gifting with charities with his beauty and couture suite at the L'Ermitage Hotel before the Oscars 16 years ago. ""Just to give celebs free stuff is meaningless, but when there's a purpose with it, then I feel good about gifting them,"" Neal said. The 200 celebrities, including 10 Oscar nominees, who attended his four-day suite event this week autographed items that will help an organ transplant foundation and a foster children's charity. Two teens who live in foster homes were pampered with facials, massages and other beauty treatments, Neal said. They also left with suits, he said. A-listers visting Neal's suite included ""Artist"" actress Penelope Ann Miller, ""Bridesmaids"" actress Wendi McLendon-Covey, Annie Mumolo, nominated for writing ""Bridesmaids,"" and actors Joe Mantegna, Eric Roberts and Quintin Aaron. Richard Middleton, executive producer of ""The Artist,"" brought his wife with him Tuesday, Neal said. She was given a Shekhar Rahate designed gown to wear on the red carpet. Seamstresses worked overnight to resize it for her, he said. Eimear O'Kane, whose ""Pentecost"" is nominated for best live action short film, was gifted a handbag and jewels by designer Timmy Woods of Beverly Hills to carry on the red carpet Sunday. Kari Feinstein's Oscar Style Lounge in West Hollywood's Mondrian Hotel offers something for everyone, with companies handing out gifts ""based on the caliber of celebrities,"" Feinstein said. Best supporting actress nominee Octavia Spencer would likely be offered a $1,000 piece of jewelry from Devora Libin Jewels and a week at the Capella Hotel in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. But some reality TV stars who show up may have to settle for a years supply of popcorn from Popcorn Indiana. ""We try and make sure that everyone that comes is someone who is recognizable with a lead part in a movie or TV show,"" Feinstein said. But this year's D-lister could be next year's A-lister.","Lisa Gal prepares $7,000 gift bags for Four Seasons' top celeb guests .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- An elite South African police squad has arrested 19 suspected Congolese rebels in a remote corner of northern South Africa, an official said, in a raid that may have headed off a coup attempt. ""The grouping's objective was to receive specialized military related training to overthrow the current DRC government, under the leadership of President Joseph Kabila,"" Makhosini Nkosi, a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority, said in a statement Tuesday. Read more: Why the world is ignoring Congo war . The alleged coup plotters were tracked to a remote area of Limpopo province, suggesting long-term surveillance by South African law enforcement. The National Prosecuting Authority said that no South Africans have been linked to the suspects but that further arrests were possible. Congolese government officials were quick to blame M23, a rebel group operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's North Kivu province. The group embarrassed the Congolese government by briefly seizing the key eastern city of Goma late last year, before withdrawing to positions outside the city. ""We know very well that these men have links to M23,"" said Lambert Mende, a DRC government spokesman.

"(CNN) -- Early data shows the Mars rover Curiosity landed with amazing accuracy this week, coming down about 1.5 miles from its target after a 350-million-mile journey, NASA scientists said Friday, perhaps giving planners more confidence about landing spacecraft in tight spaces in the future. The $2.6 billion rover is on a two-year mission to determine whether Mars ever had an environment capable of supporting life. It landed Monday and will spend the next four days installing operational software that will give it full movement and analytic capabilities, scientists said at a news conference at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Curiosity missed its target entry point into Mars' atmosphere by about only one mile, and most everything in its complicated descent and landing operations -- a spectacle popularly known as the ""seven minutes of terror"" -- happened on time, including the deployment of the largest-ever supersonic parachute and the heat shield separation. ""From all the data we've received so far, we flew this right down the middle, and it's incredible to work on a plan for (years) and then have things happen ... according to plan,"" said Steve Sell, who was involved in the powered descent phase. ""It was an impressive ride,"" said NASA's Allen Chen, the operations lead for descent and landing. Tail winds might account for some of the off-target distance, NASA's Gavin Mendeck said, but the actual landing spot was well within the expected range of uncertainty, or the area where the rover could well have ended up. ""With what we learn over the next few months, we'll see if we can chop (the area of uncertainty) back a bit"" for future missions, Chen said. Chen said the early information about the landing is based on only 1 megabyte of data received on the day of the landing; much more information will be received in the coming weeks. Precision in landing was important because NASA chose a relatively tight area for Curiosity's arrival: The Gale Crater, which contains an 18,000-foot high mountain about 7.5 miles south of the landing site. The rover's prime target is Mount Sharp, the mountain in the crater. Scientists hope the layers of rock that form the mountain will give them a timeline of the history of Mars. Though Curiosity's primary science mission has yet to begin, the rover, along with probes in orbit, already have transmitted images. On Thursday, NASA released a sweeping color panorama of the planet's surface, showing the rocky, reddish desert surrounding it and the mountain it will explore in the coming months. The 360-degree view captures the landscape of Gale Crater. NASA has said photographs like the ones beamed back by the rover, as well as others taken by the probes in orbit, will be used to map a path to the mountain's base. The rover is built to run for two years, but a previous rover, Opportunity, has been working on Mars since 2004, well beyond the three months NASA planned. Opportunity's sister rover, Spirit, ran from 2004 to 2010. The rover is installing its full surface operations software after the landing because its computers didn't have room for it during flight. The new software essentially replaces the flight operations programs, which Curiosity now doesn't need, NASA said. Complete coverage of Mars .

"Newark, New Jersey (CNN) -- Stopped at a red light in a crime-wracked neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey, a 31-year-old woman watched as her friend slumped to the floor after a bullet smashed through the back window of the 31-year-old's Pontiac minivan. ""I looked back and there was a gunman walking up on my car,"" said the driver, who declined to be named out of concerns for her safety. ""I turned away and he fired two more."" As the shots rang out, she turned the wheel and hit the gas to escape what turned out to be the second fatal shooting that day in Newark, where nearly a sixth of the city's police force was laid off amid budget cuts about two years ago. And Newark is by no means unique in implementing police cutbacks to save city money. Meanwhile, violent crime soared 18% nationwide last year, marking the country's first rise since 1993, while property crime also spiked for the first time in a decade. ""Hurry up, I can't breathe,"" mouthed wounded Bronique McLeod, after the gunman unloaded three rounds at the minivan where she was sitting with her friends just before midnight on October 1. The group then raced toward Newark's University Hospital, but the 24-year-old mother of two began to lose consciousness. One of the bullets had punctured her lung, her family said later. ""When they got her on the gurney she kept saying 'I'm dying, I'm dying,'"" the driver recalled. ""'Please don't let me die. I have two kids.'"" McLeod hung on until about 3 a.m. the next day, just hours after another victim died in a hail of gunfire in an unrelated incident about a mile away in the city's South Ward. Her death is one of at least 71 homicides so far this year in cash-strapped Newark, where police say they have reorganized after more than 160 police officers were cut from the force in November 2010. Last year the city tallied 74 murders through October, while violent crime soared despite earlier drops in the first years of Mayor Cory Booker's administration. Police expenditures in Newark have since declined every year for the last three years, according to the city's business administrator, Julien X. Neals, leaving cops to sustain public services with decreasing resources. Analysts say the trend isn't unique. ""Most cities have cut back since 2008 and the recession, though some more than others,"" said Gregory Minchak, a spokesman for the National League of Cities. Municipal administrators nationwide have since struggled to fill budget gaps amid declines in state aid, a sputtering economy, high employment and slowly rising costs in things like health care and public pensions. According to the Washington-based cities organization, the effects of the financial crisis are also ""increasingly evident in city property tax revenues in 2012,"" after dropping 3.9% nationwide last year and thereby bringing in fewer dollars for municipal services. In short, the overall pie has gotten smaller, say city officials who point to the hundreds of public sector layoffs in Newark in 2010. ""We've been in process of reducing our expenses pretty aggressively for the last three years,"" said Neals, who touted improvements in the city's tax collection efforts to help with the revenue side of the equation. ""Naturally there's a period where the rubber hits the road and there's not that much left to cut."" But last year Newark ended up with an $18 million surplus in state aid, prompting Republican Gov. Chris Christie to state that he wasn't happy with the city's 2012 requests for more assistance. ""I don't need New Jersey's largest city in any more financial trouble than it's in already,"" the governor told reporters earlier this month, dispatching state officials to ""force budget cuts."" Still, in 2010, Newark's mayor said police layoffs were an ""unfortunate situation that was entirely avoidable,"" and blamed the cuts on an unwillingness by police unions to negotiate needed reductions in the wake of the financial crisis. Booker said improvements in technologies and partnerships with federal agencies would help in the fight against crime, and pledged to sustain the number of officers patrolling the streets. But city police union vice president James Stewart has argued that both patrols and detective squads have since been reduced, and that ""all the technology in the world won't replace the bodies you need to respond to crime"" and build proactive policing. Meanwhile, town and city halls in places including Detroit, Michigan; Jacksonville, Florida; Kansas City, Missouri; and Scranton, Pennsylvania, have tentatively put public sector jobs on the chopping block this year to help fill budget gaps. In January, the mayor of crime-ridden Camden, New Jersey, nearly halved its police force while cutting close to a third of its fire department in an effort to close a $26.5 million budget deficit. And as America's fiscal health continues to assume center stage on the campaign trail, how the nation will deal with its debts in the days after November is largely expected to play out in some way on the streets of cities like Newark, Detroit and Camden. A silver lining may be that it's finally forcing the discussion. ""We're now having that frank public conversation about what do we want from government and how much do we want to pay for it,"" said Brookings Institution fellow Tracy Gordon. Law enforcement typically makes up large portions of most municipal budgets and is often considered a prime target for cutbacks. ""Every department is facing the same kind of issues of downsizing,"" said Newark Police Director Samuel DeMaio. ""Everybody has significantly less amount of police officers and you know there has to be a point where that comes to an end."" Newark residents such as Latasha Watson, who was a close friend of McLeod's, say they've become frustrated with the response from police, though they are equally disturbed by the so-called ""snitch code"" that keeps neighborhood witnesses quiet and away from authorities out of fear of retribution. Newark is listed as one of only a handful of New Jersey cities that maintain gangs with more than 200 members, according to a state survey. ""I know (police) are overwhelmed,"" Watson said. ""People are dying but we want cops on the street doing something,"" she added. Earlier this month, police arrested a 42-year-old city resident who is suspected in McLeod's murder.","In cash-strapped Newark, more than 160 police officers were cut from the force in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Police on Monday confirmed that a prosthetic leg discovered last week in a brushy area off a North Carolina road belongs to a missing 10-year-old girl. A serial number that was extracted from the prosthetic leg matches the limb belonging to Zahra Baker, the Hickory, North Carolina, Police Department said. Police launched a search for Zahra on October 9, but no one other than a family member has reported seeing her since September 25, when a woman saw her at a furniture store. The girl's disappearance is now being probed as a homicide. ""Medical records obtained from Australia where the prosthetic leg was originally fitted matched the serial number on the leg,"" police said in a news release. ""A scanner was used to extract the serial number from a transponder placed inside the prosthesis."" Zahra, a freckle-faced youngster, lost her leg to bone cancer at age 5 and developed lung cancer a few years later, according to CNN affiliate WCNC. Meanwhile, authorities continued Monday to search the Hickory home that Zahra lived in with her father, Adam Troy Baker, and her stepmother, Elisa Baker. The disappearance of Zahra, who had persevered through her health battles and wore hearing aids, has made international news. Police said Elisa Baker admitted that she planted a fake ransom note the day after the girl's disappearance was reported. Initially arrested on October 10 on several charges unrelated to Zahra's disappearance, including writing worthless checks, Elisa Baker was additionally charged with obstruction of justice for leaving the note. That charge is a felony. She is now cooperating with investigators, Hickory police have said. Zahra's father was arrested last week in nearby Catawba County on eight charges, including five counts of submitting worthless checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. Police earlier acknowledged that Adam Baker faced bad-check charges unrelated to the disappearance of his daughter. But they did not initially arrest him, as he had been helping authorities in their search.","Zahra Baker has not been seen since September .

Missouri lottery officials will announce their jackpot winner or winners at a news conference Friday morning. The winning Arizona ticket was sold at the Four Sons Food Store in Fountain Hills, state lottery spokeswoman Karen Bach said. The winner hasn't come forward there, either. ""Unbelievable,"" said Four Sons manager Bob Chebat. ""Everyone comes in here buying tickets, joking they'll take care of you if they win. But chances are so slim that it becomes standard that no one does win. I just don't know what to say. I'm shocked. I hope I was the guy who sold the winning ticket."" Lottery officials previously urged winners to take their time coming forward.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- If you're planning to transport marijuana in a private plane, you may want to check the president's schedule before taking off. That was the apparent lesson Thursday when two fighter jets under the direction of the the North American Aerospace Defense Command intercepted a general aviation plane that had flown Thursday into temporarily restricted air space over Los Angeles, NORAD said. The restriction of the airspace coincided with travel to the West Coast by President Barack Obama. The F-16s were scrambled from March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California, and intercepted the errant Cessna 182 around 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET), said NORAD. Accompanied by the F-16s, the Cessna 182 landed without incident, where it was met by local law enforcement, NORAD said. A law enforcement official said 10 kilograms of what appeared to be marijuana were found on the plane. Secret Service spokesman Max Milien said only that ""some type of narcotics"" was found. The Secret Service concluded that the pilot was ""of no protective interest to us,"" meaning the individual was not considered a threat, and was therefore turned over to the Long Beach Police Department. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations, which helped question the pilot, said police were expected to refer the case to state prosecutors. The White House had no comment. CNN Rosalina Nieves contributed to this report story from Los Angeles.","10 kilos of marijuana found on intercepted plane, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- For sale: One football club, formerly the best in Europe, now fallen on hard times. Buyer: Rich Middle Eastern family, determined to restore club's ""glory days."" When it was announced this week that a Kuwaiti family had agreed to take over Nottingham Forest, two-time winner of the European Cup, the big question became: Is this another Manchester City or Chelsea -- or more evidence of football's ""prune juice"" theory? For every Sheikh Mansour and Roman Abramovich, there is a Sulaiman al-Fahim or Venky's to prove that money pumped into one end of a club generally comes straight out the other. Indeed, Forest -- last a member of England's top division as long ago as 1999 -- reportedly required more than $100 million of investment from Nigel Doughty during his 13-year spell as owner. How much is Manchester City's victory worth for Abu Dhabi? That might not seem like a lot for a Premier League team, but for one that last season only narrowly avoided a return to the third tier, it's a significant amount. However, the Al-Hasawi family could potentially achieve a much greater return on their investment at Forest than, say, the series of money men who have followed in Al Fahim's unsuccessful attempt to make capital out of former EPL side Portsmouth. ""Financial interest from the Middle East has fallen into two camps: the genuine and the fantasists,"" Middle Eastern football expert James Montague told CNN. ""You have on one hand the likes of Sheikh Mansour who bought Manchester City, put his money where his mouth is and within four years has transformed the club from also-rans into title winners. They are now feared across Europe. Arabian dreams: Abu Dhabi celebrates City's title triumph . ""On the other you have a string of failed takeovers from those hoping Middle Eastern money could be some kind of panacea. Or in the case of Portsmouth were taken over by the UAE's Sulaiman al Fahim and eventually became the first Premier League club to go into administration. ""This takeover appears to fall in to the former category, largely because they have a successful track record in domestic football. Remember, Manchester City wasn't the first club Sheikh Mansour bankrolled. His first love is the Abu Dhabi-based club Al Jazira. Likewise the Hasawi family have turned Kuwaiti club Qadisa into a local regional powerhouse."" While Portsmouth's only English titles date back to 1949-50, Forest won the old first division championship relatively recently in 1978 and then shocked the football world by lifting Europe's top club trophy in the following two seasons. Will football clubs play fair financially? ""It makes a great deal of sense for an investor to buy into a club of Forest's stature,"" says Simon Chadwick, professor of sport business strategy and marketing at England's Coventry University. ""There is some equity in the brand amongst fans and potential fans that dates back to their successes in the late '70s and early '80s. This brand equity can offer things to customers and investors that other organizations can't."" Forest's near neighbor Leicester City, another club to have lost top-flight status in recent years, is now owned by a Thai group -- but Chadwick says there is a big difference in their earning potential. ""Forest's financial position, while not being especially strong, is more stable than it has been over the past five years or so,"" he said. ""For people like the Al-Hasawi family, it depends on what their view of the club is. If they see it as a revenue-generating asset, clearly it's going to take a great deal of hard work to build those revenue streams. ""It's there where Forest's history and equity of the brand can have an impact. Forest can deliver a level of revenue that their closest geographic rivals Leicester City can't. Nottingham has a significant population so in terms of being able to fill a stadium, in terms of latent fan base, it's very significant."" French revolution: Can Qatari cash make PSG a football force? Foreign investors once flocked to the lucrative but highly expensive Premier League -- Manchester United was reportedly valued at £1 billion when the Qatari royal family was linked with the club -- but the second-tier Championship is now proving to be more value for money. ""Sheikh Mansour saw that you needed to find undervalued clubs with history and prestige,"" said Montague, author of ""When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone."" ""City fit the bill, and in a way Forest has even more potential. We drool at clubs like Barcelona, Manchester United and Inter Milan winning the Champions League, but Forest won back-to-back European Cups just over 30 years ago and had one of the most iconic managers -- Brian Clough -- in charge. ""A whole industry has boomed over Clough -- biographies, novels, films. For the reported £20 million ($31 million), the Hasawi family are getting former European champions with Hollywood-level exposure for a snip."" Earlier this year, a Russian group agreed to buy Reading months before the club's promotion to the top flight, while Italians have bought Watford, Malaysians control Cardiff, Hong Kong's Carson Yeung owns Birmingham, a North American group has Derby County and an Egypt-born UK businessman has taken over Hull. PSG's Qatari owners aim to be world's best . ""It makes the competition for players more intense, the competition for spectators more intense,"" Chadwick told CNN. ""Whereas maybe five or 10 years ago the involvement of a rich investor might have been seen as the right ingredient for success, I think now such is the level of interest in English football and such is the level of investment, it's now much more about managerial competence and skill and knowledge of the industry and networking."" Doughty brought in former England manager Steve McClaren at the start of last season with disastrous results, and the current FC Twente coach's short reign resulted in the Forest benefactor -- considered one of the most powerful men in UK business -- standing down as chairman. Doughty put the club up for sale, but the Al-Hasawis dealt with the executors of his estate following the investment banker's death at the age of 54 in February. They issued a statement stating their goal to ""bring the Reds back to the top of the table"" but acknowledged ""challenging times ahead"" -- and have already sacked manager Steve Cotterill just nine months into his three-and-a-half-year contract. ""If the family is looking at this on a medium to longer term basis, they'll look to develop a scouting network and sign players for relatively small amounts of money,"" Chadwick said. ""They will have to manage the club in a very shrewd way to make sure they don't get back into debt in the same way. One would hope that Forest as a club have learned their lessons. ""When they were relegated they tried to spend their way out of trouble. They dropped further and further down the league structure, while at the same time building up their debts."" Cash for cups? Qatar's sporting influence spreads across the globe . If Forest fans are getting overexcited about their future, they don't have to look very far for proof that such a takeover can go horribly wrong. In 2009, city rivals Notts County announced that football's oldest professional club -- languishing in the bottom division and in danger of collapsing -- had been bought by a group called Munto Finance, purportedly financed by Middle East money. In came former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson and international star Sol Campbell on lucrative long-term deals, but they had both gone before the end of that season as Munto's promises to wipe out crippling debts proved empty. Still struggling to survive, the club was sold for a nominal fee of £1 just months after the takeover. ""There will always be this fear. The 'fit and proper person test' applied to new owners is not especially robust or rigorous, so we can never be completely sure about what new owners' intentions or resources are,"" Chadwick said. ""Until we get into this period of ownership, it won't be entirely clear what they are able to do."" From riches to rags: Why Rangers' financial meltdown should worry Europe . He cited the example of Blackburn Rovers, who suffered relegation from the EPL after only one season under the ownership of Indian chicken magnates Venky's. ""The experience since they took over is a stark illustration of how inexperience can cause problems. No matter your intentions or how much money you've got, experience of the industry is very important,"" Chadwick said. ""Do they know what they're letting themselves in for? Running a football club is very different from running other forms of business. ""What do they see as being the strategic position at Forest? If they are looking to win the Premier League and get in the Champions League, they are going to have to invest a significant amount of money. ""But if their definition of glory days is to get back into the Premier League then it will require a more modest sum. Stoke. have proved you can establish yourself as a midtable team. It's still very expensive, but not as expensive as what City have spent to win the title.""","Kuwaiti family buys former European Cup winner Nottingham Forest .

"(CNN) -- Google will kick off its annual I/O developers' conference Wednesday in San Francisco, but CEO Larry Page won't be speaking there. He also was a no-show at Thursday's annual stockholders meeting and is expected to miss the company's quarterly earnings call next month. Left to explain Page's unexpected absence at the shareholder's meeting, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told attendees that Page had ""lost his voice"" and ""can't do any public speaking engagements for the time being."" In an e-mail to employees the same day, Page wrote, ""there is nothing seriously wrong with me,"" a person familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. The company issued a statement Thursday saying, ""Larry has lost his voice. This means he can't do any public speaking engagements for the time being, including today's shareholder meeting, I/O next week and our earnings call in mid July. ""Larry will, of course, continue to run the company and he will be involved in all the strategic business decisions we make."" There is no evidence that Page, who has long been reluctant to speak in public, is seriously ill. But four days later, Google has had nothing else to say on the matter, and analysts and bloggers are getting restless. News sites have speculated about Page's ""mystery Illness,"" and Google's stock has been trending down since late last week. ""We have no specific reason to think there is anything more to Larry's condition, but we find it odd that the company would already rule him out of the 2Q call, which is likely still a few weeks away,"" said Doug Anmuth, an analyst at JP Morgan.

""We can only hope that it's nothing serious, maybe just a really bad case of laryngitis, and he's under doctor's orders not to speak."" Observers point out that while Page's health may be a private matter, Google is a publicly traded company. ""There shouldn't be any mystery (here),"" La Monica added. ""Google should own up to whatever it is. ... It could stop, maybe, any rumors from going around."" The health of a tech giant's CEO may bear extra scrutiny at a time Silicon Valley is still recovering from the death last fall of Apple chief Steve Jobs.

"(CNN) -- The intelligence community and the Obama administration have been under tremendous scrutiny since the attack on the Benghazi consulate in Libya and an investigation is under way. But some aspects of intelligence gathering and analysis are worth keeping in mind before drawing conclusions about whether this attack could have been thwarted or if its specific nature could have been publicized sooner. I should disclose my bias up front: I'm a former CIA analyst, and believe there is an innate ""inevitability of failure"" in intelligence collection and analysis. This doesn't mean we shouldn't hold agencies accountable if reasonable signs were missed in Benghazi, but assessments often take time, evolving as new information and evaluations of the credibility of conflicting reports emerge. Instead of trying to turn the Benghazi attack -- and the deaths of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three other Americans -- into a partisan blame game, policymakers would be better served by thinking about how to enhance U.S. intelligence capabilities. Richard Betts writes in his seminal 1978 piece on intelligence failures, ""Analysis, War, and Decision: Why Intelligence Failures are Inevitable,"" that ""intelligence failures are not only inevitable, they are natural."" In his 2002 piece, ""Fixing Intelligence,"" he notes that ""even the best intelligence systems will have BIG failures."" Betts says so much information is being collected around the globe regarding so many potential targets, with so many enemy actors adopting deceptive tactics to mislead analysts, that uncovering every threat and thwarting every possible attack is virtually impossible. This overwhelming abundance of information, Betts says, may result in false alarms -- making it more difficult to discern if the threat of an upcoming attack is real. The global stream of information constantly includes vague information regarding security risks. The tragic events in Benghazi mark the first killing of a U.S. ambassador since 1979. But the rarity of this kind of terror attack actually demonstrates the overarching success of U.S. intelligence agencies in keeping Americans safe. People have questioned why the administration didn't immediately report that the Benghazi attack was the work of terrorists. But we don't know whether analysts had enough credible intelligence on hand at the time to be absolutely sure of the nature of the attack. Reports indicate that the intelligence community's evaluations evolved in the following days and weeks as information came in, and policymakers were briefed as assessments changed and solidified. This is common practice. It's also important to keep in mind that the better a state's intelligence capabilities, the more reports it collects, making assessments take longer as mountains of information are sifted through. These realities are significant as the intelligence community's role in the Libya attack is examined under a political microscope. Government e-mails sent about two hours after the attack and obtained by CNN show that an Islamist group, Ansar al-Sharia, had claimed responsibility for Benghazi on Facebook and Twitter, one of many channels of information intel analysts need to examine before reaching conclusions. The group denied responsibility the next day. Claims such as these need to be corroborated. Sometimes multiple groups claim responsibility after attacks; obviously claims of responsibility are often false. It's also possible that the attackers had ties to multiple groups, or had different motives. Expecting policymakers to publicly examine and go through every conflicting piece of intelligence collected in the hours before and after an attack would be unreasonable and potentially even damaging to national security. Instead of making political hay out of the circumstances surrounding Benghazi, we should be focusing on how to improve our intelligence collection and analysis capabilities. But we should also avoid overreacting with ill-considered major organizational overhauls in response to one particular attack. One improvement we could make right away is to invest in recruiting high caliber people to the intelligence community to create an analyst reserve corps. Betts has proposed this idea, and it merits renewed attention. Such a team could comprise nonpartisan trained intelligence experts from various government agencies, academia and the private sector who would be mobilized when an incident happens. Another idea would be to create the equivalent of an intelligence special forces team made up of individuals from inside the ranks or from outside professions. Additional scholarships could be offered to recruit students from top colleges and graduate schools. We could also promote academic research into the realm of intelligence. There is a wide array of academic literature on military tactics and strategy, war, sanctions and negotiations, but little in the field of the role of intelligence in conflicts. In the final days leading up to the election, we must evaluate the performance of intelligence gathering in Benghazi in a fair and objective manner, with every effort to omit our biases and political views. The intelligence community prides itself on such objectivity in its work and in serving both Democratic and Republican administrations. The public and policymakers should afford analysts the same courtesy by holding their judgments of the intelligence community to the same standard. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tara Maller.","Critics ask why Benghazi attack was not called the work of terrorists right away .
Tara Maller: Assessments evolve over time as intel and evaluations of credibility come in .

"(EW.com) -- To play the bubbly, optimistic redhead at the center of ""Annie,"" 11-year-old Lilla Crawford doesn't have to reach far. Fresh off the announcement today that Crawford will be headlining the Broadway revival of the classic musical (due in fall 2012), EW caught up with the bright, buoyant young star before she tackles the iconic role as Broadway's favorite orphan. Entertainment Weekly: Where were you when you found out you got the part? Lilla Crawford: Well, my manager called up and said that we had to be at the agent's office to do a video audition, and so we came over and he said it was going to be an interview [about] dogs. It was just going to be questions about dogs, so he started asking me a couple of questions about them, and then he finally said, ""How does it feel to be 'Annie' on Broadway?"" And I was like, ""What? What the--?"" And he said, ""You're going to be 'Annie' on Broadway!"" And I was like, ""Really!?"" That's what happened. When I found out, oh my gosh, my heart just stopped. I was so amazed and I was so excited to start. EW: Were your parents there with you? Crawford: My mom was there! So was my sister, and all of the agents. They were really excited as well. Everyone that I could tell was there. I was supposed to keep it a secret, so I didn't call up anyone, but I wished that I could! EW: What was the audition process like? Crawford: Well, when I found out that they were doing a revival of ""Annie,"" I decided to audition just for fun and see how it turned out. So I auditioned and I got a callback, after callback, after callback. And I just wanted to be a part of the show; I didn't care what role. But I got about five or six callbacks until the last callback, then I got it. EW: Were you ever in a production of ""Annie"" growing up? Crawford: Yes, I was in another production of ""Annie."" It was an all-kids production and it was in a little community theater. I think I was about 8 or 9, and I actually played Bert Healy, so it's kind of funny. EW: Were you a big fan of the movie? Crawford: Yes. I've seen the movie before, and I've actually seen the show, so yeah, I really did like that show a lot before I became a part of it. EW: What part of being in the show are you most looking forward to? Crawford: Now that I get to be in it, I'm really looking forward to everything, but mostly I'm really looking forward to working with the dogs, and everyone else! I do like dogs a lot. EW: If you could meet any Broadway star, who would you pick? Crawford: To meet anyone on Broadway? I do like Sutton Foster and Kristin Chenoweth a lot, so it would be really fun to like, go to lunch with the two of them. It sounds crazy but... maybe it'll happen! I don't know! But I do also like Raul Esparza and Matthew Broderick. Those are really good ones, too. EW: How do you think the message of ""Annie"" will translate for other kids growing up today who might see the show? Crawford: In the Depression especially, I think you learn to face problems and not run away from them. [You have to] always have hope for tomorrow and the sun will come out tomorrow! And if you have a bad day, just always think that it'll be a new one and a good one the next day. See the full article at EW.com.

"PHOENIXVILLE, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- After 22 years in private practice and seeing people ""kicked around by the system,"" Dr. Lorna Stuart found herself frustrated with the number of insurance companies and the rules and restrictions that came with them. Because there's no insurance paperwork, Dr. Lorna Stuart says she has more time to spend talking with patients. ""The day-to-day time that I spent on paperwork was increasing, while my patients weren't getting the good care that I wanted to give them -- face-to-face time, one-on-one time,"" she recalls. ""I vowed to do whatever little I could about this inequity of care."" For Stuart, that vow came in the form of opening her own clinic and treating the uninsured. ""Every single person knows somebody without health insurance,"" says Stuart. ""There are so many people that fall through the cracks."" According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 47 million Americans are currently without medical coverage. So Stuart set out to alleviate that problem where she could -- in her old steel town of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. She confided her desire to start a clinic in the Rev. Marie Swayze, her friend whose parish property was home to a Victorian-style rectory that had become dilapidated from disuse. The two concocted a plan to restore and remodel the mansion into a place that anyone would be happy to visit for quality medical care. Then, leaving private practice, Stuart sold her house and set out to raise $400,000 in donated funds, materials and services. In 2002, these efforts resulted in ""The Clinic: Medical Center for the Uninsured,"" a charitable, sun-filled clinic that has since received more than 40,000 patient visits. Individuals receive free or low-cost primary medical care across eight specialties, regardless of income or locality.  Watch Stuart explain how her healthcare dream came true » . ""Since there's no need to spend a lot of time doing paperwork, we have time to talk to the patient and really hear what they're saying,"" says Stuart. ""So the patients go away feeling they've been heard, that they've been helped."" An arsenal of more than 100 local volunteers, including 20 retired and practicing physicians, assist Stuart in providing expert medical services to more than 800 patients per month from across the southeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware area. She even invested in Spanish language audiotape lessons to better communicate with her Spanish-speaking clients. Patients are informed that each visit costs about $60, but they are only expected to contribute what they can toward their care.  Watch Stuart explain the benefits of visiting ""The Clinic"" » . ""Many patients pay as little as a dollar or even 50 cents for the same dignified care that patients contributing in full receive,"" says Mary Ellen Smith, The Clinic's medical resource coordinator. Patient contributions account for 20 percent of The Clinic's $900,000 annual operating budget. The rest comes exclusively from private grants and donations. If The Clinic accepted money made available through government aid programs, they would be significantly restricted in terms of whom they would be allowed to treat, and how. For Stuart, giving good old-fashioned care again has restored her sense of fulfillment.  Watch Stuart explain how her clinic provides care to the uninsured » . ""Each day, I get to treat the patients whom our medical system has forgotten, without the hassle of insurance paperwork,"" says Stuart. ""Is it any wonder I once again feel the real joy of practicing the craft that I love?"" E-mail to a friend .","Doctor quit private practice, sold her house to open clinic for uninsured .

"(CNN)  -- A report earlier this week that a pair of academics had discovered a way to figure out a person's Social Security number based on information people commonly post online has raised new concerns about identity theft. Professor Alessandro Acquisti says Social Security numbers issued after the late 1980s are vulnerable. The Social Security Administration said the threat is minuscule. Still, the agency plans to change to a random system of assigning the numbers, replacing the current system based on the state and date where the number is assigned. Professor Alessandro Acquisti and researcher Ralph Gross of Carnegie Mellon University said they began by studying a half-million expired Social Security numbers obtained from the ""death master file"" published by the Social Security Administration. ""We can use these death master file records to infer patterns"" in the way numbers are assigned, said Acquisti, who then derived formulas to zero in on a range of Social Security numbers that might have been assigned to a person. Because the process depends on the date the Social Security number was assigned, it works best for people born after the late 1980s, when it became common to issue numbers to newborns. Social Security numbers are made up of three segments. The first segment of three numbers represents the state issuing the number. States with a large population, such as New York, cycle through dozens of numbers, while less populous states, such as Wyoming, use only one. The second segment is made up of two numbers that are changed periodically, while the third segments is composed of four numbers that cycle continuously from 0000 to 9999. Knowing a person's state and place of birth, Acquisti would use the death master file to find the numbers of people with nearby birth dates in the same state. Those would be plotted on a graph that would allow Acquisti to try to predict the target person's number. For example, for Oregon in 1996 the first three numbers cycled from 540 to 544, changing every 60 days or so. The middle segment started the year as 47, but 60 days in it changed to 49. And the last four numbers cycled around, also every 60 days or so. To avoid giving criminals too much information, Acquisti and Gross withheld some of the details of their methods. In a small state like Delaware, the report says, for 1 in 20 people the Social Security number can be determined in less than 10 tries. Mark Lassiter of the Social Security Administration said the threat is not significant. ""The public should not be alarmed by this report because there is no foolproof method for predicting a person's Social Security number,"" he said. Indeed, for 90 percent of people, Acquisti wouldn't hit on their full Social Security number even with 1,000 tries. ""The method by which Social Security assigns numbers has been a matter of public record for years,"" said Lassiter. ""The suggestion that Mr. Acquisti has cracked a code for predicting an SSN is a dramatic exaggeration."" Still, the authors said a determined hacker could use trial and error to try dozens of educated guesses on fraudulent credit applications -- or even use a computer to automate the effort. At a minimum, they say, their findings are a wake-up call for people who have posted their date and state of birth on Web sites like MySpace or Facebook. ""This is the challenge we face in our modern technology,"" Acquisti said. ""By interacting so much and exposing so much information, we also sometimes expose ourselves to risk."" Starting next year, the government plans to assign numbers randomly, which will protect anyone born after 2010 from mathematical calculations. But for everyone born in the past 20 years, Acquisti said, something besides the Social Security number should be used for bank accounts and credit cards. ""Social Security numbers are very bad passwords,"" he said. ""They were not designed to be used in that way."" CNN's Brian Todd contributed to this report.","Social Security numbers fall into patterns, study says .
Numbers can be guessed if person has your birth date, state where you were born .
Government says this information has been available; no codes have been cracked .
Numbers are now assigned at birth, but in future will be assigned randomly ."

"(CNN) -- In his first court appearance in nearly two years, former police officer Drew Peterson entered an Illinois courtroom Friday for a hearing in his upcoming murder trial. Wearing blue jail clothes, the former police sergeant walked in shackles and looked older and a bit thinner than his last appearance. He is accused of killing his third wife, Kathleen Savio, in 2004. He remains under investigation in the October 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson. Judge Sarah Jones presided briefly on Friday before the case was transferred to Judge Edward Burmila. The next hearing is set for May 17, though no trial date has been set. Friday's hearing comes after a controversial ruling was made earlier this year in the widely followed murder case. In April, an Illinois appellate court ruled that prosecutors can use potentially incriminating statements made by Savio and Peterson's still-missing wife against him. That ruling overturned an earlier judge's decision that forbid prosecutors from using eight statements made by Savio before her death and by Stacy Peterson before her disappearance. When Savio was found dead in 2004, her death was ruled accidental. After Stacy Peterson went missing in October 2007, her husband became the focus of a police investigation. Authorities exhumed Savio's body and conducted a second autopsy, this time ruling her death a homicide. Since Savio is dead and Stacy Peterson is missing, the defense has argued that using their alleged statements to family and friends violates Peterson's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. In general, hearsay statements made to third parties cannot be introduced at trial unless a defendant can cross-examine the person who made them. There are some exceptions if prosecutors can prove the statement is reliable. But a new Illinois law, which some call ""Drew's Law,"" goes beyond those exceptions. The law, passed while investigators were looking for Stacy Peterson, allows courts to consider statements from ""unavailable witnesses,"" provided prosecutors can prove the witness was killed to prevent his or her testimony.","NEW: The case was transferred to Judge Edward Burmila .

"(CNN) -- The president of wrestling's international federation has resigned after the Olympics recommended dropping the sport from the 2020 Summer Games, the group said Saturday. Raphael Martinetti's departure was announced in Phuket, Thailand, at a meeting of the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles. The official stepped down to give another leader the chance to fight the Olympics' decision, a FILA statement said. Nanad Lalovic, a FILA official, has been chosen as acting president. The executive board of the International Olympic Committee announced its proposal on Tuesday. Opinion: Don't drop wrestling from Olympics . ""Wrestling will now join the seven shortlisted sports -- baseball/softball, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, wakeboarding and wushu (a Chinese martial art) -- vying for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic program as an additional sport,"" the Olympic committee said in a statement. The move sparked an international outcry and surprise. It prompted a number of the federation's delegates at the Phuket meeting to hold Martinetti responsible for the widely unpopular decision. Martinetti is Swiss. Lalovic is Serbian. At a meeting in Russia in May, representatives from the eight sports will make presentations for inclusion in the 2020 Games. The executive board will recommend one. The final word will come in a vote at the Olympic committee's general session in Argentina in September. The host city for the 2020 Summer Games will be chosen in September. Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid are the finalists. The sport will be played at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Wrestling is seen as an iconic Olympic sport with a long tradition. It was an integral part of the ancient Olympics and has been a competition in all but one of the modern Games since their inception in 1896, missing only the 1900 Games in Paris. There are two types of Olympic wrestling competitions -- freestyle and Greco-Roman. The governing body for the sport in the United States was so appalled at the decision that it started a Facebook page, ""Keep Wrestling in the Olympics."" Opponents of the decision also took to Twitter, posting with the hashtag #SaveOlympicWrestling. Wrestling is a popular high school and college sport in the United States. It is immensely popular in many other countries, such as Russia, Turkey and Iran.

"(CNN) -- When news broke that six e-mail accounts belonging to members of the Bush family were hacked and some of the contents posted online, reactions ranged from being offended to amusement. Many people objected to the leak of family exchanges reflecting contingency planning for the funeral of President George H.W. Bush. If ever a family deserves privacy, it is when dealing with the death, or impending death, of a loved one. Others seized on the semi-nude bathing self-portraits of President George W. Bush to resume ridicule not seen since he left office. And virtually everyone took the episode as a warning that ""this can happen to you."" The Bush family email hack comes on the heels of reports of hacking at universities and major newspapers, and it follows urgent government warnings against our fragile cybersecurity defenses. So, do the average users of online e-mail and Web services simply have to assume that hacking will expose their personal messages and photos? Not necessarily. The recent spate of security breaches and the attention focused on them will mean that government and businesses will up their game even more to secure our information infrastructure. But the security reinforcement might take time. In the meantime, people have options to protect their information and themselves. Privacy and data security is a shared responsibility, after all, and users have a role to play. Some Web-based e-mail services like Google's Gmail offer tools to add an extra layer of protection. Gmail offers a two-step verification to add an extra layer of security. Such protection erects a double gate against unwanted interception. Through two-step verification, in addition to user name and password, you enter a code that the e-mail provider will send via text, voice call or on a mobile app. Two-step verification drastically reduces the chances of someone stealing the personal information from your e-mail account because hackers would have to not only get a password and your user name, they would also have to have access to the mobile phone to which the code is sent. And while you are taking steps to secure your e-mail, you would be well-advised to make sure your WiFi connection is secure. Wireless routers are ubiquitous, allowing you to share your internet connection and files around the house. But without securing your router, anyone within range can access the websites you visit and may be able to access your personal information. Securing your WiFi router with a password is an easy step to take, and it is often overlooked. If you want to get a little more technical, take a look at whether the website you are using to transmit information is using HTTPS -- hypertext transfer protocol secure. HTTPS encrypts your data so that it cannot be intercepted during transmission. You will find that your banking transactions almost always will be conducted through the HTTPS protocol. For an extra level of security, check to see if other websites you use offer HTTPS for transmission. So instead of throwing up your hands that Web-based e-mail and online data transfers can never be secure, seek out and use the security tools that already exist. And no matter what your political persuasion, thank the Bush family for the wake-up call. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Wolf.","Bush family e-mails were hacked, private contents posted online .
Chris Wolf: Many offended, some amused, but all concerned about privacy .
Wolf: Users have options already established to protect private information .

"(CNN) -- A police chief who allegedly used a false identity to buy as many as 192 houses in cities in China's southern province of Guangdong has sparked outrage on social media amid a growing scandal over corrupt officials amassing fortunes on the inflated property market. Zhao Haibin, a senior police official in Lufeng in the southern province of Guangdong, had been accused by a local businessman of using a fake ID on company documents to acquire the properties, the Guangzhou Daily reported. ""A police official openly had two IDs and used the other one to do business and cheat others. Why (does) nobody probe the case?"" local businessman Huang Kunyi was quoted as saying on state-run China Daily. Zhao acknowledged possessing double IDs - known as hukou in Chinese - but denied having 192 houses, Xinhua reported. He was reported in Chinese media as saying that he was managing the properties on behalf of his younger brother. Authorities told Xinhua that Zhao -- who is also a local Communist Party official -- had had the fake ID revoked and that he had been dismissed from his post. The case has drawn a sharp response on China's lively social media. ""(I) finally realized that in China, properties are forever in the hands of a tiny number of people,"" a user of China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo was reported as saying. The case follows other high-profile instances of high-ranking officials using fake IDs and their positions to speculate on China's overheated property market. On Monday, police arrested Gong Aiai -- a bank official from a rural bank in China -- who allegedly built a real estate empire worth at least $160 million using fake IDs and graft. Dubbed ""House Sister"" in the Chinese media, Gong allegedly used three false national identity cards to buy 45 properties in three cities, 41 of which were in Beijing where China's expanding property bubble is at its hottest. The high-profile cases have captured the public imagination in a country where national identity cards limit the number of apartments a person can own -- part of a policy to cool China's rampant property market. The use of fake IDs also points to corruption among the police who issue the cards, and authorities have detained four police officers on suspicion of helping Gong obtain the cards, the Ministry of Public Security said. There are fears the abuse of hukou - which registers a person place of residence in China - and the ID system may hamper the government's fight against corruption. ""It could also provide the chance for officials fleeing abroad to use a passport registered with a fake ID card. Officials, with their real identities, have to hold official passports that would leave behind records for police,"" Fang Qiongming, a police officer from the city of Jieyang's public security bureau, told the Global Times. The cases have also highlighted the precarious role of construction which has come to dominate China's economy, accounting for roughly 25% of all activity and 15% of all jobs. The injection of stimulus money following the 2008 financial crisis has led to the rise of newly built ghost cities -- satellite cities built without thought for any sustainable market -- as stimulus money finds its way into construction. Analysts say that more worrying still has been the rapid expansion of China's shadow banking system. Unorthodox loans, which often come in the form of trust loans and so-called wealth management products, have gone into fund real estate development and have been criticized for having short maturities that are difficult to roll over during times of financial stress.","Chinese police chief dismissed over probe into properties .

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- A few days ago, strangers appeared at the door of a Sri Lankan investigative journalist when he wasn't home, asking questions about him. Just before midnight Friday, three men stormed Faraz Shaukatally's house as he slept, police said. One of them shot him. Shaukatally survived the attack, which left him with a bullet lodged under the neck and questions about who may have wanted him dead. Journalists face heavy intimidation in Sri Lanka, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which has called the island nation a ""highly restrictive and dangerous nation for the press."" Police have not apprehended suspects in Shaukatally's case or established a motive, but the editor of his paper thinks he was shot over his critical articles. ""He has been writing a number of investigative stories in the past weeks,"" said Shakuntala Perera, who heads the Sunday Leader in the capital of Colombo. ""Our journalists have been under constant threat."" British Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt expressed shock and concern at the shooting. Shaukatally holds dual Sri Lankan and British citizenship, CNN affiliate ITN reported, and Burt said consular officials visited him in the hospital, where he had surgery Saturday to remove the bullet. ""It remains unclear whether this horrific incident was connected to the victim's work as a journalist. The Sri Lankan authorities must quickly identify who committed this crime and bring them to justice,"" Burt said in a statement. Though the last journalist killings in Sri Lanka were four years ago, 25 members of the press have been murdered in the country since 1999, according to the CPJ. Nine of the murders in the past decade remain unsolved. More than 63% of journalists killed in the country covered politics as a part of their work. In the past five years, 20 journalists have fled the country amid ""a climate of intense intimidation,"" the CPJ says. Last year, citing national security, the government blocked a freedom of information bill, further denying journalists and citizens access to documents. Perera's predecessor, Frederica Jansz, went into exile after a businessman with close government ties bought the paper last year. In recent weeks, the Leader ran articles critical of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Perera admitted that she does not know whether Shaukatally was attacked specifically for any of his work. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Navi Pillay, said Sri Lankan authorities should immediately give Shaukatally protection. She called the shooting an assassination attempt. In an interview with Britain's Channel 4 News, Pillay said she will report to the Human Rights Council her concerns over ""extrajudicial killings, abductions, and this kind of treatment and suppression of freedom of expression.""

"(CNN) -- UEFA has had a busy time of it during Euro 2012 handing out fines and sanctions to various federations for undesirable behavior. No stone has been left unturned in the pursuit of sporting decency, and European football's governing body has now turned its roving eye to Nicklas Bendtner's underwear. The Denmark striker is in hot water with UEFA after celebrating his equalizing goal in Denmark's match Portugal on Wednesday by lowering his shorts to reveal the inscription of Paddy Power -- an Irish bookmaker. Bendtner scored twice but Denmark slipped to a 3-2 defeat in Lviv, and the Arsenal player could face further disappointment after the UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body sit to consider the matter on Monday. ""Disciplinary proceedings have been opened against Denmark's Nicklas Bendtner for improper conduct (Law four of the Laws of the Game) at the UEFA EURO 2012 Group B match against Portugal in Lviv on Wednesday 13 June,"" said a UEFA statement. Law four of the laws of the games as outlined by FIFA, the global body which governs soccer, relates to the equipment and attire players can wear. In relation to undershorts, it states: ""If undershorts are worn, they must be of the same main color as the shorts."" Torres inspires Spain to Ireland rout . Russia has already been fined and handed a suspended points deduction for improper conduct against the Czech Republic, while also still awaiting the verdict of a UEFA investigation into alleged racist chanting during the Group A match. Meanwhile, the Croatian Federation was also fined $32,000 on Friday for failing to control it's fans during Sunday's 3-1 victory over Republic of Ireland. The punishment was issued after fans threw fireworks and missiles onto the pitch, while one supporter also entered the field of play. The German Football Federation was fined $12,500 after its fans threw paper onto the pitch during a meeting with Portugal, with the Iberian team also ordered to pay $6,250 for delaying the start of the second half.","UEFA will investigate Denmark's Nicklas Bendtner's underwear .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In a country that restricts gambling as much as China, it's become a running cultural joke that soccer betting is an endemic multi-billion yuan business. A cheeky group of contemporary artists -- the Yangjiang Group -- has almost made an industry from lampooning the Chinese love of illegal soccer gambling. With artworks like ""Soccer Gambling -- Fiercer than a Tiger,"" a title swiped from a local newspaper headline, or pamphlets that at first glance look like Taoist temple augurs that are really thinly disguised soccer predictions, the artists' work attempts to show how much illegal betting is now part of Chinese cultural life. The advent of the internet coupled with millions of illegal Chinese gamblers coming on stream has seriously skewed the market in soccer gambling. Europol's revelations that hundreds of matches have been fixed may have hit the industry in Europe, but will come as no surprise in soccer betting-crazy China. Declan Hill, in his 2008 book on match-fixing, The Fix, quoted ""a recent study for the American journal Foreign Policy [that] estimated the entire Asian gambling industry, both legal and illegal, at $450 billion a year."" Analysts say sums like these are equal to 20 times the revenues of all of European professional football leagues put together -- a situation that has made match-fixing a global and, some argue, mature and stable industry. Dutch police researching corruption in professional football in 2009 identified groups dubbed ""belchinezen"" or ""phone Chinese"" -- groups of people of Asian descent standing in near-empty stadiums of even youth league matches phoning in results for gambling companies in China or South East Asia. Dutch police said though they had no laws to act against illicit betting couriers. On Monday though Europol dropped the bombshell that its five-country probe identified 680 suspicious matches, putting the integrity of football at stake. ""It is clear to us that this is the biggest investigation ever into suspected match fixing,"" Europol chief Rob Wainwright told a news conference in The Hague, adding that the fall-out hit at the heart of the world game's reputation. ""It is the work of a sophisticated organized crime syndicate based in Asia and working with criminal facilitators around Europe,"" said Wainwright. He added: ""Matchfixing is a significant threat to football ... involving a broad community of actors. Illegal profits are being made that threatens the very fabric of the game"" Hill has identified Singapore as the center of Asian illegal soccer betting. He told CNN that while convictions in Europe were encouraging, the key was in getting Asian police to make arrests as well. ""If you really want to wrap this up, you've got to go to Singapore,"" Hill said. Grant Wahl, a senior writer at Sport Illustrated, told CNN there were many methods for fixing and throwing even major league soccer matches. ""There's different ways of doing it,"" Wahl said. ""One way is to convince players to go out on the field and do things to impact the game -- whether that's saving goals, or whether that's doing things that alter the final result. ""But there are other ways to do that too. If you are presenting yourself as a promoter and you're trying to fix a game you can set up an international friendly by paying the national federations and you can put the referee out there and then the ref is someone that can be controlled and can call a penalty or not at a certain point in the game.""","Illicit soccer gambling in China is endemic and worth billions of yuan .

"New York (CNN) -- Oft-troubled actress Lindsay Lohan has had another brush with the law, charged by police with leaving the scene of an accident in New York early Wednesday. Lohan was driving her Porsche Cayenne into the parking lot of the Dream Hotel off West 16th Street when she allegedly hit an employee of the restaurant next door, said Sgt. John Buthorn, a New York Police Department spokesman. The entertainer kept driving before parking her car and apparently leaving the scene shortly after midnight, Buthorn said. Police arrested her about 2:30 a.m., and she was later released on her own recognizance. Celebrities behaving badly: Celebrity mugshots . The restaurant employee was hospitalized with a knee injury, Buthorn said. A representative for Lohan sent CNN a statement, which read: ""While some of the facts are still being gathered, it appears that this is much ado about nothing. We are confident this matter will be cleared up in the coming weeks and the claims being made against Lindsay will be proven untrue."" The former child star is trying to make a career comeback after six years of legal troubles. Earlier this year, Lohan completed five years of felony probation mandated after two drunken driving incidents in 2007. Since January of that year, she has spent 250 days in five rehab facilities dealing with drug and alcohol addiction. Buthorn said police do not suspect drugs or alcohol played a role in the latest incident. In addition, Lohan spent six short stints totaling less than two weeks in the Los Angeles County jail as well as 35 days of home confinement. Last month, Los Angeles County prosecutors released a report saying that Lohan, who is still on probation for a 2011 shoplifting incident, was a suspect in a burglary at a Hollywood home. However, prosecutors determined they did not have enough evidence to charge her. LiLo: Why hasn't a certain Nickelodeon star gone to jail?

After his midweek all-action showing against former employer Manchester United and a goal which had experts running out of superlatives, the Real Madrid man had a much quieter night. Instead, it was left to teammate Sergio Ramos to take the headlines as Real took on local rival Rayo Vallecano at the Bernabeu Sunday. Real held in Champions League blockbuster . Leading 1-0 through young striker Morata, Ramos headed home to extend his side's advantage on 12 minutes for his first contribution of the evening. His next, however, was not so clever. A foul on Roberto Trashorras earned him a yellow card and just 45 seconds later, he was shown a second for handball. Off he trudged with 18 minutes on the clock, a goal, two yellow cards and an early bath. While receiving two bookings within 45 seconds is unusual, Ramos' dismissal is anything but. How Manchester United tried to drown the stars of Real Madrid in 1957 . The Spain international has been sent off 17 times in his career, 16 of those coming at Real with the other at former club Sevilla. His 12th red card in La Liga left Real with work to do, but with a two goal cushion already in hand, it easily held out to claim a 2-0 victory. Falcao: Soccer's 'Tiger' prowls for goals . Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid bounced back from its Europa League disappointment with a 3-0 win at Real Valladolid. Radamel Falcao scored his 20th league goal of the season with Diego Costa and Cristian Rodriguez also on target. Those three points keeps Atletico 12 points behind leader Barcelona and four clear of Real going into matchday 25. Valencia moved up to fifth with a 2-0 win over Mallorca, while Espanyol defeated Real Betis 1-0 and Real Sociedad was held to a 1-1 draw by Levante. Chelsea make winning Europa League start; Zenit shock Liverpool . In England, Chelsea booked its place in the fifth round of the FA Cup, the country's historic domestic knockout competition. Rafael Benitez's side defeated third-tier Brentford 4-0 at Stamford Bridge in a replay following a 2-2 draw in the previous game. Chelsea will now face second-tier side Middlesbrough with the winners of that game going on to play either Manchester United or Reading. Manchester City saw off second-tier side Leeds United 4-0 to reach the quarterfinals, while Wigan also progressed after a 4-1 win at Huddersfield. In the only Premier League game of the day, Liverpool thrashed Swansea 5-0 to move into seventh. Juventus leaves Celtic's Champions League dream in tatters . In Italy, Fiorentina produced the performance of the day by crushing Inter 4-1. Two goals each from Adem Ljajic and Stevan Jovetic gave the Viola all three points with Antonio Cassano registering a late consolation for the visitor. The win moves Fiorentina up to sixth, just a point behind fifth placed Inter. Napoli's quest to move to within two points of league leader Juventus suffered a blow after it was held to a goalless draw by Sampdoria. After a shock 3-0 home defeat in the Europa League by Czech side Viktoria Plzen on Thursday, Napoli had hoped to bounce back immediately. Bayern on cruise control as Arsenal awaits . With Juventus losing to Roma on Saturday, Walter Mazzarri's side had the perfect opportunity to get back on track at the San Paolo. But it failed to find a way through a stubborn Sampdoria defense and now sits four points off the lead. ""This is not good enough,"" Mazzarri told reporters. ""If we want to be up there challenging we need more. We need consistency, it makes me angry when he show up and have these unexplainable performances."" Elsewhere, Catania moved up to seventh and within sight of a Europa League place with a 1-0 home over Bologna. Valter Birsa's 87th-minute winner handed Torino a 2-1 victory over Atalanta, while Juraj Kucka's 33rd-minute goal was enough to see Genoa creep further away from the drop zone with a 1-0 win over Udinese. A Marco Sau double for Cagliari assured a 2-0 win away to new boys Pescara and moved the Sardinians up to 14th. Beckham to donate PSG wages to charity . In France, Paris Saint-Germain saw its lead at the top trimmed to just three points after it suffered a shock 3-2 defeat at Sochaux. Without David Beckham, who is expected to make his debut in next weekend's clash with Marseille, PSG took a 29th minute lead through Alex. Sochaux hit back to lead 2-1 with 54 minutes on the clock before an own-goal brought PSG level with 14 minutes remaining. But with the game seemingly heading for a draw, Cedric Bakambu popped up to lash home a shock winner and leave PSG shattered. Lyon remains in second place following a crushing 4-0 win at Bordeaux, while Reims and Saint-Etienne shared a 1-1 draw.","Real Madrid beat Rayo Vallecano 2-0 in La Liga to stay 16 points off top spot .

"(CNN) -- For Rome's Vaticanisti -- the name for the Rome-based press corps that follows the pope -- covering the closed world of the Holy See is like attending to a nuclear missile silo; it's largely routine until the balloon goes up. Opaque, hierarchical and arcane, the Vatican is a tough beat even for seasoned reporters. It involves paying punctilious attention to papal routine -- never missing the often dreary papal audiences on a Wednesday and the uneventful address from the Vatican on Sunday. Even then, getting blind-sided by stark Vatican announcements that drop without warning is a risk that comes with the round. While many might see shades of Dan Brown in the Vatican's media style, some of it can be attributed to the tradition of humility that comes with holding the Chair of St. Peter. Big on understatement, low on fanfare, first news of Pope Benedict XVI's resignation came in a low key speech read by the pope in Latin at a routine consistory, a type of ecclesiastical council meeting. ""It's important, but it's not one of those events that you underline over and over again in your agenda,"" French Vatican reporter Charles De Pechpeyrou told the HuffPost Italy. ""If you're covering it, you're doing so just as a precautionary measure, to report what happened."" Italy's ANSA news agency, whose correspondent Giovanna Chirri understood the Latin, was first to break the news. Other correspondents at the consistory struggled to make sense of the speech. Reporter first on pope story, thanks to her Latin skills . ""At a certain point, for example, I caught the word 'incapability' in the pope's speech,"" De Pechpeyrou told the HuffPo . ""I turned around and spoke with my Mexican colleague. We noticed that Pope Benedict had a sad look on his face, not his usual look. Something wasn't right. Then, when cardinal Sodano mentioned the 'sadness,' we finally understood. Then Father Lombardi confirmed his resignation over the phone."" For the Rome press corps -- laboring under the cycle of constantly falling governments, Mafia stories, and offbeat it-could-only-happen-in-Italy stories -- regime change at the Vatican (arguably one of the biggest news stories in the world) provides a raison d'etre to a sometimes sleepy beat. Now, Pope Benedict's resignation -- the first in 600 years -- has rewritten the rule book; not just for the Vatican, which now goes through a complex and unprecedented interregnum, but also for the Vatican press corps. Normally, Vatican-watching requires close attention to the pope's health - a source of low-burning anxiety for the press corps who are charged with the difficult task of taking the pulse of a man who, at best, is often seen at a distance of hundreds of meters and, at worst, whose health is a closely guarded secret. It was a running joke among Vaticanisti that the pope is always in robust health until he is dead. Certainly for the small, undermanned U.S. wire agency that I worked for in Rome during the 1990s, keeping on top of Pope John Paul II's health was a full-time job. ""I don't like the sound of that cough,'' my then-bureau chief, Charles Ridley, once quipped during the weekly papal audience on Italy's national Catholic television station, Telepace. It was the kind of remark that tempted fate. Ridley may have been a press corps veteran of five papal deaths dating back to Pius XII in 1958, but he was not sure he could survive another one. When do you know it's time to go? ""A papal death is an unbelievable sweat,'' he recalled at the time. ""Six weeks solid, sleeping in the office and filing at all hours. I wouldn't want to go through that again at my age.'' When I asked him how he had felt when John Paul I, after being chosen to succeed Paul VI in August 1978, died 33 days later, he shot me a horrified look, as if I had asked how he had felt after a family tragedy. ""How do you think I felt?'' he shot back. ""It was absolutely heartbreaking!'' No cough went unremarked, no tremor unnoticed. The health of the Pope took on a life outside its subject and, in the absence of any hard information from the Vatican, was often decided on journalistic consensus. Whether the Pope ""spoke in a clear voice'' or looked ""tired"" depended entirely on which angle you were coming from -- well for a man who had Parkinson's disease but not very well for a man who used to go skiing on his holidays. In journalistic terms, a papal death is rolling thunder. It's not just the death; it's the funeral, the curia, the conclave, electing cardinals, Vatican insiders, pope-makers and pope-breakers, the coronation. Every country in the world with a sizeable Catholic population holds out the hope that its cardinal will get a chance at the top slot. For a wire service, they must all be served. Adding to the agony is the simple fact that the exact second of any natural death is always an unknown. As John Paul II's health began to falter, networks and agencies, as a measure of their anxiety, had already begun to cut deals with landlords to rent apartments adjacent to the Vatican to get the best possible shots. While our agency didn't have the firepower of other wire services or networks, it did have history on its side. With a complete set of files on three papal deaths, it was a formidable armory containing detailed background stories -- parts of which could be used again in some form or another -- on the death, the funeral, the conclave, the election, the coronation. Running through the yellowing subsidiary wire stories on papal deaths of yesteryear was like opening a time capsule. They included such gems as an embalming that had gone wrong, fouling the air for the mourners lined up to see the pope lying in state. Another story detailed how Italians had outraged foreign dignitaries by clapping the coffin at the funeral (a wholly normal custom at Italian funerals). Like a nuclear missile silo, my agency's Vatican file had its own doomsday file - a hardbound manila folder on which a typewritten sticky label had emblazoned in telex font capitals: WHAT TO DO IN CASE THE POPE DIES. While many of the instructions dated back to 1961 and could be safely ignored, it was still an interesting study in panic. The first step was to put a call through to the London bureau, the instructions read: ""It should take you no longer than three minutes for the operator to get you a line,"" it hectored. The next step was to source the news to the Italian wire agency ANSA or Vatican Radio releasing a bulletin that read: VATICAN CITY -- ANSA REPORTING POPE DEAD at a lower wire speed priority. The pope could actually be dead for hours, and the world fully informed of the fact, before the news came officially from the Vatican press office. Only then could the bulletin: VATICAN CITY -- OFFICIAL POPE DEAD be released at ""flash'' priority -- the highest wire speed reserved for papal deaths, presidential assassinations and a few other world beating news stories. After the ""flash"" went out, as Ridley recalled at the time, it was a total circus and anyone's race. ""It was hugely and highly secretive, and there were rumors flying around for weeks,'' he told me. ""The whole thing was fairly agonizing.'' The secretive conclave, in which electing cardinals are ""locked in'' the Vatican until a decision on the next pope is made, is tension personified. The only indication as to whether a decision is made comes from the burning of the ballots at the end of each day. According to Vatican lore, the smoke is black (due to the fact that the ballots were mixed with damp hay) when a decision is still to be reached and white when a new pope has been decided. In the case of John XXIII, the smoke went from black to white to a sort of grey color and back to white again, Ridley recalled. ""The whole thing was sort of medieval,'' Ridley told me at the time. These days chemicals, rather than hay, are mixed with the ballots to prevent the kind of confusion that occurred with John XXIII. The most nerve-racking part of the enterprise, however, was backgrounding the more than 100 electing cardinals, all of whom theoretically had a chance at the top job. ""And they always chose someone you'd never heard of. I remember John XXIII was just the papal nuncio in Paris -- no one considered him for a moment,"" Ridley told me. ""And all the time, if the other (agencies) were ahead by five minutes, you were lost.","For Vaticanisti, monitoring the pontiff's health is a big part of the job .

"(CNN) -- Fire up the griddle! Much of a huge cache of maple syrup snatched from a Quebec storage facility has been recovered, police say. Three people have been arrested and five others are being sought in connection with the theft from a warehouse in Saint-Louis-de-Blandford, Quebec Provincial Police said in a statement Tuesday. The theft occurred between August 2011 and July 2012, police said. Two-thirds of the syrup was recovered, according to a police statement. The Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, which bills itself as keeper of the global strategic maple syrup reserve, said in August that up to 10 million pounds of the sweet stuff was in the warehouse from which the theft occurred but could not say exactly how much was missing. The total value of all the syrup in the warehouse was put at $30 million. The theft was discovered during a routine inventory check of the warehouse, which ""had been secured by a fence and locks, and visited regularly,"" federation president Serge Beaulieu said in a statement in August. The barrels that originally contained the syrup were empty, meaning it was somehow transferred to other containers to complete the theft, the federation said. Police said Tuesday that they had seized vehicles that were used to transport the stolen sticky stuff as well as carts, lifts, scales and kettles. They said their investigation of the thefts covered the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario as well as the northern United States. Almost 300 people were interviewed as part of the investigation, police said. As much as 80% of the world's maple syrup comes from Quebec, the federation says.","Police say two-thirds of a huge cache of stolen maple syrup has been recovered .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In a boon for IMAX and movie-watchers in China alike, a deal struck between the United States and China last week raises the number of 3D, IMAX and similar enhanced-format movies released in China. China has remained mostly closed to Hollywood, with a quota of 20 foreign films per year, most of them being from the United States. Under the agreement, announced during U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's trip to Los Angeles with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, 14 additional IMAX or 3D films would be allowed. Foreign film companies will also be permitted to take a 25% cut of the box office, nearly double the current 13%-17%. In a White House statement, Biden said the deal would support ""thousands of American jobs in and around the film industry,"" adding that ""Chinese audiences will have access to more of the finest films made anywhere in the world."" Some 2.2 million Americans have jobs that depend on the film and television industries, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. IMAX, which has 217 theatres open or contracted to open in China, hailed the move, saying in a statement Saturday that it was ""also committed to bringing Chinese films presented in our format to the U.S."" On February 14, the company said that its first quarter box office of the year was $55 million, up from $38 million during the same period last year, driven primarily by ""Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol,"" which accounted for nearly half those earnings. The Chinese film, ""Flying Swords of Dragon Gate,"" rounded the top four with $3.7 million. Last year, Chinese box office revenue exceeded $2.1 billion, much of the revenues from 3D titles, the White House noted. The deal resolves film-related issues related to a 2009 World Trade Organization ruling siding with the United States. According to the ruling, China's measures relating to the importation and distribution of films, sound recordings, audiovisual home entertainment products and reading materials breached its trading rights commitments as a WTO member. Hollywood has been battling piracy in China, despite Beijing's closure of piracy websites, in no small part due to the limited access of U.S. films to Chinese screens. Allen Wan, head of production for Hong Kong-based Salon Films Group which has worked with Hollywood companies in Asia, was positive about the deal. ""Chinese audiences can see more films from the U.S. properly, officially. And on the other hand, I think it will increase more opportunities for Chinese and U.S. film (companies) to cooperate together to produce more films."" ""The Flowers of War,"" directed by Chinese director Zhang Yimou and starring Oscar-winner Christian Bale, cost $100 million to make, the largest production made in China. The film, which is set during Japan's occupation of Nanjing and the 1937 massacre, was China's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Its executive producer is David Linde, CEO of Lava Bear Films and former chairman of Universal Pictures. (He was also executive producer for Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."") The movie has failed to connect with U.S. audiences, however. For the week of February 14, it was playing in six locations, down from 30 when it opened, with an average gross of $550 per location, according to Boxoffice.com. The film's overall U.S. gross during its four-week run? $213,792, at last count. On Friday, coinciding with the U.S.-China film deal, DreamWorks Animation announced a joint venture with China Media Capital (CMC) and two other Chinese companies to establish a China-focused family entertainment company, Oriental DreamWorks. ""In addition to content creation, the joint venture will pursue business opportunities in the areas of live entertainment, theme parks, mobile, online, interactive games and consumer products,"" DreamWorks Animation said in its announcement. The venture will have an initial capitalization of $330 million. The Chinese companies will hold a 55% majority stake; DreamWorks Animation will hold about 45%, according to the announcement. On the agenda: ""Kung Fu Panda 3,"" Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua cited CMC chief investment officer Li Huaiyu as saying in an exclusive interview. DreamWorks Animation's ""Kung Fu Panda"" was the top animated film released in China in 2008, according to the company. The sequel, which made $95 million at the Chinese box office last year, was second only to ""Transformers 3,"" which brought in $170 million.","U.S.-China film-related deal resolves 2009 WTO ruling siding with United States .

"(CNN) -- Wisconsin's Republican attorney general on Monday appealed a judge's decision to halt the enactment of a controversial new law that curbs the collective bargaining rights of most state employees. Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen is asking the state's 4th District Court of Appeals to lift the temporary restraining order handed down Friday by Dane County Circuit Court Judge Maryann Sumi. Sumi issued the injunction in response to a suit filed by a Democratic district attorney alleging that Republican legislators violated the state's open meetings law by calling a committee meeting to amend GOP Gov. Scott Walker's budget bill without providing the public 24-hour advance notice. The amended bill, which had been stalled for weeks by 14 Democratic state senators who left Wisconsin to prevent a quorum -- and thus a vote on the measure -- then sailed to easy passage in both chambers of the Legislature. In the appeal, Van Hollen argues that Sumi has no jurisdiction over state lawmakers or Wisconsin's secretary of state, all of whom have sovereign immunity. Sumi's order bars Wisconsin Secretary of State Douglas La Follette from publishing the new law. ""The (Wisconsin) Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a court may not void any act of the Legislature for alleged failure to follow a non-constitutional rule of legislative process,"" Van Hollen's brief states. ""As applied to legislative acts, the Open Meetings law is such a rule of process."" In a separate news release, Van Hollen said, ""the court may not interfere with the legislative process and enjoin the publication of a bill as the last step in the legislative process. ... Courts may only evaluate whether constitutional procedural requirements were met."" The public brouhaha over Walker's $137 million budget repair bill all but shut down the Wisconsin state Legislature for weeks. It also drew protesters by the tens of thousands, among them union supporters and public employees, who called the proposed measure an attack on workers. GOP lawmakers countered that the law will help the state close a massive budget shortfall with a plan that requires public workers, with the exception of police and firefighters, to cover more of their retirement plan contributions and health care premiums. Republican members of a conference committee on Walker's bill called a meeting March 9 to amend the bill. Over the objections of a Democratic House member, the lawmakers carved the governor's proposed curbs on collective bargaining out of Walker's budget legislation and passed them in a separate bill. That enabled Republicans to pass the bill out of the state Senate with fewer votes. The state House of Representatives then easily passed the bill. Walker signed it into law on March 11. Five days later, Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne, a Democrat appointed last year by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, also a Democrat, filed suit.","Republican attorney general files appeal to void judge's delay .

Here, the fashionista (who profiles designer Bibhu Mohapatra in TIME Style & Design, available at time.com/style) lets loose with us. TIME: Of all the fashion heavyweights you've talked to, who surprised you the most? Cho: Karl Lagerfeld. I was just interviewing him in Paris, and I asked him, ""After all these years, how you still can look at a dress and see that it needs to be a millimeter longer?"" And he said, ""Well I'm not blind yet!"" He's very quick, he's very funny, and I think you have to be very smart to be funny. TIME: But he's not exactly a CNN staple. How do you tailor your fashion coverage to viewers who are more accustomed to hard news? Cho: In order to tell great stories, you need great characters. It doesn't matter whether you're covering the political race or the aftermath of a hurricane or fashion. So my approach has always been to be more character-driven than collection-driven. And there's no shortage of characters in fashion! TIME: Like Karl? Cho: Right, like Karl. The other thing I try to do, and I think this is really important, is make my fashion coverage accessible. People always say, ""Oh, you're the new Elsa Klensch!"" But I think the show that she did [CNN's Style With Elsa Klensch, which ran from 1980 to 2000] and the show that I do are very different, because we live in a different world. My fashion coverage has to be both aspirational and accessible. TIME: You've reported extensively on politics. Why do you think people are so interested in what candidates and their spouses are wearing? Cho: It just gives us another thing to talk about. And I think in many ways, Michelle Obama changed the game. She came onto the scene wearing Tom Ford one day and J. Crew the next. There's something appealing about that, no matter your politics. I know it's exciting for me to watch. She's incredibly fashionable. TIME: What do you make of Ann Romney's outfits? Cho: I think she plays it a little bit more conservative. Maybe that has something to do with her politics. I'll leave it at that. TIME: How do you dress well for TV? Cho: You know what they say -- the camera adds 10 pounds. So fit is incredibly important. I tend to favor dresses. I tend to favor three-quarter sleeve cardigans and a little belt, but I like to say I don't own many pants. I like the ease of a dress. You zip it up and you go. It's pretty simple. So as long as it fits great, I'm in. TIME: You travel to so many fashion shows for work. What's your go-to comfort heel? Cho: My go-to comfort heel is a flat. TIME: TouchÃ©! Cho: No, but really, I change between shows. Every female New Yorker can relate to that. Nobody wants to walk around in a high-heeled shoe! I'll carry my beautiful high heels in a bag. TIME: Smart. I've seen people do that on the subway. Cho: It's something my mother told me a long time ago. I'm just now starting to listen!

"(CNN) -- Shopping for some aplicaciones? Google is surprising and frustrating some visitors to the new Web-based Android app store by greeting them in a foreign tongue. The website appears to choose which language to display based on the geographic location of the visitor's internet address, and that detection method can be pretty good at guessing a person's language preference. But for people traveling abroad, living in foreign countries or accessing the Web through an international proxy service, Google's guess can be awkwardly wrong. On other Google sites, people can navigate to domains that cater to a specific language, or designate their choice with a link called ""language tools."" No such navigation is available on the online Android Market. A Google spokesman said the Android Market site is designed only for United States-based English speakers. More languages will be added to the site in coming weeks, the spokesman said. There was no mention of this restriction at last week's ribbon cutting for the Android Market website. The announcement on the Android Developers blog did, however, say it would start out as English-only. Some Android fans were miffed to learn that Google seemed not to cater to them. Will Deasy from Cork, Ireland, tipped off CNN to the language problems with the Android Market website. Deasy was traveling to South America and lamented the ""missing feature"" for setting a language. This comes as Android phones continue to surge in popularity. Handsets running Android made up 22.7% of all smartphones sold worldwide last year, according to a report from research firm Gartner. Many of those customers do not live in the United States. There is a work-around for the problem, however. On Google's support forum, users suggested adding this text -- ""?hl=en"" -- to the end of the site's Web address in order to tell the browser to load the site in English. Swap ""en"" for ""es,"" and you get Spanish; or ""fr"" for French; and so on. Google also offers an internet  translation service. Still, dozens of Android Market users continued to flock to Google message boards to express frustrations. ""Many sites these days try to be smart and automatically change their language without giving you the option to change it back,"" said one person who speaks English but lives in Hong Kong. ""There should always be the option to change it, clearly labeled on the site."" In another message, an Android user wrote: ""I am traveling, and I want things in English, but I get Dutch instead. It's awful."" Julie Vetter, on the support board, offered this plea: . ""Google, please respond, in any language.""","The Android Market website chooses a language based on where a visitor is located .

"(CNN) -- As the eurozone's financial crisis drags past its second year, Germany's powerhouse economy has kept the bloc from sinking into a double dip recession. A quiet force behind this growth are the country's 3.5 million small and medium sized businesses, collectively known as Mittelstand. Mittelstand companies can be found behind hard to imitate niche products for the manufacturing and engineering markets. They have played a vital role in the country's export driven economy for over a century. Read more: Juliet Mann's blog on the Mittlestand . While latest economic data suggests even Germany is being weighed down by the crisis, that could be offset by the Mittelstand's philosophy of longevity, innovation and investment in their workforce. Such an outlook has helped to foster community loyalty, which has kept the Mittelstand steady through economic fluctuations. The Mittelstand often have longstanding apprentice schemes, and German universities work closely with researchers at local firms to ensure products are always improved. Pencil maker Faber Castell is one such company. They do not chase quick profits or high risk investments, and invest in their people. ""Partially it is simply being far-sighted and smart,"" said Count Anton Wolfgang von Faber Castell, chairman and chief executive of the company which bears his name. Faber Castell has been making pencils on the outskirts of Nuremberg since 1761 and today they produce one sixth of the entire world's pencils. ""We have a product which causes a yawn, pencils. But we have to stick to it and we have to try within this framework to improve, to constantly optimize the product. If you have the curiosity, you have the right people, you will always find things to improve,"" he said.","The Mittelstand is the German name for the country's 3.5 million small and medium sized businesses .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Police in Rustenberg, South Africa, clashed Tuesday with more than 1,000 striking miners who were barricading public roads near the Anglo American Platinum mine. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters, and sporadic scuffles continue, Capt. Dennis Adrio with the North West police told CNN. What's behind South Africa's mine violence? Police and firefighters responded after a power substation on Anglo American Platinum's property was set on fire at 4 a.m., Adrio said. Tuesday's clashes continued a wave of wildcat strikes and violent confrontations that has wracked the country's mining sector for more than two months, the worst labor unrest since the end of apartheid. Anglo-American Platinum fired about 12,000 striking workers who refused to attend disciplinary hearings earlier this month after a three-week walkout. Another company, Gold Fields Limited, fired 8,100 striking workers last week after they did not return to work. Some 15,000 workers at the company's KDC East mine, near Johannesburg, had gone on strike to seek higher pay, as have workers at several other South Africa mines.

"(CNN) -- It's been a grueling campaign. You just want to sit down with a bowl of popcorn and find out who will be president for the next four years. So when will we know? Technically speaking -- who the heck can say? With a race that went into Election Day neck and neck, and plenty of questions about how key battleground states will play out, it's reasonable to assume a long night is in store. What to watch for . It could be even longer if the election ends up balanced on the edge of a razor-thin vote in Ohio or if voting irregularities spark legal challenges in any of a number of critical states. Either situation could drag out the decision until mid-November or even longer, analysts say. Whatever happens, some indications should begin to trickle in now that the first waves of poll closings have come, ending voting in Virginia, Florida, Ohio and other key states. West Coast states and Hawaii will stop voting at 11 p.m. ET, and the last Americans will cast their ballots in Alaska by 1 a.m. ET Wednesday. The first place to look: Virginia, according to analysts. But the reporting of results was paused after 7 p.m. because many voters remained in line after the scheduled poll closing time, the state Board of Elections said. When results do come in, Prince William County will be a key indicator, CNN chief national correspondent John King said. ""One of the first things I'll look at are the margins in the northern Virginia suburbs closest to Washington, D.C., especially Prince William County,"" he said. Drama awaits in battleground states . ""If Gov. Romney is ahead or at least in play there, it means Virginia is in play, and we could have a long, competitive night,"" King said. ""If he's not in play, it could be over before we even get to the Central time zone."" CNN's chief politcal analyst, Gloria Borger, agreed that Virginia will have a lot to say about what happens later. ""We have to look at Loudoun County in Virginia, and if the president were to win Virginia, obviously, the path to 270 is a lot easier for him,"" she said. ""But if Mitt Romney wins Virginia, it could be a much longer night."" CNN political reporter Peter Hamby said that results from early and absentee balloting in Pasco County, Florida, could also offer a tantalizing glimpse of what the night may hold. Barack Obama won the early and absentee vote in the slightly Republican-leaning county in 2008. If Obama comes up trailing when those early votes are posted soon after polls close, it could indicate the president might have trouble carrying Florida and its crucial electoral votes, according to Hamby. Frum: U.S. voting system is a disgrace . If Ohio becomes key to the election, it's possible that bag of popcorn isn't going to hold you. If the margin separating Romney and Obama is particularly thin, the election in that key battleground state could ride on absentee and provisional ballots. And that could keep the nation in suspense for a whopping 10 days. Ohio provisional ballots hold key . That's how long Ohio law gives poll workers to check the eligibility of provisional voters. Ohio has one of the nation's highest rates of provisional voting, with 211,000 cast in 2008, according to Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. About 40,000 were later thrown out. Husted says he thinks the election in Ohio will hinge on the state's central counties, and the results will be known before midnight. ""I really believe that we will be able to project a winner tonight,"" he said. ""I think that people will have to stay up past their bedtime to be able to do that. But it's likely that we'll know by the end of the evening."" Popular-electoral split is possible . The worst nightmare scenario is a redux of 2000, when the nation suffered through weeks of uncertainty amid recounts and legal challenges surrounding the vote in Florida. And, sorry to say it, as tightly contested as this race is, it is a possibility, analysts say. ""Between provisional balloting, absentee balloting and voting technology, I think there are untold different ways that this is a tense, contested election,"" said Rebecca Green, co-director of the Election Law Program at William & Mary Law School. ""It's pretty certain there's going to be some litigation when this is over on November 6."" As we said -- who knows? Election 2012: Projections .

"London (CNN) -- All eyes in show business will turn to London on Sunday, as the stars of films from Steven Spielberg's political drama ""Lincoln"" to the Bond extravaganza ""Skyfall"" gather for the British Academy Film Awards ceremony. The Baftas, as the awards are known, are seen as one of the indicators for success in the Oscars. ""Lincoln"" leads the field with 10 Bafta nominations, while Tom Hooper's film version of the long-running stage musical ""Les Miserables"" and Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" each have nine nods. All three are in the running for best film in the British movie awards, along with ""Argo,"" (seven nominations) a thriller set during the Iran hostage crisis, and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" (five nods) directed by Katheryn Bigelow -- the only woman to win a best director Oscar -- about the hunt for Osama bin Laden. ""Argo,"" a thriller centered on the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, last month landed the best film award at the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes. Daniel Day-Lewis is nominated for best actor for his role as the U.S. president who led his country during the civil war and worked to end slavery. Having already won the Golden Globe and SAG best actor awards for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln, he is strongly tipped to win an Oscar later this month. If he succeeds, Day-Lewis would be the first male actor to win three best actor Oscars. He won previously for ""My Left Foot"" in 1989 and ""There Will Be Blood"" in 2007. In the Baftas, Day-Lewis is up against ""Argo"" star Ben Affleck, ""Hathaway"" co-star Hugh Jackman, Bradley Cooper for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and Joaquin Phoenix for ""The Master."" Oscar winner Helen Mirren is nominated in the best actress category for her role in ""Hitchcock,"" playing the wife of the British suspense filmmaker. Mirren is joined by ""Amour"" star Emmanuelle Riva, Jennifer Lawrence for ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" ""Rust and Bone"" star Marion Cotillard and Jessica Chastain for ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Quentin Tarantino is nominated for best director and original screenplay for his slavery action-drama ""Django Unchained."" Affleck is also recognized for directing ""Argo,"" along with Bigelow, Lee and Michael Haneke. Javier Bardem was nominated as best supporting actor for his role as the villain in the latest and most commercially successful James Bond movie, ""Skyfall,"" but that film was overlooked in the best film category.

"(CNN) -- It may seem like a stretch to use sensitive crooner Josh Groban and ""rock"" in the same sentence, but with his new album ""All That Echoes"" (out this week), there might be more of a connection than one would think. In an interview last month with Billboard, Groban revealed his influences this time around included Fleetwood Mac, Jethro Tull and Led Zeppelin. And indeed, he does seem to be slanting that way, at least in terms of producers. On 2010's ""Illuminations,"" he worked with the rap/hard rock producer Rick Rubin and on ""All That Echoes,"" he teamed up with veteran rock producer Rob Cavallo, whose credits include Green Day and Kid Rock. CNN recently spoke with Groban from his home in Los Angeles about his rock 'n' roll habits past and present, why he sneaks into the crowd before he performs and his upcoming role on ""CSI: NY."" CNN: Growing up, who were some of the rock bands that you loved? Josh Groban: Growing up in a city like L.A., you have everything from the Roxy to the Hollywood Bowl to see music, so I was really lucky that my parents were open-minded at a young age. They took me to see everything from Elton John to the Blue Man Group. I was lucky to be in middle-school during the grunge-rock era, which is one of the best decades for rock music. So I grew up listening to Guns N' Roses, Metallica, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, that kind of thing. There was some epicness to that music. I also loved classic rock. I loved Queen. I loved listening to groups like Blood, Sweat & Tears. I don't know if it's considered ""rock,"" but one of the albums that changed my life was Paul Simon's ""Graceland."" It blew my mind. I think that was the record that really showed me that that kind of experimentation and cross-pollination of sounds can be a brilliant thing. CNN: Looking back, did you go through any embarrassing music phases? Groban: I think we all go through questionable moments. But you know, they're back on tour, so I can actually say it: My very first concert, in the third grade, was New Kids on the Block Christmas Concert at the Great Western Forum. If you were a third-grader at that time, there was nothing bigger than New Kids on the Block. It was huge. CNN: On your last record, you worked with Rick Rubin, and this record you worked with Rob Cavallo, who worked with artists like Green Day, Kid Rock and the Goo Goo Dolls. Do they bring an edge to your recordings? Groban: I think they do. Any time you work with a producer, there's a sonic marriage that happens, where you're going to provide everything from your world and they're going to provide a real stamp of a sound that they tap into instinctively. Whenever I said to him, ""I'm not sure I can get away with that,"" he was the one to say to me, ""no, this is naturally in you. We'll know when we go too far."" CNN: Is it crazy to think that knowing your way around a loud guitar could mimic what you do with your vocals? Groban: Not crazy at all. I make comparisons between rock singers and classical singers. ... I don't think there's any different intent when Freddie Mercury sings ""We are the Champions"" and Pavarotti sings in ""Nessun Dorma."" Emotionally and cerebrally, you can be in the exact same headspace. That's what's interesting to me about quote-unquote crossover music. CNN: For the long-term Groban fan, what are they going to notice about this album? Groban: This album, in my own humble opinion, is in equal parts a return to a certain style of form that I felt was a real sweet spot for me four or five years ago, but at the same time, there's more of a willingness to explore new avenues than I ever have before. Easier said than done. As I sit back and listen to the album again, I say to myself, ""I think we really captured what we wanted to do: To not dumb down or compromise what I do vocally, but at the same time, I really pushed a lot of my boundaries."" CNN: On tour these days, do you have any rock star indulgences? Groban: (Laughs) I will tell you, many of the real rockers I know on tour, have the most zen, meditative, dare I say boring existence back stage. Nowadays, I think the rock and roll thing is to not lose your voice on stage and to make sure your fans are happy. But my rock and roll indulgences are basically apple juice, lots of Fiji water and sometimes I'll put on a hat, hoodie and sunglasses and I'll go out and feel what they crowd feels like. CNN: Really? Groban: Just during the opening act. My thing is, I like to feel the energy of the room before I go out there. Kind of plan my attack. For me, it's not just about when the lights go down, it's about the whole process. What does the room feel like? What does the stage look like? What was the ticket price? You want everything to be an experience that makes them happy. If can feel whether there's a buzz or a slight agitation. CNN: What's interesting is that as record sales of rock music have declined, yours have been massive. Is operatic pop the last frontier for successful musicians? Groban: (Laughs) It's something I've been scratching my head over. It's sad for me to see so many record stores going under. I don't think things are entirely digital. There's a huge gap in how people buy their music. Digital is certainly the most convenient. Part of it has to do whether or not you draw a line in the sand on whether you're going to be a ""single"" artist or an ""album"" artist. I can't get away with releasing an album unless it's the kind of album my fans want to listen to from beginning to end. I think the digital world has gotten people used to picking and choosing what they deem to be the hit and disposing of the rest. And I think that can be really dangerous. CNN: Last year, we saw you cast on ""The Office"" as Andy Bernard's brother. Will you reprise that role as the series winding down? Groban: I haven't been on set. I haven't been asked. I think it may have run its course. That happened so on a whim. I got a Twitter message from Mindy Kaling and she said ""Hey, I got a crazy idea, it would be really funny if you could stop by."" I just happened to be playing Staples Center the night before, so I went off stage, went home, got as much sleep as I could and showed up set the next morning at 5 a.m. I think it turned into something more than I expected it to. CNN: You're also slated to appear in an upcoming comedy called ""Coffee Town,"" alongside ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's"" Glenn Howerton. What's your character like? Groban: Kind of a slacker, a failed rock band guy who's a barista at a coffee shop who has an ongoing feud with Glenn, Ben Schwartz (""House of Lies"") and Steve Little (""Eastbound & Down""). They basically come in there every day as their ""Clerks"" style, hang and steal my free Wi-Fi by taking one sip every 20 minutes. It was fun to play that tattooed, d----e-baggy type. CNN: Do you have any other acting gigs lined up? Groban: There's a really fun cameo I'm about to make in a film that I wish I could tell you about, but they've sworn me to secrecy. I'm doing a cameo in ""CSI: NY,"" as myself. I'm just going to play ""Happy in My Heartache"" from the new album in their Valentine's episode. Not going to be a corpse, thankfully.","Josh Groban talks about some of his musical influences .

"(CNN) -- She says she was brought up to be the fastest driver, not the fastest girl. None of the boys were faster on Sunday. Danica Patrick became the first woman to win the pole position for the Daytona 500, considered the Super Bowl of NASCAR, posting a lap of 196.434 mph. She'll start next Sunday's ""Great American Race"" in the front row, on the inside part of the track. The polesitter begins the race with certain strategic advantages as well as the prestige of leading an elite pack. What is poll position? Becoming the first woman to win a pole at any NASCAR top-division race is another milestone for a racer known for breaking barriers. ""I've heard stories about a kid, a boy or a girl, saying, 'But mommy, daddy. That's a girl that's out there racing.' And then they can have that conversation to say, 'You can do anything you want to do and gender doesn't matter.' Your passion is what matters. And that's cool,"" Patrick told CNN's Don Lemon on Sunday. ""When the pressure is on and when the spotlight is on, they ultimately become some of my better moments,"" she said earlier. Patrick, who was the favorite to win the pole, said she felt some nerves because of the high expectations. ""I feel more nervous when there is more on the line,"" she said. ""It was, 'Just don't make a stupid mistake.'"" She said that driving a qualifying lap at Daytona, where drivers shift gears three times then run the engine pretty much wide open, was 90% crew preparation and 10% driver. Not so, said her crew chief, Tony Gibson, who said it's an even split. ""I'm proud of her. She didn't falter,"" he said. She will start her No. 10 GODADDY Chevrolet in the front row next week alongside Jeff Gordon, who ran a lap at the 2.5-mile Daytona International Speedway at 196.292 mph in his No. 24 Drive to End Hunger Chevrolet. ""She runs so smooth, keeps such a smooth line and that's what you have to do to carry speed here,"" co-car owner and fellow driver Tony Stewart said. A pole position does not guarantee success. Only nine of the pole winners in the first 54 Daytona 500s won the race and no one has earned both victories since Dale Jarrett in 2000, NASCAR spokesman Scott Warfield said. The rest of the field will be set in two qualifying races scheduled for Thursday. Patrick and Gordon are guaranteed two of the 43 slots in the final lineup. But they go to the back of the pack if they wreck their cars in the qualifiers, or at any time before Sunday's race, and have to switch to a backup car, Warfield said. Patrick, 30, is in her first full year as a NASCAR Sprint Cup driver. Last year she made 10 Sprint Cup starts, qualifying no better than 23rd. NASCAR says Patrick still qualifies as a rookie for the 2013 season and she's the first rookie to win the Daytona 500 pole since Jimmie Johnson in 2002. Before racing stock cars, Patrick raced open-wheel IndyCars for several years. Patrick said winning a pole position in Kansas in 2005 was one of her top moments as an IndyCar driver. She also was the first woman to win a race in that series, in Japan in 2008, and was the first woman to ever lead a lap at the famed Indianapolis 500. Patrick won a pole last year at Daytona in the Nationwide Series, NASCAR's second division. She finished 38th in that race and in the Daytona 500 and she said on Sunday that she plans on competing in both races again next weekend. Janet Guthrie previously held both the records for qualifying by a female driver. She qualified ninth for two races in 1977 and her best Daytona starting position was 18th in 1980. Gordon, a three-time champion at the Daytona 500, welcomed Patrick to the front row. ""This is great from the sport and the rest of us will benefit from it,"" he said. ""I'm proud to sit on the front row with her."" She also said that the wait to see if she had won the pole was made more agonizing because she had gone to work out as other drivers went one by one, trying to best her top lap. Patrick told CNN that understanding the scope of her achievement ""is something that happens down the road. In the moment, it's about thinking about what I need to do for next Sunday and trying to make some more history.""","NASCAR racer Danica Patrick says ""gender doesn't matter""

"(CNN) -- New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan sat for questions from lawyers for victims of sexual abuse by priests in Milwaukee while he was that city's Roman Catholic leader, his office disclosed Wednesday. ""Today Cardinal Dolan had the long-awaited opportunity to talk about his decision nine years ago in Milwaukee to publicize the names of priests who had abused children and how he responded to the tragedy of past clergy sexual abuse of minors, during the time he was privileged to serve as archbishop of Milwaukee,"" Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, said in a written statement. ""He has indicated over the past two years that he was eager to cooperate in whatever way he could, and he was looking forward to talking about the good work and progress that took place to ensure the protection of children and pastoral outreach to victims."" Dolan was archbishop of Milwaukee from 2002 to 2009 before taking the same position in New York, the Catholic Church's top U.S. pulpit. The church has been rocked globally by revelations that it failed to stop the sexual abuse of children by priests for decades, and Dolan's old archdiocese filed for bankruptcy in the face of numerous lawsuits by victims. The Chapter 11 proceedings led to the discovery that Dolan had approved payments of $20,000 to get abusive priests to leave the church in 2003. The Milwaukee archdiocese confirmed that it had offered the payoffs as ""the most expedient and cost-effective way"" to get rid of them. ""Like it or not, the archdiocese is canonically responsible for the financial care of a priest -- even a priest who has committed such a horrible crime and sin such as clergy sexual abuse of a minor,"" the archdiocese said in a statement in May that confirmed the payments. A leading victims' group said it was heartened that Dolan had sat for a deposition, saying he had been ""particularly adept at evading responsibility"" for his actions. ""So while these depositions represent progress, it's crucial to remember that the best way to prevent and discourage future crimes and cover ups is for secular authorities to investigate, charge and convict Catholic officials who hide and enable heinous crimes against kids,"" the Survivor's Network for those Abused by Priests said. Dolan, who also serves as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, is among the cardinals who will choose a new pope after the resignation of Benedict XVI. Dolan himself was a 33-1 longshot for the papacy as of last week, according to one British bookmaker. Vatican: Pope may change rules to allow replacement vote sooner .

"(CNN) -- ""Skyfall,"" the 23rd installment in the James Bond series, one of the longest-running film franchises in history, recently landed at the top of the box office with $87.8 million in ticket sales. It was the largest opening ever for 007 and the fourth largest opening this year, behind ""The Avengers,"" ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" and ""The Hunger Games."" Ian Fleming's agent has always been a man of wish fulfillment. After all, he brought heat during the chilliest parts of the Cold War and had the requisite women and weapons. Now, Bond is proving that he still has a place at MI6 by tackling a much more modern dilemma: tactical cyberespionage and terrorism. While the methods for wreaking havoc have changed, the confidential case files are as classic as the man's martini. CNN spoke to Morgan Wright, a decorated former law enforcement officer who has done work relating to cyberterrorism for the United States Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense about what ""Skyfall"" gets right and wrong. In the end, the evolving franchise portrays a very real scenario that the United States may soon struggle with from a policy standpoint: When does cyberterrorism necessitate a physical response? Busting Bond: The myths of movie spycraft . (Warning, there are movie spoilers ahead). Information storage . Shaking disbelief: One of the standout moments in ""Skyfall"" is the film's opening sequence in which Bond, played for the third time by Daniel Craig, and field operative Eve, played by Naomie Harris, chase a man through the streets of Istanbul. They're after a hard drive containing confidential information about MI6 agents. It's information that ""Skyfall's"" bad guy Silva, played by Javier Bardem, plans on uploading to YouTube, putting the agents' lives at risk. But how likely would it be for a terrorist to obtain and store this information in one place? Stirring reality: Terrorists and intelligence agencies handle the management and distribution of intelligence in radically different ways, Wright said. ""If you take Osama bin Laden, for example, they're not going to have big classified systems or safeguards that go with that,"" Wright said. It's true that after bin Laden's compound was raided, stashes of flash drives, CDs and tapes were discovered. He had everything in one place. ""That's very consistent when you're not part of the government and you lack the infrastructure to build out a big system that a national security agency does,"" Wright said. ""Bad guys need everything in one place because that's how they operate."" Unlike the 15 different members of the intelligence community -- ranging from the National Reconnaissance Office to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency â€” terrorist groups would be unable to have a secure worldwide network or to participate in cloud computing. However, it's implied that the man they're chasing is more than your common terrorist. He's a man with access. Still, it's unlikely that he would be able to have all of this information in one place. ""It's not very plausible that the government is going to put all of their sensitive information on one hard drive that manages to get stolen because that would be a violation of what they call OPSEC,"" Wright said. When it comes to top secret information, there are special access programs that are very restricted, so, Wright said, it would be virtually impossible for someone to have access to all of that information as ""everything is regulated on the government side."" Hacking in . Shaking disbelief: While Bond is sipping tequila as everyone assumes he is dead, Silva goes after his main target, M, played once again by Judi Dench. The villain hacks into MI6 to gain control of the agency's gas pipeline, which allows him to target and blow up specific rooms. The act brings Bond out of retirement. But would it be possible for a bad guy to hack into MI6 -- or any infrastructure -- to target it for destruction? Stirring reality: Wright said many critical infrastructures are connected to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems, controlling our electricity grid, water, and sewers, and are therefore are a huge soft target for terrorism. ""Now you can use it for transmissions of data communications that control everything from power in hospitals to controlling the cell doors inside a prison,"" he said, adding that targeting a specific office is highly unlikely. Transportation safety . Shaking disbelief: After hacking into the MI6 mainframe, Silva accesses the London Underground and manages to send one of the Tube's trains off the rails, launching it toward Bond in rapid succession. Would it be possible for Silva to access something like a train, and how much control could he actually have over it? Stirring reality: ""Transportation is one of the softest terrorism targets there is, and quite frankly I'm shocked that public transportation hasn't been targeted more often and that there haven't been more successful attacks,"" Wright said. ""You can create a small explosion or diversion using a computer to change the lights from go to stop or interfering with the traffic control capabilities of the track by overriding a command."" Wright said. Airlines could also be at risk, the expert said. ""There are some gaping holes in the air traffic control system in terms of being able to access frequencies or being able to talk directly to pilots."" Still, just like M's office, Wright said the idea that Silva could target a train so quickly and send it to Bond's location is based predominately in fantasy. Snagging the villain . Shaking disbelief: When things get really bad, Bond and M decide the time has come to create a digital trail that will lead Silva directly to them, but they want to make it look like they're actually hiding. This leads them to the final battle in a place called Skyfall, which fans of Ian Fleming's books know as a very personal place for Bond. It's the final showdown and the final act of tactical cyberespionage in the film. However, would anyone ever really need to create a fake geosignal to make someone like Silva think that they're actually hiding from them? Stirring reality: According to Wright you can create a computer network that looks legitimate to someone else but in reality uses its weakness for your own benefit. ""There's actually a term for this in the computer world called 'Honeypots',"" he said. ""When we were concerned about the financial sector, there was actually a project called the Honeypot project. It was a deception project where we created what appeared to be a bank front end, a Web-based front end where transactions were taking place."" By doing so, Wright and his team were able to see the latest techniques being used and which vulnerabilities cyberterrorists were willing to exploit. ""We looked at how they went about scanning the system, what tools they used, and what vulnerabilities they went after."" Often, Wright would patch the most obvious vulnerabilities but leave esoteric ones unpatched, allowing hackers to exploit the system as he monitored their behavioral patterns. In the movie, Q explains that if he makes it too easy for Silva to find them, he'll know something is up. Likewise, if the signal is too hard to find, M could possibly remain in hiding. ""People tend to get comfortable using their own techniques, and they use the same approach over and over again,"" Wright explained. ""You can get a profile of an attacker, determine if it was the same group doing something else, and see what methodology they're using."" Wright said it's a cat-and-mouse game, and ""the old saying is that government has to be right 100%, but the bad guy has only got to be lucky once."" In the case of the latest film from the 50-year-old Bond franchise, it's safe to assume who comes out on top.","A cyberterrorism expert takes on ""Skyfall's"" take on cyberespionage and terrorism .
He says accessing top secret information isn't as easy as the movie implies .

"(EW.com) -- Writer Meredith Stiehm, 44, shares similarities with ""Homeland's"" Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes): both work in male-dominated places (Stiehm is the Showtime series' sole female writer) and both have personal connections to bipolar disorder (Stiehm's sister, like Carrie, suffers from the condition). Stiehm has penned some of the series most acclaimed and talked about episodes, including season one's ""The Weekend,"" where Brody (Damian Lewis) and Carrie go to her cabin in the woods, and season two's ""New Car Smell,"" in which Carrie finally arrests Brody. ""I didn't come in until like episode 4,"" says Stiehm. ""[Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa] created the character and the show. Around episode 4, they realized that there were all male writers and they had a female lead so they wanted a female writer."" Adds Danes, ""She's really incredible. Her voice is so distinctive and so honest and funny. She has a very wry sensibility that's so in keeping with who Carrie is. But she also is very warm and feeling and all of that translates into all her work. I owe an enormous amount to Meredith."" Drake's 'Started From the Bottom': Hear it . But now there's a chance that ""Homeland"" could be losing the talented writer. Stiehm has a much-buzzed-about pilot with FX called ""The Bridge"" about a dead body found on a bridge between Texas and Mexico (it's a remake of a Scandinavian series of the same name). If the pilot, starring Diane Kruger (Inglorious Basterds) and Demian Bichir (A Better Life), goes to series, it's likely that Stiehm will also leave the Showtime series. ""It's a high-cost problem,"" admits the writer. ""It's so hard to get your own series. But, at the same time, what kind of idiot leaves Homeland right now?""

I'm sure there are other brilliant women out there who could contribute wonderful things but I just like her! She asked me to talk to Diane about my experience working in television and hopefully encourage her to accept the role. And I talked to her for about an hour and was really selling her on it.

"(CNN) -- Politics has long mixed with golf -- from the early 20th century, when William Taft became the first U.S. president to openly admit his love for the game, to modern-day leaders such as Barack Obama and George W.

The Americans have dominated the biennial tournament since it was first played in 1994, with six wins and a tie. The Internationals' only win came when Royal Melbourne Golf Club also staged the 1998 competition -- and Australian PM John Howard was chairman. Bush and his father have both served in the role, while in 2000 Bill Clinton became the first sitting United States president to be involved. South African President Thabo Mbeki (2003) and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper (2007) have also accepted the honor. Players are not paid, and tournament profits go to charity, with more than $23 million distributed to 15 countries since 1994. While origins of its name are unclear -- the PGA Tour, which runs the event, could not give CNN a definitive answer -- the tournament's link with global leaders is undeniable. Obama, the 2009 chairman, follows in a long line of White House incumbents to love golf. This was never more evident than on May 2 this year -- the date he announced that Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden had been killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan. On the morning of his address to the nation, President Obama deflected any possible attention away from him by indulging in his favorite pursuit, a game of golf at the Andrews Air Force Base course in Maryland. Although, quite understandably, he played only nine holes instead of his regular 18 that day, Obama's love for the game meant he had a perfect decoy to the dramatic events about to unfold. He is not alone in taking to the greens while occupying the Oval Office, with 15 of the last 18 presidents said to have played the sport while in power. Here is CNN's guide to the top golfing leaders. 1. John F. Kennedy (1961-1963) Video footage of JFK playing golf shows how talented he was, although -- unlike President Obama -- he was reluctant to associate himself with the game. During his run for president in 1960, Kennedy did everything possible to keep his fellow Americans from discovering that he not only loved the game but was nearly as good as a club professional, with a beautiful natural swing. Throughout Dwight Eisenhower's two terms, Kennedy had portrayed him as someone who cared more about lowering his handicap than improving the lives of ordinary Americans, so information about his own passion for the game only emerged later. 2. Dwight Eisenhower (1953-1961) Eisenhower is recognized as probably the most dedicated to the sport, and was often criticized by Democrats for spending too much time on the golf course. Eisenhower's solution? In 1954 he had a putting green installed at the White House, a short stroll from the Oval Office, to enable him to practice while at work. It still exists to this day. The former five-star general was also a member at the Augusta National Golf Club, where an overhanging tree on the 17th hole proved such an obstacle to the leader that it was dubbed the ""Eisenhower Tree."" 3. William Taft (1909-1913) Taft was the 27th president, but the first to openly admit to his love of golf, which had previously been depicted as a sport for the rich. In fact, no president has done more to promote golf than Taft, who was a regular player at exhibition matches and encouraged the media to report on how he had played -- good or bad. Despite being a large man, Taft was a good golfer, playing off a 20-handicap. However, during one of his regular public rounds at the Kebo Valley course in Maine, he managed to take a massive 27 shots at the 17th hole. 4. Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921) Like his predecessor Taft, Wilson was mad about golf. In fact, it is widely rumored that he played a round every day of the week, apart from Sunday. During his two terms in office, Wilson played more than 1,000 rounds. He even had a set of black balls made so he could play golf in the snow. A man of famous quotes, Wilson described golf as ""a game in which one endeavors to control a ball with implements ill-adapted for the purpose."" 5. Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1945) Roosevelt, the longest-serving president in U.S. history, started playing golf as a 12-year-old. Such was his early addiction to playing, he cleared a patch of land on the family's four-acre estate to make room for a nine-hole course. Sadly, illness prevented FDR from playing the game for much of his adult life, but he never lost his passion for golf and always kept a lighter in the shape of a golf ball on his desk in the Oval Office. One of his legacies was the public works program that led to the construction of more than 300 municipal courses with federal money, making the game more accessible to ordinary Americans. There is a public course in Philadelphia named after FDR in recognition of this. 6. George W. Bush (2001-2009) President Bush was not shy in letting people know about his interest in golf and was often accompanied by the world's media during a round. On one such occasion, he made one of his infamous gaffes which was reported around the globe after he gave a press briefing from the course. Questioned on violence in the Middle East, Bush told reporters: ""I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers. Thank you."" He then paused and said: ""Now watch this drive!"" 7. Gerald Ford (1974-1977) An avid golfer and sportsman in general, Ford had an unfortunate reputation of being clumsy and accident prone despite being athletic for his age. One such occasion happened during a round of golf when his drive accidentally drifted into a crowd of spectators and struck a woman on the head. The clip was repeatedly aired on television and parodied by comedians. 8. Bill Clinton (1993-2001) Clinton was renowned for an entourage featuring Secret Service agents, a police sniper, a man carrying U.S. nuclear codes, various aides and someone with a secure telephone so he could speak to world leaders during a typical round. Clinton also had a reputation for awarding himself (and his playing partners) free shots, known as mulligans, on the course -- a reputation he claimed was greatly exaggerated. 9. Richard Nixon (1969-1974) Nixon became an avid golfer during his time as vice-president to ""golf nut"" Eisenhower. However, as the complexities of office took hold towards the end of his tenure, he devoted less and less time to playing, despite having his own private three-hole course at his home in California. 10. Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) Reagan came into politics late and had already perfected a decent swing by the time he took office. However, unlike many presidents before him, he actually played less and less golf during his eight years in the White House, although he did indulge in a regular New Year's Eve round in California. On one occasion in 1983, Reagan was playing at Augusta National, the home of the Masters, when a gunman took hostages in the pro shop and demanded to speak to the former Hollywood actor.","The ninth Presidents Cup between U.S. and International teams is in Melbourne .

"(CNN) -- Two Australian Olympic swimmers who posted pictures on Facebook of themselves brandishing weapons have been ordered to take them down by the country's swimming authorities. The image, taken in a gun shop in Santa Clara, California, showed Nick D'Arcy with two pistols standing next to Kenrick Monk who is holding two shotguns across his chest, according to a Friday report in Australia's Herald Sun. The swimmers were training in the U.S. ahead of the Olympic Games in London later this year. Swimming Australia said in a statement that it does not condone ""the posting of inappropriate content on Facebook, Twitter or any social media platform."" As of Friday morning, neither of the swimmers' Facebook pages or Twitter accounts contained the photo. ""It was all just meant to be a bit of fun, the photos were just a bit of fun,"" D'Arcy told local media after returning to Australia. ""If anyone's been offended I deeply apologize. It was never the intent; it was never supposed to be offensive."" Dozens of fans have posted on Monk's public Facebook page saying they support the athletes and that Swimming Australia had blown the photo out of proportion. Swimming Australia said they will be speaking with both athletes regarding the incident. While the pair faces possible Olympic sanctions, D'Arcy has been embroiled in controversy in the past. In 2008, he was dropped from the Beijing Olympic team following an assault charge for hitting teammate Simon Cowley and breaking his jaw, the Australian Daily Telegraph reported at the time. Both swimmers were named in Australia's team in March.","Two Australian Olympic swimmers ordered to take down controversial gun photo from Facebook .

"San Francisco (Financial Times) -- Twitter has unveiled a new automated advertising technology that promises to unlock the moneymaking potential of the microblogging site. The development of a Twitter ads API, or ""application-programming interface"", satisfies a long-awaited desire of advertisers to increase and improve the reach of their marketing messages to Twitter's 200m active users. A similar technology launched by Facebook in 2010 helped that social network reach more than $3bn in revenues the following year, with analysts estimating the system currently generates roughly 60 per cent of the company's revenues. Twitter currently sprinkles paid tweets in a user's timeline, amid posts from people and companies they have chosen to ""follow"". Twitter said users would not see more ads as a result of the new system, at least in the short term, but that pricing might increase for advertisers as its auctions to buy ads become more competitive. ""As interest in Twitter has grown, our focus has been on delivering better ads for users, not more ads,"" said April Underwood, Twitter's product manager for revenue, in a blog post. ""Our system rewards marketers for being good, not for being loud."" Ms Underwood told the FT that there was ""no direct impact on the user experience in the short term"", although Twitter users should see ""more relevant and better ads"" as a result of the new system, because it would be simpler for advertisers to use the targeting capabilities which it introduced last year. Although she did not rule out a future increase in the inventory given over to ads, Ms Underwood said the company took users' experience ""really seriously"". ""We take a slow and thoughtful approach,"" she said. ""Our motto is to get it right rather than right now."" The new system will certainly increase ad revenue for the social media company, which is believed to be planning an initial public offering for early next year. Research firm eMarketer estimates Twitter revenues will grow nearly 90 per cent this year to $545.2m, and reach more than $800m in ad revenues worldwide by 2014. Before the new platform, advertisers had to manage their Twitter campaigns manually. The new system automates the process, streamlining the management process for advertisers and giving them more tools to ""deliver the right message, to the right audience,"" on both desktop computers and on mobile devices. It also allows ad buyers to integrate Twitter campaigns with those on Facebook and LinkedIn, as well as search and display. Twitter said it began testing the new API last month. It launched it on Wednesday with five partners that oversee social media advertising purchases for large multinational companies, including Adobe, Hootsuite, Salesforce, SHIFT and TBG Digital. Twitter noted earlier this month that it took four minutes after the Super Bowl's unexpected power outage for the first ""Promoted Tweet"" to appear referencing the blackout. Using the API, Simon Mansell, chief executive of TBG Digital, said that could be reduced to as little as four seconds, through greater automation. ""This is an obvious and necessary piece of infrastructure that all companies with proprietary ads systems need,"" said Josh McFarland, chief executive of TellApart, an ad-targeting company that uses Google and Facebook's APIs. But Mr McFarland, who as a product manager at Google led the development of its AdWords API in 2003-05, said that such platforms can be ""tricky"" because they ""cede some control to third parties"", in return for helping Twitter ""significantly scale its active advertisers and campaigns"". ""Twitter's willingness to build an ads API signals that they've reached a size where they feel that the accretive value of third parties -- to monetisation at least -- outweighs the risks,"" he said. Adobe did an early test of the platform with a few of its customers, including Levi Strauss, the clothing company, and its own Adobe account, in an effort to increase the number of people who ""follow"" the brands on Twitter. By using granular targeting, segmenting the campaign by regions and testing different bid levels on pricing, the company increased its number of Twitter followers by 63 per cent. ""Our customers have been asking us to include Twitter"" in Adobe's media products, said David Karnstedt, senior vice-president of media and advertising solutions at Adobe.

"Nagoya, Japan (CNN) -- Marcos Nunes swigs from his badly concealed bottle of red wine on a chilly street corner in the Japanese city of Nagoya before deciding the question was something between a joke and an insult. ""Why have we come here?"" he asks tetchily before offering his bottle, sloppily wrapped in a blue plastic bag. He is wearing a black and white football shirt. ""Corinthians is like a nation, a religion ... people are borrowing money from banks, from relatives to come here. They are quitting their jobs, selling their bikes, their cars, even their fridges. It's true."" Sports fans are no strangers to sacrifice in the name of the teams they love and for the fans of Brazilian champions Corinthians no sacrifice is big enough. But forsaking the ability to chill your food is another level entirely. The current South American champions are in Japan for the FIFA Club World Cup, an annual tournament that brings together all six continental champions, including Chelsea, the English winners of this year's European Champions League. But unlike the other teams, who have brought a few thousand at most, 30,000 Corinthians fans had turned up in Nagoya, bathing the city in black and white, to watch their semifinal clash against the African champions Al-Ahly of Egypt. ""It is natural for us to travel to watch Corinthians,"" explains Nunes, who unlike his compatriots, has booked his trip as a vacation. ""My boss knows I'm here. But even if he didn't we'd still be here ... If we have to go to Japan OK. If we have to go to Chelsea to play at Stamford Bridge, OK. We'll be 30,000 there."" Unloved . The Club World Cup is little loved by European teams; seen as no more than a mid-season annoyance given the travel involved. But in the rest of the world the tournament is taken very seriously indeed. An incredible 15,000 fans turned up at the airport just to see the team off. More than 200,000 Brazilians live in Japan and the Japanese government issued record numbers of visas to Brazilians for the tournament, a sign not just of Brazil's well-known soccer passion, but also its growing global economic and political might. Brazil will host the next World Cup and the next Olympic Games too. The effect of both can already be felt. ""We were in the second division five years ago,"" explains Carlos Eduardo Martins, one of several thousand noisy Corinthians fans singing songs on the Nagoya Metro on the way to the match, much to the puzzlement and amusement of the Japanese commuters. He had taken a 25-hour flight via Istanbul to be here. ""The government has given us a stadium, which opens in 2013. The first game of the World Cup will be played there. They sold a lot of advertising on the shirts, we get money from television network Globo for the TV so Corinthians is rising up. ""Corinthians has one advantage, the [former] president of Brazil Lula is a fan of Corinthians. So we got a lot. We have poor fans and then very rich men as fans. We have a new organization."" The prodigal son returns . But equally as important was the return of Brazil's prodigal son. In 2009 Ronaldo returned to Brazil and played for Corinthians. Brazil had always been a net exporter of footballing talent. So much so that FIFA had to change its rules on national team eligibility to prevent countries around the world filling their squads with naturalized Brazilians. But when the big names started returning home -- the likes of Robinho, Ronaldinho and Elano -- on wages comparable to those in Europe, it sent a message to the rest of the world that Brazil, and Brazilian football, was changing. ""After he [Ronaldo] came, the club rose a lot,"" agrees Martins. ""Young people started supporting us, even people from other teams. They were supporting Corinthians and Ronaldo. It was a beautiful story for everybody."" Second time lucky . This isn't the first time that Corinthians has appeared in the Club World Cup. They won the inaugural tournament in 2000 as hosts. But this is the first year they have appeared as South American champions after winning the Copa Libertadores for the first time. The club's roots can be found thousands of miles away from its native Sao Paulo in a small amateur football club. In 1910 the English club Corinthians traveled to Brazil on a tour to bring football to the masses. The game, and the name, stuck. ""Many teams form Brazil want to win this Cup so it is very important for us,"" says Martins. ""The team is for the poor people. They are crazy for the team and follow the Corinthians all around the world."" Sure enough, the Toyota Stadium in Nagoya is covered in the club's colors. A huge Union flag -- a reminder of the club's British roots, bastardized in black and white -- flies behind one of the goals. The match is like a home game for Corinthians, who win 1-0 thanks to Paulo Guerrero's goal. However, it's not the best performance with Al-Ahly dominating the second half. ""We were dominating the game in the first half and this was because of the supporters. We had to respond to them,"" Corinthians coach Tite admitted after the match. ""Thanks to the supporters we were able to show our style."" Corinthians' 12th man proved to be the difference. ""The Europeans don't give the Club World Cup much attention. We are the 12th player for the team and go anywhere they go,"" said Tony, a native of Sao Paulo, who had only made the relatively short 11-hour trip from London. He didn't have to sell his own fridge either. ""We will definitely win it, Chelsea will go down,"" he said of Sunday's final, where once again there will thousands of Corinthians fans in the stands. ""We want to win big and win over the champions of Europe.""","The FIFA Club World Cup is currently taking place in Japan .

"Washington (CNN) -- The National Park Service said Saturday that the National Christmas Tree located just south of the White House has died due to complications from ""transplant shock."" The Park Service removed the Colorado blue spruce from the White House grounds early Saturday. The tree had replaced another which was damaged in a wind storm early last year. The Park Service said it always has a replacement tree lined up to make sure one is in place for the annual National Christmas Tree Lighting event held each December. The new tree is also a Colorado spruce but won't be planted until late October.","The tree dies of transplant shock .

"(CNN) -- What does a sporting legend do when they walk away from the cut and thrust, the adrenaline fueled buzz of top flight competition? In many cases they make a comeback in an attempt to rediscover former glories and some like tennis player Kim Clijsters, who won three more grand slams, make a success of it. But more often than not in ends in failure, with seven-time Formula One champion Michael Schumacher, who quit for the second time at the end of this season, and multiple world boxing champion Ricky Hatton, knocked out in his comeback fight, recent notable examples. In golfer Annika Sorenstam's case, you get ""busier than I've ever been"" and pursue a business career while running a foundation and looking after a young family -- all with the inner drive and determination that took her to the top in her chosen sport. Her decision to quit back in 2008 came as a shock. She was only 38 and still a contender at the highest levels, but once she made the break it was total and final. Her last competitive event was in Dubai in December of that year and she has not trod the professional fairway since, marrying her second husband, Mike McGee, in 2009. They have two young children, Ava born that year and William in 2011, who arrived 13 weeks premature, but thankfully with no ill effects. But through her commercial and golf design interests, promoting the ANNIKA brand of clothing, Sorenstam is still heavily involved in the game she loves. Timing in business just like golf is everything and the Swede told CNN that launching new ventures in a global recession was ""tough."" Growing portfolio . But she was not going to allow something as trivial as economic turmoil to divert her from her goals and Sorenstam has put her name to a growing portfolio of signature golf courses, mostly in Asia. Back at home in Orlando, Florida is the base for her academy, where players of all standards can sign up for tuition, and her non-profit making foundation, which offers young golfers opportunities to fulfill their potential. She also has an interest in a winery and financial group, as well as making occasional appearances on the Golf Channel. Like her male counterparts such as Arnold Palmer and Greg Norman, who have built up business empires off the course, Sorenstam believes the work ethic is the key. ""There are a lot of similarities with the things I learned on the golf course, such as focus and determination,"" she told CNN. ""Without drive and vision you can't start anything, it's a little bit in you."" Sorenstam retired just at the time when Asian players were beginning to dominate the LPGA Tour, including World No.1 Yani Tseng, who the Swede has mentored. It helps they are near neighbors in Lake Nona. ""I share my experience of what it's like to be at the top, to always look at the big picture,"" said Sorenstam. Asian success . She believes that the wave of success that Tseng and others from the region are riding, will continue after Asian players won all four of the women's majors in 2012. ""They have tremendous support from their families, are prepared to start practicing at seven o'clock in the morning and stay there all day,"" said Sorenstam. The introduction of golf at the 2016 Rio Olympics -- Sorenstam was in the delegation which presented to the IOC -- will she believes further fuel the ambition of women golfers from all over the world to challenge the traditional American domination of the LPGA Tour. Sorenstam led the charge of overseas players during her glittering career, which saw her win 72 LPGA events, including 10 majors, and 21 other tournaments. She is the career leading money winner at over $22 million and broke new ground by becoming the first woman in 58 years to compete in a men's PGA Tour event. Her appearance at the 2003 Colonial in Texas put women's golf to the top of the sporting headlines and despite narrowly missing the cut, Sorenstam did enough to earn the respect of her male counterparts. ""I wanted to challenge myself, to get better, to learn from the best in the world, to push myself to the extreme."" Boost interest . Where Sorenstam led, others like Michelle Wie followed in men's events, but she knows that the LPGA still has a long way to go to match the coverage given to the PGA Tour. To boost interest, she would like to see the two tours run combined events as the same venue as happens with ATP and WTA tennis tournaments. ""It would be great for fans"" and would pave the way for more equality in prize money she believes. The 42-year-old was recently named vice-captain to fellow Swede Liselotte Neumann for the 2013 Solheim Cup in Colorado. She performed the same role as Europe beat the United States in the biennial team event in Ireland in 2011. But is she ever tempted to make a playing comeback? ""I think about when I turn on the golf on TV,"" she admitted. ""I remember what it was like to come down the stretch in the lead, but then I look at my kids and know that I am happy where I am in my life. ""To play with my husband and two children would be my favorite foursome now."" Juggling the demands of a busy professional and business life, her diary is hectic, and finding time for her young family, would test anybody. But one has the feeling that Sorenstam is totally committed to her new life away from professional sport and wild horses could not drag her back on the fairways of the world.","Annika Sorenstam retired from professional golf in 2008 at only 38 .

"Jos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Seven foreign workers were kidnapped late Saturday from a construction company in northeastern Nigeria, police said. The workers include one Italian citizen, one Greek citizen and two Lebanese citizens, according to those governments. Nigerian police said a Briton was also kidnapped; British authorities said they were aware of such reports and were making inquiries. Who are Boko Haram? The workers were taken Saturday night from the offices of Setraco, a construction company in Jama'are, in Bauchi State, police said. The company is based in Abuja and is involved in many major road construction projects in northern Nigeria. The gunmen first attacked a prison, burning two police trucks, public service broadcaster Voice of Nigeria reported, citing state police spokesman Hassan Muhammed. Opinion: Nigerians still waiting for their 'African Spring' They then killed a guard at the Setraco workers camp before kidnapping the workers, Muhammed told the broadcaster. Nigeria has seen a rash of killings and kidnappings blamed on criminal groups or the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. A week ago, three North Korean doctors were killed at a hospital in northern Yobe state, the state police chief told CNN. Ten suspects were arrested. Earlier this month, nine people working for a government polio vaccination program were killed in the northern city of Kano, a police spokesman said. Opinion: Nigeria is a sinking ship, but we must not desert it . Nigeria launched a military crackdown on Boko Haram on New Year's Day. Security forces have since captured one of the group's leaders and killed 17 suspected Boko Haram members in a two-day offensive. Human Rights Watch says Boko Haram -- whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege"" -- has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict Islamic law on largely Muslim northern Nigeria. Opinion: Why are Nigerians numb to slaughter? In the past, the group attacked other Muslims it felt were on an immoral path. But it has increasingly targeted Christians with numerous attacks on churches, as well as striking police stations. Boko Haram and other Muslim groups say the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the Nigerian government. But the U.S. State Department has accused its leaders of having ties to the al Qaeda terrorist network and of hoping to drive a wedge between Nigeria's Christian and Muslim communities.","The foreigners work for a construction firm in northern Nigeria, police say .

"(MNN.com) -- As a child, I hated playing outside. Even when we lived in picturesque Hawaii, my mom would send all the kids outdoors to play and I spent the time whining at the front door. Years later, my dog Lulu does the same thing. Once she has finished doing her business, Lulu sits by the door howling to come back inside. Mosquitoes have been out of control this year, so I can't really blame her for wanting to stay indoors during the summer. But plenty of pooches spend the dog days having fun in the sun with their owners. Unfortunately, this also tends to be a time when plenty of dogs get away. During our daily walks, Lulu and I have run into at least three dogs that were off leash and roaming the neighborhood. Proper identification gives lost pets a better chance of returning home safely. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals notes that about 5 million to 7 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters each year, and about half of those pets were picked up by animal control. If you plan to enjoy the great outdoors with your dog come fall, consider adding a few items that rank as favorites among trainers. Get a sturdy leash: Do a quick inventory of your dog's gear and make sure metal attachments on leashes still get the job done. You don't want to find out that a leash has passed its prime during a long walk â€” or a run-in with the neighbor's cat. Professional dog walker Benetta Green of Gone to the Dogs pet care in Atlanta also avoids retractable leashes when walking a client's dog. ""They are very difficult to control,"" she says. ""I've seen people who expand them out and let the dog have their freedom and, all of sudden out of nowhere, there comes a bigger dog and you don't have the time you need to pull the dog back. I know people like the retractable leash but you have to be aware of what's around you as well."" I'm partial to leather leashes because they wear well over time. Certified professional dog trainer Amber Burckhalter of K-9 Coach in Smyrna, Georgia, introduced me to the Mendota leash, a clever collar-leash combo that tops my list of favorites. One end has a looped handle, while the other serves as an adjustable collar. This multitasking leash gets frequent use at my house during bathroom breaks, but Burckhalter says the Mendota works great for dogs that tend to slip out of their collars. The rope-style leash features an adjustable leather attachment that makes it one size fits all. You can find Mendota leashes at most pet supply stores. Amazon.com offers a variety of colors with prices starting at $11.45. MNN: Stolen dogs returned to owners 5 years later . Easy Walk harness: If your dog pulls during walks, then a day at the park can quickly feel like tug-of-war. Front-clip harnesses like the Easy Walk fit around a dog's front legs and offer a gentle correction when pooches start to tug. ""I like that the leash attaches to the chest and not to the dog's back,"" says certified dog trainer Renee Payne of Walk This Way Canine Behavior Therapy in New York. ""It works great for pulling or dogs that like to lag behind."" The Easy Walk is available in various sizes for $16.99 at Wag.com. Kong Wobbler: On a hot day, fill Kong's rubber Wobbler chew toy with healthy treats and freeze. ""Put the dog's food in it and they have to knock it around for the food to come out,"" Burckhalter says. ""That's additional exercise for [dogs]. They also love it because they don't typically get a lot of mental exercise."" Wobblers range in price from $15.99 to $22.99 based on the size at PetSmart stores. Pet Top water dispenser: Burckhalter recommends the Pet Top for dogs that are on the go. This plastic device screws onto standard water bottles and features an adjustable roller ball setting that allows pets to drink freely. It also means that owners don't have to carry travel water bowls or other gear. You can find Pet Tops for $6.99 at Bed Bath & Beyond. ChillSpot Dog Bed: On a hot day, most dogs like to congregate on cool tile floors in the bathroom or kitchen. ChillSpot applies that approach to dog beds, pairing aluminum tiles with ""chill pods"" that you freeze overnight so that dogs stay cool while tailgating or hanging out at the beach. You can stock up now for next summer. ""It's a great product for trainers to use in class,"" says dog trainer Andrew Zbeeb, owner of Frogs to Dogs in Atlanta, Georgia. To combat Georgia's sweltering summer heat, Zoo Atlanta even ordered a larger ChillSpot for its panda exhibit. A standard 24-by-36-inch dog bed is available for $169 at ChillSpot.biz. MNN: The 8 happiest dogs on YouTube . Sturdy collars: Check your dog's collars to make sure that they aren't worn out. It may be time to replenish the stock. ""My dogs go through collars really fast,"" says Burckhalter, who recommends the award-winning collars from EzyDog. These doggie essentials feature stainless steel D rings, reflective piping and neoprene linings typically used for wetsuits. As added protection, Burckhalter goes a step further. ""I take a Sharpie and write info on the inside of their collar. If they did get away and their tag came off they are still marked."" ID tags: ID tags are cheapest and easiest way to keep pets safe â€” as long as the information is up to date. Basic metal pet tags are available for $7.50 at PetSmart stores. Lulu's dog tags serve as an early warning device, alerting me when she is getting into mischief. In my home, silence is not golden. Take an inventory of your dog's gear and enjoy your walks more.

"(CNN) -- Futoshi Toba's wife was killed by last year's tsunami but as a father of two and mayor of Rikuzentakata in Japan's Iwate Prefecture he has little time to grieve. Toba's daily routine starts by driving his two sons -- 13-year-old Taiga and 11-year-old Kanato -- to their elementary and junior high schools; two structures that were not affected by the tsunami and the reason they were not victims of the disaster. Fortunately for Toba the route doesn't take him past his old house where his wife perished. He says he doesn't like to see it and be reminded of his loss. Like many overstretched single parents, Toba sees his shortcomings before his successes. ""To be honest, I haven't done enough for my boys as a father,"" he says, the weariness of the year weighing on the 47-year-old's face. ""But I try to be with them when I have time."" As Mayor of Rikuzentakata, time is in short supply for Toba. The work to rebuild the town's entire downtown that destroyed by the tsunami is almost overwhelming. The cost of the damage is estimated at $1.6 billion. Much of the rubble has been cleared away but the shells of many of the larger structures still stand. The mayor has laid out an eight year reconstruction plan and recently secured funding from the Japanese government. The first three years are dedicated to mapping out the infrastructure and design of a new city, which includes moving its center to higher ground. Send in your memories of last year's disaster in Japan . Toba spends most of his days fielding questions and demands from residents, while prioritizing the endless needs of a city on the mend. He's also an advocate for the city, urging the remaining 22,000 residents to stay through the long rebuilding process. More than 1,000 people haven't heeded his call and have abandoned the city. Fumiko Suzuki is one resident who is sticking it out in Rikuzentakata. A nurse at a local hospital destroyed by the tsunami, she was in shock immediately after the disaster and recounted how she had to leave bedridden patients to drown in their hospital beds. ""The patients couldn't walk. I looked out and the wave was as high as the fourth floor window,"" she said when interviewed soon after the tragedy. ""'I'm sorry,' I told the patient, and I ran upstairs. It is the biggest regret I have."" Suzuki was set to retire this year but has continued to work in a temporary building that is the city's hospital. She lost her home and relatives in the disaster and sees little joy in giving up what's left in her life. ""One year isn't enough to heal,"" she says. ""My job is to be with people and share their pain."" Suzuki says without the survivors' personal sacrifice and determination to stay and rebuild, the town will disappear. Mayor Toba is a potent symbol of that personal sacrifice. He doesn't want to be seen as a brave man and uses his work as an escape from his terrible sorrow. ""My job as mayor takes precedence to being a father right now. I don't have time to be alone. I don't have time to feel sad or cry, which may mentally help me survive right now. ""It is hard for me to live without the person who was supposed to always be with me. I feel her telling me to work hard for this town. Someday soon my sons will look at this town and understand why their father wasn't around more.""","Mayor of city in Iwate prefecture lost wife in 2011 tsunami .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- A Bangladesh court on Sunday indicted the eldest son of a former prime minister and 29 others on charges related to alleged involvement in a 2004 deadly grenade attack on a rally led by the current prime minister, police and court officials said. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina narrowly escaped the attacks, but Ivy Rahman, the wife of Bangladesh President Zillur Rahman was among 24 killed. The attacks are believed to have been carried out by an outlawed Islamist group called Harkat-ul-Jihad al Islami. The accused include at least two ministers in the cabinet of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, former chiefs of two state intelligence services and three former inspectors general of police. Twenty-two other people were previously indicted in the attacks. Zia's eldest son, Tarique Rahman, 47, now resides in England and will be tried in absentia, said Syed Rezaur Rahman, the state prosecutor. A judge set the trial date for March 28. Police investigators say Tarique Rahman aided and abetted the Zia administration in planning the attacks and helping the assailants flee the scene. Rahman could face the death penalty if found guilty, according to the country's penal code. Since the end of Zia's tenure in 2006, Tarique Rahman is facing 14 cases on charges of corruption and extortion. Zia's youngest son, Arafat Rahman, was jailed for six years on a corruption and money laundering charge. He was also tried in absentia. Zia, who heads the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and has served twice as the country's prime minister, said political vendettas are to blame in both her sons' prosecutions. The BNP and its allies have recently demanded midterm elections and launched an anti-government movement.","Tarique Rahman is among 52 total indicted in the deadly 2004 attack at a political rally .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iranians headed to the polls Friday in a parliamentary election, marking the first nationwide balloting since a disputed vote triggered massive protests nearly three years ago. In ornate mosques that serve as polling centers, voters waited patiently in long lines to cast their ballots. Some of the centers were decorated with huge banners celebrating the achievements of the Islamic Republic of Iran. ""Elections protect the country,"" read one slogan. ""The capture of the drone was another slap in the face of the enemies of the Islamic Republic,"" declared another poster, above a photo of the U.S. spy drone that was captured by Iran late last year. ""I have voted in every election in Iran,"" said a retired university professor named Nasser Ahadi, who brandished an ink-stained finger in a ""victory"" sign after he cast his ballot. ""The fundamentalists...the group that are now governing this country will win this election,"" he predicted. Not all Iranians were enthusiastic about the election, though. ""I'm not voting,"" said a mustachioed man in a small Tehran tailor shop, who asked not to be named because of the plain-clothed security officer who stood conspicuously outside listening in on the conversation. ""I voted for Ahmadinejad before, and I regret it because he's not doing a good job,"" he said, referring to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. About 3,400 candidates are vying for 290 seats in the parliamentary election. The Islamic nation faces an escalating international outcry and Western sanctions over its nuclear program, prompting leaders to call for a higher voter turnout to establish legitimacy. Days before the vote, campaigning intensified as workers distributed leaflets and plastered candidate posters along tree-lined streets in Tehran. State television broadcast wall-to-wall programming encouraging voters to cast their ballots. ""Our progress in science and economics depends on your vote,"" slogans read in the publicity campaign that included a quote from the late founder of the nation, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, saying ""The measure of a nation is its vote."" In Iran, elections are heralded by the revolutionary regime as a popular demonstration that it enjoys the overwhelming support of the population. The Interior Ministry predicted voter turnout of about 60%, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Results from smaller precincts could be available in 48 hours, but larger cities may not have complete results until 72 hours, the news agency said. But the poll marks the first time Iranians are voting since allegations of rigging in the 2009 elections triggered mass street protests against Ahmadinejad's re-election. Security forces used deadly force to crack down on the opposition Green Movement and presidential candidates Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi were placed under house arrest, where they remain. But at a campaign rally for candidates from the conservative Principalist Front on Wednesday, one lawmaker running for re-election offered a different account of the aftermath of the 2009 vote. ""During the 2009 elections, attempts were made to use cheating in the elections as an excuse to plot against the regime,"" said Zohreh Elahian. ""Attempts were made to show the world that there is no democracy in Iran and that the people are not the ones who have the power to elect their leaders,"" she said. ""That's why the Friday elections represent the people's will to participate in determining their own future and their country's fate."" There are no candidates from the Green Movement in this year's parliamentary election. Iranian political analysts describe the vote as a contest between rival conservative factions within the government. ""The underlying issue is whether or not you support Ahmadinejad,"" said Sadegh Zibakalam, a political scientist at Tehran University. ""It's a rivalry between Ahmadinejad on the one hand and the supreme leader on the other ... not overtly, and not directly of course."" Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly supported Ahmadinejad's controversial re-election victory during the dispute over the 2009 ballot results. But tensions have flared between the two leaders over the last year, with Ahmadinejad disappearing from public view for 11 days after the supreme leader overruled his decision to fire an intelligence minister. Several of Ahmadinejad's top political allies have also been subjected to lawsuits and investigations. In the run-up to this week's vote, the supreme leader urged factions to overcome previous divisions and repeatedly called for unity. He accused the United States and its allies of trying to stop Iranians from voting, saying a high turnout would be ""another firm slap in the face of world arrogance,"" according to Press TV. ""Vigorous participation of the Iranian nation in the election will send a message to hegemonic powers and will be beneficial for the country's future,"" he said. On Tehran streets, some Iranians blamed increasingly harsh American economic sanctions for the precipitous drop in the value of the nation's currency over the last several months. At polling stations, some voters seemed to suggest there were few ideological differences between the candidates. ""I'm just going to vote out of chance. They're all good,"" a voter named Behzad said. ""It doesn't make any difference. They're all the same. All Hezbollah, religious, very nice kind people."" ""To be honest, most of the [candidate] groups are very similar,"" said Dr. Ali Reza Marandi, a former health minister and current parliament member running for re-election. He said the group of candidates he was running alongside, called the United Principalist Front, campaigned on the platform of ""Spirituality and Justice."" Some opposition activists from the Green Movement expressed despair about the election in conversations with CNN. ""What you see on Iranian TV is all propaganda. All the voters are saying, 'See, this is democracy, we are voting,' but we all know it's rigged,"" said an art student from the city of Shiraz in a phone conversation with CNN. ""These elections have been rigged since 1979 and always will be until the mullahs stop running this country into the ground. I am not voting today because my vote does not count and never has counted."" ""Moussavi and Karrubi are under house arrest, my friends and family have been arrested, jailed, falsely accused, and beaten,"" said an engineer, speaking by phone with CNN from Tehran. ""I feel like a coward that I cannot go on TV and tell the world what is happening in Iran, but what good am I to the future of this country if I am dead. I am ashamed."" About 48 million people are eligible to vote, according to state-run Press TV. Iranian officials announced the polling stations would remain open an additional three hours Friday night. Mitra Mobasherat and Joe Duran contributed to this report.","Many voters participate, but others sit it out, saying vote is ""rigged""

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted on multiple counts of child sex abuse, argued a motion for a new trial Thursday. Judge John Cleland, who presided over Sandusky's conviction and sentencing, heard arguments Thursday at Centre County court in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, but did not rule immediately. A motion for a new trial asks the trial court to re-examine issues it already ruled on in an earlier judgment. In October, Cleland sentenced Sandusky to no less than 30 years and no more than 60 years in prison for abusing 10 boys during a 15-year period. Sandusky, 68, had faced the possibility of up to a 400-year prison term. Sandusky's lawyers have argued that there was insufficient evidence to convict him, and that the court didn't allow them enough time to prepare for trial after the prosecution flooded them with documentation. Defense attorney Joe Amendola testified Thursday that he had been unprepared for the trial. But he also conceded that after reviewing the documents post-trial, he didn't see anything he would have done differently in defending Sandusky. Sandusky's legal team has also argued that certain counts against their client were too broad and should therefore have been dismissed. Opinion: Pennsylvania's suit against NCAA is absurd . Cleland could easily rule that evidence presented at the criminal trial was so overwhelming -- the victims' testimony, for instance -- that the defense's concerns would not have changed the end result, said Karl Rominger, one of Sandusky's lawyers. The eight victims who testified, now young men, said that they were boys when Sandusky forced them to engage in sexual acts with him. The acts occurred, they said, in showers in Penn State's athletic facilities; hotel rooms; and the basement of Sandusky's home, among other places. Testimony was often emotional and graphic. Jurors convicted Sandusky on 45 out of 48 sexual abuse counts. This first attempt to overturn the conviction based on ineffective counsel, a common tactic, will be tough, his lawyers acknowledged before the hearing. They said that if the court rejects it, they may launch appeals based on other arguments. ""If you win on one of the appeal issues, everything probably falls,"" Amendola has said. ""All we have to do is convince an appellate court that one of the issues we will raise is worthy of a reversal."" Amendola and Rominger have also filed a motion to have Sandusky's sentence reconsidered. The lawyers had attempted to withdraw from the case before the trial, telling Cleland the day before jury selection began that they did not feel adequately prepared and that it would be ""unethical"" for them to move forward. Cleland denied their request. The sex abuse scandal led to the firing of head football coach Joe Paterno and the ouster of the university's longtime president, Graham Spanier. Paterno died in 2012 of lung cancer. The NCAA slapped Penn State with fines and sanctions over the case, but Pennsylvania's governor announced a lawsuit last week against the collegiate athletic board, saying Sandusky's actions were a criminal matter and not a violation of NCAA rules. CNN's Sara Ganim, Josh Levs, Mallory Simon, Ben Brumfield and Marina Carver contributed to this report .","NEW: Sandusky's attorneys filed a motion for a new trial .
