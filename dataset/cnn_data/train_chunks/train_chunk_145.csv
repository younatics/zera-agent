"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel's parliament has voted to dissolve itself and schedule an election in January, setting the stage for the beginning of an intense political campaign in the Middle Eastern nation. The election is set for January 22, moved up from October 2013, according to a statement on the Knesset website Tuesday. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the early election after failing to agree on a budget with his coalition partners, saying the vote should be held ""as soon as possible"" for the good of the country. He said the election was necessary to ensure ""a responsible security and economic policy"" in the face of the economic downturn and threats to Israel's security from Iran and elsewhere. ""It is my obligation as the prime minister to put the national interest above everything else,"" Netanyahu said. ""So I have decided that it is in the best interest for the state of Israel to go to elections now and as soon as possible."" The Israeli Prime Minister said he had concluded after talks with the heads of the other parties in his coalition that it was not possible to pass a ""responsible budget with a long-term outlook"" for Israel. Researchers at the Bank of Israel predicted in September that Israel's economic growth this year would come in at 3.3%, versus 3.0% next year. Inflation through the end of the third quarter of 2013 was forecast to be 2.6%. Two coalition partners, the ultra-Orthodox party Shas and Yisrael Beytenu, Avigdor Lieberman's nationalist party, were against cuts being imposed on lower earners, including young families and families with many children. Defense Minister Ehud Barak, leader of the Independence Party, was against any cuts in the defense budget. Without those three coalition partners on board, Netanyahu had little chance of getting the budget through the Knesset.","The election is set for January 22, moved up from October 2013 .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League giants Liverpool announced plans Monday to stay at their ""spiritual home"" of Anfield rather than move to a new stadium. The north-west of England club will be working with Liverpool City Council to regenerate the area around the historic ground, which would include new housing developments. Under the proposals, Anfield will be extended from its existing 45,000 capacity to a 60,000 all-seater stadium, enabling the club to better compete with other EPL sides such as Manchester United and Arsenal. The team's U.S. Owners Fenway Sports Group are renowned for re-developing existing old stadiums, most notably the home of their Boston Red Sox baseball team, now named Fenway Park. Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre said that the decision to stay at Anfield rather than move forward with previous 10-year-old proposals for a new ground at Stanley Park, had been heavily influenced by the owners and the club's 120-year history. ""I think this is the spiritual home of Liverpool Football Club,"" he told the club's official website. ""We've had some of the greatest triumphs in our history here, so it makes sense if there's a right solution that this is the place we should continue to play our football."" Criminal proceedings launched in 1989 Hillsborough Stadium crush . The Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, told a press conference Monday that the local authority had developed a ""good, honest relationship and partnership"" with Fenway Sports Group. He announced that the council had secured a $40 million grant to regenerate the area around the stadium, with further investment likely to be achieved. Anderson said he had visited Boston to see the Fenway Park development and meet Liverpool's owners John Henry II and Tom Werner, who took control of the club two years ago. They replaced the previous American pair of Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr. with widespread approval from Liverpool fans. Ayre said the announcement was a ""huge step forward"" but warned that it was subject to the ""right financing solution"" and the UK planning process. Liverpool dominated English football in the 1970s and 1980s, winning 11 league titles and seven trophies in European competition. But in recent years they have played second fiddle to arch-rivals Manchester United. Their success in the English League Cup last season was their first trophy since 2006, but was not enough for manager Kenny Dalglish, appointed by Fenway Group, to stay in his job. Brendan Rogers took over in the summer, but has overseen a difficult start to the season with a squad weakened by injury and departures.","Liverpool to stay at their historic Anfield ground .

"(CNN) -- In a presidential campaign laden with historic twists, the biggest shock may be yet to come: With three weeks to go, the first of two remaining debates tonight, and most Americans yet to cast their ballots, the final surprise may be that there are no surprises left. This campaign for president may be over. There is a good chance that the Denver debate was the watershed that carries this election to its conclusion. If so, Barack Obama has only himself to blame. Yes, the polls show a very close race, but the momentum has belonged to Romney since his superior showing in the first debate. Long ago, Team Obama displayed a heartbreaking lack of faith in its candidate and his prospects. Abandon hope, all ye who campaign here; they never tried to get Barack Obama re-elected president. Constrained by the paucity of their achievements and the poverty of their ideas, perhaps they felt they had no choice: We can't win, they concluded, but maybe we can stop the other guy from beating us. Obama's thin campaign only tried to stop his opponent from winning. Get instant updates on the second presidential debate on CNN's live blog . Until this last month, the president's ""This is a one-man race"" marketing philosophy was working -- but only with the assistance of an opponent who ran as if his shoes were tied together. Mitt Romney had allowed Obama to paint him as an unacceptable alternative. He also helped the president with 47% of the brushstrokes. Team Romney's inability to introduce their candidate as a good and decent man has frustrated Romney's core supporters, who've longed to hear more about their man's munificence and compassion. Romney's campaign seemed equally unable to acquaint voters with the transformational business leader who, as Ann Romney describes, has routinely done things others thought ""impossible."" All that changed two weeks ago in the pure Denver air. What millions of dollars of ads had not been able to do, Mitt Romney did for himself. The Romney who showed up in the first debate did not, as Obama had led voters to expect, have horns and tail. Instead, he was the most unexpected candidate of all: a reasonable alternative to good-hearted but flailing president. In debate one, Romney even admitted he was having fun, an emotion we were not led to think he was programmed to express. iReport: Share your questions for moderator Candy Crowley . In the presence of an acceptable Republican replacement, the only theory of the president's campaign, that voters had no choice but Obama, began to break down. Voters began to suspect there was no alternative, not to Obama, but to Romney. Suddenly, Barack Obama was the man who wasn't there. If the 2008 election was about hope and change, the 2012 contest has always about strength and certainty. In these turbulent and uncertain times, the most unacceptable quality in a leader is weakness. In one flashing moment in a primary debate, Tim Pawlenty refused to say to Romney's face what he had said absent his presence, that Romney had created ""Obomneycare."" Without hesitation, voters neutered Pawlenty. General election voters may have seen similar weakness in Obama, as he sleepwalked with unmasked indifference through his greatest political challenge. If our president wasn't equal to the defining moment of his own re-election, how can we trust him to rise to the test of fixing the economy? Now, with only three weeks to go, Obama's campaign marinades in its powerlessness. Doubts metastasize as the administration moans that no one asked the president to protect our Libyan ambassador, as if it had not been his responsibility. He's started losing female voters, treating women as no more than a constituency of sexual organs and then hiding behind his secretary of state's skirt. He pretends to protect women, Hispanics, seniors, when he cannot protect himself. Obama, Romney face big hurdle in town-hall format: Unpredictability . Debates are the most primitive moments in our democracy. In these primal contests, we test those who would lead our country. We send our gladiators into the coliseum to see if they have the authority to command an unexpected moment, satisfying our blood thirst for strong leadership. There is no bigger test. Tonight we should expect a solid performance from both men. Romney has been doing ""Ask Mitt Anything"" Town Halls for five years. On the stump these days, he connects with ease, telling stories of the people he's met, moved by their hopes and suffering. His growth is evidence that our campaign process is not only built to pick presidents but to shape them. Obama is gifted in the town-hall debate format, too. His performance against John McCain was stately; but one debate alone is probably not enough to rebuild what he has destroyed, the image of constancy and strength. Five things to watch for in Tuesday's debate . It takes only a moment to reveal feebleness. It requires many to reestablish certainty. One good debate tonight will help re-energize Obama's base but not our country's confidence in him. Whether victory belongs to Romney or Obama, we do not know but this cake may be baked: The Denver debate may have eradicated the opportunity for both candidates to change the outcome of this election. Mitt Romney may have already won this election: Even if the president has a strong performance tonight, he failed us on the economy, failed us in Libya, failed us in Denver. How can we trust that Barack Obama won't fail us again? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Castellanos.","Alex Castellanos: What if there are no more surprises in the presidential campaign?
He says the momentum since the first debate has been all in favor of Romney .

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Rafael unleashed heavy rain and powerful gusts to the Virgin Islands and threatened more areas in the Caribbean Sea late Saturday night. With sustained winds of 50 mph, Rafael could get even stronger as it bears down on several islands popular with tourists. ""Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Rafael could become a hurricane by late Monday,"" the National Hurricane Center in Miami said at 11 p.m. Saturday. At that time, the tropical storm was centered about 40 miles west-northwest of St. Marten and 95 miles east of St. Croix. Rafael was moving north at 14 mph. A tropical storm warning is in effect for a number of Caribbean isles, including the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, St. Marten, Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts and Guadeloupe. Dousing rains and steady winds in excess of 39 mph are expected in 12 to 24 hours in these places, according to the hurricane center. Puerto Rico is under a tropical storm watch, meaning such conditions are possible. Forecasters expect Rafael to dump between 3 to 5 inches of rain over the Lesser Antilles and Virgin Islands, with some pockets getting as much as 10 inches. ""These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous terrain,"" the hurricane center said. The storm could impact rescue efforts for two men and one woman whose small aircraft crashed Saturday morning about six nautical miles (7 miles) south of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad said. They were aboard a twin-engine Piper PA-23 that left St. Croix destined for St. Thomas, according to Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. Rescue crews from the Coast Guard and U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Natural Resources saved one female passenger, Valerie Jackson, who told them three others were still unaccounted for. A Coast Guard cutter ship, two helicopters and a fixed-wing aircraft have been dispatched from Puerto Rico for the search, Castrodad said. The effort continued Saturday night despite what the Coast Guard spokesman said were deteriorating conditions due to Rafael. CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","NEW: The center of Rafael passes St. Martin and is heading north .

"(CNN) -- The upcoming presidential election will likely hinge on whether voters trust President Obama or Mitt Romney to restore a robust economy. Presidents have less power over the economy than they and most people believe -- Congress, the Fed, and the economy's inherent dynamics all play major roles -- but the president can lead on key issues and set the tone for economic policy. To understand how the Romney and Obama views differ, consider two issues. The first is how to avoid the so-called ""fiscal cliff."" Under current policy, substantial tax hikes and spending cuts kick in on January 1, 2013. The Bush tax cuts, in particular, are scheduled to expire, and both domestic and military spending are scheduled to fall, under the debt ceiling deal of August 2011. Both candidates view this tightening in fiscal policy as a threat to economic recovery, but they differ on which aspects to modify. Obama wants to continue the Bush tax cuts on middle-class households but let them expire on high-income households. And Obama opposes the automatic spending cuts in general, although most observers suspect he would be open to some cuts in military spending. CNN Money: Tax deduction cap -- how much would it raise and who would pay? Romney also wants to extend the Bush tax cuts, but for all households rather than just the middle class. In fact, Romney has called for further reductions in tax rates, including those on corporate income. Romney will likely accept cuts to domestic spending while opposing those to the defense budget. Obama, therefore, will use negotiations over the fiscal cliff to push greater redistribution of income and for shifts in expenditure from military to domestic programs; Romney the reverse. Neither candidate, of course, describes his position in these terms. Obama will paint the debate over tax policy as about fairness, while Romney will say it is about promoting economic growth. Obama will defend domestic expenditure as ""investment"" in our future, while Romney will characterize much of it as waste. Regardless, the two have different priorities for taxes and spending. On the tax side, Romney's position is more convincing. Raising rates on high-income households will generate only modest revenue, and higher rates on dividends and capital gains are bad for growth. Likewise, lower corporate tax rates will boost growth. More broadly, Obama's focus on redistribution sends a chilling message to entrepreneurs and innovators, and any negative impact on growth makes the debt situation worse. On the budget, neither candidate is sufficiently skeptical of federal spending. Obama errs in believing that federal expenditure is mainly ""investment."" In reality, huge chunks -- such as drug prohibition, the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, NASA, earmarks, the Postal Service, Amtrak, foreign aid, agricultural subsidies, the Small Business Administration, along with bridges to nowhere, the Big Dig, and high-speed rail -- are wasteful. Opinion: Romney's radical economic plan for U.S. Romney makes a similar mistake for military spending. Many defense and national security activities, such as the ongoing war in Afghanistan, provision of national security for nations in Western Europe and other parts of the globe, not to mention unnecessary weapons systems, redundant military bases, and more, are difficult to justify. The second big issue facing Obama or Romney will be taming the growth of Medicare. Both candidates agree that, under current projections, Medicare grows faster than the national's overall economic output forever, which means Medicare is essentially bankrupt. Romney and Obama disagree, however, on how to fix Medicare. Obama's approach consists of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a creation of the Affordable Care Act. The IPAB will have the power to restrict Medicare expenditure, chiefly by controlling health care prices and limiting reimbursement for care deemed unnecessary or not cost-effective. Romney wants to shift most or all future Medicare beneficiaries (those currently 55 and younger) to vouchers. By limiting the rate at which the voucher amount increases over time, this approach can also slow Medicare expenditure. And if competition among insurers makes the health insurance market more efficient, vouchers can reduce spending further. Both approaches, therefore, aim to ""save Medicare,"" but in fundamentally different ways: The IPAB relies on government to decide what health care is valuable, while the voucher approach lets individuals make those choices. Of the two, Obama's has little chance of success, given the failure of similar efforts in the past. Price controls incentivize health care providers to game the system, such as by billing for extra tests, procedures, and medications. This also means that price controls will introduce myriad inefficiencies in the health care system. The Romney voucher approach has more potential, but the devil is in the details. Any voucher system must include enough insurers to generate real competition. And the definition of ""health insurance"" must be sufficiently broad that competing insurers can offer policies that genuinely limit costs. In addition, the most obvious way that insurers can lower premiums is by raising co-payments and deductibles. This would be a good outcome, since it would encourage seniors to balance the benefits and costs of health care. Yet this also means seniors would pay more, a fact not often emphasized by advocates of vouchers. Obama's and Romney's economic visions differ, therefore, on three fundamental issues: how much government should redistribute income; what kind of federal spending is worth its costs; and whether governments or markets allocate resources more efficiently. The choice is not unambiguous, but overall Romney has the better view. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Miron.","Libertarian economist Jeffrey Miron says both candidates' economic plans have flaws .
He says Romney's position on taxes is stronger, higher rates will curb growth .
Miron says both candidates try to control the unsustainable growth of Medicare .
He says Obama seeks to use government to curb costs while Romney relies on a voucher plan ."
"(CNN) -- A 28-year-old Jamaican-born man has confessed to his involvement in the stabbing deaths of an American couple on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten, a prosecutor said Wednesday. The suspect, whom authorities have identified only by his initials M.K.J., has also confessed involvement to a robbery of a restaurant last month, said General Solicitor Taco Stein. The suspect had previously denied any involvement in the killings last month of Michael and Thelma King, of South Carolina, at their oceanfront residence in Cupecoy, a beach town on the southwest tip of the Dutch island nation. Their bodies were discovered September 21, authorities said. The suspect appeared before a judge Wednesday, who granted the prosecution's request for a pretrial detention of eight days for the suspect, Stein told CNN. Investigators are now working to confirm the details of the suspect's statements and are gathering additional evidence to present in court, Stein said. A second suspect in custody in the Kings' murders has been identified as a 17-year-old man with the initials of J.C.M., Stein said. He hasn't confessed to any involvement in the slayings and will appear in court Thursday for a pretrial detention hearing, Stein said. St. Maarten is a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, whose economy is based on the tourism industry. More than 1 million tourists visit the island each year. The killings occurred in what is generally considered a safe area that is popular with tourists, according to the solicitor general. Investigators believe the murders took place during a robbery of the Kings, Stein said.

"London (CNN) -- Alex Salmond, Scotland's First Minister, is fond of saying that when the United Nations was first formed in 1945, it had just 50 members. Today, he adds, that figure has risen to almost 200. It's a nice line, although in reality the emergence of a new nation remains relatively rare. But there does seem to be a pattern emerging, in Europe and beyond. In Spain (Catalonia) and Belgium (Flanders), as well as the United Kingdom (Scotland), secessionist movements appear to be on the rise. All three have existed for decades, yet they seem particularly lively in the second decade of the 21st century. Thus Salmond, who this weekend addresses delegates at the Scottish National Party's annual conference in the Scottish city of Perth, likes to talk of Scotland's ""home rule journey"" being part of a bigger international trend. His point is clear: ""independence,"" far from being dangerous or unusual, is a natural state of affairs. Professor Robert Young, an expert in secession, says all three countries have a history of regional -- or devolved -- government (relatively recently in the case of the UK). ""I was considering the old question,"" he says, ""about whether regional government structures aid or inhibit secessionist movements. ""It seems to me that they aid them, other things being equal. The secessionist party will come to power, sooner or later, because governments become unpopular. If they then govern well, this serves as a further mobilizing mechanism."" Only recently a secessionist movement, the nationalist party ConvergÃ¨ncia i UniÃ³ first took office in Catalonia in 1980, while in Scotland the SNP formed a minority government in 2007 -- becoming a majority four years later. In Flanders the Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie, which wants gradual secession from Belgium, recently swept the board in municipal elections. This week British Prime Minister David Cameron traveled to Edinburgh to sign an agreement on the terms for a Scottish independence referendum due in October 2014. In Catalonia, meanwhile, opinion polls suggest a majority favor secession, while snap elections on 25 November are expected to return a regional parliament dominated by pro-independence parties. Secessionist movements in Spain, Belgium and the UK hinge upon a heady mix of national identity, history and economics. Catalonia and Flanders believe that they contribute more to national coffers than they get out. Scottish Nationalists make similar claims -- vis-Ã -vis North Sea oil -- although the Westminster government refutes that as too simplistic. Anecdotal evidence suggests Basque and Catalan nationalists are watching events in Scotland closely. IÃ±igo Gurruchaga, a London-based correspondent for the Basque newspaper El Correo, says Spanish politicians and commentators are particularly struck by the willingness of the UK Government to facilitate a referendum on Scottish secession. ""For Basques and Catalans who defend their right to decide their own constitutional arrangements it is seen as proof of a British 'democratic maturity' that is missing in Spain,"" he says. ""It is very doubtful that an agreement similar to the one announced in Edinburgh on Monday would be reached in Spain over the next two years."" ""Once the Scottish referendum is held and the result is known,"" adds Gurruchaga, ""it would likely have again a substantial effect on attitudes in Spain."" Young believes relations go even deeper than keeping abreast of news developments. ""Sovereigntist movements,"" he says, ""keep in close touch and learn from and encourage each other."" Indeed, in Young's home country of Canada, the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois (PQ), which recently formed a minority government in the French-speaking province, has not ruled out another referendum on secession (there were others in 1980 and 1995). The PQ also maintains links with the SNP. Visiting Paris this week, Quebec premier Pauline Marois said Scotland's quest for independence ""inspires us."" And on a trip to London last month, the veteran Catalan nationalist Jordi Pujol praised Salmond while warning that Scotland might opt for independence if the UK Government did not devolve more power. The SNP leader has clearly studied Pujol's style closely, echoing the Catalan's ""gradualist"" approach to acquiring more powers short of full independence. But while the world's nationalist leaders might monitor each other's progress, support for secession in Quebec, Scotland and Flanders remains a minority view; only in Catalonia does it appear to total more than 50%. That could, of course, change, particularly as austerity bites around the world; nationalist movements, like political parties, rise and fall in popularity. Some parts of the world might even be heading in the opposite direction. On November 6-- the same day as the U.S. presidential elections -- Puerto Ricans will vote in a plebiscite on the Commonwealth's constitutional status, choosing between U.S. statehood, independence or ""free association."" The governor, Luis Fortuno, supports statehood as the best option for Puerto Rico, currently a U.S. territory, although opinion polls are inconclusive. Even so, the United Nations would do well to at least clear some desk space in preparation for its 194th member.","Secessionist movements appear to be on the rise in Scotland, Spain and Belgium .

"(CNN) -- A judge sentenced a former Peace Corps volunteer to 15 years in prison for abusing girls under the age of 6 in South Africa while he was a volunteer there, federal officials said. The sentencing was announced Thursday in a statement from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Jesse Osmun, 33, of Milford, Connecticut, joined the Peace Corps in 2010 and worked in a nongovernmental organization's AIDS center for children whose families had suffered or died from the disease, his attorney, Richard Meehan, Jr., told CNN Thursday. Osmun volunteered as a Web designer for the center and worked with older children in a ""scout"" program. While there, Osmun engaged in sexual acts with four girls, all under the age of 6, officials said. One girl was abused twice a week over the course of approximately five months, authorities said. Peace Corps volunteer charged with sexual abuse of children in Africa . ""The way that the government has framed the case is that a teacher walked into a room that (Osmun) was in with three little girls,"" Meehan said. The teacher noticed that Osmun quickly zipped his pants and, after questioning one of the girls, the teacher found that he had exposed himself and asked them to touch him. When the program director of the NGO confronted him with these allegations, Osmun confessed to being involved with the four little girls, saying that he had touched them and asked them to touch him in exchange for candy, his attorney said. Osmun resigned from the Peace Corps and returned to the United States. The U.S. Peace Corps has called Osmun's acts ""reprehensible."" The organization was notified about the allegations against him after he returned to the United States, and it immediately contacted authorities, the Peace Corps said in a statement. Special agents from ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) directorate then worked with members of the South African Police Service and Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation to launch an investigation that resulted in Osmun's arrest on August 4, 2011, officials said. Osmun was sentenced Wednesday to 180 months in a U.S. prison, followed by 10 years of supervised release. David Fein, U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut, congratulated all investigative parties in a statement. ""Their collaborative efforts, and this strict sentence, have stopped this child predator,"" he said. The Peace Corps donated $20,000 to a fund that Osmun's family started for his victims. ""The Peace Corps is committed to ensuring that the children affected by these crimes receive proper care and treatment,"" Peace Corps Director Aaron Williams said. ""As this sentence clearly demonstrates, there will be no refuge for U.S. citizens who believe that they may victimize children outside the United States,"" said Peter Vincent, director of HSI's Office of International Affairs. ""No place is too distant or too remote to escape the attention of law enforcement."" Osmun's attorney noted that his client gave a full confession and cooperated with the court to spare the victims the trauma of a trial. Meehan attributed these actions to the judge giving Osmun a lower sentence than was recommended.","Jesse Osmun, 33, of Connecticut worked at a center for orphans in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- Should David Petraeus -- or anyone, for that matter -- lose a job because of marital infidelity? Four experts weigh in. Larry Flynt: Stop being the morality police . It's ""Zippergate"" all over again. When will Americans realize that an active libido has no effect on how someone runs a government agency? How many leaders in the past -- whether it's in politics, business or other settings -- have done a fine job in spite of having an extramarital affair? We need to cease being the morality police and accept the fact that we're all human beings. What's more, in the uniform code of military justice, adultery can be deemed a crime. As long as such archaic laws are part of any justice system, it makes it impossible to move out of the dark ages. We are living in a society where over half of all marriages end in divorce. Why should it surprise anyone that adultery is commonplace? The best thing the arbiters of decency and good taste can do is to stay out of other people's lives. The greatest right that any nation can afford its people is the right to be left alone. Larry Flynt, a prominent advocate of First Amendment rights, is chairman of the Hustler brand, which includes adult magazines, broadcasting, Internet, retail, gaming and entertainment businesses. Laura Kipnis: Our amnesia about adultery . Should David Petraeus have had to resign over an affair? We've all been reading about legendary CIA director Allen Dulles' multiple flagrant affairs, so if you turn to history for an answer, no. But adultery matters more now than it did in Dulles' day, and there's more of a social need to rake people over the coals for it. Thus we have to keep developing amnesia about how common adultery is, and about the previous 10 adultery scandals, so that we can be outraged all over again. Society needs its scapegoats, and unfortunately Petraeus offered himself up for the role. This is an incredibly pleasurable scandal. First, it's a classic downfall story, replete with powerful warriors and vengeful females -- there's something satisfying about familiar myths like this playing out in actual life. This scandal also has so much narrative complexity: It's a cautionary tale about unintended consequences and people not foreseeing the effects of their actions (Paula Broadwell's e-mails, Jill Kelley contacting her FBI pal, not to mention the affair itself, though these days that's obviously not so newsworthy on its own). You can't help wondering what elements of your own life could unravel as quickly following some misguided impulse. At the same time, you get to feel superior about the terrible judgment and irrationality of supposedly rational people. And of course it confirms a lot of stereotypes we're supposed to have put aside, about catfights, spurned destructive women, and the younger woman-aging wife problem, all of which runs counter to the various enlightened and progressive things we're supposed to think and say about gender. There's been much hypocrisy on this. You have all the news outlets running Broadwell's picture next to Holly Petraeus', more or less saying: Draw your own conclusions. Then a few days later they're all running finger-wagging articles (e.g. Frank Bruni in The New York Times) rebuking the other news outlets for focusing on Broadwell's appearance and ""well-toned arms."" My own view is that given Broadwell's tendency to showcase her physique in public appearances, it's a legitimate part of the story. Finally, there's always a certain satisfaction in exposing the powerful and purportedly virtuous. It confirms a cynical view of the world, that behind closed doors everyone is up to something untoward. Laura Kipnis is the author of ""How to Become a Scandal: Adventures in Bad Behavior"" (Picador). William Doyle: No cover-up in the digital age . The resignation under fire of David Petraeus is many things: a global media circus, a made-for-cable-TV reality soap opera, a professional disintegration, a bizarre and sad spectacle. On one level, it is also unfair, since there is no proof yet that Petraeus violated any laws in his private personal conduct. And if perpetual moral chastity were a strict requirement for public office, Washington would be a ghost town filled with chirping crickets, tumbleweed and empty offices. But Petraeus did occupy the most sensitive and potentially high-risk job in America, and there are concerns -- not yet verified, to be sure -- that sensitive information may have passed to his mistress. From a national security risk perspective, and because of the dangers of blackmail or influence by foreign powers, it's not too much for the American people to expect from a CIA director that he or she suspend such third-party relationships while in the post. I interviewed Petraeus a while back for my book. Like many others, I found him to be very helpful, responsive and enthusiastic, even though I believed that he did not turn the Iraq War around in 2007, but rather built on the momentum already established by Capt. Travis Patriquin and his Army and Marine colleagues the year before. I am sorry to see Petraeus go because he seems to be a very capable man for the job. Petraeus was America's first great digital general. He was the ultimate ""PowerPoint Ranger"" -- the nickname given by military officers to colleagues adept at giving dazzling digital presentations overflowing with data, graphics and bullet points. He was an inveterate e-mailer, famously accessible to journalists, historians and writers at all hours. So it's not surprising that he was brought down by a chain of e-mails. Perhaps Petraeus and his former colleague Gen. John Allen were addicted to e-mails on some level, but in jobs like theirs, sloppiness can be fatal. In the digital age where everything seems to have a trail, there is really no escape, no appeal and no cover-up. There's been a lot of talk from Petraeus' supporters that he did the honorable thing by quitting. The truth is, given his job and the digital world we live in, he had no choice. William Doyle is author of ""A Soldier's Dream: Captain Travis Patriquin and the Awakening of Iraq"" (Penguin) and co-author of ""A Mission from God: A Memoir and Challenge for America"" (Simon & Schuster). Noel M. Tichy and Chris DeRose: Resignation was honorable, necessary . David Petraeus is by equal account an honorable man, a great patriot and one of the most important generals in recent U.S. history. So was it really necessary for our country to lose one of its brightest intellects in the top spy job just because he had an affair? Can't you hear the laughter coming from France or Italy, where the reaction to discovery of a mistress or even a child out of wedlock is blasÃÂ©? Petraeus' resignation was as honorable as it was necessary. He didn't lose his job over infidelity. He had to either resign or be fired because he exercised poor judgment. It's that simple. Petraeus' surreptitious extramarital affair was investigated for fear he might have been the target of blackmail or revealed national secrets. As a long-time Washington insider, Petraeus was no naif about the consequences if the affair became public. The moment the man in charge of the world's most powerful spy agency engaged in the affair, he took a risk that had repercussions well beyond his personal life. His self-indulgence invited an inevitable media circus that has undermined his credibility and distracted his organization at the critical moment it faces an inquiry into the September attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Petraeus knew that his ability to stand tall before his co-workers at the CIA, the Congress or the American people had been compromised. To enable the CIA to get on with its business, he accepted the need to step aside so that his personal life didn't become the focus. Organizations are built on trust and shared values. When leaders exercise bad judgment and take actions that risk the well-being of their constituents -- even if it happens in their personal life and is not criminal -- they compromise that trust and have to go. In the business world, CEOs or top leaders at Best Buy, Stryker, Highmark and Lockheed Martin have lost their jobs in recent months because of sexual affairs. Most companies have explicit rules or require disclosure of relationships within a company. These policies are to protect employees from managers who might leverage their power to sexually harass subordinates or engage in favoritism, creating intolerable work environments. Such rules apply to all employees, but these business leaders failed to acknowledge their affairs. Some simply kept secrets from their boards of directors, while others took deliberate steps to conceal them, no doubt to protect their reputations and marriages. To Petraeus' credit, he reportedly never asked for special treatment and knew that public knowledge of his lapse in judgment would inevitably lead to his removal. Let's applaud Petraeus and thank him for his invaluable service to our country. As Americans, we seem to love redemption stories and have been so often willing to give our leaders a second chance after they demonstrate their fallibility. Petraeus will no doubt resurface in coming years and, we hope, continue to contribute to our nation's welfare. It just won't be at the CIA. Noel M.

"Grosseto, Italy (CNN) -- Described by one lawyer Monday as looking ""like he walked straight out of a GQ magazine,"" the ex-captain of a shipwrecked cruise liner faced about a dozen of the survivors he's accused of abandoning. It was the first time Francesco Schettino, 52, had faced survivors since the luxury ship Costa Concordia ran aground in January, killing at least 32 people. Schettino, 52, wore a black suit and tie at the preliminary hearing, which was held inside a theater in the Tuscan town of Grosseto. Accompanied by lawyers and technical consultants working on his behalf, the embattled former captain arrived 20 minutes early. ""He looked like he walked straight out of a GQ magazine,"" said John Arthur Eaves, an American lawyer who is representing 150 of the passengers. Schettino faces allegations of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, abandoning ship, failing to report an accident to the coast guard and destroying a natural habitat. The ship, carrying 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, turned on its side after striking rocks off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13. According to passengers' accounts, chaos ensued on the night of the shipwreck, as guests rushed to fill lifeboats and escape. Some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard, passengers said; remaining crew members seemed helpless to handle the melee. Related story: Port Authority to captain: 'Get on board damn it!' Like all preliminary hearings in Italian courts, Monday's hearing was closed to the news media. But eventually, reports about the hearing made their way out of the theater. One survivor approached Schettino at the hearing, saying he hoped the ""truth would come out soon."" The captain shook the man's hand and replied, ""Yes, the truth must be ascertained,"" Italian media reported. During the hearing, Schettino was seated on the theater stage with eight other defendants under investigation in the case, including his second in command, Ciro Ambrosio, officer Salvatore Ursino and Roberto Ferrarini, the head of the Costa Cruises fleet. Also in attendance were about 12 former passengers, some of whom contributed to the theatrical theme outside the hall, known as Teatro Moderno. Passengers turned the area around the theater into a stage for impromptu news conferences for an international group of about 150 journalists. Several German passengers said German newspapers had flown them to Grosseto. Dozens of police patrolled the area. Schettino's lawyer, Paolo Bastianini, told CNN his client had received death threats. The case centers on several questions, including why it allegedly took Schettino more than an hour to issue an order to abandon ship and why he allegedly left the vessel before all passengers had abandoned it. Related story: Luxury cruise turns into nightmare . Retired Capt. Fredrik J. van Wijnen, a friend of Schettino's and a representative of the Confederation of European Shipmasters' Associations, told reporters that Schettino felt terrible for the loss of life. Though the captain made a mistake by coming too close to Giglio, his maneuvers after the accident saved thousands of lives, van Wijnen told CNN. Schettino, who was released from house arrest in July, was fired last week by the Costa Crociere parent company, Italy's official ANSA news agency reported. He has said that he was wrongfully fired and that his actions prevented additional deaths. During the hearing, which is expected to last up to 10 days, a judge is expected to determine what evidence is admissible for an eventual trial, including the on-board ship data recorder. An attorney for Schettino raised objections about an expert and asked that the inquiry be extended while he was brought in from Jakarta, but the request was denied. Efforts to secure the wreckage are expected to be completed within 10 days, ANSA reported. The next phase will involve putting floating platforms inside the half-sunken ship. Salvagers plan to remove the wreckage by summer, it said. Journalist Barbie Nadeau reported from Grosseto; CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome; CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: Lawyer for passengers compares ex-captain's suit to fashion magazine attire .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai is calling the United States' refusal to hand over an undisclosed number of detainees a breach of an agreement that outlines the transfer of power from U.S. forces to Afghanistan. Karzai's accusation comes two months after the United States handed over Parwan prison at Bagram Air Base. The handover of the prison and detainees was considered the linchpin in a larger agreement that spells out U.S.-Afghan relations following the withdrawal of American troops in 2014. Read more: Ex-Afghan prisoner claims Bagram abuse . In a statement released Monday, Karzai called the failure to hand over all the detainees ""a serious breach of the Memorandum of Understanding."" He ordered his defense minister, attorney general and prison administrator ""to take required and urgent measures"" to ensure the complete transfer of authority. The issue has become a sticking point between Karzai and U.S. military leaders. Karzai has been adamant that all prisoners be under Afghan control, and his latest statement indicates a growing frustration with the U.S. military's resistance to surrender the remaining prisoners. Read more: U.S. holds on to some detainees during handover of prison to Afghan control . The United States ""paused"" the transfer of the detainees on the day it handed over Parwan prison in September. At the time, Karzai called the action a breach of Afghan national sovereignty. The U.S. military has not publicly discussed the specifics of the dispute. But a military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN in September that the United States was holding on to several detainees over concerns about whether Afghan authorities will properly handle their cases, and under what circumstances they might be released. Read more: Rewarding Afghanistan's torturers? The United States also is maintaining custody of several prisoners whose nationalities were not Afghan, said the military official, who was not authorized to publicly disclose the details. Roughly 99% percent of the detainees in custody were turned over, the U.S. military has said. Last year, a loya jirga, or grand assembly of Afghan elders, endorsed the continued presence of U.S. forces following the end of combat operations in 2014, though only if the two countries could agree on the transfer of prisoners, an end to night raids and lifting immunity for U.S. troops accused of committing crimes.

"(CNN) -- The Boston Children's Hospital pediatric doctor charged with receipt of child pornography was disciplined for using a school computer to access adult pornography when he was medical director at Phillips Academy boarding school, school officials said Friday. Richard Keller, 56, who is also a pediatrics clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School, was the medical director at Philips Academy for 19 years, according to John Palfrey, the head of the school. In an e-mail to faculty, staff, students, alumni and parents on Friday, Palfrey said Keller was reprimanded in 1999 for using an academy computer to access pornography that featured adult subjects, and in 2002 was reprimanded for showing an inappropriate cartoon to students. According to Palfrey, Keller was cited for ""poor management and poor judgment,"" leading the Andover, Massachusetts, school to place him on administrative probation in 2009. Palfrey went on to say that as recently as 2010, Keller sent an inappropriate voice-mail message to a colleague at the school. A claim by Keller that the school had discriminated against him was determined to be ""groundless,"" according to Palfrey. In April 2011, the academy informed Keller that his contract would not be renewed. The doctor resigned that month, the school said. ""We have no reason to believe that any of our students were involved in, or affected by, Dr. Keller's alleged criminal behavior,"" Palfrey said, adding the federal case made Thursday against Keller is unrelated to alleged misconduct at Phillips. Keller's name came to the attention of authorities after the U.S. Postal Inspection Service began a 2010 investigation into a movie production company that sold films featuring minor boys, according to the criminal complaint. Investigators conducted a review of the company's customer database and located alleged customer Richard Keller, who had two addresses listed, authorities said. Investigators determined that Keller allegedly had, on multiple occasions, purchased child pornography from the company's website, according to the complaint. Receipts and purchase summaries that were found during the investigation showed that the doctor allegedly made 19 online transactions totaling $2,695, prosecutors allege. Some of the pornographic material was sent to Phillips Academy's student medical center, according to the complaint. Authorities searched Keller's residence Thursday and seized approximately 500 high-gloss printouts of child pornography and between 60 to 100 DVDs containing films of minors engaged in explicit sexual conduct, according to court documents. A statement released by Boston Children's Hospital says that there have been no complaints by patients or family members concerning Keller's medical services. He is on administrative leave from both the hospital and from Harvard Medical School pending the results of the investigation, according to statements released by both institutions. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Keller faces a mandatory minimum of five years and up to 20 years in prison, to be followed by up to lifetime supervised release and a $250,000 fine if convicted. A detention hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. The U.S. Attorney's office told CNN on Friday Keller is hiring an attorney, but did not know who. In the interim, Page Kelley with the federal defender's office is representing him. Kelley did not return calls Friday seeking comment.

"(CNN) -- Martin Brodeur was unstrapping his goaltending pads after another victory, about to be rushed to a TV interview, when a reporter on deadline made a request. Could he answer just one quick question? ""Yes, I'm 40,"" Brodeur cracked, predicting the question before it could be asked. ""For some reason, that's a big deal."" Well, it actually is, and the reason is simple: Brodeur couldn't celebrate the milestone -- his birthday was May 6 -- because he was too busy notching another win en route to leading the New Jersey Devils to the Eastern Conference Finals. And now, as the playoffs move to the final two rounds, Brodeur has a chance to win the Stanley Cup at an age when most players already have hung up their skates and picked up their golf clubs. Turning 40 usually means collecting your gag gifts and waking up with a hangover and a realization: You're not as young as you used to be. For Brodeur, it means doing what he's done his entire adult life: winning hockey games at the highest level in the sport. No goaltender in NHL history has won more games than Brodeur: His 656 career victories are 105 more than Patrick Roy, who is second on the list. The next active goaltender on the all-time list, Roberto Luongo, has just 339, so it's a record that may never be broken. And no one has appeared in a playoff game in his teens and his 40s, which became another line on Brodeur's long rÃÂ©sumÃÂ© this week. He is the definition of longevity, and he's not just hanging on by the edge of his skates, either. Watch Brodeur's greatest saves . ""You go out, and you compete against players that are such a young age,"" Brodeur said during the Devils' second-round series against the Flyers, which they won in five games. ""I'm more than twice the age of (Devils rookie defenseman) Adam Larsson. I mean, you kind of shake your head a little bit. ""But you're able to play at a level when you're having fun and you're able to compete in a league you always wanted to play and still be able to keep going. For me, I don't take anything for granted. I appreciate every moment, especially this year. It's been awesome for me."" Brodeur has spent his entire career outside the limelight. That comes with the territory of playing in the NHL, the least popular of the four major U.S. sports leagues, and playing for the Devils, who lack the following of their rivals across the Hudson River, the New York Rangers. The Devils, despite their continued success, are rarely picked for national TV games. That doesn't diminish what he could accomplish this spring. When Brodeur won his first Stanley Cup, he was just 23. Now, if the Devils continue their hot streak through the playoffs, he could win his fourth at 40. That would be a 17-year gap between his first title and his last one. There aren't many athletes who can match that, but two who did -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Babe Ruth -- are recognized amongst the greatest in sports history. Brodeur is certainly among hockey's greatest. Along with his three Stanley Cups (1995, 2000, 2003), he's won two Olympic gold medals (2002, 2010) and the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goalie four times (2003, 2004, 2007, 2008). His ability to handle the puck behind the net changed the sport, leading to a rule change that restricted where goalies could play the puck. His critics have said that Brodeur benefited from the Devils' defensive approach for years. But his former role model -- who later became his biggest rival -- thought that argument was unfair. ""I remember in the playoffs, he once said he was facing more critics than shots,"" said Roy, who owns most of the NHL goaltending records that Brodeur doesn't have. ""I thought it was a nice way to deal with the pressure. From the outside watching him, he almost makes it look easy, but I know how tough it is."" Roy retired in 2003, when he was 37. Brodeur is in the final year of his contract but has said he's leaning toward coming back next year -- his 20th in a Devils uniform -- ""if they're going to take me back."" He said he's having too much fun to stop now. ""You have to enjoy what you do,"" he said. ""I've been here for so long that I've had different roles regardless of me playing or not playing. Just watching guys and helping guys during their careers to make the right decisions. You have to think the right way and go through hurdles for success."" The 40-year-old goaltender is doing what's he's done for two decades now: winning hockey games. About the only time he shows his age is when he counted the candles on the birthday cake from his family. There were only about 20 of them. ""Couldn't find a big enough cake, I guess,"" he said with a laugh.","New Jersey Devils goalie Martin Brodeur turned 40 on May 6 .

"(CNN) -- A zookeeper was in stable condition at a Sydney hospital Saturday, a day after she was crushed by a young male elephant during a training session. Lucy Melo, 40, is recovering in Royal North Shore Hospital -- her condition apparently steady, the Taronga Zoo said in a statement. ""We're all relieved to hear Lucy's condition remains stable, and we're continuing to provide support for her family and fellow keepers, while we continue our programs for the whole herd,"" said zoo director Cameron Kerr. The 2-year-old elephant -- known as Pathi Harn, which means miracle in Thai -- pinned Melo to a post around 11:30 a.m., according to the zoo. Two other zookeepers at a nearby stall came over, got the animal off Melo and called for an ambulance. The Sydney zoo launched an investigation, but as of Saturday it was unclear why Pathi Harn ""challenged"" the zookeeper. That young elephant and the rest of the herd are ""calm and well and in the elephant paddock as usual,"" according to Taronga. These pachyderms, in fact, are going about life as usual -- including normal daily activities. An Asian elephant, Pathi Harn showed no signs of his life while his mother was in labor for eight days before his birth -- alive and well -- at 3:27 a.m. on March 10, 2010, according to Taronga's website. Weighing in at 116 kilograms (255 pounds) at birth, he grew to 506 kilograms by his first birthday. The zoo's website describes him as a ""very happy calf who is always looking for attention."" ""Playful and inquisitive,"" Pathi Harn is often found ""sparring and wrestling"" with Luk Chai, a 3-year-old elephant at the zoo.","A 2-year-old male elephant pins a Sydney zookeeper against a post .

"(CNN) -- The Israeli navy boarded a ship and halted an attempt to break the sea blockade of Gaza on Saturday. Forces stormed the ship and took the passengers into custody. ""The boarding was carried out only after numerous calls to the passengers onboard,"" an Israeli military statement said. ""As a result of their unwillingness to cooperate and after ignoring calls to change course, the decision was made to board the vessel and lead it to the Port of Ashdod."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the military operation. ""Their entire objective was to create a provocation and blacken Israel's name. If human rights were really important to these activists, they would sail to Syria,"" Netanyahu said. The boat, named Estelle, was about 30 nautical miles off the coast of Gaza when it was stopped, said Reut Mor, an Israeli activist. Passengers were hoping to call attention to human rights in the Palestinian territory, which has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007. In addition to Mor, among those sailing are a priest and a lawmaker. ""The important thing is that they were on international waters and no one has the right to board the ship,"" said Victoria Strand, a spokeswoman for the ship. 'It is an act of piracy to board the ship in international waters."" The ship Estelle sails under a Finnish flag. ""We are following the situation very closely.,"" said Helena Tuuri, director of the Middle East and Northern Africa at the Finnish foreign ministry. ""Our clear political view, which is the same one that is held by the entire European Union, is that the blockade should end as soon as possible. It hinders the peace process and it is not helpful for the people, the blockade is very hard on the population."" The legality of boarding the ship depends on whether one believes the blockade itself is legal, she said. ""There is no clear official opinion about the international law in this case. Different experts have different opinions,"" she said. Vessels attempting to break Israel's blockade of Gaza have sparked controversy -- and violence -- in the past. In 2010, an Israeli raid on one flotilla ship, the Mavi Marmara, resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish activists, deteriorating relations between Israel and Turkey, once close allies. Israel was roundly criticized by many over the deaths. A U.N. report criticized Israel for its use of excessive force in the incident. Israel says it is concerned about the smuggling of arms to Gaza militants intent on attacking the Jewish state. Gaza is controlled by the anti-Israel Hamas militant group, regarded as a terrorist group by the United States and Israel. But activists say Israeli's embargo of goods into Gaza from land and sea punishes civilians in the tiny and densely populated strip of land along the Mediterranean coast. Israel has said any organization or state that wants to give humanitarian aid to Gaza can do so in coordination with Israeli authorities via existing land crossings into the Palestinian territory.

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court on Thursday narrowly struck down Michigan's 6-year-old ban on considering race and gender in college admissions, a ruling that the state intends to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 8-7 that the affirmative action ban, which Michigan voters passed in a 2006 referendum, violated the U.S. Constitution's equal protection laws. The ruling is the latest step in a years-long legal battle over whether the state's colleges can use race and gender as a factor in choosing which students to admit. The ban's opponents say the case could help strike down anti-affirmative-action policies in other states if it goes to the Supreme Court. Opinion: What's wrong with affirmative action -- and why we need it . ""We think this is a tremendous victory for the tens and hundreds of thousands of students who fought for affirmative action for decades,"" said Michigan attorney George Washington, who represents the By Any Means Necessary coalition that sued to overturn the ban. ""This is a tremendous day for black and Latino students in the entire country,"" Washington said. The ruling might take a while to go into effect, if ever. The office of Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, who is defending the ban, says the court's rulings take effect only when it issues a mandate, usually weeks later. But Schuette intends to inform the court that he will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, and will ask the appeals court to stay its ruling until the high court can review the case, Schuette spokeswoman Joy Yearout said. Schuette plans to file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court within 90 days, his office said. ""(The ban) embodies the fundamental premise of what America is all about: equal opportunity under the law,"" Schuette said in a news release Thursday. ""Entrance to our great universities must be based upon merit."" A three-judge panel from the same court made a similar ruling on the ban last year, 2-1. Schuette then asked the full court to consider the case, leading to Thursday's ruling. The ban was passed in a 2006 referendum, with 58% voting yes. It was added to the state's constitution, barring publicly funded colleges from granting ""preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin."" 5 things to know about affirmative action . That prompted a series of lawsuits and appeals from various groups. In Thursday's ruling, Judge R. Guy Cole wrote that the ban illegally gives minorities fewer ways to persuade colleges to adopt a ""race-conscious admissions policy"" than people have to influence colleges on other aspects of admissions. ""A black student seeking the adoption of a constitutionally permissible race-conscious admissions policy ... could do only one thing to effect change: She could attempt to amend the Michigan Constitution -- a lengthy, expensive and arduous process -- to repeal the consequences"" of the ban, Cole wrote. On the other hand, a student could do several other things to persuade a college to alter its admissions policy to favor applicants' alumni connections, including lobbying the admissions committee or petitioning the university's leaders, Cole wrote. ""The existence of such a comparative structural burden undermines the Equal Protection Clause's guarantee that all citizens ought to have equal access to the tools of political change,"" Cole wrote. Michigan voters approved the ban after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that while Michigan universities could use race as a factor in choosing which students to admit, they could not make race the determining factor in deciding whether applicants are accepted . The referendum effort was led by Jennifer Gratz, who was at the center of the high court case. As a white student, she was put on the waiting list for undergraduate admission to the state's largest university. She eventually attended another school, and became the lead plaintiff in a subsequent reverse discrimination lawsuit. After the Supreme Court's 2003 decision, she began a public campaign to end racial preferences in admissions. Affirmative action: Good or harmful? The Michigan ban also prohibits the state from considering race and gender in public hiring and public contracting decisions. But Thursday's ruling deals only with the college admissions portion, Yearout said. Efforts over decades to create a diverse classroom have been controversial. The Brown v. Board of Education high court ruling in 1954 ended segregation of public schools, but sparked nationwide protests and disobedience by states who initially refused to integrate. In 1978 in the so-called Bakke case, the Supreme Court ruled universities have a compelling state interest in promoting diversity that allows for the use of affirmative action. That issue involved a reverse discrimination claim by a white man denied admission to law school. The issue in recent years is whether and when affirmative action programs would eventually have to be phased out as the goal of obtaining diversity is met. The Supreme Court is considering whether the University of Texas' admissions practices aimed at creating campus diversity violate the rights of some white applicants. Washington said he hopes that the Supreme Court takes the Michigan case. He said he hopes that if it rules against the ban, it also would strike down some other states' rules against affirmative action, such as those in California that do not allow race considerations in college admissions. Opinion: Keep affirmative action but reform it . CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Michigan voters had approved ban on considering race, gender in college admissions .

However, Jamaica's Olympic champion is not Black Caviar. Black Caviar is the epitome of a modern sporting superstar: athletic, invincible, marketable. The only thing out of the ordinary about this athlete is that she is a horse. The world's most popular racehorse has arrived in England to compete at this month's Royal Ascot -- arguably the world's most recognizable race meeting and avidly watched by the Queen of England. The queen of the turf made the long journey off the back of an undefeated career of 21 wins in 21 starts in her native Australia. She has inspired a fanatical following in the sports-mad country, where she has her own Twitter account, Facebook page, blog and shop, where fans can purchase such necessities as Black Caviar's own-brand shampoo (How do you keep your tail so shiny?) As such, the horse has been accorded VIP status for her first trip away from her home country; most ""air stables"" (the adapted cargo pallets which routinely transport racehorses around the world) accommodate three animals. Sometimes, just two horses travel together, a sort of equine business class. One horse per stall is considered first class. Black Caviar made the 30-hour journey solo, the only horse on the plane. Royal approval: Will unbeatable Black Caviar grace Ascot? Boarding the jet in her now-famous body suit (inspired by the compression suits used by human athletes such as Aussie hurdler Sally Pearson), Black Caviar -- who is affectionately known as ""Nelly"" -- was accompanied on the flight by her personal track rider and veterinary surgeon to make sure she remained relaxed during transit. The overseas tour has inevitably drawn comparisons with Phar Lap, the legendary New Zealand-born stayer who became one of the earliest stars of the television age when he traveled to the Americas to seek his fortune after dominating Australian racing in the early 1930s. But even Phar Lap never commanded the frenzied attention that accompanies Black Caviar's every move. When she took her first tentative steps off the Singapore Airlines 747 at Heathrow last week she was probably only dimly aware that she had flown into the biggest media circus the racing world has seen since the days when the Francois Boutin-trained Arazi drew crowds of reporters from both sides of the Atlantic when embarking on his three-year-old campaign in Europe in 1992. Black Caviar cannot be said to be unaccustomed to the attention; thousands of fans flock to see the wonder mare every time she races, many dressed in her signature salmon and black silks (the distinctive black dots represent the ""caviar"" in her name). It's a scene that is likely to be repeated when she makes her English debut in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot on June 23, when a record crowd of 80,000 people is expected to pack the Queen's racecourse. A sizable Australian contingent will be out in force, but for once it won't be the ubiquitous gold and green colors that accompany Australian athletes of every stripe as they exert their sporting dominance around the world, but salmon and black. Get ready, Royal Ascot -- the queen of racing is coming to you.","Black Caviar arrives in England to compete in Royal Ascot next week .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian authorities have charged seven Coptic Christians living in the United States and a Florida pastor with insulting Islam and inciting sectarian strife for their alleged links to an online video that has enraged much of the Muslim world. Egypt's public prosecutor announced the charges Tuesday, the latest development in the deadly backlash against the low-budget, amateurish 14-minute movie trailer produced privately in the United States and posted on YouTube. The clip from ""The Innocence of Muslims"" mocks the Muslim Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer. Belief: Controversy shines light on Coptic Christianity . ""Innocence of Muslims"" was an obscure Internet video until September 11, when rioters, seizing on it, breached the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. Protesters also attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, killing U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The charges -- largely symbolic because the accused all live outside Egypt -- name alleged filmmaker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, who is identified by Egyptian officials as Elia Bassili. Reports that Nakoula is a Coptic Christian have raised concern about a possible backlash against the minority religious group in Egypt, where tensions between Copts and Muslims have risen recently. Egypt also charged Morris Sadek, who is believed to have posted the clip to YouTube. The Florida pastor charged is Terry Jones, who was allegedly contacted by the filmmaker to help promote the video. Jones sparked some protests in Muslim countries last year when he staged a trial of Islam at his church. The others accused were identified as Morcos Aziz; Fikri Zokloma, also known as Esmat Zokloma; Nabil Bissada; Nahed Metwali; and Nader Nicola. Aside from Nakoula, who lives in California, and Jones in Florida, it was not clear where the others live in the United States. Opinion: Anti-Islam video does not represent Coptic community . In addition to charges of insulting the Islamic religion, insulting Mohammed and inciting sectarian strife, all eight are charged with harming national unity and spreading false information, according to Adel Saaed, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. Egyptian authorities added the names to their airport watch list. Prosecutors said they will ask the international police agency, Interpol, to add the names to its wanted lists. U.S. authorities would also be contacted, according to prosecutors. Although Washington has made it clear that it did not sanction the film, a week of protests have rippled from Morocco to Malaysia, spurring U.S. officials to increase security at diplomatic missions and demand other governments to take action. Sherif Doss, head of the Egyptian Coptic Association, said the accused Copts have created their own ""cult-like"" organization in the United States, have appointed their own minister and are ""disregarding any church or religious norms."" Here are the latest key developments: . Call to kill Americans . As part of the fallout from the video, al Qaeda's affiliate in North Africa on Tuesday urged Muslims in the region to kill U.S. government representatives and called the death of Stevens a ""gift."" ""We encourage all Muslims to continue to demonstrate and escalate their protests ... and to kill their (American) ambassadors and representatives or to expel them to cleanse our land from their wickedness,"" said the statement from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The group called last week's killing of Stevens ""the best gift you (can) give to his arrogant and unjust administration."" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland reiterated the Obama administration's stance that video, which she called ""reprehensible,"" was no justification for violence. Actor: Maker of anti-Islam film 'was playing us along' The man behind the anti-Islam film . Video purportedly shows Libyans rushing to aid Stevens . Investigation into ambassador's killing . U.S. and Libyan officials have held a series of high-level meetings to ""assess what went wrong"" in Benghazi, a senior Libyan official said Tuesday. Some of the U.S. officials had flown in for the meetings, which included security experts. Following the attack, Libya suspected an increase in U.S. drone activity over eastern portions of the country and were worried the Obama administration would take military action because of domestic political considerations, the official told CNN. Mohamed al-Magariaf, newly elected president of Libya's parliament, spoke with the White House ""to contain the situation,"" the official said. The official said the government urged the Americans to work together ""in full partnership"" because any military action during this ""fragile and sensitive situation"" would give ""an excuse"" to the two main threats to the state: extremists and loyalists to the deposed Gadhafi regime. The official expressed concern with the deteriorating regional picture. ""They (the United States) are losing Egypt, if they lose Libya ... they and we cannot afford to lose our partnership."" CNN correspondent Brianna Keilar pressed the White House on Tuesday on whether the Libya attack was planned or spontaneous. ""We saw no evidence to back up claims by others that this was a preplanned or premeditated attack,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""But there is a lot that is under investigation here, and as more facts come to light, if they change that assessment, we'll make that clear."" Libya has taken steps to arrest those responsible for last week's deadly consulate attack, bringing in dozens for questioning over the weekend, Libyan officials said. The exact number of arrests was unclear. One Libyan official said those arrested included suspects from Mali and Algeria as well as al Qaeda sympathizers. Ambassador's last moments . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that FBI agents had arrived in Tripoli. They had delayed entering the country a few days while the situation remained especially volatile. The United States is looking at security at all diplomatic posts and will augment it at specific locations if necessary, Clinton told reporters. Where Obama, Romney stand on foreign policy challenges . Fareed's Take: Protest images do not tell the whole story . Media for Christ leader says he was duped . A man who allowed his studio to be used for 10 days for the making of ""Innocence of Muslims"" said he was misled by the person behind the film. Joseph Nassralla, president of Media for Christ, based in Southern California, said the ensuing controversy over the anti-Islam film brought him death threats and forced him into hiding. In a statement, Nassralla criticized Nakoula, the alleged filmmaker. Nakoula told him he was making a movie about Christian persecution that ""would examine the culture of the desert and how it is related to what is going on right now,"" said Nassralla. ""Nakoula altered the film without anyone's knowledge, changing its entire focus and dubbing in new dialogue ..."" said Nassralla, who who also runs a satellite TV station in Los Angeles. ""The final product ... bore no resemblance to the film I thought he was making, or the film the actors thought they were creating. We were shocked."" Nakoula denied that he made the film, according to Bishop Serapion, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Diocese of Los Angeles, citing a phone conversation with him last week. At a news conference Monday, the Coptic leader condemned violence by protesters which, he said, ""only serves to continue the hate."" Nassralla said his interest is calling attention to ""bloody persecution of the Copts."" He said his only involvement in the finished film was allowing use of his facilities. Nassralla's statement was provided to CNN by blogger Pamela Geller, who posted it on her website after receiving it from Nassralla. Geller is author of ""Stop the Islamization of America."" Suicide attacks in Afghanistan . Taliban-allied insurgent groups claimed responsibility for two suicide attacks that killed 13 people, including eight South Africans, in Afghanistan. The first attack was a response to the film, one of the groups said. Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, a group allied with the Taliban, said a 22-year-old woman drove a car packed with 660 pounds (300 kilograms) of explosives into a van on a road leading to Kabul International Airport. Eleven others were wounded in the attack, the Afghan Interior Ministry said. In Kunar province, the Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide attack that killed an Afghan civilian and wounded four people, including three International Security Assistance Force troops, according to Wasifullah Wasifi, a spokesman for the provincial governor's office. State Department spokeswoman Nuland on Tuesday described the first Afghan attack as ""piling on."" ""We are seeing a lot of extremist activity trying to exploit the sentiments from this video to gin up folks to violence and try to use that as an excuse for things that might otherwise have been planned for their otherwise rejectionist agendas,"" Nuland said. ""So, that is very concerning, this sort of spoiler, pile-on agenda that is happening now."" The escalating tensions have spilled into NATO military operations in the central Asia nation, prompting the alliance to order its troops to adjust joint operations with Afghan security forces to minimize attacks on them by their local allies. ""Recent events outside of and inside Afghanistan related to the 'Innocence of Muslims' video plus the conduct of recent insider attacks have given cause for ISAF troops to exercise increased vigilance and carefully review all activities and interactions with the local population,"" a spokeswoman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. The operations with Afghan forces could increase as the ""threat level"" goes down, she said. More protests . â¢ About 100 demonstrators gathered Tuesday near a U.S. diplomatic facility in Medan, Indonesia, the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta reported on its website. Indonesian authorities were deploying about 150 police officers to the Medan protest and adding security outside the U.S. facility in Jakarta, although no protests were taking place there, the embassy said. â¢ In Indian-administered Kashmir, a general strike flared, shutting down businesses, public transport and most government operations, with reports of sporadic violence. A coalition of religious parties and separatist groups called the strike as a protest against the video. â¢ In Thailand, a peaceful crowd protested in heavy rain in front of the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok for about 90 minutes Tuesday, the Bangkok Post newspaper reported. No violence was reported, the newspaper said. U.S. officials were aware of the planned protest and made plans to close the building to the public and send home nonessential personnel, the embassy said on its website. â¢ In Iran, students at universities staged protest rallies Tuesday against the film and the United States. They chanted ""Death to the U.S."" and ""Death to Israel,"" the semiofficial Fars News Agency reported. Opinion: Should Google censor film?

"(CNN) -- When waking up this morning in France, one could be forgiven for not knowing that French celebrity magazine Closer had crossed the Rubicon and published topless pictures of Kate Middleton, wife of Prince William, heir to the British Crown. No mention on early morning radio shows or television news bulletins, nothing on the national daily newspapers' websites. It is in fact the British furore over the publication which slowly made France aware of the shocking faux pas. In an interesting cultural twist, the British media suddenly discussed the outrageous breach of the Royals' privacy by French photographers, invoking the fate of late Princess Diana in Paris, at the hands of French paparazzi. British commentators seemed to be forgetting a little too quickly perhaps that Britain boasts the most intrusive tabloid and celebrity press in Europe, one which never shies away from divulging, and often making up, stories about public figures' intimacy. And while there is a right to privacy in Britain under the human rights act, the law is much stricter in France. In that country, privacy laws protect people from such intrusion and there is no doubt that if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge do sue, they're likely to win their case. Only last week, ValÃÂ©rie Trierweiler, partner of French President FranÃÂ§ois Hollande, won a string of cases against publications having showed her in a bikini this summer. However, the rise of the celebrity press in France since the introduction in 2005 of magazines such as Closer, -- the French edition is published by Italian company Mondadori, part of the Berlusconi empire -- has proved that French readers have a taste for gossip too. With a weekly circulation of 400 000, Closer is a natural heir to France's first gossip magazine, German-owned Voici introduced in 1981. Many in Britain may add that France has in fact a much older tradition: Look at Paris Match, the world's oldest celebrity magazine. Paris Match, a political and current affairs magazine, has indeed a keen interest for public personalities, but keeps away from the salacious unlike publications such as Closer. Paris Match also publishes serious political reportages. The problem of the celebrity press in France lies in the fact that magazines such as Closer, knowing all too well they'll be condemned and fined for invading people's lives, take it into account from the beginning and provision all legal costs in advance. In short, their success is such that they can afford paying hefty fines every week. They also tend to target foreign personalities, American or British, as their lives have already been invaded by sister publications in their respective countries and they are less inclined to sue. French celebrities whose privacy has been invaded tend to react, fast and furious, and sue straight away, well aware of their rights. No doubt, the French public at large will have sympathy for the royal couple especially as their intimacy was breached in France while they were having some time off before embarking on a tour of Malaysia on behalf of the Queen. As a nation as a whole, they value privacy and everyone's right to it, powerful or not. However, they may take the British media's attacks less kindly and brand it hypocritical. They remember how, only just a few weeks ago, Rupert Murdoch's The Sun justified publishing the pictures of a naked Prince Harry in a Las Vegas luxury hotel in the name ""of public interest."" If the British media is keen to protect the young royal couple from the paparazzi's glare, perhaps they could start at home. A spokesman from St James's Palace declared: ""We believe a red line has been crossed."" The red line is crossed every time somebody's privacy is invaded, royal or not. After Diana: Why no privacy in France?","Agnes Poirier: UK commentators forget Britain boasts most intrusive press in Europe .
In France stricter privacy laws protect people from such intrusion, she says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The oldest known surviving copy of the New Testament gets the modern touch Thursday when parts of it go online for the first time. The full manuscript of the Codex Sinaiticus will be online a year from now. The British Library plans to begin publishing the Codex Sinaiticus, a 4th century text handwritten in Greek, on its Web site. The Gospel of Mark and the Book of Psalms go online Thursday. The full manuscript is to be online in a year. Translations of the Codex Sinaiticus have long been widely available, but publishing images of the manuscript online will let anyone see pages that, until now, have been viewed in detail mainly by academia. As the Web site becomes operational, it will show photographs of each page of the text, with links to translations in English and German. There will also be a search function. ""It contains the earliest complete copy of the New Testament,"" said Scot McKendrick, the head of Western Manuscripts at the British Library. While the Codex contains all of the New Testament, it also includes part of the Old Testament and originally contained the entire text of the Christian Bible. The manuscript also includes the Apocrypha, 14 disputed books of the Old Testament that are usually omitted from the Protestant Bible. It also includes two early Christian texts: the ""Epistle of Barnabas"" and the ""Shepherd of Hermas."" The library announced plans three years ago to digitize the 1,600-year-old book, a tough job since pieces of the manuscript reside in four countries. ""It was a challenge, but it was ... also very exciting,"" said Juan Garces, the curator of the project. Photographers took digital pictures of the text in United Kingdom, Russia, Germany and Egypt to put the entire manuscript online. ""It unites something that belongs together,"" he said. The complete text once was housed at the Monastery of St. Catherine in Sinai, Egypt, before it came to the attention of a German scholar, Constantine Tischendorf, in the 19th century. He took parts of it to Germany and Russia. The British Library later bought several hundred pages from the Russians. Digitizing the text is a windfall for scholars, but the main goal was to make the Codex available to everyone. ""It makes it accessible, and it opens up to anyone who can access it via the Internet,"" Garces added. Eventually, the manuscript will be translated into Russian and modern Greek. ""The user will come to the Web site and will be able to look at images of each page of Codex Sinaiticus, will be able to zoom in and out and look around the page and see the page lit in standard light."" Garces said.","British Library plans to publish world's oldest surviving Bible online .

"(CNN) -- A female zookeeper was seriously injured Friday after being ""pinned"" to a post by a young male Asian elephant during a routine training session at Sydney's Taronga Zoo. Two other keepers rushed to the woman's aid after they heard her cries and moved the elephant away, the zoo said in a statement. The woman was taken to hospital in a critical condition, but is now stable in intensive care. She has not been identified out of respect for her family's privacy, the zoo said. The elephant involved was a two-and-half-year-old male calf called Pathi Harn, which means ""miracle"" in Thai. The calf was given the name after being born alive, even after experts pronounced him dead in the womb following a difficult eight-day labor. The calf -- initially referred to as ""Mr Shuffles"" due to his odd gait -- was conceived by artificial insemination as part of the zoo's elephant breeding and conservation program. At the time of his birth in March 2010, the young male weighed 116 kilograms and one year later tipped the scales at just over 500kgs. The zoo said it doesn't know what provoked the calf. ""It's unknown at this time why the young elephant challenged the keeper. The public were not at risk at any time and the elephants are now in their paddock at the zoo."" WorkCover, a New South Wales government agency ""promoting productive, healthy and safe workplaces,"" is investigating the incident. ""Initial enquiries indicate that the zoo keeper suffered serious crush injuries while working in the elephant enclosure,"" the agency said in a press release. The Sydney zoo is home to eight elephants, some of whom have rehabilitated from domestic elephant camps in Thailand. According to the zoo's website, their enclosure includes deep and shallow swimming pools, mud wallows, sleeping mounds, shaded areas, scratching posts and logs. Every morning, ""the elephants and keepers walk around the exhibit paddocks and in the Zoo grounds for exercise and physical activity,"" the website said. It added: ""A scientific study conducted during 2006-2007 found that Taronga Zoo's elephants had an activity profile that closely matched behaviors, exercise and foraging activities of wild elephants."" The World Wildlife Fund estimates that there are around 30,000 Asian elephants left in the world. Of those, nearly 30% are in captivity.","Zookeeper crushed after elephant pins her to post in Australian zoo .

"(CNN) -- A year ago, Libyans celebrated the death of dictator Moammar Gadhafi. I wrote then that despite enormous challenges, the country's prospects were actually pretty good. Its small, relatively well-educated population and abundant oil wealth certainly gave it a leg up on neighboring Egypt, which has to make its transition under dire economic circumstances. Libya's path was never going to be easy, but its trajectory since Gadhafi's death has defied the worst predictions of chaos and civil war. The Transitional National Council, headed by Mahmoud Jibril, oversaw the first phase of transition. It managed to bring all of Libya's factions to the bargaining table, crafted an electoral law and held successful elections on July 7. Despite security concerns, some 3,700 candidates contested 200 seats with a minimal violence. Turnout was high among the 1.8 million Libyans who registered to vote in the country's first election since 1965. Bucking the Islamist tide that swept Tunisia and Egypt, Libya's secularists fared well, with the relatively progressive National Forces Alliance winning 39 out of the 80 seats. News: Rights group recounts Gadhafi's last bloody moments, calls for justice . There has also been a flowering of civil society in a country that for decades had almost none. Dozens of new organizations focusing on issues such as democracy building, the environment and women's rights have formed in the past year. Some groups played an important role in advocating for a female quota in the electoral law. As a result of that preference -- which required political parties to alternate male and female candidates on their ballots -- women won 33 of the 200 seats. And thousands of Libyans shared their opinions of the draft law through the council's website and phone line and through social media. Libyans went from being barred from any kind of organized activity outside the reach of Gadhafi's network to creating a rich civic dialogue in a matter of months. But Libya faces profound challenges, most notably the threat from armed militias that still control parts of the country. Some of those militias adhere to radical, jihadi ideologies. The terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi in which four Americans died, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, is a stark reminder of the danger posed by heavily armed militias and extremists. The government's inability to bring these militias under state control has contributed to an environment of lawlessness. Gadhafi timeline: A long 8 months in Libya . Much of the violence is fueled by bitter tribal rivalries. Over the past few weeks, competing militias have fought to take control of the town of Bani Walid from Gadhafi loyalists. In some places, the militias are given free rein by a government that cannot provide security. The prevalence of weapons -- many of them looted from Gadhafi's arsenals -- makes things worse. Still, especially after the Benghazi attack, thousands of Libyans have protested the rise of the militias, demanding that the government disarm them. Undoubtedly, this is an important inflection point in Libya's transition -- a moment when the government must rein in the militias or see them become more deeply entrenched, more emboldened and harder to dislodge. Photos: A silent Libya after Gadhafi . Libya's next challenge is the writing of a new constitution, and it has set itself an ambitious, perhaps impossible, timeline of a draft within 60 days of the constitutional committee's first meeting. The country needs time to debate the big issues, and the more actively involved a broad cross-section of civil society is, the better the outcome. As is true in Egypt and Tunisia, religion will be a flashpoint in the constitution. Already, various groups are pressing to make Islam a central source of law, while others are trying to restrict the role of religion. How Islam is reconciled with human rights in general, and women's rights in particular, will be a litmus test for which path forward Libya chooses. The division of power between the central government and the regions will also be critical to resolve, especially since significant oil resources are at stake. Libyans rightly fear a scenario of civil war fought along regional lines, reminiscent of the tragedy in Iraq. Clearly, Libya must overcome many political pitfalls and security challenges before it can successfully emerge from its transition. But it has already made significant progress with a legitimate first election, a flowering of civil society and a briskly recovering economy. The United States should continue to support the Libyans with technical assistance, capacity building, military intelligence and critical training of security forces.

"(CNN) -- Five workers at an Idaho dairy have been fired after an undercover video by animal rights activists showed mistreatment towards cows, the dairy owner said. Three of the workers have been charged with misdemeanor cruelty to animals, according to Twin Falls County District Court records. Luis Bettencourt, owner of Bettencourt Dairies, told CNN his family-owned operation of 30 years was ""appalled"" at the video -- which the Mercy for Animals group says depicts workers and supervisors ""violently hitting, stomping on, punching and kicking cows in the face and body."" The Idaho Department of Agriculture informed the dairy of the tape about five weeks ago, and Bettencourt fired all the individuals filmed in the mistreatment, he said. Since then, the business has installed video cameras to watch employees, he added. Opinion: Farmers aren't evil. Now can we have a civil conversation? ""We are all devastated by it. We are family owned and we love our cattle,"" Bettencourt told CNN. ""It's something we don't allow, and it's been a hard five weeks."" Bettencourt Dairies, based in Wendell, Idaho, has 13 milking facilities with about 60,000 cows and about 500 employees, its website says. The video was taken at the firm's Dry Creek Dairy site outside Hansen, Idaho, where about 10,000 Holstein cows are kept, the animal rights group said. All 500 employees at 11 dairies have seen the video, and each has signed a document about zero tolerance on animal abuse, Bettencourt said. The workers who have been charged are Jesus Garza, 24; Jose Acensio, 28; and Javier Victor Rojas Loayza, 39. Previously on CNN.com: USDA suspends slaughterhouse after video appears to show animal cruelty . Kraft Foods said the dairy provides milks to a supplier, which processes raw material for Kraft, spokeswoman Angela Wiggins said in a statement. ""While Kraft does not raise dairy cows or have milking operations, we want animals to receive proper care and be treated with respect. We have long believed high-quality dairy products begin with quality animal care,"" Wiggins said. ""Kraft condemns the handling behaviors shown in this video as they are both upsetting and unacceptable,"" she said. Burger King Corporation said the Bettencourt Dairies ""may be an indirect supplier of a small percentage of cheese products"" used in the chain's U.S. restaurants, spokesman Bryson W. Thornton said in a statement. ""Burger King Worldwide does not have a direct relationship with Bettencourt Dairies,"" Thornton said. ""Burger King Worldwide estimates that a fraction of our dairy products, less than 1%, could have originated at the Bettencourt facility where the video that depicts inhumane treatment of dairy cows was allegedly filmed.""

"(CNN) -- Police arrested a man Friday on suspicion of murder in the case of April Jones, a 5-year-old girl abducted in Wales four days ago. Suspect Mark Bridger, 46, had previously been arrested on suspicion of her abduction. Police continue to search for April, who has been missing since Monday evening, when she was snatched from a street near her home in Machynlleth, in a remote corner of mid-Wales. However, the hunt is now presumed to be for a body rather than in the hope of finding April alive. The case, which Prime Minister David Cameron described as ""every parent's nightmare,"" has gripped the British media. Bridger remains in custody and continues to be questioned, said Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan, of Dyfed-Powys Police. Bevan appealed again for the public to come forward with any information on the movements of Bridger or his vehicle between Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon, when he was first arrested on suspicion of abduction. Hundreds join desperate search . April's family has been told about Bridger's arrest on suspicion of murder, he said. Superintendent Ian John told reporters that the ""dynamics of the search have changed"" and that only specialist teams would now be involved. Scores of local volunteers from the small, close-knit community had been helping police and mountain rescue teams hunt for the girl in the town and surrounding hilly and wooded countryside. April's parents spoke Tuesday of how the abduction of ""our beautiful little girl April"" had ""shattered"" the family. Cameron added his voice to the appeals of April's family and police Thursday, when he urged anyone with information that might help find her to come forward. There has been no trace of the pretty brown-haired child since she was last seen Monday evening, climbing into a vehicle that then drove off. She had been playing on her bicycle with a friend.

Prime Minister Najib Mikati, a billionaire supported by Hezbollah, announced Saturday that he plans to stay in power, despite having offered his resignation to appease those who claimed al-Assad was behind Friday's car bombing that killed Lebanon's intelligence chief, Brig. Gen Wissam al-Hassan. ""To hold me personally responsible for the assassination is unfair,"" he told reporters. ""I have always respected and admired al-Hassan, who has done great things for Lebanon."" Mikati's decision to stay heads off a power vacuum in Lebanon's government, as sectarian tensions flare particularly as the effects of Syria's 19-month civil war spill across borders and threaten the region. Don't know who is who in Lebanon? A guide to key players . The senior Lebanese security official and at least nine others died in the explosion in the typically peaceful and cosmopolitan Ashrafiyeh district of East Beirut. The attack -- in broad daylight, at one of the capital's busiest intersections -- left a crater more than a meter deep and was just the kind of thing al-Hassan had worked to prevent. But beyond its potential impact on Lebanon's security, al-Hassan's life and death illustrates the deep political and religious fissures within Lebanese society, believed to be exacerbated by its neighbor's internal conflict, where at least another 123 people were killed Saturday amid fighting that has left tens of thousands dead. Saad Hariri, a Lebanese opposition leader and former prime minister, told CNN that he had no doubt that the Syrian leader was responsible for Friday's deadly strike. Hariri accused al-Assad of ""killing his own people"" and said ""he will not think twice"" about killing Lebanese in order to protect himself. ""The message from Damascus today is anywhere you are, if you are against the regime from Lebanon, we will come and get you. ... No matter what you try to do, we will keep on assassinating the Lebanese,"" said Hariri, who blames the 2005 assassination of his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, on the Assad government. Lebanon on edge after attack . Syrian armed forces opened fire from across the border on anti-al-Assad and anti-Hezbollah protesters in northern Lebanon, the Lebanese state-run National News Agency reported. The protesters burned al-Assad's effigy and Hezbollah flags before being fired upon, NNA reported, citing its reporters at the scene. Walid Jumblatt, a Druze politician and influential power broker in Lebanon's rough-and-tumble political landscape, also echoed Hariri's comments. Jumblatt told CNN he blames Friday's murder on the Assad government and has expressed concerns over his own safety. He said the Syrian-backed murderers of al-Hassan ""can hit you any place anywhere."" ""I don't feel safe,"" he added, talking to CNN in his hillside home outside the capital. When asked if he thought al-Hassan's killers would be captured, Jumblatt replied: ""Sometimes you have justice -- I mean procedural justice according to the rules, and sometimes you have natural justice when one day the killer will be killed. One day the killer will die. You just have to be patient and one day you will see your enemy floating in front of you in the river."" Under Assad, Syria has continued to influence the politics of its smaller neighbor despite withdrawing troops from Lebanon in 2005 following Rafik Hariri's assassination. Last year, Damascus maneuvered to topple Hariri's son Saad as prime minister by persuading Jumblatt to abandon the majority coalition in parliament, which left Hezbollah to play kingmaker in protracted negotiations to form a new government. Tensions have since boiled over in Lebanon following Friday's attack as enraged citizens blocked roads and clashes erupted in the port city of Tripoli between supporters and foes of Syria's government. The Lebanese president declared Saturday a day of national mourning in decrying the ""abominable crime"" in a statement. But the prime minister's failure to appear publicly after the explosion elicited criticism, including from one protester in Beirut who said, ""This government is killing us by not doing anything. It is not acting like a government. It is like a ghost government."" The U.N. Security Council also weighed in Friday, calling for ""the perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of this crime"" to be brought to justice.

"(CNN) -- Eve Arnold, known for her intimate portraits of stars such as Marilyn Monroe as well as her groundbreaking photojournalism work, has died in London, at the age of 99 Magnum Photos said Thursday. Arnold, who in 1957 was the first woman photographer to join the photo agency, became a prominent member, thanks to her talent for photographing people, whatever their background. ""Her intimate, sensitive and compassionate 10-year collaboration with Marilyn Monroe has cemented her as one of the most iconic portrait photographers of our time, but it is the long-term reportage stories that drove Arnold's curiosity and passion,"" Magnum said. CNN Photos: View some of Eve Arnold's memorable images. Born in 1912 to Russian immigrant parents in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Arnold grew up knowing hardship first-hand. She brought that awareness to her work documenting social injustice in the United States and elsewhere. It was her photos of African-American fashion shows in Harlem, New York, in the early 1950s that first caught the eye of Henri Cartier-Bresson and won her entry to Magnum, at that time a highly male-dominated environment. She became a full member in 1957. She had begun to take pictures while working at a photo-finishing plant in New Jersey in 1946 and after that studied photography with Alexei Brodovitch in New York. Arnold moved to London in 1962 to put her son through school and remained there for the rest of her life, apart from a six-year period when she worked in the United States and China, Magnum said. She was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003 for her services to photography. In the 1960s and 1970s, Arnold turned her eye to the black civil rights movement in the United States, as well as traveling widely in China, Russia and elsewhere. Behind the Veil, which documented life in Arab states, including for the women inside harems, was published in 1971. One of the first westerners to be granted a visa for China in the 1970s, her reportage work was published in the book In China in 1980. Arnold was known for the connection, and sometimes lasting friendships, she formed with those on the other end of the lens. ""If a photographer cares about the people before the lens and is compassionate, much is given. It is the photographer, not the camera, that is the instrument,"" she said. Some of her most memorable and haunting images of Marilyn Monroe were taken during filming in Nevada for the 1961 film The Misfits. Marlene Dietrich, Joan Crawford and Isabella Rossellini were also among the celebrities to pose for Arnold. Arnold wrote extensively for magazines and newspapers and published 15 monographs, notably In Retrospect, published in 1995, in which she tells the story of her own life and career. Women and the lives of those in poverty were subjects she returned to repeatedly over the decades. In her 1976 book, ""The Unretouched Woman,"" Arnold wrote: ""Themes recur again and again in my work. I have been poor and I wanted to document poverty; I had lost a child and I was obsessed with birth; I was interested in politics and I wanted to know how it affected our lives; I am a woman and I wanted to know about women.""","Eve Arnold was born in 1912 in Philadelphia, the child of Russian immigrants .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- For the second time in a week, Turkish officials searched a civilian airplane headed to Syria in what appears to be the enforcement of a new Turkish air blockade against the Syrian government. Armenian and Turkish diplomats confirmed to CNN that an Armenian cargo plane destined for the battle-scarred Syrian city of Aleppo stopped first in the Turkish city of Erzurum for an inspection of its cargo Monday morning. Also on Monday, the European Union added to Syria's growing isolation by announcing a 19th round of sanctions against the regime. One of the punitive measures bans Syrian Arab Airlines planes from all European Union airports. ""This comes in addition to an existing ban on Syrian cargo flights,"" the EU Council announced in a news release. The Armenian cargo was eventually allowed to fly on to Syria after remaining grounded and searched in Turkey for at least five hours. Read more: Report: Turkey diverting civilian planes to avoid Syrian airspace . Unlike last week's unexpected grounding of a Syrian passenger plane flying from Moscow to Damascus, the inspection of the Armenian airplane appeared to have been agreed upon ahead of time by Armenian and Turkish authorities. ""The plane is transporting humanitarian aid to Syria and its stop in Turkey was planned,"" Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Tigran Balayan wrote in an e-mail to CNN before the cargo was allowed to leave. ""An Armenian civilian cargo aircraft requested overflight permission from Yerevan to Aleppo,"" explained Selcuk Unal, a spokesman for Turkey's Foreign Ministry. ""We provided a license for use of our airspace provided they first make a 'technical landing.' "" Read more: Turkey to Syria: Don't send arms through our air space . ""We are exercising our sovereign right,"" Unal added. Last Wednesday, Turkey made a conspicuous show of force, dispatching F-16 warplanes to escort the Syrian passenger plane headed from Moscow to Damascus to an unplanned stop in the Turkish capital, Ankara. After a search of the aircraft, Turkish authorities confiscated an unspecified number of items in the plane's cargo hold that officials said were being shipped to Syria's Ministry of Defense. The Turkish government says it is a violation of international and Turkish law to transport military materials on civilian planes. The embattled Syrian government denounced the grounding of the aircraft, calling the incident an example of ""air piracy."" On Monday, Turkey's prime minister defended the decision to confiscate cargo from the Syrian plane. ""These containers that have been taken off the plane, the sender company is KBP Instrumental Design Bureau,"" Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced in a live television broadcast. ""The receiver? The Syrian National Defence Ministry. This material that we confiscated is without a doubt military equipment. Calling it radar equipment or some other type of equipment is a deflection."" The English-language website for KBP Instrumental Design Bureau describes it as a ""developer and manufacturer of high-precision weapons."" Headquartered in Tula, Russia, the company advertises itself as a manufacturer of rocket systems, tanks, artillery, and short-range air defense systems. In the wake of the search and confiscation of the Syrian plane cargo, both Turkey and Syria have closed their airspace to each others' aircraft.

The once intimate relationship between the Turkish and Syrian governments is one of the many casualties of the Syrian civil war. Since Syrian security forces first began attacking anti-government protests in March 2011, Turkey and Syria have gone from lifting visa restrictions on each other's citizens and holding joint Cabinet meetings to routinely denouncing each other. Turkey's prime minister has backed the Syrian opposition and provided a staging ground for rebels, while repeatedly calling on Syria's president to step down.

This month, escalating tensions flared yet again, when Syrian artillery killed two women and three children in the Turkish border town of Akcakale. Since then, Turkey and Syria have repeatedly engaged in artillery duels along the 900-kilometer (560-mile) border dividing the two countries. On Monday, Turkey's Foreign Ministry announced more than 100,000 refugees had now fled Syria to take shelter in Turkish refugee camps. But over the weekend, a new kind of ""refugee"" fled to Turkey. Read more: Syria's attack on Turkish plane could ignite conflict . Turkey's Foreign Ministry confirmed to CNN Turkish media reports that at least 12 Syrian soldiers, running away from clashes with Syrian rebels, escaped across the border and surrendered to Turkish border guards. ""They swam through the Orontes River,"" said a Turkish government official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss border security with the media. The Orontes makes up part of the border between Turkey and Syria. ""Some of the soldiers are wounded and are being treated in hospital. They left their weapons in Syria,"" the Turkish official continued. Unlike thousands of other soldiers and officers who have defected from the Syrian armed forces throughout the 19-month conflict, the Turkish official said the 12 new arrivals did not appear to be deserting the military. ""They wanted to escape from the fighting,"" he said, adding that the 12 Syrian troops were being kept at a separate location from other camps housing refugees and defectors.","NEW: Prime Minister Erdogan details cargo taken from plane last week .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- In first-ever tests for commercial airplanes carrying passengers, as many as three American Airlines jets will be equipped with a shoulder-fired missile defense system. The Department of Homeland Security signed a $29 million contract with BAE Systems on December 21. BAE said Thursday it is working with American Airlines to put laser systems on the planes, which will be flying between New York and California. Since the contract calls for the planes to log about 7,000 flight hours, the tests will probably last from early spring, starting in March or April, until the end of the year, DHS spokeswoman Amy Kudwa said. The systems have already been tested on cargo aircraft and out-of-service passenger planes. The new contract calls for the systems to be tested for the first time on aircraft carrying passengers. DHS, American Airlines and BAE Systems were all careful to assure there will be no test firing -- through simulators or otherwise. The tests primarily will check the systems' worthiness in air and their maintenance reliability. The system works by detecting the heat-seeking missiles and then emitting a laser that diverts the missile. Homeland Security officials say there is no specific threat of these weapons -- also known as MANPADS, for Man-Portable Air Defense Systems --  being fired at planes. Taliban forces, however, successfully used MANPADS against Soviet helicopters in Afghanistan. Terrorists tried, unsuccessfully, in 2002 to shoot down an Israeli passenger jet in Kenya with them. Insurgents hit a DHL cargo plane in Baghdad the following year, but the plane landed safely. Experts say about 500,000 to 700,000 MANPADS have been produced worldwide, and some have been purchased in Middle Eastern and Central Asian arms markets for as little as $5,000. Since 2003, Congress has pressured DHS to adapt military anti-MANPADS technology to commercial aviation. Commercial airlines have opposed efforts to install defense systems, which are costly, add weight, and can weaken the plane's aerodynamics. A chief goal of the testing program is to discover how to increase the systems' endurance. Military systems require frequent maintenance -- not practical for commercial airplanes that fly for extended periods between maintenance checks. American Airlines on Thursday  said it is participating in the program, but added it is ""not in favor of installing counter-MANPADS on commercial aircraft."" The airline believes protection is best accomplished by preventing terrorists from getting shoulder-fired missiles, or by using ground-based systems, spokesman John Hotard said. But the airline said it is willing to participate because it ""wants to understand the development"" of these technologies that might be available in the future. Last year, American and BAE installed and test flew BAE's hardware on a Boeing 767 that was not in commercial service, Hotard said.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea maintained their unbeaten run in the English Premier League with a 4-2 win over London rivals Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on Saturday. The match, which saw Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas face his former club for the first time since Chelsea sacked him in March, sparked into life in the 17th when Gary Cahill struck a stunning volley to give the league leaders the lead. That's how it stayed for the remainder of the first half before Spurs mounted a comeback in a breathless second half. William Gallas netted his first goal for Spurs two minutes after the break to bring the home side level before Jermain Defoe turned in Aaron Lennon's cross to give Villas-Boas' new team the lead in the 54th minute. But Chelsea responded superbly to the setback with Juan Mata leading the fightback with two goals in three minutes. First, a poor clearance from Gallas fell to the advancing Mata who controlled the ball instantly before guided a low shot past a helpless Brad Friedel. Chelsea had their noses back in front moments later when Eden Hazard's pass split the Spurs' defence with Mata scurrying through to put the ball in the back of the net. Spurs attempts to get back on level terms came to nothing and it was Mata once again who finally put the result beyond doubt. This time, the Spanish international turned provider finding Daniel Sturridge with a low cross which the Englishman side-footed home from close range. It completed an unhappy day for Villas-Boas against his former employers as well as bringing to an end a four-match winning streak in the league for Spurs. Chelsea remain at the top of the table with 22 points from a possible 24. Both Manchester City and Manchester United recorded wins on Saturday to remain four points behind Roberto Di Matteo's side. A Wayne Rooney own goal in the 11th minute gave Stoke City the lead at Old Trafford before the English international equalized at the other end 16 minutes later. Robin van Persie and Danny Welbeck then scored either side of the break to give United a two-goal cushion. Stoke's Michael Kightly halved the deficit in the 58th minute but Rooney scored again seven minutes later to make it 4-2, which is how it stayed. Edin Dzeko came off the bench to spare City's blushes at West Brom. Roberto Mancini's side were reduced to 10 men midway through the first half when James Milner was shown a red card for a challenge on Shane Long. The Irish striker then gave the home side the lead in the 67th minute before Dzeko came to the rescue with two goals in the last ten minutes to seal a last-gasp 2-1 win. Norwich City recorded their first three points of the season with a battling 1-0 win over Arsenal. Grant Holt's 19th minute goal -- slotting home after Arsenal keeper Vito Mannone could only parry Alexander Tettey's low drive -- consigned Arsene Wenger's side to their first defeat at Carrow Road since 1984. The win moves Chris Hughton's team up to 15th with six points while Arsenal are ninth with 12 points. West Ham United are up to seventh after thrashing struggling Southampton 4-1 at Upton Park. Liverpool also move up the table to 11th after beating Reading 1-0 at Anfield. Teenager Raheem Sterling scored his first goal for the club which was enough to earn Brendan Rodgers his first league win at home since taking over in the summer. Swansea City are one place above Liverpool after they beat Wigan 2-1. Fulham beat Aston Villa 1-0 at Craven Cottage to move up to eighth.","Spain's Juan Mata scores twice as Chelsea beat Spurs 4-2 in English Premier League .

"(CNN) -- If the first presidential debate in Denver was a game changer,Tuesday night's was not. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a spirited, heavyweight bout with several consequential moments. President Obama entered the second presidential debate needing to make up serious ground after his first debate performance. He turned around the narrative from the first debate -- that he was listless and lethargic and on the defensive -- but showing up is one thing, winning is another. Obama needed a convincing win Tuesday night, and he did not get it. Gov. Romney came into Tuesday night's debate needing to prove that his first performance wasn't a fluke -- in other words, that he wasn't Jimmy Carter in the Reagan-Carter debates, when Carter won early on but went on to get dominated by a Reagan comeback. Tuesday night Romney delivered again and proved his performance was consistent and legitimate. He has established himself as a legitimate alternative to the president. Romney was relaxed and not intimidated by Obama's newfound aggressiveness. He was responsive and flexible. He went toe to toe early on, challenging the president directly over the production of oil on government land and winning on the facts. Reality check: Oil production . One of the highlights of Romney's night was when he spoke directly to the African-American man who voted for Obama in 2008, but wondered whether the next four years would be any different if Obama were re-elected. In an encyclopedic fashion, Romney gave a litany of Obama's failed promises and failed record. Romney was at his best when he told the voters in the room to look at the president's record and policies, rather than listening to his rhetoric, and then proceeded to explain the impact of the Obama policies and what he would do differently. In what may be one of the more important political moments of the debate, Romney was asked how he would be different from George W. Bush. Romney effectively distanced himself from Bush on policy specifics, noting he would control deficit spending and champion small business, not just big business. It was an important moment to convince many undecided voters that he is not Bush 2.0. From the first whistle, Obama was stronger, more forceful, and more aggressive, no doubt to the delight of his supporters. If Obama landed punches it was because he threw a lot of them -- mainly on Romney's private equity career and tax returns. But too often his attacks seemed rehearsed and scripted. Romney's empty 'binders full of women' Furthermore, Obama spent more time attacking Romney than focusing on his own vision for the future. Obama didn't lay out a new, bold, or different plan for a second term dealing with the debt or entitlements. Romney was looking to the future; Obama was trying to remind the country of the Bush years and tie Romney to Bush. If there was a key takeaway from the debate indicative of the race going forward, it may be the heated exchange over Libya and the president's handling of the attack on our ambassador. The president was directly asked about the security in Benghazi and who declined the requests for more security in Libya. Obama didn't answer the question. Romney could have called him on it and missed a big opportunity. Then there was the most controversial moment of the night, when moderator Candy Crowley intervened to insert that Obama did in fact call the attacks that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens ""terror"" attacks in his Rose Garden speech the next day. Obama actually said, ""No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for."" There will be much parsing and spinning of these words, but Romney shouldn't have let Crowley interrupt him and assert her own interpretation. Fact check: Obama's statement on ""acts of terror"" For two weeks after the president's Rose Garden speech, Obama and his administration peddled the explanation of a spontaneous protest sparked by a YouTube video, before they finally called the Benghazi attack what it really was -- a terrorist attack. Romney should have emphasized this mishandling. He may have missed this moment, but he will have another chance during next week's foreign policy debate. Until now, the momentum of this race has been about impressions and appearance -- Romney's aggressiveness and forcefulness in the first debate versus Obama's listlessness and lethargy. In Tuesday night's debate, Obama gets points for showing up, but that's hardly something for the Democrats to be proud of. The impression Romney made in the first debate he reaffirmed Tuesday night, meaning that Obama has still has ground to make up going into the final debate next week. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Bennett.","William Bennett: Denver debate was a game changer; Long Island one wasn't .
He says the president needed to score a convincing win but fell short of that .
Bennett: Obama was more energetic, but Romney showed he's a credible alternative ."
"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Firefighters, air tankers and helicopters replaced hikers and campers in the recreation-rich San Gabriel Canyon on Monday after a wildfire forced authorities to close the area for Labor Day. Authorities evacuated the canyon Sunday after the fire broke out in Angeles National Forest, an urban recreation area near Los Angeles that is popular with hikers, campers and off-road vehicle enthusiasts. About 50 residents and 1,000 campers were evacuated, CNN affiliate KABC reported. ""I know we have some neighbors up there that didn't leave. We're really worried about them,"" evacuee Toni Kova told KABC. Kova and her husband live in Camp Williams, which was evacuated Sunday. ""We saw the smoke and the fire coming over the hill. The river is literally our front yard and the mountains that the fires were coming over,"" she said. ""We were like, we gotta start packing up."" Officials told KABC the fight was made more difficult by the steep and rugged terrain. The U.S. Forest Service in California said on its Twitter feed it expected a ""very active"" fire because of low humidity and high temperatures. Between 10,000 and 12,000 people use the area during an average holiday weekend, according to Inciweb, the government fire-tracking website. Structures in Camp Williams, a camping and recreational vehicle resort, are in danger from the fire even though it is burning to the northeast toward a wilderness area, Inciweb said. About 400 firefighters, a heavy air tanker and six helicopters are working on the blaze, which had burned through about 4,000 acres of brush by Monday afternoon, according to Inciweb. The brush, comprised mostly of chaparral, is very thick in some areas. The fire is 5% contained, the website said. Inciweb said the cause of the fire was under investigation. CNN affiliate KTLA-TV in Los Angeles, citing a U.S. Forest Service official, reported the fire began when a car caught fire.

"(CNN) -- A letter of reprimand was sent to the 911 operator who handled the emergency call from a social worker seeking help as Josh Powell killed his sons and himself in his Graham, Washington, home in February. It took eight minutes for 911 communications officer David Lovrak to send a police car, and it took an additional 13 minutes for a police car to get to Powell's home, according to the letter released Thursday. Lovrak violated several department policies and failed to recognize ""many red flags"" that should have led to a faster response, the reprimand said. Powell snatched the children from a social worker delivering them for a supervised visit, locked the doors and hacked them with a hatchet before an explosion engulfed his home February 5. The gas-fueled blast killed Powell and his sons, Charles, 7, and Braden, 5, a grisly end to a story that started with the 2009 disappearance of the boys' mother. ""You said that you have learned from this call to be more attentive to every caller and listen carefully to what they are saying and assuming nothing,"" wrote Diana Lock, the assistant director of the Law Enforcement Support Agency, which operates the 911 call center. Lovrak was confused about how the social worker, who brought the two children to Powell's home for a supervised visit, ""fit into the equation,"" the letter said. ""During the fact-finding you said that you were indeed confused and at first thought that the caller was the mother of the children,"" Lock wrote. ""You said that you regretted sounding contentious when you said 'You can't supervise yourself.'"" The operator was also criticized for responding to the caller's question of ""How long will it be"" with the answer ""I don't know ma'am, they have to respond to emergencies -- life threatening situations first."" His assumption that the caller was a mother involved in a custodial dispute contributed to the operator missing what ""appeared to be many red flags,"" Lock wrote. ""When asked about this in the fact-finding you responded that custodial interference calls typically have heightened emotions and feel like emergencies to the person making the 911 call,"" she wrote. ""You further stated that you wished you had known who Josh Powell was."" In March, investigators found Susan Powell's blood inside the family's Utah home and a handwritten will saying she feared for her life at the hands of her husband, court documents show. The documents offered a glimpse of the evidence authorities collected that put Josh Powell at the center of the investigation into her December, 2009, disappearance. The reprimand regarding the 911 call also listed factors that were beyond Lovrak's control. The 911 computers have a system to quickly identify addresses known to be related to problems, but there was no ""premise hazard"" information for Powell's home despite his history. This ""would have alerted you and the dispatcher to the need for a heightened response,"" the letter said. The appropriate discipline should be corrective, not punitive, the letter concluded. ""You have undergone local and national scrutiny, have admitted your errors, and have identified the ways you will correct and improve your call handling in the future,"" Lock wrote.","NEW: The operator was confused how the social worker ""fit into the equation,"" the reprimand letter says .

"(EW) -- After four years off of the silver screen, James Bond made his triumphant return this weekend in ""Skyfall"" â and the British spy's appeal was bigger than ever. The action thriller grossed a truly massive $87.8 million in its first three days (and an additional $2.2 million during Thursday night previews), making its debut the very best in the Bond series' 23-film history â by a huge margin. ""Skyfall"" shattered the previous opening weekend record for a Bond film, which was set in 2008 when ""Quantum of Solace"" bowed with $67.5 million. With the lucrative Thanksgiving holiday on the horizon and a straight ""A"" CinemaScore grade, it's likely that ""Skyfall"" will also become the first Bond movie to ever pass the $200 million mark at the domestic box office. (Of course, this is not accounting for inflation.) EW critics disagree on 'Skyfall' ""Skyfall's"" debut marks the seventh-best November opening weekend of all time â behind two ""Twilight"" films and four ""Harry Potter"" titles â and the film, which Sony and MGM spent about $200 million to make, garnered an impressive $25,050 per theater average from 3,505 theaters. ""Skyfall's"" per-theater average was even more impressive in IMAX locations, where the film found $13.1 million (15 percent of its weekend gross) from 320 screens, good for a $40,938 average. Daniel Craig, the sixth man to play Bond, has seen his popularity as the character surge since taking over the iconic role in 2006. His first Bond film, ""Casino Royale,"" debuted with $40.8 million on the way to a $167.4 million finish. Two years later, ""Quantum of Solace"" opened 65 percent higher with $67.5 million on the way to $168.5 million total. (Reception for the film was tepid, which is why its endurance at the box office was so much weaker than ""Casino Royale's."") And now ""Skyfall"" has improved upon ""Quantum's"" opening weekend by 30 percent. At this rate, Craig's next turn as Bond (due in 2014) could garner well over $100 million in its debut frame. EW poll: 'Skyfall's' Silva is ... Before the weekend had even begun, ""Skyfall"" had already proven itself a remarkable success internationally, and it continued to do so over the past three days. In its third weekend of release, the film earned an additional $89 million, which lifts its overseas total to $428.6 million and its worldwide cumulative to $518.6 million. ""Skyfall's"" most popular international territory has been the United Kingdom, where it has earned Â£72.9 million ($117.5 million) in 17 days, already establishing it as the fourth highest grossing film in British history. ""Skyfall"" will easily become the first Bond film to surpass $600 million worldwide â a testament to both the booming state of the international box office and Bond's enduring appeal. So what made ""Skyfall"" reach such sky-high numbers? Timing likely helped. Though MGM's financial woes prevented the film from starting production on schedule, the delay may have worked in ""Skyfall's"" favor. Not only were audiences (which were 60 percent male and 75 percent above the age of 25) extra-eager for a new installment, but the film got to debut during the 50th anniversary year of the Bond franchise, which has given the character substantial publicity in 2012. On top of that, Adele's well-received theme song has also boosted ""Skyfall's"" profile nicely. It debuted at No. 8 on Billboard's Hot 100. 'Skyfall': One of the best Bond films ever? Moreover, Sony aggressively marketed the film over the past two months, and Daniel Craig's numerous endorsement deals have kept his public profile strong leading up to the release. Still, all these marketing and publicity efforts pale in comparison to the organic buzz that formed around ""Skyfall."" The presence of director Sam Mendes and Oscar winner Javier Bardem gave the project an elevated pedigree, and early response to the film ranged from strong to wildly positive. (It currently boasts a 93 percent ""fresh"" rating on RottenTomatoes.) And, coverage in the U.S. of the film's boffo international business only swelled anticipation further. In other words, the stars aligned perfectly for ""Skyfall"" to have a true box office moment. Heading into the frame, I predicted an $85 million opening weekend. 'Skyfall': Box office preview . Other movies at the box office held up well in the face of ""Skyfall."" Disney's animated ""Wreck-It Ralph"" finished in second place, dropping by a slim 33 percent to $33.1 million in its sophomore weekend. After 10 days, the $165 million videogame-themed comedy has grossed $93.7 million, and provided it isn't utterly cannibalized by Dreamworks' ""Rise of the Guardians"" (due November 21), it looks to be headed for a finish in the $175-200 million range. ""Wreck-It Ralph's"" weekend gross is particularly notable given the fact that it made ""only"" $7.8 million on Friday. Family films have a tendency to bring in booming bucks on Saturday and hold well on Sunday, and ""Wreck-It Ralph"" was no exception. It increased by a whopping 87 percent to $14.7 million on Saturday and eased just 29 percent to $10.5 million on Sunday. Denzel Washington's ""Flight"" descended into third place in its second frame, dropping 39 percent to $15.1 million â an impressive hold considering it shares an adult target audience with ""Skyfall."" Paramount's well-received $31 million drama has earned $47.8 million after ten days, and it's vying to become Washington's second $100 million earner in 2012 after ""Safe House,"" which grossed $126.2 million in February. ""Argo"" held strong in fourth place in its fifth weekend of release. Warner Bros.' $45 million Ben Affleck-directed feature dropped 34 percent to $6.7 million, bringing its domestic total to $85.7 million. Over the next few weeks, a slew of expected nominations and honors at end-of-the-year awards ceremonies should help push ""Argo"" right past $100 million. Rounding out the top five was Fox's ""Taken 2,"" which dipped 32 percent to $4 million and now has a strong $131.3 million total. The $45 million Liam Neeson thriller has proved powerful overseas as well â its international total stood at $217.1 million heading into the weekend. 1. ""Skyfall"" -- $87.8 million . 2. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" -- $33.1 million . 3. ""Flight"" -- $15.1 million . 4. ""Argo"" -- $6.7 million . 5. ""Taken 2"" -- $4.0 million . In limited release, DreamWorks' ""Lincoln"" got off to a tremendous start, earning $900,000 from 11 theaters in seven cities, enough for a stunning $81,818 per theater average. The Steven Spielberg-helmed Oscar contender, which earned an ""A"" CinemaScore grade, will expand into about 1,500 locations next weekend, when it will face off against ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 2,"" which, based on early tracking reports, just may be the biggest ""Twilight"" movie of them all.

"(CNN) -- Children play with a worn-out badminton set. Families sip traditional Indian tea known as chai from silver-colored cups and chat as the sun sets in a rose-colored sky. Goats bleat in the distance, water buffaloes chew on hay and the cackles of crows ring through the air. Welcome to the village of Chevuru, in southeast India, not far from the Bay of Bengal. Here, lush green rice paddies ring concrete homes in various stages of construction. I came here with 15 colleagues to help these villagers, who are among some of India's poorest and most disadvantaged people. We came to help build safe and solid concrete and brick homes for them. The villagers are Dalits -- once known as untouchables -- and they still suffer from discrimination. This group of 90 families live in thatched-roof huts that are prone to leaks and have mud floors that wash away. Some of their children attend a ""school"" that is a small outdoor space in front of a church. Many only have the clothes on their backs for daily wear. Ravi Kumar, head of the Association of Relief Volunteers (which partners with American nongovernmental organization Longitude, the group we used to volunteer in India) and our leader on this project, told us that giving the villagers these homes would not only physically improve their lives but it would also boost their morale -- endowing them with a new sense of pride and helping them to dream of a brighter future. Despite their tough lives -- many of the village men can only get work a few months a year on the rice paddies -- the villagers were enthusiastic, generous and hard-working. We worked under humid skies and sunny days, sometimes in more than 40-degree Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) temperatures. We carted cement, sifted materials, mixed cement, plastered walls -- and one day we worked together as a group to plaster a roof. It was back-breaking work, and watching the villagers tirelessly do it inspired me to do as much as I physically could, though we had to drink copious amounts of water and eat a lot of food. I became known as the ""after lunch napper,"" frazzled by the morning's duties. As we worked side by side with the villagers, we got to know them and their friends. One family I spent a lot of time with was building their home to accommodate four generations: their parents, their children and their grandchild. Their names were Ramadu (the grandfather), his son-in-law Krishna and his daughter, Buji. Krishna and Buji's eldest daughter had polio, which led to her legs being amputated. The couple help raise their daughter's grandchild, a 5-year-old boy named Siy, who has a clever smile and always seemed ready to test the commands of his grandparents. I visited them in their hut, where they lived in a space that seemed to measure about 10 feet by 10 feet. I knew the new home -- at a cost of just $1,500 -- would dramatically change their lives. Despite the difficulty of their situation, they kept telling our project leader Kumar that I was working too hard and needed to rest. They always brought us superb chai tea to drink with them. But all I wanted was to help them and all the others as much as possible while we were there to get the house done. I think we did a good job: Though the homes were unfinished when we left after two weeks of work, noticeable progress had been made. Most importantly, we felt the townspeople's spirits were lifted. During our time, we met many families and played games with the children. We asked them what they wanted to be when they grew up. One of my colleagues brought bubbles (which were very popular), while others brought clothes, pens and pencils, and sports equipment. Kumar said the villagers benefited by meeting people from outside their world, getting to speak English and exchange ideas. But the benefits were definitely mutual: We got to learn about them, too, their lives, goals and interests. These villagers have so many needs: proper schooling, health care, hygiene, clothing, mosquito nets (which only cost $5) and, of course, housing. But I saw that given the right tools and opportunity, the people of Chevuru were quite capable of accomplishing what they set out to do. On our last night, the villagers threw us a party and we danced together in the new saris and kurtas they had given us. We all left wondering what we could do next to help them and discussed plans for future work in Chevuru.","A group of 16 volunteers from Turner Broadcasting goes to India to help build houses .

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Rafael unleashed heavy rain and powerful gusts on the Leeward Islands on Sunday and could turn into a hurricane by Monday, forecasters said. With sustained winds of 60 mph, Rafael could get even stronger as it bears down on several islands popular with tourists. As of 5 p.m. ET, Rafael was centered about 185 miles (298 kilometers) northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The storm was moving north-northwest at 10 mph (16 kph) and was expected to turn northward by Monday. A projection map shows Rafael headed toward Bermuda later this week. Officials there issued a tropical storm watch Sunday and told residents that they expected the storm to affect the British territory on Tuesday. While the National Hurricane Center predicted Rafael will stay well to the east of the Bahamas through Monday, it did warn of life-threatening surf conditions and rip currents on the eastward-facing beaches of the Bahamas over the next few days. Tropical storm warnings that had been in effect for the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, St. Martin, Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts and Guadeloupe were discontinued Sunday morning. Forecasters expect Rafael to leave between 4 to 6 inches of rain over the Lesser Antilles and Virgin Islands, with some pockets getting as much as 10 inches. ""These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous terrain,"" the hurricane center said. The storm could hamper rescue efforts for two men and one woman whose small aircraft crashed Saturday morning about six nautical miles (seven miles) south of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad said. They were aboard a twin-engine Piper PA-23 that left St. Croix destined for St. Thomas, according to Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. Rescue crews from the Coast Guard and U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Natural Resources saved one female passenger, Valerie Jackson, who told them three others were still unaccounted for. A Coast Guard cutter ship, two helicopters and a fixed-wing aircraft have been dispatched from Puerto Rico for the search, Castrodad said. CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","NEW: Bermudan officials issue a tropical storm watch .

"(CNN) -- A fight for the control of Sake, a strategically placed town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, raged Thursday, while regional leaders sought to end the crisis. The political leader of M23, the rebel group that captured Goma, a key city near Sake, two days earlier, flew to Uganda Thursday for talks with that country's president. The United Kingdom's minister for Africa, Mark Simmonds, arrived in Kigali, Rwanda, Thursday and immediately issued a statement saying ""there can be no attempt to unseat the legitimate government of the Democratic Republic of Congo"" while calling on the DRC government to ""address the underlying causes of the conflict."" ""I call on the M23 to stop its advance and to withdraw from Goma immediately,"" Simmonds said. ""This would benefit the people of the DRC and is the will of the governments of the region and the whole international community."" Oxfam, which is monitoring humanitarian conditions in the area, warned Thursday that the fall of Goma to the rebels poses ""a very real risk of complete collapse of state authority and the humanitarian crisis reaching new depths."" It estimates that 120,000 people are in urgent need of help, with many sleeping in the open or in schools and other buildings without humanitarian aid. ""People are living in chaotic conditions,"" said Tariq Riebl, Oxfam's humanitarian coordinator. ""There are real fears that cholera and other fatal water-borne diseases could spread, as shortages of power and water in Goma have left thousands of people with no choice but to get water straight from Lake Kivu."" Reporter Phil Moore, who was in Sake Thursday, said ""the crack of heavy gunfire ripped through the town"" in the afternoon, sending thousands of residents fleeing down the road to Goma. ""The road east to Goma was filled by people carrying bedding, cooking pots and whatever belongings they had to hand,"" Moore said. ""One boy walked past with his six goats. Motorcycles sped past, three people squeezed onto the small seat, and minibuses were bursting with those fleeing renewed violence. The sound of mortar rounds exploding mixed with the rumble of thunder, rolling in from the north."" These refugees from Sake will suffer a difficult night, he said, ""forced to sleep amongst the sharp, volcanic rock that defines the landscape on the edge of Lake Kivu. Seeking refuge in the Mugunga IDP camp, already filled with 50,000 people. There is little to eat, and no shelter."" The situation of who is fighting and who is in control is unclear, he said. Sake is strategic because it is a gateway to Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu. ""A motorcycle raced through the crowd saying that M23 had retreated from the town and were held up at a small stream crossing just outside of the city,"" Moore said. ""As the thousands of fleeing civilians walked east towards a camp for the internally displaced, a truck filled with rebels raced from Goma towards Sake. Minutes later, they were followed by a column of a dozen rebels, running on foot, their pick-up truck having broken down further up the road. Bandoliers rattled around their necks as they carried PKM machine guns and Kalashnikov rifles, and some carried rocket-propelled grenades."" M23 political leader Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero was summoned to Kampala by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who is hosting a conference of regional leaders Saturday aimed at ending the crisis in the DRC, according to an M23 source close to Lugerero. DRC President Joseph Kabila and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda were also in Kampala for the International Conference for the Great Lakes Region, which is set to start there Saturday. When the M23 rebel movement gained control of Goma earlier this week, it announced that it plans to ""liberate"" the entire country. An M23 spokesman said Tuesday that the capture of Goma, the culmination of several days of heavy fighting against government forces, was just the beginning. ""We will push on to Bukavu, then Kisangani, and finally take Kinshasa and overthrow the government,"" Lt. Col. Vianney Kazarama said to enthusiastic cheers from a crowd of several hundred at Goma's stadium, according to a Congolese reporter there. Kazarama said that once the rebels overthrow the government, they will call for elections. Kinshasa, the country's capital, lies nearly 1,000 miles west of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. The eastern part of the DRC, which includes Goma, has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals following the genocide in that country. The M23 group was named for the peace deal of March 23, 2009, which they accuse the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly Tutsis, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army in April, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised, and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions. Tens of thousands of Congolese, already displaced by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region, have fled camps around the edges of Goma, according to UNICEF and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","NEW: U.K. minister calls on M23 to ""stop its advance and to withdraw from Goma immediately""

"(CNN) -- After a week in which football's reputation has been dragged through the mud, the ugly spectre of hooliganism raised its head once more after a goalkeeper was subjected to a physical assault during an English Championship game. Chris Kirkland, the goalkeeper of Sheffield Wednesday, was hit in the face by a supporter of Leeds United during the teams' 1-1 draw at Hillsborough. With Leeds just having equalized in the 77th minute, the man ran onto the pitch and struck Kirkland, who fell to the floor and required medical treatment. Racism row shines light on Serbian football . The former England goalkeeper, 31, was left visibly shocked by the event and led to his manager, Dave Jones, insisting that Leeds fans should be 'banned from every league ground'. ""They are vile animals,"" Jones told Sky Sports. ""You don't wave at them after that. I thought it had gone out of our game. ""The authorities have to look at it and sort it. I'm talking about an incident when we should be talking about the football. We're talking about vile animals. ""That's what they are. We talk about racism, but that, we need to sort that. ""Chris Kirkland is feeling sore, if he had stayed down I wonder what would have . happened? They [Leeds United] should be punished."" English player chief Carlisle calls for Serbia ban . The two teams, both from Yorkshire, have a fierce rivalry and had not played at Hillsborough for six years. ""I felt embarrassed to be a manager when I saw that,"" said Leeds manager Neil Warnock. ""I thought it was an absolute disgrace. I think they should get the guy and prosecute him and put him in prison. ""He (Kirkland) went down like a ton of bricks but that doesn't make a difference. Nobody should be on the pitch doing that. ""I hope we can make an absolute issue of it. He spoiled everything for everyone. I've not enjoyed that when I see a moron like that. ""I am not proud of being Leeds manager when I see that. I don't mind the rivalry between us - there was a great atmosphere. ""To see things like that on the field of play there is no place for it - I am absolutely embarrassed."" In March 2007, Timothy Smith, was fined ÃÂ£300 and given a three-year Football Banning Order after running onto the field and attempting to punch Frank Lampard during Chelsea's FA Cup replay at Tottenham. Call for unity as racism divides English football . And action is nearly certain to be taken against the offender with Leeds offering its full cooperation to ensure he is found. In a statement released after the game, Leeds said: ""Leeds United Football Club would like to publicly apologise and condemn the action of the fan who came on the pitch and attacked Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Chris Kirkland. The club will fully cooperate with the police and the football authorities in identifying the individual concerned. ""After the week football has endured there is no place for this type of behaviour and the majority of Leeds supporters will be ashamed of his actions."" Speaking after the incident, Chief Superintendent Jason Harwin of South Yorkshire Police said: ""During tonight's match, Sheffield Wednesday versus Leeds United at Hillsborough, incidents occurred where it is believed seats and bottles were thrown inside the ground. ""We are also aware of an incident whereby the Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper has been assaulted by an individual who ran onto the pitch. ""Fans are still leaving the ground and surrounding areas and our priority is to ensure the safe departure of fans. ""Such incidents are not acceptable and won't be tolerated. We will be working with both clubs to identify and quickly bring to justice the persons responsible. ""Thankfully, such incidents are a rarity and we see a minority spoil it for the majority of genuine supporters. ""We are keen to hear from anyone that can help identify any person responsible for any of these incidents tonight."" Meanwhile, in Russia, Dynamo Moscow's players came under attack from fans using paintball guns at the club's training ground on Friday. Fans arrived in camouflage at the club's training base in Novogorsk, just north of Moscow before unleashing a flurry of paintballs at the players. Dynamo lost seven of its opening eight games before the arrival of new coach Dan Petrescu. The former Chelsea defender has helped guide the club to 13th position in the league since taking over the reins. ""They are idiots,"" club president Gennady Solovyov told local media. ""I have no other words to describe those who could do such things. I promise I'll do my best to try to find and punish those responsible for these actions."" Dynamo midfielder Alan Gatagov added: 'I was hit in the back of the head when they shot at us. Lots of players were also hit. 'I just can't find the right words. What are we supposed to do now? Should each of us hire a personal bodyguard?'","Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Chris Kirkland attacked on pitch .

"(RollingStone.com) -- Ellie Goulding emerged in 2010 with a one-two punch: first, her (still-rising) helium-voiced hit ""Lights,"" then, an elegant read of Elton John's ""Your Song"" that led to a gig at Prince William's wedding. As Cinderella stories go, it's a good one. But as a 25-year-old adept who dresses rave-y hooks in folk-rock tunefulness and art-pop filigree, Goulding earned her glass slippers. ""Halcyon,"" her second LP, pumps up her sound as befitting a court musician. The single ""Anything Could Happen"" has the London Community Gospel Choir swooping around staccato piano and club beats; elsewhere she's multitracked into a one-woman choir. If the songwriting doesn't quite measure up to U.K. art-pop divas like Kate Bush, the hooks always go to town, and her voice -- Dolly Parton-dazzling in the upper register -- mates gorgeously with electronics, swirling around itself on the title track, morphing through synthscapes on ""Don't Say a Word."" ""I Need Your Love,"" a bangin' collab with Scottish rave-op master Calvin Harris (Rihanna's ""We Found Love""), gets slotted as a ""bonus cut,"" maybe to avoid confusing the more genteel fans.

"(CNN) -- In this space, Michele Flournoy, former undersecretary of defense under President Barack Obama, and some of her colleagues attacked a recent Mitt Romney opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. In their piece, entitled ""Romney's empty foreign policy agenda,"" they hurl all sorts of tired accusations at the Republican nominee. They even recycle a trope used by Democrats against Ronald Reagan and other successful Republican presidents, that Romney employs ""cowboy rhetoric."" Yet even as they condemn the Republican nominee for wrapping himself in ""platitudes and falsehoods,"" they offer a remarkable demonstration of some of the serious problems afflicting Obama's stewardship of America's role in the world. Let us scrutinize some of their points. Opinion: Romney's empty foreign policy agenda . On Iran, they assert that there are ""zero actual policy differences"" between Obama and Romney, citing the president's policy of sanctions. But what they neglect to say is that Obama resisted imposing the kind of new, crippling sanctions that are necessary to stop Iranian nuclear efforts for much of his presidency. Today, Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than ever before. What they also conveniently forget is that Obama, saying he did not want to ""be seen as meddling,"" at first issued no more than cursory objections during the Iranian spring of 2009, when dissidents took to the streets of Tehran and other cities to protest a stolen election. A President Romney would never abandon our basic principles of supporting freedom and democracy in this way. Flournoy and company point proudly to the fact that Osama bin Laden is dead ""on the president's watch."" They are right to be proud of this, as are all Americans. But when they say that ""more al Qaeda senior leaders have been taken off the battlefield than at any time since 9/11,"" they run the danger of hubris. And hubris has been one of the defining characteristics of the president's foreign policy. Alas, we saw a tragic demonstration of the consequences of hubris just this past September 11, when four Americans -- including our ambassador -- were murdered in a terrorist attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Perhaps believing its own rhetoric about the decimation of al Qaeda, the Obama administration let down its guard about the significant striking power of al Qaeda's remnants, affiliated and otherwise. Certainly, the inadequate protection given to our diplomatic personnel on September 11 -- the anniversary of the terrible attack -- is a spectacular piece of evidence that their judgment was skewed. Even worse, after the attack on Benghazi, the Obama administration appeared to be so desperate to believe that al Qaeda was not responsible that it pinned the entire episode on the spontaneous rage of a crowd provoked by an obscure video on the Internet. It clung to this version past the point of decency. But it was false. American intelligence agencies have made it clear that our citizens were killed in a terrorist attack launched by an al Qaeda affiliate. Flournoy's assertion that Obama ""has effectively managed the tumult of the Arab Spring"" would be laughable if the consequences of his lack of effective management were not so tragic. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard Williamson.","Richard Williamson: Despite criticism of Romney on foreign policy, Obama's record flawed .

"Denver (CNN) -- President Barack Obama turned in a less-than-stellar performance Wednesday night in his first debate this election season. On Thursday, his campaign aides said former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney came armed with distortions. But if the president believed that, he barely brought them to the viewers' attention during the debate. Instead, he turned in a distracted, passionless performance. Here are five reasons he fumbled: . 1. His nice-guy image: The Obama team believes the president's biggest asset is his likability. They want him to preserve that at all costs. They're convinced undecided voters don't want to see him engaged in verbal combat -- so he rose above it. That meant he passed on openings to attack Romney. He also missed openings to defend his own record and didn't challenge what his campaign now labels Romney ""distortions."" It let him stay the nice guy, but isn't there a saying about the nice guy and where he finishes? 2. Misjudging the room: They decided this wasn't about the debate. Instead, it was an opportunity, like the speech at the Democratic National Convention, to speak directly ""to voters at home, not the people in the room."" Viewers saw that tactic a few times when the president looked directly into the camera to deliver his message. But a debate is about engaging with at least two people in the room -- the opponent (Romney) and the moderator (Jim Lehrer). By reaching beyond them (and at one point snapping at Lehrer), the president seemed disengaged and disinterested -- and no doubt that matters to the people watching at home. 3. Not enough prep: The president held more strategy sessions about the debate than actual mock debates. It's no doubt harder to find the time to prep when you're a sitting president and not a candidate, but to get rehired, he needs to find the time. Known for his gift with words, the president is, according to sources, challenging to coach. He believes he's his own best critic and that he knows what to say and how to say it. 4. Incumbency syndrome: Did you get the sense the president did not want to be on that stage, that other things were on his mind? He appeared impatient with the experience, not unlike other incumbent presidents, including George W. Bush 2004. It read almost as if the president is dealing with too many other domestic and global issues to stand there and volley about campaign promises when he has -- in the mind of the incumbent -- more pressing matters. He seemed to have a bad case of it Wednesday night. 5. Doesn't take criticism well: It's no secret Obama is a confident man. He wouldn't have a lot of patience for advisers talking about how to score style points. But as Al Gore's sighing debate performance in 2000 proved how a candidate looks when he's not speaking can be as important as what he says. Sources tell CNN that during debate prep, only the president's inner circle stayed for the critique of the president's performance after the mock debates. Even then, it didn't seem to make enough headway to calm the president's impatience with this process. Maybe next time, they'll show the president tape of his downward gaze and grimacing during Romney's answers -- and let him provide his own self-criticism before he shows up in Hempstead, New York, for the second debate at Hofstra University. Three things we know about the president: He's fiercely competitive, hates losing and he is disciplined. After last night's experience, he will no doubt adjust and come in ready with a different performance for round two. But he has to avoid the problem Al Gore faced in 2000. Gore was too passive in one debate so he overcorrected and came off as too aggressive in another -- missing the mark both times. Day after: Obama accuses Romney of dishonesty in debate .

"(CNN) -- A priest known for his collection of religious art is under investigation for possible involvement in the illegal ivory trade, according to a Philippine law enforcement agency. Monsignor Cristobal Garcia was quoted in the October issue of National Geographic directing a reporter to ivory carvers and traders, and also dispensing advice on how to smuggle the banned item into the United States. According to the National Geographic article, Garcia told the journalist, Bryan Christy, to wrap ivory in ""old, stinky underwear and pour ketchup on it,"" to disguise it as a soiled piece of clothing to get it through U.S. customs. He was with the Cebu Archdiocese when he allegedly made his remarks to the magazine. This caught the Philippines authorities' interest. Garcia was known as ""one of the best known ivory collectors in the Philippines,"" according to National Geographic. An investigation concerning Garcia is ongoing, said Sixto Comia, the chief of the environmental and wildlife investigation division of the National Bureau of Investigation. Garcia has not been charged with any crime and his collection has not been confiscated. Comia said the agency takes illegal trade of ivory seriously. Elephants, valued for their tusks, are being killed in Africa at an alarming rate by well-armed poachers, according to conservation groups. The highly coveted ivory tusks are often traded in Asia, where there is high demand -- especially in China and Thailand. National Geographic described Garcia owning a ""mini-museum"" filled with ivory religious figures. Garcia was removed from his position in June stemming from a U.S. case in the 1980s, said Monsignor Achilles Dakay, the Cebu archdiocese media liaison officer. National Geographic's article alluded to a dismissed lawsuit filed against Garcia when he served as priest in Los Angeles in the 1980s for sexual abuse of an altar boy. The Cebu Archdiocese released a statement Wednesday saying that Garcia's past ""has been elevated to the Holy See,"" the Vatican City government of the Catholic Church. ""The Church is also aware of the gravity of the crime of pederasty. In recent pronouncements, the Church has stated her regret for the failure to address the problem in a more decisive and effective way,"" according to the Archdiocese statement. Garcia has since taken ill, Dakay said, and is unable to be reached for comment. The church's statement, attributed to Cebu Archbishop Jose S. Palma, also condemned the ivory trade, saying, ""the Church does not condone ivory smuggling or other illegal activities, although in the past, ivory was one of the materials used in the adornment of liturgical worship."" The church also stated that Garcia has rights to a ""fair and just hearing"" on the ivory trade allegations. The church said the National Geographic Magazine story ""needs to be assessed as to its veracity, considering that the article smacks of bias against religious practices.""","A quote in the National Geographic article lands priest in ivory investigation .

"(CNN) -- President Obama's Ambien finally wore off, and thus he began the second presidential debate with Mitt Romney. Obama's performance Tuesday night was stellar (but not perfect) because of two techniques that I push to my debate teams ad nauseam. The first is the primacy effect, and the second is using your opponent's language against him. If you want to win a debate, you've got to master these techniques. The primacy effect is the idea that the first things a speaker says are more persuasive than those that follow. It holds true in conversations, in 90-minute debates, and even over a series of speeches or debates. Obama came out strong. He lacked passion in the previous debate, but when answering the first question from the audience Tuesday night, Obama brought the heat. Early on he said Romney didn't have a five-point economic plan, but ""a one-point plan"" -- that ""folks at the top play by a different set of rules."" Right away we knew this was a different Obama. Yeah, I know, everyone's probably talking about that comment because it's a good sound bite. But for me, it's the primacy effect taking off. I teach my debaters that you've got to make your best arguments early in the speech. Otherwise you might not have the judge's full attention when you get to your best arguments, thereby lessening the weight of your position. Opinion roundup: Obama bounces back, dominates debate . I guarantee you this one answer -- the ""one-point plan"" -- will be talked about more than any other (aside from that silly ""binders full of women"" distraction), partially because the president was memorable here, but mostly because of the primacy effect. The second debating concept I preach is the importance of language choices. If a team I coached ever concluded a debate without using their opponents' language against them, I'd want to make them run laps. (OK, that's a terrible idea -- picture in your mind a debate team running laps. ) Obama used Romney's language against him time and time again, and it was effective. Here are some examples of Obama quoting Romney. ""This plant kills"" (from a Romney quote illustrating his flip-flop on coal plants); Romney's assertion that promoting a lower tax rate for the most wealthy Americans ""grows the economy;"" ""I'll get back to you on that,"" his spokesman's initial response on Romney's stance on the Lilly Ledbetter bill, which makes it easier for women who have been discriminated against over equal pay to sue employers. Debaters can't easily get out of arguments when you quote their own words. It's a timeless, winning strategy. Opinion: How Obama aced comeback . Moving further forward in the debate, Romney used the same technique responding to the sixth question, when asked what the president had done or accomplished to earn our vote. Unemployment, Medicare, Social Security and immigration were all subtopics that Romney used when answering this particular question. And he began each of these issues with the phrase ""He said..."" when referring to Obama. He followed this by reminding the audience of Obama's perceived shortcomings on these issues. It was Romney's best moment of the debate. Unfortunately, it came almost an hour into it. In fact, it took Romney almost an hour until he had a clearly favorable exchange. That's too long. Because of the primacy effect, undecided voters won't likely remember the stuff in the middle of the debate as much as the points at the beginning. It's good for Romney that this wasn't the first debate, because Obama's performance was much stronger Tuesday night. The primacy effect over these two debates might have just saved Romney. I expect the president to get a bump in the polls from this debate, but it could have been worse for Romney. Think about it: If we simply reversed the order of the debates, the race for president would look very different right now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Todd Graham.","Todd Graham: Obama revived himself and gave a stellar (but not perfect) debate performance .
He says Obama used ""primacy effect"" technique to be most persuasive first thing in debate .
He says Obama also used Romney's own words against him, a timeless, winning strategy .
Graham: Romney used that technique too, but late in debate; lost valuable time in waiting ."
"(CNN) -- A powerful 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck near Mexico's Baja Peninsula Tuesday, the U.S. Geological Survey said. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries as the area around the epicenter is sparsely populated, said a spokeswoman for the Baja California Sur's Civil Protection Office. She said many people there were nervous because earthquakes are rare in the area. The quake's epicenter was 47 miles (75 kilometers) north of La Paz, Mexico, USGS said. The quake was more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) deep, the agency said.","There are no immediate reports of damage .

"(CNN) -- More than two million Americans have already cast ballots for president less than three weeks before Election Day with a substantial number coming in the battleground state of Iowa. The state, which holds six key electoral votes, is on pace to exceed the 1.5 million votes cast early in 2008 -- a trend that is not lost on either political party. While both parties are investing resources in early voting, Democrats' push to turn out voters -- and in particular young voters in Iowa -- could be paying off. Early numbers, which are updated daily, show that almost 20% more registered Democrats than registered Republicans have voted so far. Of the 463,219 early voting ballots requested in the state as of Thursday morning, 45% came from registered Democrats compared to 30% of registered Republicans. In voting, the early bird skips the line . Experts caution no direct link should be made between requests and how the vote might go. ""We don't know if a registered Democrat will vote for Barack Obama and we don't know if a registered Republican will vote for Mitt Romney,"" said Michael McDonald, associate professor government and politics at George Mason University who specializes in elections. But return data coupled with polls that show a slight lead for Obama in Iowa, he said, can give us some clue. The electoral makeup in Iowa looks like it did in 2008 when Obama took the state by almost 10 points, according to McDonald. So far this year, 4% more Democrats have voted early than in 2008. Republican numbers have only risen by 1%. That's not enough for Romney if he wants to flip the state, McDonald said. ""It's not just enough to recreate the 2008 electorate. Romney needs to have improvement,"" McDonald said. That's assuming that Election Day returns mirror 2008 as well. Romney's improvement might come naturally to Republicans in Linn County, Iowa, one of the Hawkeye State's most populous counties. Tim Box, the deputy commissioner of elections there, said Democrats are more naturally inclined to vote early and Republicans are more apt to cast ballots on Election Day. ""If you paint it with a broad brush, a lot of Democrats vote absentee, Republicans go to the polls. They always start behind [in Linn County],"" Box said. He also attributed the Democratic success to an organized effort to turnout early voters. Democrats, for instance, requested more satellite voting sites for early voting and staffed them more heavily than Republicans. There is some good news for Romney in the state since early voting requests and returns are slowly closing the gap between Republicans and Democrats, day-to-day monitoring shows. With some ""hustling"" and a push at the end, Romney could make a race of it, McDonald said. He could also change the game if he is able to turn out more Republicans on Election Day than the GOP did in 2008. John King: Who benefits from early voting? And while Iowa's electoral votes could be key to winning the White House, what is true of Iowa is not true of Ohio or of North Carolina, two of the 22 states that have begun early voting. ""Each state is like a unique snowflake [when it comes to early voting],"" said McDonald since the Constitution gives each state the right to administer their elections at a state level. What this also means is that with different demographics, Democrats and Republicans have different strategies for turning out early voters in each state with different results. What's also different is the way that states collect data, meaning that it is easier to infer conclusions from returns in states that report party registration, like Iowa. But in Ohio, where registration is required only in primaries, the parties rely on different indicators, like returns in key strongholds. Ohio touts early voting numbers . And there is encouraging news for both: In Hamilton and Franklin counties, two urban centers around Cincinnati and Columbus respectively, early voting shows heavy turnout in the areas that helped secure the state for Obama in 2008. The state is mailing absentee ballot applications to voters for the first time this year and McDonald said that could be affecting increased returns in rural areas, which are more heavily Republican. In rural areas of Ohio, absentee ballots sent to each registered voter in the state for the first time in 2012 also show increased turnout. In Cuyahoga County, the largest in the state and home to Democrat-heavy Cleveland, nearly 250,000 absentee ballots have been requested and some 80,000 have been returned. Those numbers strongly favor Democrats: 47,538 to 16,720. GOP officials say their absentee and in-person voting turnout in Franklin County is coming along nicely. Republicans account for 16.5% of registered voters there, but make up 28.6% of early voting activity so far. Still, McDonald said looking that the numbers now is ""like reading tea leaves."" It is also still too early to decipher returns in North Carolina, which began early voting on Thursday. If voting stays pace with projections from early voting experts, 5% to 10% more than the 30% or 130 million Americans who voted early in 2008 will have voted before November 6, according to early voting experts. Here's a look at the early voting returns so far and the dates that they began voting, according to state and county voting officials: . â¢ California (October 8): The Golden State issued more than eight million ballots as of Wednesday, but just more than 81,000 -- or 1% have been returned. â¢ Georgia (October 15): 120,032 ballots have been cast in person and 73,119 ballots via mail. There are still almost 100,000 mail-in ballots outstanding. Early voting began in Georgia on October 15. â¢ Idaho (September 21): Did not return requests for data. â¢ Indiana (October 8): More than 180,000 applications for early voting ballots have been submitted since the state began early voting. Of those, 118,000 have been returned. Indiana has in-person absentee voting. â¢ Iowa (September 27): Of the almost 450,000 absentee ballots requested, more than half have been returned. Democrats lead the pack, requesting more than 200,000 ballots and returning almost 65% of those. Republicans requested almost 140,000 and returned just less than 60%. Ballots requested with no party affiliation or for other party affiliations total about 105,000 and 50% of those have been returned. â¢ Kansas (October 17): More than 120,000 ballots were requested by the time early voting began. State officials say it's too early to tabulate an accurate representation of the ballots returned. â¢ Maine (September 24): Almost 80,000 ballots have been requested, with 76,330 issued and 29,931, or almost 38%, returned. â¢ Montana (October 9): More than a quarter million voters requested ballots. As of Wednesday, almost 40,000 or just under 15% of the ballots had been returned. â¢ Nebraska (October 2): Of the almost 80,000 ballots requested, more than 50,000 have been returned. â¢ North Dakota (27): Of the almost 40,000 ballots sent as of Wednesday, 15,252, or almost 40%, have been returned. â¢ Ohio (October 2): 1.26 million ballots have been requested and just more than 280,000 or 22% have been returned by mail. That's almost 20 percent of the 5.7 million Ohioans who voted early in 2008. â¢ South Dakota (September 21): Of the nearly 36,000 absentee ballots requested, 35,888 ballots have been sent out and 25,238 or 70% have been returned. â¢ Tennessee (October 17): Already, 105,405 voters have cast ballots since voting began. â¢ New Jersey (September 22): An accurate count of returned ballots will be available beginning next week. â¢ Oregon (October 8): The state is one of the two that votes by mail only. Return data is not available until October 22. â¢ Utah (October 9): Data collected at the county level was not immediately available. â¢ Vermont (September 22): Data is collected at the county level was not immediately available. â¢ Wyoming (September 27): Data was not available.

"New York (CNN) -- Police said Thursday that they have arrested a homeless man in the daytime rape of a 73-year-old woman in New York's Central Park. David Albert Mitchell was charged with predatory sexual assault, rape, criminal sex act and robbery assault, according to police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. He said detectives uncovered photographs of Mitchell on the victim's home computer, which she had apparently downloaded after photographing him more than a week ago in the park. Browne said the woman told police that she had seen him masturbating in park and then photographed him . ""It's the same guy she thinks she photographed nine days ago,"" added Browne, who said Mitchell has an extensive arrest record in Virginia and West Virginia. The heavily tattooed 42-year-old man was charged with murder and sexual assault in 1989 but was acquitted the following year, he said. In May 2003, Mitchell was convicted of abduction and kidnapping in Virginia and sentenced to eight years in prison . Police said the attack occurred Wednesday while the victim was bird watching in the vicinity of 74th Street and Central Park West, also known as Strawberry Fields. The woman told police they exchanged words and he sexually assaulted her. He also stole some items, authorities said. The woman was taken to a hospital after passerby Eric Ozawa found her lying in the bushes. ""I saw her face was badly beaten,"" Ozawa told CNN affiliate WABC. ""She was swollen, her right eye was black, her forehead was swollen. ... She told me that she had been raped."" This is the first reported sexual assault in Central Park this year, according to police records. In 2011, two such attacks occurred. ""She was a victim of a terrible attack,"" Browne told WABC.

"(CNN)  -- Mary Travers of 1960s folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary, has died, according to her publicist. She was 72. Mary Travers performs at the 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston, Massachusetts. Travers died from side effects of treatment from a bone-marrow transplant after battling leukemia, publicist Heather Lylis said. The singer was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in November 1936 and grew up in New York's Greenwich Village. As a teenager, she performed in a Broadway review, but stepped on to the folk music scene in the 1950s. She emerged as an iconic folk singer while performing with Peter Yarrow and Noel Paul Stookey. Peter, Paul and Mary came together while singing ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" in Stookey's New York City apartment. They went on to play gigs at coffee houses and later on the radio. ""As a performer, her charisma was a barely contained nervous energy -- occasionally (and then only privately) revealed as stage fright,"" Stookey said. Their music reflected the 1960s and the 1970s, a time of turmoil as the civil rights and anti-war movements moved into full swing. Travers applied her recognition to rally behind those progressive movements. In 1963, the trio performed its hit song ""If I Had a Hammer"" at the Washington march where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famed ""I Have a Dream Speech,"" her publicist said. ""We've learned that it will take more than one generation to bring about change,"" Travers once said. ""The fight for civil rights has developed into a broader concern for human rights, and that encompasses a great many people and countries. Those of us who live in a democracy have a responsibility to be the voice for those whose voices are stilled."" Travers advocated against U.S. government moves in Central America in the 1980s. She went on a mission to El Salvador and later spoke out against the country's regime. She also opposed American funding of a militant group in Nicaragua set on overthrowing an elected government there, according to her publicist. Peter, Paul and Mary recorded hits still recognized now, including ""Leaving on a Jet Plane,"" ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" and ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone."" They performed together for nearly 50 years, winning five Grammys and releasing 13 Top 40 hits, six of them in the Top 10 charts. Their debut album, ""Peter, Paul and Mary"" was on the Top 10 chart for 10 months. Travers also recorded four solo albums in the 1970s. ""Her talent was huge ... Mary was the difference maker,"" said Joe Smith, former head of Warner Brothers Records. ""Super bright, super talented, and a pleasure to know and work with."" Their last performance was in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on May 20. Those closest to Travers say she valued her friendships. ""Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of my relationship with Mary Travers over the last almost 50 years is how open and honest we were with each other, and I include Noel Paul Stookey in this equation,"" Yarrow said in a statement. ""Such honesty comes with a price, but when you get past the hurt and shock of realizing that you're faulted and frequently wrong, you also realize that you are really loved and respected for who you are, and you become a better person."" She is survived by her husband, Ethan Robbins; her daughters Alicia and Erika; her sister, Ann Gordon; and her granddaughters Wylie and Virginia.","Mary Travers was a member of the 1960s folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A father and mother showed heroism when a gunman opened fired inside their California home before dawn Saturday, but two members of the family couldn't overcome their wounds, Inglewood police said. The mother ran from the house carrying her youngest child, though she was shot in both legs, in an ""extraordinary rescue attempt,"" police said. The 4-year-old boy, however, was shot in the head and later died in surgery. The mother was in critical but stable condition Saturday afternoon. Inside the house, the father used his body as a shield in trying to protect the other three children. Despite the father's efforts, the gunfire wounded two of his children: a 6-year-old boy in the pelvis and a 7-year-old girl in the chest. Both were in critical but stable condition, police said. The father later died in surgery of multiple gunshot wounds. The oldest of four children, an 8-year-old boy, was the sole family member who wasn't injured, police said. ""What would motivate an individual to do this is inexplicable,"" Inglewood Police Chief Mark Fronterotta said. Inglewood is adjacent to Los Angeles and its international airport. Police were conducting a manhunt for the suspect, who lived in a house in the rear of the property. That rear house was also set afire, believed to have been ignited by the gunman, police said. Police did not release names of the father, 30; mother, 28; or their children as of Saturday afternoon. The incident occurred about 4 a.m. Saturday when police received a report of 10 gunshots at the property. The fire department also received a call at the same time. Firefighters were hampered by fears that the gunman might have been armed in the rear residence, police said. Fallen power lines also hindered firefighting efforts. The suspect was described as a 55-year-old black man with a dark baseball cap and is 5-foot-6 and 160 pounds, police said. They later identified him as Desmond John Moses. The suspect wore a painter's mask when he gunned down the family, the police chief said. Police didn't provide a motive. The suspect should be considered armed and dangerous, the police chief said.

"(CNN) -- No doubt about it, actor Steven Yeun is in a pretty great place in his career. He's on one of the most popular scripted series on cable, ""The Walking Dead,"" and he's one of the most popular characters on that series. On top of that, he is as close as one can get to being a romantic lead on a show about a zombie apocalypse. His character, Glenn, is involved with farmer's daughter Maggie, and they have the most stable relationship of all of the survivors at this point. Of course, stability -- not to mention life itself -- is a very fragile thing on ""The Walking Dead."" The third season, which began on Sunday to record ratings, sees the group settling in what at first appeared to be in an abandoned prison. Yeun spoke with CNN about the new season, the fans and what scares him more than zombies. CNN: Where is Glenn's head at this season? Yeun: He sees himself as, if not a leader, at least a provider and protector and someone to look to in times of trouble. You see Glenn in this moment ready to take up the charge. It's not easy, but these are the moments he's been preparing for. We'll see how that plays out. CNN: How devoted is he to Maggie now, as opposed to the rest of the group? Yeun: I think Maggie is his strongest link. She's the sole thing he identifies with. I think she's the only thing that keeps him from going off on his own. I don't think he completely trusts the group. You saw in the last season, he questioned Rick, someone he's always looked up to. Glenn saw that the only thing he can really trust is his own gut, and he needs to do that to protect the people he loves. Maggie is his sole connection to being in this world, even. CNN: What new challenges come with the change of setting? Yeun: It's an adjustment to get used to being on stages, not outside all the time. Luckily, our writers and producers make sure we had plenty of time in the battering heat. It was a challenge at first, but it's fun to play how the situation changes how the character behaves. CNN: Is there anything for Glenn this season that tops that grotesque, harrowing scene in the well? Yeun: This season is literally no holds barred; it's gas pedal down. I'm excited for people to see what's coming. It's just crazy. The well was an amazing thing. It was terrifying and fun. There's definitely stuff this season that tops that by far. CNN: How does it feel to know about the season premiere's record-breaking ratings? Yeun: It's pretty damn amazing. It's nice to know that people are anticipating it and telling their friends. It's all around great. CNN: Are you into horror movies? Yeun: I'm not much of a horror fan. When it comes to ghost stuff and demon stuff, I can't watch that. I've heard too many crazy stories about that stuff, so I don't mess around that. Especially when you're staying in a haunted hotel. CNN: So zombies are no problem, but ghosts on the other hand ... Yeun: Zombies -- you can deal with that. You can punch or shoot them. With ghosts, you're going to be possessed, or something's going to be thrown at you. You can't do anything about that. No, thank you! CNN: Did you run into ""Mythbusters' "" Grant Imahara when he dressed up as Glenn at Dragon*Con this year? Yeun: That's pretty amazing that he did that. It's amazing to see anyone do anything with that character. I'm just lucky enough to be able to play it in a public forum. CNN: Have you had any unusual ""zombie"" interactions outside of the show? Yeun: People are strange sometimes, which is completely hilarious to me. A really normal couple in Atlanta were walking down the street, and the girl recognized me and started walking towards me in a ""walker"" walk. And she was committed, like ""Uuuuhh, I love your showwww ..."" That was unique. CNN: Finally, I have to ask, do you ever try to get information out of ""Walking Dead"" creator Robert Kirkman about what's going to happen on the show? Yeun: They're pretty protective (of that). They hold on to things sometimes. We just don't ask, out of courtesy. And also, if you ask, you may put it on yourself. CNN: Don't mess with the guy who could kill you off, huh? Yeun: Exactly.","Steven Yeun portrays fan favorite Glenn on ""The Walking Dead""

"(CNN) -- Thirty years ago, amidst much hype from Walt Disney Pictures, ""Tron"" debuted in theaters. The movie -- with its then-unusual plot of a man interacting inside a computer as an avatar -- failed to bring in a large audience in comparison with ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" a month earlier. Despite that, the movie left a mark. Few would dispute that its special effects were ahead of its time. Its early use of CGI inspired no less than Pixar Animation co-founder John Lasseter, who saw it as the future of animation. It held a special place in the heart of not only filmmakers but legions of fans as well. Whether they take part in ""Tron"" cosplay or own their own classic ""Tron"" arcade game, fans of the film that was cyberpunk before such a concept even existed are some of the most rabid. After all, for many of them, it was their first entry into the world of computers. This groundswell led Disney to relaunch the franchise with ""Tron: Legacy"" in 2010 (It even went so far as to screen test footage for fans at San Diego Comic-Con in 2008). And now, the franchise has continued, with no less of a fan than Paul Reubens (best known as Pee-wee Herman) taking part in its latest incarnation. Just like his character Pee-wee, Reubens has a pretty impressive toy collection. One of his favorites is a small ""Tron"" lightcycle. ""I just love looking back"" at the time of ""Tron's"" release, Reubens said. The comic actor spelled out what made that movie so special. ""We all knew 'Tron' was way ahead of its time,"" he said. ""To some degree, it's ahead of its time still. People know enough about the world of it and have more reference to it that it's way more accessible now."" So when Reubens was offered the chance to play the villainous Pavel in ""Tron: Uprising,"" Disney XD's animated series (which returns with new episodes Friday), he was glad to be on board. ""Anyone will tell you the villain roles are the more fun roles,"" said Reubens, who plays opposite Elijah Wood's hero Beck. ""I ran into people excited to see it before it happened. In the last six months, people stopped me all the time and said, 'oh, you're working on 'Tron!' I've run into a lot of 'Tron' fans out there."" ""Tron"" fandom is something just about everyone involved in the series -- a prequel to ""Legacy"" -- has in common. That was important to executive producer Charlie Bean, a lifelong fan himself, who wanted to avoid ""typical action-adventure"" casting. ""For anyone who witnessed the onset of computers and the dawn of video games, 'Tron' spoke to a lot of us with concepts about what it was like to be inside a computer or a virtual world,"" he said. ""It always sat inside of my mind. From a design point of view as an artist, it had such an impact on me."" The look of the show, reminiscent of Japanese anime and the 1990s series ""Aeon Flux"" among other influences, was also crucial. ""There's an artistic background to 'Tron,' from the first film with (designers) Syd Mead and Moebius,"" Bean said. ""(Yet) some of my initial ideas were about what I didn't want it to look like. ""I wanted it to stand out and be something that stood out from the action stuff that's out there, in bringing a live-action property to animation. My initial idea was to go in the opposite direction. Because of the world and types of stories, I wanted something that was more human but stylized, where you could really invest in the plight of these characters."" The series' look also appealed to Reubens, who famously employed all manner of animation on ""Pee-wee's Playhouse"" and has worked as a voice actor for many years, perhaps most famously on ""A Nightmare Before Christmas."" ""We saw enough stuff (ahead of time) to know ('Tron') was going to be really beautiful,"" the actor said. ""I could tell they had a really strong art direction."" Beyond the fans, though, the show involves someone who has been there from the beginning: Bruce Boxleitner once again portrays Tron. A fan favorite from his time on ""Babylon 5,"" Boxleitner admitted that ""Tron"" devotees have approached him more often than those for ""B5."" ""This was the only one that really seemed to resonate over the years,"" he said. So it took no convincing at all for Boxleitner to return to that world. ""I think 'Tron' could very well be a mythology for our time. It was born at the age of the Internet,"" he said. ""When Tron and Yori and Flynn destroyed the MCP, we liberated the internet for everyone. You can thank me. Who knew?"" Outside the world of animation, Boxleitner hopes for more live-action ""Tron"" -- with one stipulation. ""It's my motivation to find a young Tron. I can't fit in those tights. Tron's a young man's game!""","The film ""Tron"" has become a cult classic among fans .
The animated ""Tron"" series stars one such fan: Paul ""Pee-Wee Herman"" Reubens .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese dissident and artist Ai Weiwei has turned the cameras on himself.

Ai, 54, was on his way to Hong Kong last April when he was taken into custody and detained for three months amid a crackdown on political dissidents, activists and religious groups across China. Ai's Beijing studio was raided, and his wife and eight assistants were taken into custody for questioning. Activists attributed the campaign to government concerns about potential uprisings inspired by the Arab Spring. More than a month after taking him into custody, Beijing police told the state-run Xinhua news agency that Ai evaded a ""huge amount"" of taxes and that his company, Fake Cultural Development Ltd., intentionally destroyed accounting documents. The government then initiated a tax evasion case against Ai's company, demanding RMB 15 million (US$ 2.4 million) in fines, charges he denies and which critics argue are politically-motivated.

He said he was beaten in 2009 by police officers in his hotel room as he prepared to testify at the trial of a fellow earthquake activist. However, he was allowed to fly to Munich, Germany soon afterward to exhibit his installation. Ai also helped designed the iconic Bird's Nest stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but later renounced his role after feeling the games had become too politicized.

"(CNN) -- The 84 million bright yellow wristbands distributed by Lance Armstrong's cancer charity have become a well-known symbol of strength and perseverance against adversity. ""LIVESTRONG,"" they urge. In the wake of Wednesday's release of hundreds of pages of evidence supporting persistent allegations of doping against the legendary cyclist, there's another take on the wristband. Critics have struck out the ""V"" to make it read what they accuse Armstrong of doing for more than a decade: ""LIE STRONG."" Evidence of Armstrong doping 'overwhelming,' agency says . Still, the flood of less-than-flattering details doesn't seem to be shaking the resolve of fans accustomed to accusations that have swirled for more than a decade, accusations the seven-time winner of cycling's most prestigious event -- the Tour de France -- has resolutely denied. The information released Wednesday by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency is part of a report to international cycling officials supporting the organization's request to strip Armstrong of his tour titles and other accolades. He is also subject to a lifetime ban on competition in events sanctioned by U.S. Olympic sports bodies. Armstrong's fans took to Facebook and other social media venues to stand by the man many see less as an athletic titan and more as an inspirational cancer survivor who has raised millions for cancer research and assistance. ""Whether you did, or you didn't, you still won 7 tour titles, you never failed a test and what you have done to increase the awareness of cancer, is enormous,"" one fan wrote on his Facebook fan page. ""Believe me, no one can tarnish the good you have done,"" wrote another. It's too soon to tell what the release of evidence against Armstrong and his teammates, many of whom admitted doping, will ultimately have on Armstrong's charity efforts and his overall reputation. However, his foundation says contributions increased after his August announcement that he would give up fighting the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's investigation of him. ""Our donations have increased to nearly double their usual amount since August,"" said Katherine McLane, spokeswoman for the Lance Armstrong Foundation. ""He's a person who helped change the perception of cancer survivors around the world. He's done an incredible amount of good for people affected by cancer and nothing can change that,"" she said. Armstrong won his seven Tour de France championships after being diagnosed in 1996 with testicular cancer, which spread to his lungs, lymph nodes, abdomen and brain. By December of that year, after months of surgery and treatment, doctors declared him cancer free. The following year, he established his foundation. Three years after his diagnosis, Armstrong won the first of his seven Tour de France titles, thrilling and inspiring millions in his home country, where cycling is barely followed. His victory brought increased attention to the sport in the United States and helped raised money and attention for cancer research worldwide. Still, throughout it all, rumors and allegations of doping dogged the Texas native. In 2002, a 21-month investigation into allegations that Armstrong's team used banned substances during the 2000 Tour de France closed after finding no evidence of illegal drug use. The International Cycling Union released a report in 2006 clearing him of allegations from 1999. And in February, federal prosecutors in Los Angeles closed a two-year investigation into the allegations without filing charges. In the latest investigation, the USADA said examination of old Armstrong blood samples seemed to indicated doping. Its report also said Armstrong made a ""financial agreement"" to bury a positive test for a banned substance and accused the team of falsifying prescription records to cover corticosteroid use by Armstrong. The file also contains affidavits from Armstrong's teammates implicating themselves, and Armstrong, in the cheating. Armstrong's teammates recount tricking drug testers . The agency said its investigation ""found proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Lance Armstrong engaged in serial cheating through the use, administration and trafficking of performance enhancing drugs and methods and that Armstrong participated in running the US Postal Service Team as a doping conspiracy."" ""The evidence in the case against Lance Armstrong is beyond strong; it is as strong as, or stronger than, that presented in any case brought by USADA over the initial twelve years of USADA's existence,"" said the organization, which is not a governmental agency but is designated by Congress as the country's official anti-doping organization for Olympic sports. Armstrong himself hasn't commented directly on the case. He posted to Twitter Wednesday night, however, saying he was ""hanging with my family, unaffected"" and thinking about an upcoming event for his charity. His lawyer, Tim Herman, called the agency's report a ""one-sided hatchet job"" and a ""government-funded witch hunt."" A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles, which ran the investigation that was closed in February, declined to comment on whether the evidence released publicly Wednesday would spur renewed interest in possible criminal sanctions against Armstrong or anyone else associated with the team. Bruce Deming, a former federal prosecutor and avid amateur cyclist himself, said he doubted the criminal case would be reopened. ""The feds knew what USADA knew. USADA knew what the feds knew. So this is not new information to the prosecutors, I don't think,"" he said. In fact, he said, he suspects the information revealed Wednesday is largely similar to what federal prosecutors unveiled. ""This investigation against Lance, which you know involved multiple federal agencies and a very large, well-organized federal investigation and what has to be millions of dollars spent, came up with apparently not enough hard evidence to charge Lance Armstrong with a parking ticket,"" Deming said. Still, the report has had an impact on some fans, for whom the evidence appeared to sour their opinion of Armstrong. ""I am sad and have finally accepted there really are no true heroes in our world,"" one Facebook fan wrote. ""On behalf of pretty much everyone who has held you in high regard... Looked on as an idol in the wake of your excellence in your sport... Bought your books and aspired to be as (successful) as you are... If the allegations are true then you have duped your country and fellow athletes,"" wrote another. Still, Howard Bragman, an expert in crisis communications, said he does not expect the accusations will have any significant impact on Armstrong's legacy. ""He's done amazing things for people with cancer,"" Bragman said. ""He's given a lot of people hope in this world. And to many millions of Americans and people around the world, Lance Armstrong will always be a hero. And none of these allegations are ever going to change that."" CNN's Casey Wian and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","Many fans still support Armstrong, despite recent doping revelations .

"(CNN) -- A sex abuse support group called on the Boy Scouts of America to oust any official still with the organization who was involved in covering up child sex crimes. The demand by the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests was in reaction to a Los Angeles Times story detailing previously sealed files that it said showed scouting officials ""failed to report hundreds of alleged child molesters to police and often hid the allegations from parents and the public."" The 1,600 ""ineligible volunteer"" files from 1970 to 1991 reviewed by the Times were obtained through a 1992 lawsuit against the Boy Scouts, the newspaper reported Sunday. The ""perversion files"" were a blacklist of alleged sexual molesters, it said. L.A. Times reporter on sexual abuse cover-up in Boy Scouts of America . Although the Scouts learned of most of the abuse allegations after they were reported to authorities, the organization learned about more than 500 instances from boys, parents, staff members or anonymous tips, the paper said. ""In about 400 of those cases -- 80% -- there is no record of Scouting officials reporting the allegations to police,"" the Times reported. ""In more than 100 of the cases, officials actively sought to conceal the alleged abuse or allowed the suspects to hide it."" ""Here's the next step in the Boy Scouts child sex abuse and cover up scandal: Every Scout official who knew of or suspected or concealed these heinous crimes should be ousted and, if possible, prosecuted for failure to report possible child sex crimes to law enforcement,"" SNAP Director David Clohessy said. The files reviewed by the Times were ""from approximately 40 years ago, when the BSA served approximately 5 million young people each year,"" Boy Scouts spokesman Deron Smith said in a statement Monday. ""We have always cooperated fully (with) law enforcement, and now require our members to report even suspicion of abuse directly to local law enforcement,"" Smith said.

"(CNN) -- Kevin James trained for 14 months to play a biology teacher who moonlights as a mixed martial arts fighter to raise money for his school in ""Here Comes the Boom."" James said training included working out three times a day, drinking greens, running and sparring. Yet, he was moving pretty slowly when he dropped by CNN last week. ""I threw my back out ... getting into a town car. That'll show you the kind of shape I'm in now. How far I've let myself go,"" the self-deprecating comic said. James co-wrote and co-produced the action comedy, which hits theaters on Friday. It's already garnering positive feedback. Among his favorite early viewer reactions: ""God forgive me, I think I honestly liked this Kevin James movie."" Some people have the idea that ""Here Comes the Boom"" is ""just going to be Paul Blart falling around a ring, being the fat guy, tripping over his own feet,"" James said. ""But the UFC gave us their blessing to make this movie. ... I had to promise them I'm going to make this thing as realistic as possible and it's going to be something that they haven't seen in me before."" As several MMA sites have reported, this is the first film that's actually been allowed to use the UFC brand name. So far it seems MMA fans like the way the sport is represented. Fight Network's Sarah Davis wrote, ""I can appreciate all the cameos made by UFC personalities and fighters, whether they play themselves or not and there are a lot of fight scenes with superman punches, Kimura locks and body shots."" Since ""The King of Queens,"" James has made a name for himself in the PG arena, headlining family films like ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" and ""Zookeeper."" And then there are his PG-13 endeavors, which include ensemble comedies like ""Hitch,"" ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" and ""Grown Ups."" Despite some critical reviews, James' flicks have consistently performed well at the box office. As Entertainment Weekly reported after ""Zookeeper's"" 2011 release, 41% of moviegoers listed ""actor in a leading role"" as their reason for seeing the flick about talking animals. James said he doesn't feel the need to defend his recent films, and he won't apologize for playing ""the goofy guy falling down."" ""I love doing it,"" he said. ""It cracks me up sometimes what people will say about 'Paul Blart,' "" the 2009 flick he co-wrote and starred in as a Segway-riding security guard at a New Jersey mall. ""This is for families and for kids."" ""Here Comes the Boom"" is a very different kind of physical comedy, full of knockouts and arm bars. Everything that happens in the film is something that has happened during a real MMA fight, James said, noting, ""There was a ring that broke. A guy got thrown through the ring. There was a rain fight. These are all from real life."" James, who was a wrestler and a football player once upon a time, has been a fan of the UFC since watching the first fight in 1993. He said it was his ""love of trying to be physical and trying to portray what these guys go through"" that led him to the project. As for the other half of the story: ""I also have teachers that I remember from when I was going to school that have inspired me,"" he said. ""I've also had really crappy teachers, unfortunately, where they don't really care that much and you think it's a great time then because you're in class ... but literally there is nothing for you later on down the road. I kind of just wanted to tie these two worlds together."" ""It's tough,"" he added, ""because you're trying to blend a big comedy with inspiration, with heart and realistic fighting. ... There are a lot of ingredients in this one."" James hopes audiences will enjoy the idea of a ""common, everyday guy"" fighting in the Octagon for a good cause. ""You can watch 'James Bond' and enjoy it because it's something that you would never do,"" he said. ""I could never be James Bond. And then there are movies where you watch because you're seeing yourself through the eyes of the character. And I think I'm the latter."" Part of James' appeal as the everyman is his size, which is occasionally written into his story lines, as fans of ""The King of Queens"" already know. While he said he doesn't mind the jokes, his mother is not a fan. ""If I do a movie where I have to have (a son) and it's a chubby kid, my mother is always like, 'You were never like that.' She gets so upset about it,"" he said. It's his own kids, who are 7, 5 and 17 months, who have greatly influenced his professional decisions. ""I want to do movies that I'm proud of where my kids, at some point, can see and I can feel comfortable sitting there watching it with them,"" he said. ""And just that move people. That make people feel a little bit better about themselves when they leave the theater."" James will next appear in ""Little Boy"" and ""Grown Ups 2,"" which is due out in July 2013. He's also gearing up to star alongside Kevin Hart in ""Valet Guys,"" the comedy he co-wrote about two valet parking attendants who witness a murder.","James trained for 14 months to play a teacher/fighter in ""Here Comes the Boom""

"Washington (CNN) -- Bill Clinton, while on the campaign trail in 1992, attacked the George H.W. Bush administration for collaborating with ""the butchers of Beijing."" If he won the White House, Clinton promised, he would put human rights first when dealing with the People's Republic of China. But six months after assuming the Oval Office, Clinton tossed those promises out the window, and dealing with China returned to ""business as usual,"" according to William Galston, a former Clinton policy adviser. Clinton isn't alone. Candidates, once elected, usually struggle to live up to their rhetoric on foreign policy. The reason is simple, according to a cadre of international affairs experts: The view from inside the Oval Office is much different from the view from outside. ""It is very difficult for presidential candidates to know even a fraction of the facts and the texture of diplomatic relations between the United States and other countries,"" said Galston. ""Once you get inside the White House, the world looks very different."" With foreign policy about to take center stage on Monday during the last presidential debate of the 2012 cycle, experts say Republican challenger Mitt Romney should be cautious about over-promising. But some say he already has. In Romney's October 8 foreign policy address, the Republican candidate promised to increase sanctions on Iran, help arm Syrian rebels who ""share our values,"" and close the ""daylight"" between Israel and the United States. Robert Pastor, a professor of international relations at American University and a former national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, said Romney joins a long line of candidates who promise too much. ""He will have to wake up if he were elected,"" Pastor said. ""It would be irresponsible for him to implement"" some of those promises, and ""I suspect his new secretary of state would tell him that."" If Romney wants proof of the pitfalls of foreign policy promises, all he has to do is look across the table at Monday's debate at the man he is trying to unseat. During the 2008 campaign, then-candidate Barack Obama advocated for regional conferences with Syria and Iran, said his administration would enter diplomatic talks with governments that his predecessor, President George W. Bush, would not, and pledged to eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Syria has fallen into a long civil war, Iran continues to be a provocateur in the Middle East, and North Korea is still developing its nuclear program. Possibly Obama's biggest broken promise is the one to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ""I have said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo, and I will follow through on that,"" Obama told CBS News' Steve Kroft in 2008. Guantanamo remains open, even though Obama signed an executive order to have it closed two days after he took office in 2009. The issue has largely been put on the back burner in light of issues on the economy. Governing on foreign policy is more difficult than talking tough on it, Galston said, because it hinges on the instability of the globe and can change in the blink of an eye. ""I think this is the reality of political campaigns,"" Galston said. ""You can say things (on the campaign trail) in good faith, based on consulting with experts -- and it is rarely the case that candidates say things about foreign policy that they know not to be the case. The issue is once you get inside the White House, the world looks very different."" Pastor, the former Carter adviser, says these unmet foreign policy promises can be broken up into three distinct groups. There are the promises that are sincere but difficult -- or impossible -- to meet because they require action from other governments. ""Secondly, there are promises that are sincere but cannot be implemented because the political opposition makes it impossible,"" Pastor said. Lastly, according to Pastor, are promises that are made because they are political expedient but prove irresponsible once the ramifications are understood. Presidential history is littered with promises that fall into these categories. During the 2000 campaign, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush promised to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a promise that many of his predecessors had also made. The embassy, however, to this day remains in Tel Aviv. Upon assuming office in 1981, Ronald Reagan promised to get tough and stop the Sandinistas, a left-wing Nicaraguan political party that swept across Central America. The Sandinistas were still around when Reagan left office in 1989 and to this day continue to hold political power in Nicaragua. In 1960, then-Sen. John F. Kennedy used soaring foreign policy rhetoric to help catapult him to the White House at the young age of 43. According to the State Department's Office of the Historian, Kennedy failed to live up to his rhetoric on international affairs. ""The execution of Kennedy's foreign policy did not quite live up to the stirring rhetoric of his inaugural speech. ... In fact, his foreign policy was marred by a string of failures,"" reads the State Department website. In April of 1961, Kennedy had only been in office for a short three months when he called for a meeting with Dwight D. Eisenhower, his predecessor in the office. The Bay of Pigs invasion, a carryover from the Eisenhower administration, had been a massive failure that month and an early blunder by the Kennedy presidency -- even though many attributed the failure to Eisenhower. The Kennedy-Eisenhower relationship had been frosty, at best, after the young senator defeated the former general's vice president, Richard Nixon, in the 1960 campaign. Even though Eisenhower had long viewed Kennedy as naive -- he referred to Kennedy as ""Little Boy Blue"" -- the two put their chilly relationship aside and the sitting president invited the former general to Camp David to review the mistakes in Cuba. According to Eisenhower's notes from the meeting and a number of media reports, the conversation between the new and former president previewed the pitfalls of foreign policy campaign promises: . Kennedy: ""No one knows how tough this job is until he's been in it a few months."" Eisenhower: ""Mr. President. If you will forgive me, I think I mentioned that to you three months ago.""","Candidates often struggle in office to live up to foreign policy promises .

"(CNN) -- This election should have been a walkover for the Republicans. The economy is sluggish and the United States is beset with crises abroad. Yet, Mitt Romney has committed one gaffe after another, almost as if he actually wants to lose. Perhaps the multi-millionaire has decided that the White House is too small for him. On Monday night, Romney was hit with what we might call a ""pre-gaffe"" when a private statement that he made months ago suddenly hit the Web. The video shows Romney apparently dismissing the 47% of Americans who he says don't pay federal income taxes as freeloaders. For someone who is often portrayed as cynical and uncaring, this is not good news. What will we see next? Leaked footage of Romney stealing candy from a baby? There's cause for Republicans to panic. Some commentators are starting to ask, ""Did Romney just lose the election?"" When I first saw the ""47%"" video, I wrote that it had to damage Romney's already poor likeability ratings and maybe even cost him the White House. But, after a couple of days of reflection, I think there's still reason for Republicans to have hope. Not least because the polls point to a closer election than the headlines do. But I'll come to that in a moment. First, it's helpful to put the ""47%"" speech into historical perspective, which suggests that ""gaffes never matter."" Every campaign has a moment when the candidate says something they shouldn't have, and it isn't necessarily the end of the road. Opinion: Romney better off as a Latino? In April 2008, in the middle of his primary race against Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama gave a speech in which he said that poverty caused ""bitter"" people to ""cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them."" His opponents went wild, but this kind of ""cat out of the bag"" statement tends to matter far more to fervent activists than it does to ordinary voters. After all, Obama won the primary and the general election. Four years later, it's only Republican activists who still say they are ""proud to be clinging to my guns and religion"" -- as if the statement has any contemporary relevance. In 2016, Democratic activists will probably be driving around with faded bumper stickers that read, ""47 Percent -- And Proud!"" The rest of us will have long forgotten what that means. Over time, sober analysis might slowly turn in Romney's favor, too. Consider how Obama's words were taken out of context. He was really making a case for why liberals had to renew their efforts to improve people's finances, ""to get people persuaded that we can make progress when there's not evidence of that in their daily lives."" Likewise, Romney was actually arguing that there was no point pitching his low tax policy to the 47% of Americans who already don't pay income taxes because ... they don't pay taxes. What he meant by ""I don't have to worry about them,"" was that he didn't need to court their vote. He wasn't saying that if he saw them begging in the street he'd drive his limo straight on by. In fact, the ""47%"" speech reads a lot better on the page than it sounds on the video. Part of Romney's problem isn't the content of his ideas, but the ubiquitous context of wealth and power. His host was a one-percenter with a taste for extravagant parties, and Romney delivered his line as if sharing the inner workings of a Ponzi scheme. Despite Romney's personality problem, he isn't doing nearly as badly in the polls as the punditry suggests. In fact, the day after the 47% video leaked, Gallup released a poll that showed the president only 1 percentage point ahead of the Republican challenger. Ironically, the pollster also reported that he has surprising support among people with low incomes. This would seem to prove that Obama's convention bounce was only temporary and that he remains vulnerable. More importantly, the public hasn't punished Romney for a serious gaffe he made over Egypt. Critics accused him of jumping the gun when he lambasted a statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Cairo condemning a film considered offensive to Islam -- protests against which later resulted in the death of four Americans in Libya. If they're prepared to forgive him for that snafu, perhaps they'll ignore this one, too. Take a look at the electoral map and you'll see that Obama has momentum in the swing states. But not much. According to RealClearPolitics' average of polls, he's ahead 4.2 percentage points in Ohio, 3 points in Virginia, 2.7 points in Wisconsin, and 1.4 points in Florida. That puts Romney well within striking distance and that's even before he's had a chance to land some punches in the debates. Opinion: How Romney really feels about Republicans . Never underestimate the power of events or the flexibility of polls. We don't know what's going to happen between now and November, and the recent crises in the Middle East show how unsettled things are. Around this point in 1980, Carter was running even with Reagan. Things changed then; things can change now. Ultimately, Romney still has an advantage when it comes to the grand narrative of this campaign. A lot of the 2012 election has been about character and culture -- which candidate do you like best and where do they stand on same-sex marriage or abortion. But voters consistently tell pollsters that the issue they really care about is the economy. As long as they actually vote on that matter -- and as long as unemployment remains high -- Romney is in with a chance. Republicans shouldn't give up hope just yet. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Tim Stanley: Mitt Romney's secretly taped remarks hurt his cause but aren't fatal .

"(CNN) -- Assassinations of high-profile government figures are not new to Lebanon. Some result from gruesome car bombs, ripping through people and buildings along bustling streets in cities like Beirut. For years, when such blasts occurred, Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan led the investigations. He was credited with overhauling his nation's intelligence forces, finding those responsible for targeted killings and preventing fresh attacks. No more. Al-Hassan and at least two others died in a massive explosion Friday in the typically peaceful and cosmopolitan Ashrafiyeh district of East Beirut that he called home. Lebanon on edge after anti-Syrian intel official killed by Beirut car bomb . The attack -- in broad daylight, at one of the capital's busiest intersections -- was just the kind of thing the intelligence official worked so diligently to prevent. But beyond its potential impact on Lebanon's security, al-Hassan's life and death illustrates the deep political and religious fissures within Lebanese society -- fissures that could be widened amid spillover from Syria's bloody civil war. ""The person who was the master of uncovering these kind of things ... is gone,"" said Amal Mudallali, a senior scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center who, like al-Hassan, is affiliated with Lebanon's ""March 14"" movement. ""So unfortunately, the Lebanese are bracing for more assassinations."" Al-Hassan was more than just Lebanon's top intelligence official. He was an icon among many fellow Sunni Muslims, including those aligned with the opposition led by Saad Hariri, for his leadership and efforts in rooting out those responsible for targeted killings in Lebanon. But as much as he was loved by some, others despised him -- especially those backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and those affiliated with Hezbollah, the Shiite militant and political movement that has a prominent role in Lebanon's government. The U.S. government labels it a terrorist organization. ""This is a very polarizing figure,"" said Aram Nerguizian, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank who teaches in Beirut. In his position with Lebanon's Internal Security Forces, al-Hassan tackled one of the nation's bloodiest and politically volatile attacks, which occurred on February 14, 2005, in Beirut's fashionable seaside Corniche district. On that day, an explosive-laden truck detonated as the motorcade of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri -- Saad Hariri's father -- passed by, killing the dignitary and 22 others. As Hariri's chief of protocol, al-Hassan himself might have been among the dead had he not taken that day off to take a university exam. Details from al-Hassan's investigation were shared with U.N. investigators, who concluded the assassination may have been linked to high-ranking Syrian officials (despite denials from Damascus). A U.N. tribunal went on to indict four Hezbollah members, and left the door open for more to be charged, though that group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, blamed Israel for Hariri's death. Al-Hassan spearheaded several other investigations into a series of killings that targeted major anti-Syrian political figures. And he is credited with uncovering an Israeli spy network that involved Lebanese agents, including a top aide to Hezbollah's powerful Christian ally, Michel Aoun. His latest big break, occurring in late August, came with the arrest of a former Lebanese minister and current member of parliament, Michel Samaha. Lebanese security forces claim a recording shows Samaha -- who has close ties with Damascus and is now in jail awaiting trial -- attempting to smuggle in explosives intended to be used in religious and political assassinations. Two Syrian security officers also were charged. ""Unfortunately, today, al-Hassan paid the price for his success,"" Saad Hariri said. Twice in the years after Rafik Hariri's death, al-Hassan had skirted death. The second assassination attempt left one of his top aides, Wissam Eid, dead. With his absence, others within Lebanon's security apparatus will step into his place. Photos: Aftermath of the Beirut blast . But describing Friday as ""a grim day,"" Mudallali said finding someone who can do the same thing as al-Hassan -- whom she lauds for his ""great achievements"" in unraveling complex cases -- will be difficult. ""I don't think Wissam al-Hassan -- somebody with his experience, with his background -- is going to be replaced very easily,"" she said.","Brig. Gen.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge has allowed Arizona to enforce the most controversial part of its politically charged immigration law, the so-called ""show me your papers"" provision. In an order on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton upheld the section allowing authorities, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of people who may be in the United States illegally. The Supreme Court in June tossed out most other aspects of the tough new law but said the part known by critics as the ""show me your papers"" provision could go into effect, at least for now. The hot-button immigration issue is a major attack line in this year's presidential campaign with Republicans, led by Mitt Romney, accusing President Barack Obama of failing to devise a comprehensive strategy to deal with illegal immigration. Arizona is the nation's most heavily traveled corridor for illegal immigration and smuggling. The Justice Department said Arizona's population of two million Latinos includes an estimated 400,000 there illegally, and 60% to 70% of deportations or ""removals"" involve Mexican nationals. The Pew Hispanic Center recently issued a report that found that Mexican immigration to the United States has come to a standstill. However, the debate continues as more than 10 million unauthorized immigrants -- from Mexico and other countries -- continue to live in the United States. Bolton's decision was in response to a suit that followed the Supreme Court ruling by a number of individuals and civil rights groups who said enforcement would lead to racial profiling. It would be up to Arizona to decide when to enforce the measure and there was no sign that would occur immediately. It was not clear if the coalition of civil rights groups and individuals would appeal Tuesday's ruling or wait to see how the law is enforced. What's next in the Arizona immigration battle? ""There is a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how it will be enforced,"" said Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in late June, making clear that Arizona authorities must comply with federal law in conducting the immigration status checks or face further constitutional challenges. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican who led the fight to pass the overall law, applauded the latest court order, saying it gives law enforcement ""one more tool"" to use ""in collaborating with federal authorities to reduce the crime and other impacts associated with illegal immigration."" She said the law ""must be enforced efficiently, effectively and in harmony with the Constitution and civil rights."" The American Civil Liberties Union, which had asked Bolton to block the provision, said it was prepared to continue challenging the law by documenting instances of racial profiling throughout the state, Alessandra Soler, executive director of the legal group in Arizona, said in a statement. The Supreme Court struck down other challenged parts of the Arizona law, upholding the broad authority of the federal government to set immigration policy and laws. Among provisions tossed by the high court was a measure that authorized police to arrest illegal immigrants without a warrant where ""probable cause"" existed that they committed a public offense making them removable from the country. The Arizona law generated immediate controversy after it was signed by Brewer in April 2010, prompting an Obama administration challenge. Supporters of the Arizona measure contend the federal government has failed to enforce existing immigration laws, leaving it to states to take their own steps to deal with mounting economic and social problems caused by illegal immigrants. Administration officials have said the Department of Homeland Security expects increased requests from Arizona police to check the immigration status of suspects. However, they said the department will get involved only in high-priority cases. Several other states followed Arizona's lead by passing laws meant to deter illegal immigrants. Similar laws are under challenge in lower courts in Georgia, Alabama, Utah, Indiana and South Carolina. Arizona's appeal is the first to reach the Supreme Court. At issue was whether states have any authority to step in to regulate immigration matters or whether that is the exclusive role of the federal government. In dry legal terms, this constitutional issue is known as pre-emption. The district court case is U.S. v. Arizona (10-cv-1413).

"(CNN) -- Criminal investigators from the Department of Justice and the Food and Drug Administration were at a Massachusetts pharmaceutical company on Tuesday with a search warrant, a company spokesman said. Federal officials say that more issues have been reported with drugs from the New England Compounding Center, or NECC, which has been linked to a deadly multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis. FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson confirmed that criminal investigators were on site, but declined to answer questions regarding a warrant. U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz similarly said that personnel from her office and law enforcement partners were investigating allegations concerning the company. She added that it was ""entirely premature"" to suggest what the results of that investigation may be. Nineteen people have died from the noncontagious meningitis associated with injections of a contaminated steroid produced by the NECC. Are my drugs coming from a compounding center? Paul Cirel, an attorney for the NECC, said of the investigation Tuesday, ""It is difficult to understand the purpose of this search, since we have been clear that New England Compounding Center would provide, and has provided, anything requested. We've been clear that warrants weren't needed; asking would have produced the same result. Nevertheless, we continue to offer our cooperation."" As part of the ongoing investigation into the center, a patient with possible meningitis has been identified who received an injection of another NECC product, triamcinolone acetonide, the Food and Drug Administration said Monday. Also, a fungal infection from Aspergillus was reported in a transplant patient who received cardioplegic solution from NECC, the FDA said. Cardioplegic solution is used to induce paralysis of the heart during open-heart surgery. ""An investigation of this patient is ongoing; and there may be other explanations for their Aspergillus infection,"" the FDA said. The health care facility initially reported two transplant patients having infections from Aspergillus, the FDA said. FDA urges patients to be 'vigilant' The heart transplant patient received the cardioplegic solution in August, and the patient who received the triamcinolone injection was treated on September 19 -- both before NECC recalled its products, according to an official at the federal Centers for Disease Control, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject. The NECC announced a recall of all its products October 6. The FDA said ""the sterility of any injectable drugs ... produced by NECC (is) of significant concern, and out of an abundance of caution, patients who received these products should be alerted to the potential risk of infection."" The CDC reported Wednesday the number of meningitis cases increased from 233 to 245, spread across 15 states. There are two cases of a ""peripheral joint infection"" that specifically affects a joint such as a knee, hip, shoulder or elbow, officials said. The cases have been linked to injections of a contaminated steroid, methylprednisolone acetate, produced by the NECC. Some 14,000 people may have received the injections, the CDC estimated last week. A Minnesota woman, Barbe Puro, filed a lawsuit Thursday -- which may be the first from the outbreak -- against tthe NECC. In it, she alleges she was injected in September with a tainted batch of steroids from the NECC. Meanwhile, members of Congress expanded an investigation into the outbreak. In a letter to the director of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy, leaders of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce noted the FDA sent the NECC a warning letter in 2006 ""detailing significant violations witnessed"" by investigators the previous year. Woman sues over outbreak . Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick also accused the NECC last week of misleading regulators and operating outside its license by shipping large batches of drugs nationwide. Plus, the state's pharmacy board mandated that all Massachusetts compounding pharmacies sign affidavits stating they are complying with state regulations requiring compounders to mix medications for specific patients. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by an infection, frequently with bacteria or a virus, but it can also be caused by less common pathogens, such as fungi in this case, according to the CDC. Steroid injections common for back pain sufferers . Fungal meningitis is very rare and, unlike viral and bacterial meningitis, is not contagious. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said fungal infections are not usually mild. He said when a fungus invades small blood vessels, it can cause them to clot or bleed, which can lead to symptoms of small strokes. In addition to typical meningitis symptoms such as headache, fever, nausea and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness and discomfort from bright lights. Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms, the CDC says. CDC: Tests may not detect meningitis fungus .

"(Mashable) -- Siri may have her critics, but Apple's talkative virtual assistant is definitely useful for some functions, like checking the weather and texting. Nuance, which works with Apple on voice control, now plans to take Siri-like abilities to more apps. The product is called Nina, and it'll let businesses build voice capabilities right into their apps -- iOS or Android -- via a software development kit (SDK). Nuance says it's the first voice assistant with an SDK (Siri still doesn't have one), and Nina obviously has access to all of Nuance's data on the industries that use its tech: banks, airlines, hotels, retailers and more. Nina is aimed at the enterprise, essentially taking the automated call center functions you might encounter when calling an 800 number, and putting it into an app. Mashable.com: Here's the most stunning photo of Mars the world has ever seen . ""Nina takes natural-language understanding, and it provides a way for a developer to add that into an app,"" says Robert Weideman, executive vice president of Nuance's enterprise division. In a demo at Mashable's offices, Nuance reps showed us a mock banking app equipped with Nina. Responding to commands like ""Pay my bill,"" or even ""Pay the full balance on my Visa bill on August first,"" Nina performed tasks that would probably take complex navigation in one step. Mashable.com: What does Siri know about the iPhone 5? Nina is dependent on Nuance's Voice Assistant Cloud, so she won't work without a network connection. And as we discovered in the demo, her speed and ability to parse longer phrases depend on the quality of that connection. Using a Verizon 3G modem, Nina had trouble figuring out the longer bill-paying command above, but on Wi-Fi she executed it almost instantly. Nina also happens to sound almost exactly like Siri, though Nuance says businesses will be able to choose from 40 different voices, and even be able to customize it with their own voice ""persona,"" if they have one. One of the major differences between Nina and Siri is voice biometrics, which means Nina can actually tell that it's you talking, and not someone who just picked up your phone. This can act as both a security and convenience feature -- after all, passwords become redundant if the app can tell it's the right person speaking just by voice. Mashable.com: Google ditches apps for Teams and 3 other products . ""For the first time on a mobile device, our virtual assistant doesn't just understand what you said and what you want, we can actually understand who said it,"" says Weideman.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Militant sources in Gaza tell CNN that a shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missile was used to try to shoot down an Israeli helicopter flying east of Gaza last week. It is significant because it is the first time a weapon of this type has been used against an Israeli aircraft, though the missile did not manage to hit its target. Hamas, which controls Gaza, has not commented on the incident. The weapon is said to be a Strela SA-7 and was smuggled in from the Sinai desert but originally came from Libya, according to a source in Gaza. Libya has been grappling with a huge number of unaccounted for weaponry since the revolution that toppled its dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, and left everything from mines and mortars to anti-aircraft missiles in the hands of its citizenry. No group has taken responsibility for firing the surface-to-air missile from Gaza. So far the Israeli military has declined comment and has not publicly acknowledged the provocation. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a senior Israeli Army official told CNN there has been a significant change in the kind of weaponry being used by militant groups in Gaza since the Arab Spring. The weapons are more powerful and sophisticated than have been used in times past. In the past week, there has been an increase in rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel and subsequent air strikes by Israel on targets in Gaza. Israeli airstrike targets operatives in Gaza .

"(Wired) -- Of all the things Felix Baumgartner had to worry about while pursuing his dream of skydiving from 120,000 feet, the one that almost stopped him cold was ... Claustrophobia. ""Fearless Felix"" got a bit freaked out by the pressurized suit he'll wear during his ascent and, more importantly, his supersonic descent from 23 miles up -- now tentatively scheduled for Sunday or Monday. Getting over his discomfort was a key hurdle to clear as the Austrian adventurer set out to make the highest skydive ever. Opinion: The space adventure you can't miss . To that end, Red Bull, his sponsor, called in Dr. Michael Gervais. He's a sports psychologist who specializes in high-performance and ""extreme"" sports like, say, falling out of the sky at the speed of sound. Red Bull wanted him to psychologically evaluate Baumgartner and help him conquer his fear. It must be said that Baumgartner is no stranger to fear or death-defying situations. The 43-year-old former military parachutist has made more than 2,500 jumps, including dives from the Petronas Towers and the Taipei 101 skyscraper. Clearly he has learned how to put aside fear, even use it to his advantage. ""Fear has become a friend of mine,"" he said in a statement. ""It's what prevents me from stepping too far over the line. On a mission like this, you need to be mentally fit and have total control over what you do, and I'm preparing very thoroughly."" But his plan to break the unofficial record retired Col. Joe Kittinger set with a leap from 102,800 feet in 1960 revealed a fear Baumgartner hadn't felt before. And it had nothing to do with coming down from such a height, but suiting up to reach it. To prevent a potentially fatal condition called ebullism, Baumgartner must wear a custom-made space suit and helmet. Although the suit, based on those worn by high-altitude reconnaissance pilots, is designed to maximize maneuverability and visibility, it constricts his movement and vision. He'd never worn a pressurized space suit before, and he felt the claustrophobia â which, according to a New York Times account, was so severe it brought on panic attacks â threatened to bring the mission to a screeching halt. Skydiver to try again for record free fall . That's when Gervais stepped in. After determining that Baumgartner was entirely committed to making the jump and not using claustrophobia as an excuse to back out, he set to work. (Baumgartner, who is in Roswell, New Mexico preparing for Sunday's launch, could not be reached for comment, but Red Bull confirmed Gervais' account for Wired.) Over the course of three days, Gervais determined Baumgartner didn't have quite the right tools to manage his mind and emotions in the face of so great a risk. That's where the suit became an issue: It was a symbol of his not having complete control of the situation. To combat this, Gervais said, Baumgartner had to reconnect with his vision. He'd become too focused on the suit, not the goal he hoped to reach wearing it. Simply put, he needed to get his eyes back on the prize. ""When we are in a high stakes or intense situation, it's not uncommon for our minds to jump forward, going to the next moment and worrying about what happens when this moment doesn't go well,"" Gervais said. ""What happens is we give 50 percent to something that doesn't exist yet and 50 to this moment."" To reconnect with his vision, Baumgartner needed to reconnect to what Gervais called his hidden journey â what the jump meant to him, beyond being the first person to skydive from so great a height, or being the first person to exceed the speed of sound (about 700 mph at that altitude) in free fall. The hidden journey, he said, is much more basic: Baumgartner wants to go somewhere no one has ever been. Gervais taught Baumgartner how to better manage his mind and body under pressure. Baumgartner mastered something Gervais called ""combat breathing,"" or deep breathing, to calm himself. And he developed positive self-talk, using great care in choosing the words he used when talking to himself and others about the jump. ""Self-talk is considered one of the most powerful mental skills,"" Gervais said. ""Self talk is the foundation for self-confidence and self-esteem."" To sharpen these skills, Gervais put Baumgartner in increasingly uncomfortable situations â which he would not specify â and made him try to gain control of his body and mind. ""We cultivated a situation to move a person to the edge of panic,"" said Gervais. ""Imagine doing that repeatedly over 30 hours of training and at the end of it, you've got full control of how your mind works, and you breathe freely in those moments."" To further help Baumgartner, Kittinger â a trusted adviser who has worked closely will Baumgartner over the years â will be the only voice the Austrian will hear on the radio. ""Felix trusts me because I know what he's going through â and I'm the only one who knows what he's going through,"" the retired colonel told the Times. His flight team also devised a detailed pre-launch procedure to help occupy Baumgartner's mind before lift-off. Once Baumgartner's mind was at ease, Gervais had to convince the Stratos team the problem had been solved. Because his ascent, in a space capsule dangling beneath a 55-story helium balloon, would take about 3.5 hours, and the descent about 20 minutes, he had to demonstrate 4.5 to five hours of proficiency in the suit. ""Then they would feel comfortable that Felix as a man and an athlete could manage himself in a space where no one else has been,"" Gervais said. We already know Baumgartner passed the test, because he made successful test jumps from 13 miles up in March and 18 miles up in July. That said, the repeated weather delays â the jump has been twice delayed by high wind â can't be helping the mental strain, but Gervais is confident that Baumgartner has what it takes to stay focused on the task at hand. ""He's somebody that is willing to commit everything to his vision,"" added Gervais. ""Everything is on the line. It's a great emblem for all of us to find value and fully commit to a vision.""

"(CNN) -- Ghanaian officials swore in a new president Tuesday, hours after the death of the West African nation's leader. John Evans Atta Mills died suddenly at a military hospital Tuesday afternoon a few hours after becoming ill, Chief of Staff John Henry Martey Newman said in a statement. He was 68. In a ceremony broadcast on state television, John Dramani Mahama -- formerly Ghana's vice president -- became the country's new president and ordered that flags be flown at half-staff for a week. ""This is the saddest day in our nation's history. Tears have engulfed our nation and we're deeply saddened and distraught. I never imagined that one day I will address our nation in such difficult circumstances,"" Mahama said. ""I'm personally devastated. I've lost a father, I've lost a friend, I've lost a mentor and a senior comrade."" Opinion: Mills' election victory was a 'victory for democracy in Africa' Officials did not specify what caused Mills' death. The president had denied rumors about his health for months. ""Does my continued living pose a threat to some people?"" he told reporters at a January event, according to the state-run Ghana News Agency. On June 25, he returned from a medical checkup in the United States, the news agency reported. Mills was a former law professor and a tax expert. He was Ghana's vice president from 1997 to 2000. Before his political career, he taught at the University of Ghana and also was a visiting lecturer at Temple University in Pennsylvania and Leiden University in the Netherlands. Mills ran for president unsuccessfully in 2000 and 2004 before narrowly winning a runoff in 2009. Mills' death came several days after he celebrated his 68th birthday. He had said he would run for re-election in December. In a statement read on his behalf by Ghana's information minister Monday, Mills said his government had focused on developing the nation's economy, according to the Ghana News Agency. ""We made a promise to expand our country's infrastructural base in support of our economy take-off,"" the statement said. ""We also decided to invest in the people of our country so as to make them competitive both locally and abroad."" Mahama said Tuesday that Mills was a ""prince of peace"" who ""brought a distinctive insight into Ghanaian politics."" The opposition New Patriotic Party expressed condolences in a statement Tuesday. ""We join the nation in mourning this sad loss to Ghana,"" the statement said. U.S. President Barack Obama met with Mills when he visited Ghana in July 2009. Obama praised the country as a model for democracy and stability when Mills visited Washington this year. ""Ghana has become a wonderful success story economically on the continent,"" Obama said. ""In part because of the initiatives of President Mills, you've seen high growth rates over the last several years. Food productivity and food security is up. There's been strong foreign investment."" In a statement Tuesday, British Prime Minister David Cameron described Mills as ""a tireless defender of democracy in West Africa and across the continent."" Part of a former British colony, Ghana was among the first African countries to gain independence, in 1957. It endured a series of coups before a military dictator, Jerry Rawlings, took power in 1981. Rawlings led Ghana through a transition to democracy about 10 years later. Mahama, 53, is a former member of Ghana's parliament who has served as director of communication for the National Democratic Congress party.

"San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- A fire at a fuel storage facility that burned for three days and forced hundreds of  Puerto Rico residents from their homes has been extinguished, fire officials said Sunday evening. But some of the tanks continued to smolder and crews stood ready to fight another outbreak. Hundreds of firefighters battled the blaze, which began with an explosion at the Caribbean Petroleum Corp. facility in Puerto Rico's Bayamon municipality, near San Juan, early Friday. The initial explosion shook the ground with the force of a 2.8-magnitude earthquake, authorities said, and flames shot into the air while plumes of thick, black smoke hovered over the region. As the fire died, reporters and officials were able to witness firsthand the extent of the damage. Seventeen tanks were destroyed by flames and the initial explosion. Agents from the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were investigating to determine whether the explosion was an act of sabotage. The FBI is investigating graffiti found on two San Juan tunnels that referred to a fire, Special Agent Harry Rodriguez said Friday. A spray-painted message on the tunnels, less than three miles apart, said: ""Boom, fire, RIP, Gulf, Soul, ACNF."" Caribbean Petroleum owns the Gulf Oil brand, but Rodriguez said he did not know what ACNF referred to. Agents were at the storage facility and treating it as a crime scene, which is a routine designation. Puerto Rico's governor, Luis Fortuno, said the main priority of his government is to counter any long-term effects of air and water pollution caused by the fire. Representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency had been checking air quality near the fuel depot. ""We're not finding levels that would be of concern,"" EPA spokeswoman Bonnie Bellow said. She said the fire had been so intense that it was ""burning off chemicals that are part of the fuel."" About 600 displaced people were in shelters on Sunday night, but many were being sent home. Dr. Lorenzo Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's health secretary, said everyone at shelters and all the emergency personnel were vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus as a precaution, given their close proximity to each other. He said tests have been conducted on the air and water, and the results showed no reason for concern. President Obama declared an emergency in Puerto Rico, which frees up federal aid. Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. Fortuno said the blaze has cost the island at least $6.4 million. The governor sought to allay fears over gasoline supplies. Caribbean Petroleum owns 200 gas stations on the island and several inland distribution facilities, and supplies much of the island's fuel. Puerto Rico will receive 3.6 million gallons of regular gasoline, more than 1 million gallons of premium gasoline and more than 1 million gallons of diesel fuel to help make up for what may have been lost, Fortuno said. The company has had violations of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the main law in the United States that deals with the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, according to EPA spokeswoman Bellow. Caribbean Petroleum is under a corrective-action plan, she said. CNN's Rafael Romo in San Juan and Arthur Brice in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","Fire extinguished three days after explosion at Puerto Rico fuel depot .

The report, ""Afghanistan in 2012: A Survey of the Afghan People,"" found public opinion to be the most optimistic since the annual survey began in 2004. Fifty-two percent of the respondents felt that the country was moving in the right direction, compared to 46% in 2011. Improvements in security and reconstruction were the most cited reasons for the improved outlook. The Foundation interviewed nearly 6,300 Afghans from all 34 provinces, gauging their perception on security, governance, economy and other issues relating to the country's development. ""This survey helps to give us a sense of citizens' priorities, needs, and views,"" said Abdullah Ahmadzai, The Asia Foundation deputy country representative in Afghanistan, in a news release. ""We hope these findings help bridge the gap in understanding between the international community, the Afghan government, and local communitiesÃ¢â¬âdialogue necessary for Afghanistan's long-term prospects."" Over half of the respondents feel that their families are more prosperous today than in the Taliban era and access to schools has increased. Most respondents agreed with the government's national reconciliation and negotiation efforts with the Taliban. But concerns remain. ""It is good that the government is putting efforts on talks with the Taliban, but I am always afraid that if talks become positive and the Taliban come (back) to the government, would we still hold our rights or not?"" Habibi said. ""But generally I think we are moving towards a right direction."" In the 2012 report, fewer Afghans said they experienced violence or crime over the past year, with a significant decline in violence and crime. ""I feel safe in Kabul, especially in my shop because it is not on a main road or near a military compound, "" a 29-year-old shopkeeper told CNN, who asked not to be named. ""But I don't feel safe once I go to downtown or to any of the high profile areas of Kabul."" Attitudes toward women also appear positive. Nearly nine in 10 respondents agreed that women and men should have equal educational opportunities. Two thirds of Afghans surveyed say they think women should be allowed to work outside the home. Despite the sense of optimism in the report, insecurity continues to be the biggest worry. Respondents cited security issues (28%), unemployment (27%), and corruption (25%) as the three biggest problems facing Afghanistan. Two-thirds of those interviewed said that local employment opportunities are bad. ""I don't think Taliban threat is worse than corruption in Afghanistan,"" the Kabul shopkeeper said. ""It is the corruption, which is taking Afghanistan towards calamity as we have been seeing in the last decade."" The report comes at a crucial time when the NATO led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is in the process of transferring the country's security responsibilities to the Afghan National Forces. Afghanistan is also preparing for its next presidential election, scheduled for April 2014. Not all are hopeful for the future. Jan Mohammad Parwani, a 35-year-old father of three who sells mobile phone credit cards on the streets in Kabul, said he wants to leave the country. ""I was really hopeful for the future of my country and the direction it was moving to when I returned from Iran with my family seven years ago, but now I regret (it),"" Parwani said. ""I wish I was still living as a refugee in Iran. ""I know Iranian government doesn't like us Afghans and they don't treat us in a nice way, but at least I was earning enough and also there was no fear of suicide attacks, roadside bombs and rockets.""","The Asia Foundation releases ""Afghanistan in 2012: A Survey of the Afghan People""

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama must do well in the debate Monday or he risks losing the national security advantage that Democrats have struggled so hard to regain. Obama was able to ward off Mitt Romney's attacks about Libya in the second debate, when Romney tripped up on one word, ""terror,"" which contradicted the public record. But tonight, the Republican will have 90 minutes to take on the president's national security program in more systematic fashion. With last week's capture of a terrorist who was planning to bomb the New York Federal Reserve and a brutal bombing of civilians in Syria, national security issues are heating up. Democrats stand a lot to lose. For several decades, the public trusted Republicans on the issue of national security. Since Vietnam, Republicans hammered away at Democrats as being weak on defense and unwilling to do what was necessary to protect the nation. In 2004, President George W. Bush eviscerated his opponent, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, with this argument. Though Kerry began the Democratic Convention by highlighting his credentials as a Vietnam veteran, the Republicans developed an entire campaign around the question of whether Democrats could be trusted to prosecute the war on terrorism. For all of Obama's struggles with the economy, Democrats have made huge strides in the past six years. The reversal of partisan fortunes began toward the end of George W. Bush's presidency, when the White House was struggling to avoid total chaos in Iraq, a war that was highly unpopular. Democrats took control of Congress in the 2006 elections, partially in response to Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq and his handling of it. In the 2008 presidential election, Obama made Bush's war a centerpiece of his campaign. He promised to bring the war to an end and to reverse those components of the war on terrorism that had violated civil liberties. The strategy was successful. As president, Obama continued to neutralize many of his critics. He left intact most of Bush's counterterrorism program, in some cases intensifying operations such as drone airstrikes against al Qaeda, and he made it difficult for conservatives to say that he was not doing enough. After Osama bin Laden was killed by special operations forces, even Republicans had to praise the courageous operation. Obama accelerated the war in Afghanistan and brought the controversial war in Iraq to a close. While many on the left have been frustrated that Obama retained so much of the status quo, politically the president positioned himself as the person who was tougher on defense. During the Democratic Convention, he railed against Romney for having failed to salute the troops in his acceptance speech and for a series of embarrassing gaffes that took place when Romney traveled overseas this summer. In September, Pew found that 53% of those surveyed trusted Obama to make wise decisions on foreign policy, compared with 38% for Romney. But in recent weeks, the advantage seems to be eroding. The outbreak of violence in the Middle East and the White House's contradictory statements about a deadly al Qaeda attack at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, have opened up space for Republicans to go after the administration on this front. Vice President Joe Biden's statements during his debate against Paul Ryan that neither he nor the president knew about security threats, along with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton taking responsibility, certainly did not help. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told Fox News, ""I think it's very laudable that she should throw herself under the bus. But first of all, responsibility for American security doesn't lie with the secretary of state. It lies with the president of the United States. It's either willful deception or a degree of incompetence and failure to understand fundamental facts on the ground. ... Either one of those is obviously totally unacceptable."" Obama has tried to push back against all of this criticism, including his statement in the second debate that he himself has ultimate responsibility, but the Republicans' singular attacks have continued nonetheless. Administration officials must be careful if they think there is no risk. Aside from 2008, there are many years in which parties lost their advantage on national security. In 1952, Democrats still thought of themselves as the party that had won World War II and set up America's Cold War strategy against the Soviet Union. Republicans hit back when Adlai Stevenson faced off against Dwight Eisenhower, a World War II military hero. Republicans attacked Democrats for being weak on fighting communism, for a military stalemate in Korea and for having allowed China to fall to communism in 1949. Eisenhower won the presidency, and Republicans took control of Congress. Just a few years later, Republicans saw their advantage slip away. Though Eisenhower was an immensely popular president and one who, as Evan Thomas shows in his masterful new book ""Ike's Bluff,"" demonstrated immense skills at diplomacy, John F. Kennedy ran as more of a hawk than Eisenhower's vice president, Richard Nixon, did in 1960. He built on arguments that Democrats had made in the 1950s, that Republicans were so focused on balancing the budget they were not spending enough on defense to win the presidency. ""Our security,"" he said, ""has declined more rapidly than over any comparable period in our history -- in terms of defensive strength and retaliatory power, in terms of our alliances, in terms of our scientific effort and reputation."" Republicans struggled again in 1992 when President George H.W. Bush watched as his advantage, which had apparently been cemented with the successful Operation Desert Storm in 1990-1991 that resulted in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, slip away. While Bush did not devote enough attention to the economy, it was also Saddam Hussein's continued military attacks on his opponents in U.N. cease-fire zones that seemed to demonstrate Bush's victory had been incomplete. ""It's like any other bully,"" presidential candidate Bill Clinton said then, ""you send 'em mixed messages, they'll take advantage of you every time."" The politics of national security is tricky, and uncontrollable events can easily push politics in a different direction. Obama will have to answer some of the tough questions that have emerged, and this time Romney is going to be prepared to handle them more effectively and to show that his overall agenda still offers the U.S. the best path forward. Monday's debate can have a big impact, not just on the outcome in November, but on how the public thinks about whom they should trust when it comes to national security.

"(CNN) -- A violent rash of fast-moving storms churned north Saturday, ripping off roofs, toppling trees and pushing the three-day death toll to 26 as possible tornadoes moved into the mid-Atlantic states. More than 100 twisters were spotted across the region, according to the National Weather Service, which reported seven casualties in North Carolina. Three people in Raleigh were killed in mobile homes that were destroyed, the weather service said. It reported two people died near Ammon, North Carolina. One person was killed in the Bladenboro area and another in the Benson and Black Creek area, the weather service said. North Carolina State Rep. Mike Stone reported two additional deaths in Lee County. Julia Jarema, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management, said the state suffered multiple fatalities but declined to give a specific number. The ""destructive"" and ""extremely dangerous"" tornado had barreled into North Carolina early Saturday evening, prompting emergency warnings for much of the central part of the state. Two rotating storms triggered tornado watches and warnings up through the Richmond, Virginia, Washington and Baltimore areas, according to the National Weather Service. CNN affiliate WTVD broadcast images of damaged homes and vehicles in Smithfield, North Carolina, as local residents and emergency workers surveyed the damage. In South Carolina, a tornado cut through Berkeley County, destroying a church and injuring six people, the weather service said. ""We're expecting large violent tornadoes that are going to stay on the ground for a long period of time,"" said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. ""This is a high-risk day,"" she added. ""We only get a handful of days like this every year."" Meanwhile, emergency crews in Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama worked to assess the damage as the storm system moved north through the Carolinas and up into southern Virginia. On Friday, Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley declared a state of emergency after reports of tornado touchdowns in at least six counties. Multiple injuries were reported in Sumter and Marengo counties, with at least one fatality in the latter, he said. Three people were also killed in Autauga County after fallen trees crashed into mobile homes in the area, police said. Three additional deaths were reported in Washington County, said Yasamie August, spokeswoman for the Alabama Emergency Management Agency. Two other deaths were previously reported in Oklahoma and seven in Arkansas. In Greene County, Mississippi, one death and six injuries were reported, officials said. Flood warnings were issued across portions of western Alabama Saturday, as earlier rains raised water levels along the Tombigbee River, the weather service said. Mississippi Lt. Gov. Phil Bryant and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin also declared states of emergency Friday for 14 Mississippi counties and 26 Oklahoma counties, respectively. But by Saturday, hazardous weather warnings were taken down across the states, the weather service reported. The city of Clinton, Mississippi, suffered ""extensive damage"" when a tornado touched down, according to Mississippi's Emergency Management Agency. The city's mayor said no one was injured in the storm, which tore the roof from a hotel and caused major damage to a bank and numerous homes. It narrowly missed an elementary school and a church daycare center packed with about 650 children between them, she added. ""We have a lot to be grateful for,"" Mayor Rosemary Aultman said. ""It could have been a lot worse."" The storm also tossed cars on Interstate 20, Aultman said. The tornado in Clinton was one of several reported Friday in Mississippi and Alabama that cut a wide path of destruction. CNN affiliate WAPT in Jackson, Mississippi, showed video of the destroyed home of a teacher at Hinds Community College. Several of her students were at the house, helping to clean and salvage what they could from the wreckage. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" said one student. ""My heart dropped because it hurt me to see my teacher's home like this. ... I know it's hurting her, but she's being strong about it."" Numerous power poles were snapped in Jackson along the storm's path, leaving more than 23,400 customers without power, utility company Entergy Mississippi said. In Alabama, tens of thousands of fans gathered for a weekend of races at the Talladega Superspeedway, which had been under a tornado watch until 9 p.m. Friday . Some 30,000 people camped out, some in tents, on the infield of the speedway, said Steve Dover, spokesman for the Talladega County Emergency Management Agency. Thousands more were seated in the grandstands, he said. By Saturday, the severe weather had relented, allowing the Superspeedway to open its gates to waiting fans, according to Talladega spokeswoman Hannah Kinderknechd. A tornado watch remained in effect until 9 p.m. Saturday for eastern North Carolina. The storms were the latest in a round of severe weather that has hit parts of the Midwest and South since Thursday. They left a trail of downed trees and power lines, scattered cars and crushed homes as it moved east.

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- A top aide to the Rwandan president is in German custody for her alleged role in a 1994 assassination that sparked the Rwandan genocide, the German Foreign Ministry said Monday. Rose Kabuye is suspected of participating in downing of a plane carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana. Rose Kabuye was arrested Saturday at the Frankfurt airport while on a private visit, the ministry said. She is awaiting extradition to France, it said. Rwanda's government issued a statement saying Kabuye is innocent of the charges, and that she is ready to face trial in France. ""The government of Rwanda believes that this is a political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the government,"" the statement said. She is one of nine aides to Rwandan President Paul Kagame that Europe is seeking to arrest on charges of plotting the assassination of the then-Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana in April 1994. A French judge ruled in 2006 that legal proceedings could proceed against Kagame and his nine aides, which prompted Rwanda to break its diplomatic ties with France. Habyarimana and Burundi's former leader Cyprien Ntaryamira were killed when their plane was shot down in April 1994, a move that fueled the genocide in Rwanda by Hutu extremists against mostly Tutsis. About 800,000 people were killed.","Aide to Rwandan president held over assassination that sparked genocide .

"(CNN) -- CNN asked a Democrat, Hilary Rosen, and a Republican, Will Cain, to offer advice to the opposing party's candidate for Monday's final presidential debate. Will Cain's advice for President Obama . Be prepared to answer one question: Why, for almost two weeks after the attacks on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, did your administration give the American people the impression that the attack was part of a spontaneous protest over an offensive video? This is not criticism veiled as advice. Monday night's debate will largely focus on foreign policy. If that question is not asked, it will be journalistic malpractice by moderator Bob Schieffer and debate malpractice by Mitt Romney. 5 things to watch in tonight's debate . Malpractice is exactly what Romney committed in the last debate by bickering over whether the word ""terrorism"" was uttered in the Rose Garden. Who cares what happened in the Rose Garden? The picture that Susan Rice and Jay Carney painted was clear and wrong. There was no protest over a video. There was no protest at all. It could be that initial intelligence wrongly suggested it was a spontaneous attack in response to a video and that even now the nature of the attack isn't fully clear, as The Washington Post reported on Friday. But within hours of the attack there were contradictory reports. And as reported by The Daily Beast's Eli Lake, those initial reports were soon put in doubt. Whatever the answer, Obama should expect the question to be asked, and respond not with outrage, but accountability. Get instant updates with CNN's live blog . Romney will try to draw clear distinctions over how he would handle Iran, Afghanistan, and China. Most of his criticism will revolve around rhetoric. The theme: Romney will be strong, Obama weak. On this Romney runs the risk of looking petty in questioning the burdens and respect that accompany the title commander in chief. But this one question is about truth and accountability. Obama will need an answer. Not for Romney. For the American people. And it will be asked. Oh yeah, mention Osama bin Laden at some point too. 13 reasons to watch the last debate on CNN's platforms and nowhere else . Hilary Rosen's advice for Mitt Romney . A debate on foreign policy for most Americans is, let's face it, like eating your peas. You know it matters, but you just can't get too excited about about it. In a way, perhaps that is as it should be. If Americans felt their safety was particularly threatened by global events, people would be much more engaged in the policy discussion that will take place Monday night. Of course there are grave issues many parts of the world: the seemingly never-ending threat to Israel from Iran and others, North Korea, trade deficits with China, a weak economy in Europe, and pockets of anti-Western terrorism in many parts of the Middle East and North Africa. And the United States has much at stake in the outcomes of them or in shaping the ongoing crises. But the reality is also that we have spent billions of dollars in two wars over the last 12 years, and President Obama has kept his promise to bring those wars to an end and to focus his effort on keeping America safe. CNN/Google Campaign Explorer: Ads, money and travel . So how does Mitt Romney get an edge over the president in a foreign policy debate? My view is that he must simply look like a commander in chief for the future. In an effort to distinguish himself from Obama, Romney has made some big mistakes with regard to foreign policy. Romney's biggest mistake may simply be in his attitude. In short, he acts like a leader from the 1950s who is still trying to prove to the world that America is not just the best country, but the boss of the world. And in 2012, that just doesn't fly. Are we the leader of the free world? Yes. Are we a nation that should continue to share our democratic values with the world? Yes. Can we control everything that happens in the world? No -- and we shouldn't try. Simply put, we can't afford it and we don't need to. So when Romney blusters on about how much tougher he would be than Obama, in an effort to distinguish a foreign policy that isn't very distinguishable, he should pay careful attention to the fact that were he to be president, acting so aggressively would carry expectations that he follow through. And the American people do not want a president who picks fights around the world. My advice to Romney is to ""chill"" a little in the debate. Don't act like you will be the world's bully. Act thoughtful and well, presidential -- like our actual president. How foreign policy hits close to home . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Republican Will Cain to Obama: Explain in detail the attack in Benghazi, Libya .
Cain: Of course, Obama should point to killing of Osama bin Laden .
Democrat Hilary Rosen: Romney must behave like a commander in chief .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- New U.S. commander Gen. David Petraeus arrived in Afghanistan Friday, a day marred by violence in a part of the troubled nation that was relatively peaceful a year ago. Petraeus arrived at NATO headquarters in Kabul in the evening, the International Security Assistance Force said. Earlier in the day, Taliban militants in the northern city of Kunduz attacked the compound of a U.S. aid agency subcontractor, killing at least five people and wounding 20 others, government officials said. On the day of Petraeus' arrival, the brazen attack served as a grim reminder for international forces that they face a difficult challenge in overcoming the Taliban insurgency, which many say has been gaining momentum. A year ago, places like Kunduz were regarded as safe -- but not anymore. The pre-dawn raid started when a suicide bomber on foot and another in a car detonated at the gate of the compound, said Mohammad Omar, the provincial governor. Following the initial assault, four gunmen stormed the facility, firing machine guns and throwing hand grenades, according to Omar. Three of the dead were foreigners -- a Filipino, a Briton and a German, Omar said. State Department spokesman Mark Toner told CNN that two American contractors were among the wounded and had been taken to the Provincial Reconstruction Team hospital in Kunduz province. The six-and-a-half-hour attack was on an office of Development Alternatives Inc., a humanitarian assistance subcontractor working with the U.S. Agency of International Development. The Taliban said the building was a base for U.S. Special Operations troops, which the U.S. military denied. DAI said four of the dead worked for its security subcontractor, Edinburgh International, and that several more EI staff were wounded as were two DAI staff members. In a conflicting report, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said six gunmen had killed nearly all of the 52 foreigners at the compound. ""The attack by insurgents in Kunduz was an attempt to intimidate Afghans and members of the international community trying to improve the lives of all Afghans,"" said NATO's International Security Assistance Force in a statement. ""This attack shows the insurgents' desire to prevent progress and draws attention to their true goal of serving themselves rather than the people of Afghanistan,"" said Navy Capt. Jane Campbell, an ISAF spokeswoman. ""We remain committed to serving alongside our Afghan partners to improve security and development for all Afghans."" CNN's Atia Abawi, Journalist Matiullah Mati and State Department Producer Charley Keyes contributed to this report.","NEW: Two of the wounded are Americans .

"(CNN) -- The transitional government of Guinea-Bissau said its forces killed six people amid an attack on the barracks of an elite military unit near the capital's airport. The transitional authorities, which took power in the West African nation after military commanders overthrew the previous government in April, said they believed the attempt to seize control of the barracks on Saturday night was led by people loyal to the former prime minister Carlos Gomes Jr. The government said the assault was a ""premeditated action aiming at destabilizing the legal order and whose main aim is to create a political situation where an international force in Guinea-Bissau could be justified."" Six attackers were killed in the fighting at the Para-Commando barracks, two were captured and an unspecified number remain at large, the government said. It added that one government soldier was wounded. Gomes Jr. and the former interim president Raimundo Pereira fled to Portugal after the generals ousted them in April on accusations they had agreed a ""secret deal"" to let Angolan troops into the country to attack the military. The coup prompted international condemnation and calls for a return to civilian rule by the African Union, the United Nations and Western powers. Guinea-Bissau suspended from African Union . The regional Economic Community of West African States brokered a deal to set up the current transitional government, which has until May to organize presidential and legislative elections. The regional body agreed to deploy about 600 peacekeeping troops in Guinea-Bissau to monitor the transition and replace the Angolan soldiers that were in the country. Angola had said its military personnel were there to help reform the Guinea-Bissau armed and security forces. Coups and coup attempts have taken place repeatedly in Guinea-Bissau since it won independence from Portugal in 1974. To date, no democratically elected president of the country has served a full five-year term. Pereira became interim president after the January death of incumbent Malam Bacai Sanha after a long illness. Sanha had become president in September 2009 after the assassination of his predecessor, Joao Bernardo Vieira.

"Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Two Islamist militias have agreed to close their bases in the eastern Libyan city of Derna, state news and a source said Saturday. A third base will be shut on Sunday, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The state-run LANA news agency said the militias, which it identified as Bou Salim Martyrs and Ansar al-Sharia, will also disband. The move comes after hundreds marched in the nearby city of Benghazi and took over the headquarters for Ansar al-Sharia. Individuals from the radical Islamist group are accused of having been involved in the attack last week that left four Americans dead. Protesters demanded an end to all security activities of armed groups operating outside the official command of the army or police. Mohamed al-Magariaf, president of Libya's General National Congress, later told reporters that a joint security office would be established to bring together the army and the various brigades backed by the government. Militias outside that office will not be allowed to operate, he said. As militia members fled the headquarters in Benghazi, demonstrators torched a vehicle and took over the group's building without firing a single shot. Army General Naji al-Shuaibi said the citizens, whom he referred to as ""revolutionaries of the February 17 uprising,"" later asked that the Ansar al-Sharia headquarters be handed over to the Libyan army. Some protesters also gathered at locations that house forces loyal to the national authority, he said, including the headquarters of the Rufallah al-Sihati battalion. Gunfire could be heard there, but it was not clear who was responsible. At least four people were killed and 70 were injured in clashes at the Rufallah al-Sihati brigade headquarters, LANA reported. Al-Magariaf thanked the protesters for helping evict ""armed groups."" He also said the Rufallah al-Sihati brigade was actually ""under the command of -- and committed to -- the national authority,"" the case appeared to be one of mistaken identity. Magariaf asked demonstrators to stop their activities and go home. On the night of September 11, U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was one of four Americans slain after a group assaulted the U.S. Consulate in the eastern Libyan city. Seen as the birthplace of the revolution that led to the death of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, Benghazi has in recent months been beset by security issues. Initial reports indicated that, ahead of the consular attack, Ansar al-Sharia had organized a protest to decry an inflammatory film that mocks the Prophet Mohammed and also protest the United States, where the film was privately produced. On Thursday, Libyan Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur said eight detained in connection with that assault include members of Ansar al-Sharia, though he added that not all the attackers came from one specific group.","A third base will shut on Sunday, says a source .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- ""Freedom!"" That word, yelled out in Arabic, reverberated Friday along the banks of the Nile River in Cairo -- as well as in the port city of Alexandria, near the canal in Suez, and other pockets of Egypt. Many demonstrators voicing their desire for a new government and new political future remained on the streets well into Saturday morning, defying a curfew and revelling in a historic day in a nation whose history dates back millennia. By early Saturday, police were nowhere to be seen in the capital of Cairo, with military forces deployed on streets all around the nation for the first time in more than three decades. They were ordered out by President Hosni Mubarak, whom many demonstrators were urging to step down or, at least, institute dramatic economic and political reforms. ""We want (Mubarek) to leave,"" said Ahmed, whose last name was withheld to protect his identity. ""His time is over,"" the 19-year-old law student said early Saturday from Raml Square in central Alexandria. Mubarak has been in power for 30 years, during which time Egypt has established itself as one of the most important powers in the region and a strong ally of the United States. At the same time, the long-time ruler and his regime had a reputation for restricting freedoms and staunchly holding onto power. Resistance in the past had often been stifled by either political manuevering or the police, members of which were out in full force this week. But rarely have they met an opposition force as large, or as apparently determined. ""Police have always been violent, but we haven't seen it this way,"" Sarah Sirgany, a reporter for Daily News Egypt who has been posting regular developments on Twitter, told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""We haven't seen this many people on the streets at the same time."" Video footage from Friday showed throngs of protesters charging down a bridge over the Nile River in Cairo, overrunning police trucks that fired off tear gas with minimal effect. Elsewhere, demonstrators torched and ransacked the headquarters of Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party. When protesters circled the Ministry of Information in Cairo on Friday, they were greeted by police, who responded with sharp cracks of gunfire. It's not clear whether police shot at protesters or into the air, whether their bullets were rubber or steel, whether anyone was wounded or killed. There were many other reports of run-ins, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights reporting early Friday that the government had arrested more than 1,000 people, including political opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei. Mohammed Mansour, a resident of the Shubra neighborhood of Cairo, said that he and fellow demonstrators had been ""beaten and assaulted by police"" since Monday, when the popular unrest began. Continuing to fight Friday, he said that his group had beaten back police, who retreated. Later he claimed, protesters set fire to three police stations and about 20 police cars. ""We went out today and we were ready to die, so our children can live in dignity,"" said Mansour. Protesters' interactions with Egypt's military -- members of an army that is widely respected in Egypt -- were far more friendly. In Cairo and Alexandria, many protesters greeted troops with embraces and cheers, some even shaking hands with soldiers. Mansour, the Cairo resident, said he and fellow demonstrators celebrated when they saw troops roll into town, and they were not alone. ""It means we are victorious,"" he said. ""If the army comes out, that means the government ... is no longer in control."" In the wee hours of Saturday, with the curfew ostensibly in effect, people continued to come up to friendly army troops, greeting them and posing for pictures by tanks. Some military personnel were stationed outside burned out police stations, but did little to prevent people from going into them and coming out with chairs, tables and various valuables. The army wasn't the only side exercising restraint. The Muslim Brotherhood sent its followers onto the streets after Friday prayers, the first time Egypt's large and venerable -- but illegal -- Islamic opposition called for protest during this round of demonstrations. And when younger Muslim Brotherhood protesters seemed ready to hurl rocks at the police in Alexandria, Egypt's second-largest city, older men put their arms around their shoulders, calming them down. Just after midnight Saturday, Mubarak gave a speech defending and explaining the government's response to the protests while saying that he'd soon form a new government mindful of the demonstrators' demands for policy changes. Still that didn't appease many on the streets, who vowed to continue demonstrating again against what they felt was an unjust ruling government that needed a fresh start -- without Mubarak. ""We are one of the richest Arab countries, and we want to live,"" said a 20-year-old student named Mohammed, whose last name was withheld to protect his identity, from Alexandria. ""Let a new government form, but if we don't get what we ask for, we will go back to the streets again and again."" Another protester in Alexandria, an 18-year-old taxi driver named Yousef, didn't even think the entrenched Egyptian ruler deserved even that much of a chance. He said Egyptians should press on with their protests, following the lead of their fellow African nation Tunisia. There, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali left the country after 23 years in power following weeks of demonstrations against his rule. The new government, under Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi, announced new freedoms and promised to institute numerous democratic-minded reforms. ""They kept protesting until he fled the country,"" Yousef said of Tunisia. ""We will do more and more, we will continue our demonstrations, and we will do 3,000 times more of what the Tunisians did.""

"(AOL Autos) -- Okay, you've decided what model of car you want to buy. And you know, more or less, how much you want to spend -- or how much you can afford. You've kicked tires, talked to salesmen, taken a few shiny new numbers for a test-drive and you're ready to make the deal. If you eat in your car you may want to consider fabric or leather protections. Except, you're not quite done. You still need to decide whether to buy any of those ""extras"" that your salesperson will always suggest. Some of these extras have real value and are probably worth adding. Others ... maybe not so much. The list of ""extras"" offered by most dealers, may include paint sealant, fabric protection/leather care, extended warranties, extended 'one price' service contracts, rust/underbody coatings and anti-theft systems, to mention a few. We wanted to know which of these new car extras were worth it and which ones a consumer can do without. To get to the bottom of it, we thought we would consult an expert -- David Bennett, Manager of Automotive Programs for AAA. As it turns out, like most things in life, the answer often just comes down to what's best for you, depending on your own situation, budget or locale. Let's address these add-ons one by one: . Paint sealant . ""I think that most paint jobs on cars are pretty good these days, so in most cases you probably don't need that anymore,"" said Bennett, who offered one caveat. ""But that can depend on what part of the country you live in -- what the climate is, whether you get a lot of snow and ice, and what the road crews put down on the road -- whether it is salt, or if it is something that is less harmful to the paint. But generally, as long as you keep your car washed, and wash that salt off of it, and get it waxed regularly, that paint should last without getting the 'add-on' sealer at the dealership. Also, if you get a chip or a ding, get it fixed so the rust doesn't get a chance to set in and spread."" Fabric / leather protection . These extras are fairly self-explanatory -- the dealer ""treats"" the upholstered or leather seating with a ""protection"" product that make the seats more resistant to stains or scuff marks. ""This can be a good purchase, but the first question you should ask before buying it is, 'What kind of lifestyle do I lead?' suggests Bennett. ""Do you have a lot of kids and are they prone to spill things? Or is your vehicle mostly going to be occupied by adults?"" Do you eat in the car with some regularity? If so, and you're just too darn messy for your own good, a stain protection might be a good way to go. ""Also, look at exclusions in the plan,"" advises Bennett. ""If you're a smoker, and the plan excludes burn holes from cigarette ashes, and you're not diligent about making sure your ash is always short, that might not be a good purchase because of that exclusion. Each of these policies or plans is probably offering something different, and you need to read all of the exclusions before making that purchase, because it might not be a good one for you."" If you want to save some cash, one option would be to forego the protectant and just make sure you clean your seats regularly with a good upholstery cleaner or leather cleaner. To remove spots from a leather seat, use a good leather cleaner and work it into the spot with a soft cloth. If the spot still remains, let it sit for a few hours. Repeat, as they say, if necessary. It's also a good idea , to use a leather conditioner regularly on leather seats to restore moisture and to maintain its appearance. Rustproofing . This is when the dealership applies various rust-inhibiting chemicals, waxes or sealers to the vehicle's undercarriage. It can also be applied to other rust-prone areas. Rustproofing treatments sometimes include a guarantee over a certain number of years. Keep in mind that some guarantees require annual ""checkups"" to re-apply the sealers or rust inhibitors to any areas where the rustproofing may have been damaged. ""I don't think this is necessary in most cases,"" opines Bennett. ""The way most vehicles are constructed today, they are not nearly as prone to underbody rusting as they used to be in the old days -- even in the north, where they get a lot of snow."" LoJack Car Security System / Anti-theft systems: . The folks at LoJack Car Security Systems report that a vehicle is stolen every 25 seconds in the U.S. Using a car alarm is one way to protect your vehicle. But if you want to go the more high-tech ""tracking"" route, using a security system like LoJack may give you more peace of mind. The LoJack System, includes a small radio frequency transceiver hidden in up to 20 different places in the vehicle. The System uses a code that is tied into the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). Then, when you report that your car has been stolen, the state police crime computer can match code against the state VIN database. This automatically activates the LoJack System in the vehicle -- emitting an inaudible signal. Then, police cruisers and aviation units that have the LoJack tracking system can identify the vehicle's location, track it and recover it. LoJack claims that over 200,000 vehicles have been recovered worldwide using their system, with over 100,000 of those in the U.S. ""Whether or not this is a purchase you should make depends on various factors. If you live in a high-crime area, a system like this could provide you with peace of mind,"" advises Bennett. ""But even if you live in a safe, low-crime district, your car can still be stolen from a busy downtown street or parking garage,"" he notes. One caveat: Some car owners may not want their car back after it has been stolen, especially if it has been seriously vandalized, or if it has been driven so hard that it causes some mechanical problems. Another thing to consider is that owners of GM vehicles that come with its patented OnStar system, probably won't need a theft tracking program, says Bennett. ""Because the system allows OnStar operators to track the location of the vehicle if it is stolen. So if you buy a GM car with the OnStar system, you may want to pass on a LoJack or similar tracking system."" Extended warranties . ""This really does depend on how long you plan to keep the vehicle, because most of these extended warranty plans don't kick in until the manufacturer's warranty expires,"" advises Bennett. ""And these days, those manufacturers warranties are three or five years, sometimes longer. ""So if you plan on selling the car after three or five years, it probably doesn't make sense to buy the extended warranty."" Some warranties offer transferable policies, which let you ""sell"" the warranty along with the vehicle. Others allow you to ""return"" the warranty for a pro-rated refund. Bennett also explains that not all warranties are created equal. ""They usually have three levels of warranties: A basic extended warranty will just cover the powertrain, for example; while a better one will cover the powertrain plus some other components that are listed -- or an 'exclusionary' extended warranty may say it covers everything except those items that are listed. At the top end, the best warranty just covers everything, but that is also the most expensive."" Bennett gives an example of one manufacturers warranty. ""For a 2007 Buick, the basic manufacturers warranty is five years or 100,000 miles for the powertrain coverage, and the corrosion warranty is six years or 100,000 miles. In fact, that's the same warranty GM offers on their Chevy and Cadillac brands."" ""That's a pretty good warranty, so if you plan on only keeping your vehicle for five years or less, the extended warranty is probably money you don't need to spend.""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Italy's prime minister vowed Sunday that his country will continue supporting Afghanistan even after combat troops pull out. ""It is important that the relationship between Afghanistan and the international community is modified to reflect the new conditions, but that it doesn't stop,"" Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said Sunday in a joint news conference with Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai. NATO leaders are on a timetable to withdraw all of the alliance's combat troops from Afghanistan in 2014. ""It will be a presence based less on military contributions,"" Monti said. ""It will be a presence based far more on economic cooperation, it will be cooperation on the exploration and use of Afghanistan's important mineral resources and it will be a cooperation, as it already is in this phase, of institution-building to make Afghanistan an ever more solid country."" Monti met with Karzai after visiting Italian forces on a surprise trip to Herat, Afghanistan, where Italy's troops there are based.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo won his 99th international cap for Portugal -- but the Real Madrid superstar could not inspire his country as it slumped to a World Cup qualifying defeat in Russia. Only Luis Figo (127) and Fernando Couto (110) have made more appearances for Portugal than Ronaldo, who will hope to reach his century against Northern Ireland on Tuesday. Ronaldo had scored eight goals in his previous three games for Real Madrid, including a classy double against Barcelona in last Sunday's El Clasico.

But he was unable to prevent Russia from claiming a third consecutive victory in Group F to claim top spot as Fabio Capello's men recorded a 1-0 win. Alexander Kerzhakov's sixth minute strike was enough to secure Russia its first ever win over Portugal in the post-Soviet era. Playing on the synthetic surface at Moscow's Luzhniki Arena, Portugal struggled to make a breakthrough against a stubborn Russian defense. Russian keeper Igor Akinfeyev made two impressive saves to deny Ronaldo and Bruno Alves as the visitors pushed for an equalizer. But the home side held out and might have even extended their lead further had Denos Glushakov and Roman Shirokov made the most of their opportunities. ""I can't say that we looked bad tonight,"" Portugal manager Paulo Bento told AFP. ""In general we played a good match. We reacted well on the goal we conceded and we followed the plan which we worked out before the match.

Marco Reus scored twice in eight minutes to give the Germans a 2-0 lead at the break, before goals from Mesut Ozil, Miroslav Klose and two Toni Kroos strikes left Ireland decimated. Andy Keogh grabbed a consolation for Ireland but that failed to tarnish a Germany performance which sees them top Group C with maximum points.

""There are some great players there and to be in the England top five is something to be proud of,"" he told ITV1. ""I am only 26 so hopefully I will score a lot more. ""We created some good chances and maybe there was a bit of poor finishing but it's not that easy when they put 10 or 11 men behind the ball. ""It's difficult to break them down and we had to create chances and we managed to do that, so obviously we'll take the positives and it wasn't a bad result."" Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain grabbed his first international goal to complete a routine win over a San Marino side ranked 207th out of 207 in the world rankings.

"(CNN) -- Legendary Ukraine striker Andriy Shevchenko called time on an 18-year soccer career back in July in order to concentrate on a new profession -- politics. But just four months after turning his back on football, Shevchenko has been offered the chance to immerse himself in the beautiful game once again, as coach of the national side. As Ukraine's most capped player and their highest goalscorer of all time, with 56 goals in his 111 games, Shevchenko is the finest player the country has produced since gaining independence in 1991. He won five consecutive league titles with Dynamo Kiev between 1995 and 1999 before joining Italian giants AC Milan, where he played his part in their 2003 European Champions League triumph. Shevchenko was signed for English club Chelsea by Jose Mourinho in May 2006 for a reported fee of $47 million but failed to make an impact in his two years at the club. After another loan spell with Milan he returned to Dynamo Kiev for three final seasons and signed off from the national team after they failed to get out of their group in Euro 2012, which Ukraine co-hosted with neighbors Poland. Though the 36-year-old has no previous coaching experience, he is the Ukrainian Football Federation's (FFU) first choice to take over from Oleh Blokhin, who left the post to coach Ukrainian club side Dynamo Kiev. A statement on the FFU's official website read: ""President of the Football Federation of Ukraine Anatoliy Konkov has decided to invite Andriy Shevchenko to take the post of head coach. ""Andriy had a prominent schooling at renowned clubs such as the Dynamo Kiev, Milan and Chelsea, led by legendary coaches Valeriy Lobanovskiy, Carlo Ancelotti and Jose Mourinho. ""He had a unique ability to absorb their talent, their knowledge and their experience. ""It should be noted that at one time Andriy Shevchenko debuted in the youth national teams under the leadership of Anatoly Ridge. And today the FFU president offers Shevchenko a new debut!"" The statement quoted Konkov as saying: ""I'm sure Shevchenko will also be able to conquer great football countries as head coach of this country. He has enough experience and character. ""The federation, in turn, will ensure to give him all the help he needs with the national team.""","Andriy Shevchenko invited to take charge as coach of Ukraine national team .

"San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN)  -- Investigators don't know if the massive fire at a fuel storage facility near San Juan was deliberately started or was an accident, the agent in charge of the FBI's San Juan office said Monday. The blaze, which started with an explosion at the Caribbean Petroleum Corp. facility in Bayamon municipality early Friday, was extinguished Sunday, firefighters said. Some of the tanks continued to smolder and crews stood ready to fight any flare-up. ""We don't know if it's a crime scene,"" said FBI Special Agent Luis Fraticelli. ""We don't know if it's an accident, so we're not making any determinations at this point until our experts do their work, do their analysis and then provide input to us as to what they feel happened here."" Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. The FBI is investigating graffiti found on two San Juan tunnels that referred to a fire, Special Agent Harry Rodriguez said Friday. A spray-painted message on the tunnels, less than three miles apart, said: ""Boom, fire, RIP, Gulf, Soul, ACNF."" Caribbean Petroleum owns the Gulf Oil brand, but Rodriguez said he did not know what ACNF referred to. Hundreds of firefighters battled the blaze, which began with an explosion early Friday morning. That explosion shook the ground with the force of a 2.8-magnitude earthquake, authorities said. Flames shot into the air while plumes of thick, black smoke hovered over the region. Agents from the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were investigating to determine whether the explosion was an act of sabotage or an accident. Seventeen tanks were destroyed by flames and the initial explosion. Puerto Rico's governor, Luis Fortuno, said the main priority of his government is to counter any long-term effects of air and water pollution caused by the disaster. Representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency have been checking air quality near the fire. ""We're not finding levels that would be of concern,"" said Bonnie Bellow, EPA spokeswoman. She said the fire had been so intense because it was ""burning off chemicals that are part of the fuel."" About 600 displaced people stayed in shelters on Sunday night, but many were being sent home. Dr. Lorenzo Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's health secretary, tests conducted on the air and water showed no reason for concern. Because they were placed in close proximity in the facilities, everyone in the shelters and all the emergency personnel were vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus as a precaution, Gonzalez said. President Obama declared an emergency in Puerto Rico, which frees up federal aid. Fortuno said the blaze has cost the island at least $6.4 million. The governor sought to allay fears over gasoline supplies. Caribbean Petroleum owns 200 gas stations in the island and several inland distribution facilities, and supplies much of the island's fuel. Puerto Rico will receive 3.6 million gallons of regular gasoline, more than 1 million gallons of premium gasoline and more than 1 million gallons of diesel fuel to help make up for what may have been lost, Fortuno said. The company has been cited for violations of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the main law in the United States that deals with the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, according to EPA spokeswoman Bellow. Caribbean Petroleum is under a corrective-action plan, she said. CNN's Rafael Romo and Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Blaze started with massive explosion early Friday .

"(CNN) -- After months of talking about each other and their policies, the world finally gets to see Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney go toe-to-toe on the same stage in three televised debates ahead of the U.S. election. Unlike other countries, such as the United Kingdom, where the prime minister must defend his policies under televised duress from the opposition nearly every week, face-to-face showdowns between the two men fighting for the White House only happen every four years. And while debates rarely swing the outcome of an election, a gaffe -- or a silver-tongued swipe at the opposition -- under the bright lights can alter the perception of the two contenders, for better or worse. What's the history of U.S. presidential debates? Presidential debates are a relatively recent phenomenon. The first televised debate was between Republican Richard Nixon and Democrat John F. Kennedy, on black-and-white TV in 1960. More: Presidential debates by the numbers . Many people listening on the radio to that first of four Nixon-Kennedy debates thought Nixon had won - but on live TV, a tan and youthful-looking Kennedy trounced a sweaty, haggard Nixon (who'd recently suffered a staph infection) in the appearance department. While Nixon improved in later debates, Kennedy went on to win the election. There were no debates again until Jimmy Carter took on Gerald Ford in 1976. Since then, the Republican and Democratic hopefuls have matched wits in a series of (usually three) debates every election year - and twice, in 1980 and 1992, an independent candidate has joined the duo onstage. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter refused to take part in the first debate with Ronald Reagan because John Anderson, an independent candidate, had been invited to take part. Carter's boycott led to a dramatic decline in the anticipated viewership for that debate. The second was cancelled, and Anderson was wiped off the program for the third round several weeks later. What are the debates about? In recent election cycles, the three debates have consisted of a domestic policy debate, a foreign policy debate, and a general debate in a town hall format, where members of the audience also offer up questions. Vice presidential candidates also face off in a single debate in the run-up to the election. Generally speaking, candidates are asked questions by a moderator, who in recent years has come from one of America's major broadcast news networks. Candidates then have a set period of time for responses and rebuttals. More: 10 debate moments that mattered . A coin-flip determines the order of answers at debates. Tonight Obama will answer first, but Romney will have the final word. The dates and sites for the debates, which typically take place at universities across America, are chosen from a list of applicants by the non-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates. Do debates even matter to the public? While the debates offer Romney and Obama a chance to expand on their views and rebut each other's plans directly, experts say that the vast majority of Americans have already decided who they're voting for along party lines. But although debates aren't typically seen as deciding an election's outcome, there have been a few exceptions over time. Kennedy's telegenic dominance of Nixon during the first televised debate helped swing momentum in the Democrat's direction in 1960. In a 1980 debate, facing a barrage of assertions and accusations from incumbent Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan coolly replied with a smile: ""There you go again."" His famous retort momentarily took the wind out of Carter's sails. After entering debate season behind in opinion polls, eventual winner Reagan left the podium with the advantage over Carter. More: Get latest updates at CNN's Election Center . Sometimes it's not the debate that hurts a candidate - it's the post-game review. In 2000, cameras caught a visibly annoyed Al Gore sighing and shaking his head when George W. Bush spoke. The clip was played over and over again and lampooned on television, to the point that ""people began to project onto Gore a personality trait of just annoyance and irritation of people in general,"" according to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. A clear favorite before the debates, Gore lost his lead during the debate season. He eventually lost the controversial election after the Supreme Court ruled in Bush's favor. Are Romney and Obama any good at debating? As mentioned above, American politics don't involve many head-to-head debates between Republicans and Democrats, but both candidates are seen as more than competent debaters. Obama handled Republican John McCain in all three contests four years ago, says debate coach Todd Graham, staying on track in his arguments, showing poise, and refusing to take attacks on his policies personally. Obama's quick wit may have backfired on him during a 2008 Democratic primary debate. He responded to Hillary Clinton saying he was likeable with, ""You're likeable enough, Hillary."" The audience laughed, but many viewers saw the remark as a mean-spirited swipe. More: Coach says Obama, Romney are top debaters . Graham says despite Obama's reputation as a great orator, his debate performances have not lived up to the standards of his speeches - and that at times the president can be awkward and long-winded in his debate answers. Romney is currently the better-practiced of the two, having emerged victorious from a Republican primary season that featured nearly 20 debates. Graham says Romney is consistently solid, has great opening lines to questions, and has a firm grasp of the issues. More: Inside debate prep with Mitt's sparring partner . Romney's biggest weakness, according to some experts, is that he often comes across as fake. Graham says Romney's broad smile and ""thank yous"" following heated answers make it seems like ""he's practicing his speeches,"" not debating his opponent. Are debates about great politics or great theater? Long stretches of presidential debates involve dry policy speeches, but it's usually a single gaffe or clever one-liner that comes to define a debate in the annals of national memory. Reagan was already the oldest president in history in 1984, and when asked during a debate about whether age would be an issue for him, the 73-year-old famously replied: ""I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."" Even Democratic challenger Walter Mondale, then age 56, had to laugh. More: Doris Kearns Goodwin's top debate moments . Sometimes body language matters more than words in a debate. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush took a glance at his watch while an audience member was asking a question - a move that made Bush, whose re-election hopes were rapidly slipping away, seem uninterested in the concerns of the public. John McCain sparked controversy when he referred to Obama as ""that one"" during the second 2008 presidential debate. At a dinner attended by both senators several days later, Obama joked that his first name was Swahili for ""that one,"" according to the New York Times. Vice presidents and their counterparts have delivered just as many memorable lines as their bosses have over the years. Lloyd Bentsen's sharp ""Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy"" reprimand of Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle in 1988 remains one of the all-time greats -- along with Perot running mate James Stockdale's ""Who am I? Why am I here?"" debate opener in 1992, which drew guffaws from the audience. A bad enough gaffe can help derail your campaign long before the first primary votes are cast, as Republican Rick Perry showed in late 2011. At a primary debate in Michigan, Perry became the first candidate in history to say ""oops"" during a debate after forgetting the name of the third government agency he'd pledged to cut. When pressed for an answer, Perry said: ""The third agency of government I would do away with, the Education ... uhh the Commerce, and, let's see. I can't. The third one, I can't. Sorry. Oops."" After the debate, Perry owned up to the gaffe as only a Texas governor could: ""I'm sure glad I had my boots on because I sure stepped in it out there.""","Obama, Romney to debate domestic and foreign policy over three debates .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The U.S. Army intentionally denied benefits to soldiers suffering from a widespread stress disorder after they returned from service in Iraq and Afghanistan, a veterans advocacy group charges in a suit filed Wednesday. A soldier is welcomed home from Iraq by his son at Fort Stewart, Georgia, earlier this month. The lawsuit, filed by the National Veterans Legal Services Program, accuses the Army of illegally cutting off benefits to thousands of veterans and their families by refusing to assign a proper disability rating to those veterans after they had been discharged with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As a result, the veterans have been denied benefits, including, among other things, lifetime monthly disability payments and free medical care for  themselves and their families. ""I experience firsthand the horrors of war"" said Juan Perez, an Iraq veteran and one of five plaintiffs in the lawsuit. ""My expectation was that the military would be there for me, and my country would be there for me. Instead, the way I was treated felt more like a slap to the face."" All disabled veterans are assigned a disability rating from zero to 100 percent. According to the Legal Services Program, a rating of at least 30 percent is required to qualify for benefits such as monthly disability payments and free health care. Soldiers receiving less than a 30 percent rating are  entitled only to a one-time lump sum severance payment after being discharged. On October 14, the Defense Department ordered the Army to assign at least a 50 percent rating to all soldiers discharged with PTSD in the future. The lawsuit seeks to provide full benefits to all veterans discharged with PTSD in the past six years. A Rand Corp. study released in April indicated that nearly 20 percent of all military service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have reported symptoms of PTSD or major depression.","Soldiers: Army denied them disability rating, so they were denied benefits .

"Kabul (CNN) -- On a hill overlooking the dusty, sprawling city of Kabul is a park where kids fly their kites. A dirty, beaten up Toyota sedan arrives, and Mohammad Nasim steps out wearing traditional Afghan garb -- a perahan tunban (tunic and pants) and a lungee (a headdress). He's traveled more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) from his home in Nangarhar province near the Pakistani border, a drive that has taken him at least five hours because the roads are so bad. He wants to tell his story after learning of the decision to transfer Bagram prison from U.S. to Afghan control. It's a story that began almost a decade ago, a year after the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United States by al Qaeda terrorists then based in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, radical islamic fundamentalists dislodged from power by the U.S.-led war against terror that followed. ""At the beginning of the Karzai government we were at home, living our normal life,"" he said. ""I was a farmer supporting my wife and kids. The police surrounded our house in October 2002 and said 'you're involved with the Taliban,' and they arrested me and took me to Bagram prison."" Nasim says many men in his town were rounded up that day. ""They accused me of being involved with the Taliban and attacking Jalalabad airport about 40 kilometers from my home, but I asked them, 'How was I involved in an attack on the airport when you arrest me in my house, with my family?'"" Despite Nasim's claim of innocence, U.S. records reveal he was in possession of rocket motors and other equipment when he was taken into custody -- an allegation he strongly denies. He was taken to Bagram Prison, which was at the time was run by the U.S. Defense Department, and claims he was tortured there. ""Yes, yes, I was tortured,"" he said. ""They gave me electric shots on my wrists. I was hung from the ceiling for seven days. Our faces were masked, and we were handcuffed, hanging from the ceiling. Our legs were chained as well."""" As he explains his story he plays out the torture scenes, raising his arms into the air. ""A guard would keep shaking the chain so we couldn't sleep for seven days,"" he said. ""I completely lost my mind. I was hanging from the ceiling; my body was aching. They would hit our heads into the wall."" Asked about Nasim's allegations of torture at Bagram, a spokesman for the Department of Defense in Washington released a statement that did not specifically reference his claims, but said in part: . ""DoD does not tolerate the abuse of detainees. All credible allegations of abuse are thoroughly investigated, and appropriate disciplinary action is taken when those allegations are substantiated. We take such matters very seriously. ""Although there have been substantiated cases of abuse in the past, for which U.S. service members have been held accountable, our enemies also have employed a deliberate campaign of exaggerations and fabrications. The suggestion that DoD personnel, the overwhelming majority of whom serve honorably, are or ever were engaged in systematic mistreatment of detainees is false and does not withstand scrutiny."" As we sat cross-legged in the dirt in the park, Nasim took in the panoramic view of Kabul, a city surrounded by rugged mountains amid a landscape so arid and dry -- and yet so beautiful. As he gazed out, almost lost in thought, I asked him if he thought he would survive his time in Bagram. He said, ""I felt completely hopeless. Some people inside killed themselves. I too had lost all hope. I thought I was going to die in there."" It was during this period that two Afghan prisoners, Habibullah and Dilawar who were also hung by their wrists, were beaten to death by U.S. soldiers in Bagram Prison in December 2002. A U.S. military investigation later found that abuse had been widespread that year and the following. After five months in Bagram, Nasim was transferred to Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba as a ""medium-risk"" prisoner. Guantanamo was not like Bagram, he said. ""Every prisoner had their own small room. We spent three months separately in confinement. After three months they took us up to camp 5. It was difficult to cope but not as bad as Bagram."" After four and a half years in Guantanamo Bay, Nasim was finally released. ""An American woman said, 'we're sorry,'"" he said. ""But what to do with their sorry? I spent five years of my life there. I was innocent. You take me away from my family, my children. Who supported them while I was locked up? I lost five years of my life."""" Nasim, who's now 36 but looks at least a decade older, is still very upset about what hey says happened to him. He says he's received no compensation and no formal apology. The father of five said, ""It made me feel like I wanted to go out and kill all of them. If somebody takes you to the prison for five years, how would you feel? I was very angry. My hurt was blasting."" His level of anger has subsided over the years, but he believes the Americans and international forces need to get out of Afghanistan. ""This will be a better place once they've all gone. We don't need them. Afghans can run their own country,"" he said.","Nasim says he was a farmer when police arrested him in 2002 and took him to Bagram prison .

"(CNN) -- Blood transfusions. Saline injections. Back-dated prescriptions and tipoffs to coming tests. Former teammates of cycling superstar Lance Armstrong recounted a wide range of techniques used to beat the sport's drug-testing regimen to investigators from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which released its findings on the seven-time Tour de France winner Wednesday. But perhaps the most effective one was the most low-tech: laying low. ""We hid,"" the report quotes former U.S. Postal Service team member Tyler Hamilton. ""At the time, the whereabouts programs of drug testing agencies were not very robust."" The sport's international governing body, the UCI, ""did not even have an out of competition testing program. If a tester did show up, you typically would not get a missed test even if you decided not to answer the door. In any case, there was no penalty until you had missed three tests. So, avoiding testing was just one more way we gamed the system."" Highlights of the Armstrong report . The team's staff ""was good at being able to predict when riders would be tested and seemed to have inside information about the testing,"" states the nearly 200-page decision, which was backed by hundreds of pages of supporting documents. During Armstrong's comeback attempt in 2009, his Astana team ""benefited from privileged information or timing advantages during doping control tests."" And in 2010, Armstrong himself ""was providing untimely and incomplete whereabouts information to USADA, thereby making it more difficult to locate him for out of competition testing."" Armstrong has consistently denied doping accusations, and his lawyer called the USADA probe a ""witch hunt"" Wednesday. But he has stopped contesting the allegations, and he faces being stripped of his titles. The riders also told of timing their use of erythropoietin, or EPO, which boosts the number of red blood cells that carry oxygen to the muscles, to avoid detection. The substance was undetectable before 2000 and currently can be detected only for a short time. The riders cut that time further by injecting it into a vein rather than under the skin, meaning it would be gone ""in a matter of hours."" Evidence of Armstrong doping 'overwhelming,' agency says . They used testosterone in much the same way, taking small doses at night so that they could pass a drug test the following morning. And they also had infusions of saline solution before a test, which throws off a test that measures red blood cell concentration. That sometimes required fancy footwork, and there were some close calls, the riders said. During the 1998 world cycling championships, a UCI tester showed up unannounced and started setting up at a bed and breakfast where Armstrong's team was staying. A team doctor went outside to their car, retrieved a bottle of saline ""and smuggled it right past the UCI tester and into Armstrong's bedroom,"" the report states. Teammate Jonathan Vaughters told investigators that they later ""had a good laugh about how he had been able to smuggle in saline and administer it to Lance essentially under the UCI inspector's nose.""

"(CNN) -- A faulty monitoring system on a gasoline tank at a Puerto Rico storage facility most likely led to a massive fire in October that damaged homes and businesses more than a mile away, federal investigators said Tuesday. A storage tank at the Caribbean Petroleum Corp. facility in Bayamon, near San Juan, was being filled with gasoline from a ship docked in San Juan harbor when the tank apparently overflowed, U.S. Chemical Safety Board investigators said at a news conference. ""Gasoline spilled from the tank without detection; as the material spilled, it vaporized and spread across the facility,"" the agency said in a release. ""CSB investigators estimate that the vapor cloud spread to a 2,000-foot diameter until it reached an ignition source in the northwest section of the facility."" The liquid level in the tank could not be determined because the facility's computerized monitoring system was not fully operational, the CSB investigators said. To monitor the level in the tank, operators used a mechanical gauge on the tank's exterior wall, the investigators said. As the gasoline level in the tank rose and eventually overflowed, employees in the facility's control room were not aware of the situation. ""The filling of a tank without a functioning monitoring system is the type of activity the CSB will be examining very closely,"" said lead investigator Jeffrey Wanko. ""The CSB's investigation will examine operations particular to Caribbean Petroleum, but will also look at the regulations and best practices surrounding the industry as a whole in an effort to improve safety practices at similar facilities."" The fire, which started at 12:23 a.m. on October 23, burned for three days. There were no fatalities, but thousands of residents were forced to evacuate to avoid the thick clouds of black smoke. The FBI has determined that the explosion was an industrial accident, said Agent Harry Rodriguez of the San Juan office. ""It was not a terrorist act or an act of sabotage,"" he said. He said the FBI had determined that graffiti found on two San Juan tunnels that referred to a fire were not painted by anyone with connection to the blaze. The spray-painted message on the tunnels, less than three miles apart, said: ""Boom, fire, RIP, Gulf, Soul, ACNF."" Caribbean Petroleum owns the Gulf Oil brand in Puerto Rico. Nonetheless, Rodriguez said, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were still investigating. Caribbean Petroleum supplies a significant portion of Puerto Rico's petroleum products. The facility includes a tank farm and refinery that was shut down in 2000. Before the fire, the tank farm stored gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and fuel oil in about 30 aboveground tanks. The Chemical Safety Board is an independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents. CSB investigators look into all aspects of chemical accidents, including physical causes such as equipment failure, as well as inadequacies in regulations, industry standards and safety management systems. The board, which is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, does not issue citations or fines. The board does make safety recommendations to plants, industry organizations, labor groups and regulatory agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Storage tank fire at the Caribbean Petroleum Corp. has been investigated .

"(CNN) -- You know the presidential election is in full swing when politicians are getting tough on China. While both Democrats and Republicans promise to do just that, it is the Obama administration, being in the driver's seat, that has been leading the charge. On Monday, the Obama administration filed a trade case against China at the World Trade Organization, arguing that it provides subsidies to its auto and auto parts industries that hurt American manufacturers. If you had any doubts that the new complaint against unfair Chinese trade practices is part and parcel of the election campaign, consider these factors. This week's complaint is the third one this year, and it comes just about two months before Election Day. Where was the administration before? Ohio is a key battleground state, and automotive components happen to be one of the most important segments of the local economy. Why is Obama focusing on Chinese auto subsidies now? Note also that he made the announcement in Ohio during a campaign rally. Tough with China? Give me a break. We don't know whether Obama conveyed to the Chinese what he told the Russians (just let me get through the election, and I will be more flexible), but it's no secret to anyone that China holds more than $1 trillion in U.S. debt. When you owe another country that much debt, it may not be so easy to act tough. The Obama administration had plenty of opportunities to take steps that would genuinely challenge the Chinese. For example, it could have labeled China as a currency manipulator, which would have allowed the U.S. to take measures such as imposing tariffs unilaterally rather than through the WTO. Likewise, the administration has done little to offer vigorous protection of American intellectual property rights, which impacts a much broader array of U.S. business interests. And the administration has failed to take other concrete steps that would reduce China's competitive advantage. Let me make it clear. I am not defending China, and I have often offered criticism of Chinese practices and continue to do so. However, I find the current round of China-bashing disingenuous and brazen in its kowtowing to politically viable groups. What we need is an effective strategy of how to deal with China in the long term rather than engage in election season tactics. We should also face up to some of our own self-inflicted wounds. There are things under our control that undermine our competitiveness in relation not only to China but to numerous other countries. For a starter, maybe our government should try to tackle the huge and growing debt that makes us beholden to other countries like China. Our educational system does not provide nearly enough to prepare our graduates for the skills and knowledge that companies require to succeed in a global workplace. And we should reconsider regulations that discourage companies from setting up plants in the U.S. while China looks attractive in comparison. Instead, what we have are slogans that used to be quite popular with the Chinese in hardline communist days, e.g., doubling our exports in five years. How, exactly? Maybe the Obama administration and the Romney camp can start addressing those questions first. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Oded Shenkar.","This week, President Obama announced a trade complaint against China .

"(CNN) -- Rwandan President Paul Kagame hit back Monday at human rights activists who say he's behaving like an autocrat and fueling a bloody civil war in Rwanda's neighbor, Congo. ""If you are talking about people in the human rights community from outside... I have an issue with this,"" Kagame said, 16 years after he was hailed as a hero for ending a genocide that killed at least 800,000 people. ""You tend to make a judgment of a country, 11 million people, on what a couple of people have said and (they) don't take into account what Rwandans say."" Kagame added, ""Nobody has asked the Rwandans ... it's as if they don't matter in the eyes of the human rights people. It's our own decisions in the end."" He said everyone in Rwanda has to play by the rules and be accountable. ""There has to be leadership to make things move in the right direction,"" Kagame stated. Kagame's comments came a month after the New York-based group, Human Rights Watch, said opposition activists are facing increasing threats, attacks, and harassment ahead of Rwanda's presidential election in August. Human Rights Watch said opposition party members have suffered serious intimidation by individuals and institutions close to the government and Kagame's ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). The RPF took power in 1994 after its army swept into the capital of Kigali and overthrew the Hutu-dominated government responsible for the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans, most of them members of the minority Tutsi community. In the aftermath of the 100-day genocide, the fastest in modern history, Kagame transformed his country, turning it into one of the fastest growing nations in Africa and -- in the view of some -- a model of economic and social development. Kagame said Rwanda has made significant progress in erasing some of the scars left behind after the tragedy. ""That's why the country is stable. That's why the country is moving on. That's why the country is developing."" Kagame insisted he has nothing to do with the continuing civil war in mineral-rich Congo, even though he acknowledged that Rwandan troops intervened there a decade ago in an attempt to stop rebel groups from returning to Rwanda. The war became the largest and most destructive conflict in African history, costing more than 5 million lives, as various groups and foreign armies fought for control of Congo's land and mineral resources. ""I cannot be blamed for the problems of Congo or any other country,"" Kagame said. ""There are the Congolese who have their own country, who are supposed to manage it, who are supposed to govern it. It has nothing to do with me.""","Human Rights Watch said opposition activists are facing harassment ahead of elections .

"(CNN) -- Out of the mouths of politicians comes a new lingo, especially during a high-stakes presidential election year. Thanks to the Democrat and Republican smooth talking contenders, voters are being treated to a refreshed vocabulary. Sometimes a slip or sometimes a calculation, some words and expressions uttered by the candidates have proved so memorable that wordsmiths and wisecracks rush to the Internet to stake out a new website or social media handle to capitalize on the moment. Which brings us to the first entry in today's political parlance: . ""Binders full of women"" Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney uttered this phrase while thinking fast on his feet, in response to a voter's question during the second presidential debate. Discussing how he tried to bring women into his cabinet while governor of Massachusetts, Romney stated, ""I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks?' And they brought us whole binders full of women."" The remark spurred a political action committee to immediately mock Romney and set up bindersfullofwomen.com, dedicated to holding ""Republican candidates accountable in this year's election and beyond."" Meanwhile, the social media world erupted with humor -- some of it good-natured, others laced with sarcasm. A similarly named Tumblr page features creative composites of images and written commentary. A picture of Hugh Heffner in a library, for instance, bears the caption: ""Binders full of women? Oh sure, I've got hundreds of them."" Then there's a photo of a laughing Romney as he declares, ""Binder? I just met her!"" ""Malarkey"" Begosh and begorrah, Joe Biden must have been channeling the leprechauns of his ancestral homeland when he conjured up this bit of Hibernian slang during the debate between the vice presidential candidates. The Delaware Democrat claims the word's origin is Irish, like his own name, but the Oxford English and American Heritage Dictionaries say the etymology is officially unknown. Nothing like malarkey about malarkey. ""You didn't build that"" Those four words from President Barack Obama became a rallying cry for Republicans everywhere, who portrayed them as offensive to business owners nationwide. During a stump speech about public infrastructure and individual initiative, the president said, ""Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business -- you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."" What Obama built for himself, by uttering those words, was a mess -- and an opportunity for opponents to pounce. ""47%"" Move over, ""99%"" and ""1%."" The new No. 1 number this election season is ""47%."" Romney spoke of this percentage, secretly videotaped, during a private fundraiser in May. The GOP nominee said 47% of Americans will vote for Obama ""no matter what."" ""There are 47% who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that, that they are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them. Who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing,"" he said. After initially saying the remark was ""not elegantly stated,"" Romney later walked back the comment -- calling it ""completely wrong"" and promising he'll represent 100% of Americans. But not before Democrats pounced on it, by caricaturing Romney as an elitist who didn't care about less affluent Americans. ""Obamaloney"" Then the presidential candidates became punny, er, funny. At one point, Romney wearied of what he called Obama's baloney. So Romney gave the country a new lunch meat: Obamaloney. ""He is serving up a dish that is in contradiction to the truth,"" Romney said about Obama in a Fox News interview. The neologism spawned three namesake Facebook pages. But a Google search had yet to show, however, any delis with such an item on the menu. ""Romney Hood"" Obama had his turn as a punster, too. Obama ripped Romney's tax proposals -- which he said stole from the poor and gave to the rich -- as ""Robin Hood in reverse."" ""It's Romney Hood,"" Obama said. That remark provoked the chutzpah in Romney supporter Zach Tanner of Edmond, Oklahoma. He's dressing up as Romney Hood this Halloween, which occurs six days before the election. He even posted a photo of his planned costume on his Twitter account: A Romney mask with a toy bow-and-arrow set. ""I'm a fervent Romney supporter and disagree with Obama's initial quote,"" said Tanner, 24, a student at the University of Central Oklahoma. ""Sesame Street"" Consider this: Two grown men are running for the highest office in the most powerful nation on Earth. Their favorite show? ""Sesame Street."" And they are engaged in a tug of war over its iconic Big Bird. Romney started it all. At the first presidential debate, Romney said he wanted to cut federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service -- no offense to Big Bird. On the campaign trail, Obama later seized the reference and mocked how Romney wanted to slay Big Bird to help solve the nation's financial problems. The national laughter, however, didn't daunt Romney. On Thursday, he invoked the children's show again at the humorous Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner, an annual fundraiser to benefit Catholic charities. ""By the way,"" Romney quipped, ""in the spirit of 'Sesame Street,' the president's remarks tonight are brought you to by the letter O and the number 16 trillion."" Last month, the national debt eclipsed $16 trillion. ""Romnesia"" Not to be outdone the following day, Obama invented a new word, fusing his challenger's name and amnesia. (Obama's critics earlier dubbed the portmanteau Obamacare, which refers to the president's reforms to national health care -- a term the president has since embraced.) At a rally in Virginia on Friday, Obama lampooned Romney for memory lapses. ""If you come down with a case of Romnesia,"" the president said, ""and you can't seem to remember the policies that are still on your website or the promises you have made over the six years you have been running for president, here is the good news: Obamacare covers pre-existing conditions. We can fix you up. We've got a cure."" The partisan crowd roared with approval. By late Friday afternoon, the new word was growing in the U.S. lexicon, according to Twitter's trend chart. Romney had no immediate response Friday. But the sword play on words is expected to continue.","Wordsmiths rush to social media whenever candidates dub new phrases .

"(CNN) -- The Orionid meteor shower put on a cosmic light show for the Northern Hemisphere over the weekend. The Orionids peaked early Sunday morning as more than 25 meteors an hour streaked the night sky. The astronomical event caught the attention of many photographers over the weekend. iReporters from across the world stayed up late or woke up early for the chance to catch a glimpse of the meteor shower. Renata Arpasova set her alarm a few hours early, waking up at 1 a.m. to see the Orionids from Wiltshire, England. She found a clear patch of sky and was thrilled to see a few big, bright meteors pass overhead. She described the Orionids as being magical. ""I love meteor showers, and have always been fascinated by them from an early age,"" she said. ""They're nature's fireworks, and they are so breathtaking, especially when you get a big fireball that burns through the astrosphere."" ""And you get to make a wish every time you see a meteor,"" she said. A childhood love of space inspired Robbie Lopez to wake up early to watch for the Orionids as well. He was disappointed to look out his window at 2 a.m. and see extensive cloud coverage in Richmond, Virginia. Determined to capture a photograph of the Orionid meteor shower, he drove 25 minutes to a remote field in Chester, Virginia, and says he was not disappointed with the show. ""The shower itself was quite a beautiful sight,"" he said. ""I had seen the occasional shooting star and had always wanted to see a shower, but never saw one until that night."" He described the shower as a quick process, with streaks of light dashing across the sky, lasting for only fractions of a second. ""The sheer number of them made the wait in the cold worthwhile,"" he said. ""I was even more surprised by how many more meteors my camera captured that my eyes did not see."" The quick dashes of light from are produced when the meteoroids strike the planet's atmosphere at approximately 148,000 mph, according to NASA. Fast meteors have a tendency to explode, becoming fireballs in the sky. Once a meteor explodes in the Earth's atmosphere, it leaves behind a trail of stardust, which viewers on the ground see as streaks of light, or the meteoric tail. In North Wales, Kevin Lewis watched a late movie to pass the time before the Orionid meteor shower. He sat outside snapping photographs of the Orionids from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m. Despite the chilly weather, he found the experience relaxing. ""Meteors always capture my imagination,"" he said. ""Considering they are mere specks of dust, they have a huge impact on the viewer."" The Orionid meteor shower occurs annually in October as the Earth passes through a patch of space debris left from the famed Halley's Comet. The space dust enters the Earth's atmosphere as meteors, creating what we now refer to as the Orionids, which seems to shoot from the constellation Orion, the Hunter. Although the Orionids is not the strongest meteor shower, it is considered one of the most beautiful, according to NASA. The meteor shower is framed by some of the brightest planets and stars in the sky, like Venus, Mars and Sirius. Did you miss the Orionids' peak over the weekend? You may still be able to catch some streaking meteors for the next few days as Earth continues to pass through the remnants from Halley's Comet.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Mo Yan's Nobel Prize in literature appears to be a nod to the hungry literary tastes in modern China and could help spark more freedom, activists say. The beloved Chinese author -- whose pen name means ""not talking"" -- has captivated his countrymen by intertwining fantasy and gritty everyday life. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Mo the prestigious prize Thursday, praising the way the author's ""hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary."" Mo plies his trade in a country where running afoul of party lines could lead to censorship. His work packs a punch but he walks a fine line. He is considered a writer within the system and even has embraced official restrictions on writing. He's a Communist Party member and was elected to a vice-chairman spot in the state-sanctioned China Writers Association. State media reported Mo's victory immediately after the announcement -- a sharp contrast to Chinese dissident's Liu Xiabo's win of the Nobel Peace Prize two years ago, when international news coverage was blacked out. ""I think this comes at a really important time for Chinese literature. China is an extremely literate and energetic society. The bookstores are full. There's a lot of interesting writing going on now,"" said Larry Siems of Pen American Center -- which promotes literary freedom and free exchange of literature around the world. Mo, Siems said, is one of the most notable writers to come out of a system that's been ""a rigid combination of patronage and censorship."" Mo has produced compelling literature as he navigated that line, he said, but many in China think the author has been too ""reticent"" on some topics. Siems said the award is ""a really good thing for Chinese literature."" ""I think in some ways, the award may be recognizing the fact that there's lively literature happening in China and I hope this stimulates people to read Chinese writers, not only Mo Yan,"" he added. Patrick Poon, executive secretary of the independent Chinese Pen Center, said Mo is famous for the book on the country's policy that restricts couples -- with few exceptions -- to having one child. Poon called Mo ""one of the most influential"" contemporary writers and a ""good writer."" However, he said, there are better and bolder writers who didn't get a Nobel. He said he senses that the award appears to be a recognition of -- or trying to please -- the Chinese government. ""I don't think it's a very wrong decision to give it to Mo Yan,"" he said. But ""we can't understand it."" However, Poon said, now that Mo won the prize, maybe he can ask the Chinese government to free the more than three dozen or so imprisoned writers in the country. ""He should have this responsibility,"" Poon said. Mo was born in Gaomi in Shandong province into a family of farmers in 1955 as Guan Moye. He joined the People's Liberation Army as a young man and began his career, becoming, according to literary magazine Granta, one of the country's ""most celebrated and widely translated writers."" ""He's an earnest and pragmatic person,"" his brother said, according to news reports before the award was announced. ""I hope he will continue writing earnestly and create more literary work enjoyed by the masses."" Mo told local media in 2003 that his pen name is a word play on his original middle name, but also a reminder to himself that he should talk less and write more. The author sets his novels in a community based on his hometown. Granta asked him in a recent interview if he has been influenced by other writers, such as American novelist William Faulkner, who set many of his stories in one specific fictional county in Mississippi. ""When I first started writing it was the year of 1981, so I didn't read any books by Marquez or Faulkner,"" he said, referring to Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez. ""It was 1984 when I first read their works and undoubtedly those two writers have great influence on my creations. I found that my life experience is quite similar to theirs, but I only discovered this later on. If I had read their works sooner I would have already accomplished a masterpiece like they did."" His novel ""Frog"" explores China's one-child policy, designed for population control. He poignantly explored the traditional Chinese preference for boys over girls, which stems from the perception that boys are more able to provide for the family and carry on the family line. That tendency has fed the practice of aborting female fetuses or abandoning infant girls, which continues today in rural parts of China. ""Frog traces the life of a midwife who witnesses forced late-term abortions, forced sterilization and other horrors, and it does so whimsically Ã¢â¬â in the form of four letters and a play. The midwife's struggle to reconcile her conflicting loyalties to party, family and patients forms the backbone of the narrative, which Mo Yan says had been percolating in his head since the early 1980s,"" a Time magazine story said. Read more: Nobel Peace Prize winner rips into fellow laureate over corruption . Mo recently won China's prestigious Mao Dun literary award -- a potential indication that China has become more open to talking about the issue. He also is famous for his novels ""Red Sorghum,"" a story that takes place during the Japanese occupation of China during World War II, and ""Big Breasts and Wide Hips,"" described as an epic about women. He was asked by Granta if he considers himself a feminist or if he is ""simply drawn to write from a female perspective."" ""First of all, I admire and respect women. I think they are very noble and their life experience and the hardship a woman can endure is always much greater than a man. When we encounter great disasters, women are always more brave than men -- I think because they have their due capacity, they are also mothers. ""The strength that this brings is something we can't imagine. In my books I try to put myself in the shoes of women, I try to understand and interpret this world from the perspective of women. But the bottom line is I am not a woman: I'm a male writer. And the world I interpreted in my books as if I were a woman, might not be well received by women themselves but that is not something I can do anything about. I love and admire women, but nonetheless I am a man,"" he said. Mo told Time that he doesn't worry about censorship when deciding what to write. He told the magazine that the ""inability to attack some topics head on is actually an advantage."" ""There are certain restrictions on writing in every country,"" he said. ""One of the biggest problems in literature is the lack of subtlety. A writer should bury his thoughts deep and convey them through the characters in his novel."" ""By placing much of his writing in the past, and through the adroit subtlety of his magic-realist style, Mo Yan avoids stirring up the animosity of the country's ever vigilant censors any more than he needs to,"" the Time interview said. After the award was announced, Chinese national pride rippled across the Internet. ""China,"" one commenter said on the Nobel website, ""is rising."" Mo himself ""was overjoyed and scared,"" Chinese state media reported, citing a Nobel committee member who informed the author of the prize. Chinese authorities and many Chinese people regard Mo as the first to win the literature prize. The prize in 2000 went to Chinese writer Gao Xingjian, who was born and educated in China but is now a French citizen. Read more: Ideas cost Liu Xiaobo his freedom .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Jonathon Levine was a fiercely ambitious 25-year-old with a Masters degree -- but stuck in a dead end job. This is not how it was meant to be for a boy raised in New York City, nourished on the American dream that hard work and a good education would bring rewards and riches. So what did he do? He left. After researching job vacancies abroad, an opportunity in reclusive North Korea grabbed his attention. Deciding his ambitions didn't stretch that far, Levine settled on a teaching job at Beijing's Tsinghua University instead. ""In the (United) States everyone is so mopey -- it is the end of the world, no jobs, and income inequality is through the roof. We're back to the gilded age in the U.S,"" he said. Fact Check: China tire case . I met Levine in the crowded Tsinghua campus cafeteria. He's had to get used to a lot in a short time. But he's getting to grips with the language and can now order exotic new local food. ""You could say it has been a long march,"" he said. He is part of a new generation waking up to a new reality. America is no longer the land of opportunity. China is. While people like Levine get it, U.S. politicians seem bent on casting China as the bad guy. Beijing is accused of keeping its currency low to win an export advantage and steal American jobs. The China bashing moved to center stage in the second U.S. presidential debate. Both candidates tried to score points against each other by getting tough on China. ""China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years. And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so. On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator,"" proclaimed Republican Mitt Romney. What questions weren't answered in the debate? In response, President Barack Obama, looking far more engaged than he did during the first debate, said Romney was the last person to get tough on China, accusing him of sending jobs to Asia during his business career. ""Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated. In the private sector, Governor Romney's company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing. That's not my phrase. That's what reporters called it,"" Obama said. ""And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11% since I've been president because we have pushed them hard. And we've put unprecedented trade pressure on China. ""That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency. That's going to help to create jobs here."" After a softly-softly approach at the beginning of his administration, Obama has switched tack. He's pivoted U.S. geostrategic policy towards Asia after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. While some countries express concern about the intentions of a more powerful and assertive China, the United States is bolstering its relationships in the region. It is boosting its military presence by carrying out military exercises with allies Japan and South Korea, while some U.S troops have been placed on Australian soil at a new base near the northern city of Darwin. Many China watchers have couched this as an attempt to block the emerging super power's rise. China's Foreign Ministry has said U.S politicians need to treat China fairly and that in the interests of security the relationship needs to be based on trust. Checking candidates' facts on foreign policy . Ahead of a visit to Asia by U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton last month, an editorial in the state-run Chinese Global Times newspaper claimed ""many Chinese people dislike Hillary Clinton. ""She has brought new and extremely profound mutual distrust between the mainstream societies of the two countries."" One of the sources of this hostility has been Washington's perceived interference in maritime disputes with China's neighbors in the region. During her recent visit, Clinton urged those involved in the various territorial disputes to ""begin to engage in a diplomatic process toward the shared goal of a code of conduct."" While Chinese officials responded diplomatically by saying that ""freedom of navigation and safety in the South China Sea is assured,"" another editorial in the Global Times was more scathing, saying it hoped Clinton ""can reflect upon the deep harm she is bringing to the Sino-U.S. relationship in the last few months before she leaves office and try to make up for it."" For her part, Clinton has stressed the importance of deepening bilateral ties. ""As we continue to expand our work on the consequential issues of our time, we must continue to build on this historic opportunity to deepen our relationship, because a thriving China is good for America and a thriving America is good for China,"" she said in a goodwill message to mark China's National Day on October 1. Meanwhile, Levine is watching all of this unfold as he teaches his students about the United States, the country he's left behind. He says it is misguided to fear China. ""It's not like going to the moon, like it might have been a hundred years ago because communication links us much closer together."" For him this is a new world, interdependent with China as a rapidly emerging new axis of power. And for people like he used to be -- back home and struggling -- he has some only half-joking advice. ""Get out, get out, leave everyone behind you."" Global reaction to final debate: Disappointment .","Grant: America is no longer the land of opportunity -- China is .

"(CNN) -- The flagging economy has been the clear-cut No. 1 issue for this year's presidential race. But some other concerns are just timeless. ""Don't underestimate the pull of safety and security in the minds of American voters,"" said Candy Crowley, host of CNN's ""State of the Union"" and moderator of last week's presidential debate. ""There is no issue closer to home and hearth than the safety and security of your family. That is the most basic question the federal government has to answer."" President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney face off Monday night in the last of the three presidential debates, and they will be looking to convince voters that they can protect America and American interests abroad better than their opponent. Foreign policy will be the focus in Boca Raton, Florida, and there is plenty to talk about. There's an ongoing war in Afghanistan, civil war in Syria and a tense standoff between Iran and Israel. Terrorism is still an issue, as evidenced by the recent embassy attack in Libya. And then there is a perceived threat from China. Whoever wins this election will have to make decisions on all of these global issues -- issues that might affect you personally. Here's a look at these likely debate topics and what's at stake for Americans. Afghanistan: Will the war really be over soon? Obama has promised to withdraw combat troops in Afghanistan by the end of 2014, 13 years after the war began. Romney has said he would generally abide by the deadline, although he said he would solicit the advice of military commanders first. The plan, already under way, is to withdraw troops while gradually handing over power to Afghan forces. But the feasibility of that plan is being questioned after some recent setbacks, including a rise in ""green-on-blue"" insider attacks. ""Insider attacks are particularly worrying because they call into question the most critical pillar of the Obama administration's Afghanistan strategy, which is to train and build a capable and credible Afghan force that can maintain security and prevent the return of the Taliban and al Qaeda after foreign troops' departure in two years,"" said Ahmad Majidyar, a senior research associate at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute. ""Training and mentoring requires close partnership and is impossible without trust."" 5 things to watch in tonight's debate . Will Afghanistan be ready by the end of 2014? Or will more U.S. troops be needed longer to oversee security and ensure a successful handoff? Polls have shown that most Americans are tired of the war. A CNN/ORC International survey from March indicated that only 25% of Americans favored the war, and 55% said the U.S. should remove all of its troops before 2014. ""We cannot fight wars by polls,"" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said in response. ""If we do that we're in deep trouble. We have to operate based on what we believe is the best strategy to achieve the mission that we are embarked on. And the mission here is to safeguard our country by ensuring that the Taliban and al Qaeda never again find a safe haven in Afghanistan."" Iran: Are we nearing the 'red line'? While the U.S. tries to end one war, it is trying to prevent another. There are fears that Israel might stage a pre-emptive attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, drawing the U.S. into conflict. Or that the U.S. might be the one to attack to protect its ally Israel. Iran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but Israel and many Western leaders believe Iran is trying to build atomic weapons. At the U.N. General Assembly last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""It's not a question of whether Iran will get the bomb. The question is at what stage can we stop Iran from getting the bomb."" This ""red line"" is under dispute. Experts and policymakers differ about the time Iran would need to develop a nuclear weapon. But the clock is ticking. 13 reasons to watch the last debate on CNN's platforms and nowhere else . ""America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there is still time and space to do so,"" Obama said. ""But that time is not unlimited. ""Make no mistake, a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained."" Romney agrees, although his red line might be sooner than Obama's. Israel is also taking a much more urgent approach. ""Just imagine Iranian aggression with nuclear weapons,"" Netanyahu said at the U.N. ""Who among you would feel safe in the Middle East? Who would be safe in Europe? Who would be safe in America? Who would be safe anywhere?"" Syria: Should America step in? The Arab Spring has seen dictators fall as fledgling democracies try to find their feet, but one country, Syria, is still mired in civil war. Every day, there are more reports of bloodshed and the humanitarian crisis worsens. Thousands of Syrians are dead, and more than a million people have been displaced as rebels battle the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. ""Americans are understandably reluctant to become embroiled in another war in the Middle East, but as the situation in Syria continues to deteriorate, the costs of standing on the sidelines -- in terms of human tragedy, regional instability, and rising extremism -- are growing,"" said Isobel Coleman, a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""At what point does your cost-benefit calculation tip toward greater U.S. intervention?"" Syria's key role in the heart of the Middle East means there might be long-term geopolitical consequences at stake. CNN/Google Campaign Explorer: Ads, money and travel . Many analysts see the conflict as a proxy war between Iran and its Sunni Arab rivals in the region, between Iran and the United States, and even between the United States and Russia. There are also concerns that Syria could devolve, like Iraq once did, into a bloody, sectarian battle that could further destabilize the region. And any time you talk about instability in the Middle East, there are worries about al Qaeda and other hard-line militants filling any power vacuums or failed states. One thing's clear, says CNN's Fareed Zakaria: Syria's neighbors are getting worried. ""Syria's problems will not stay confined to Syria,"" he said. ""Syria is a multi-sectarian society with shared identities with groups in other countries. As a result, the sectarian tensions that are being unleashed there are also spilling over from Syria's borders."" Terrorism: Bin Laden's dead. Now what? Osama bin Laden was killed on President Obama's watch, and al Qaeda's been significantly weakened over the past decade. But last month's attack at the U.S. Embassy in Libya -- an attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens -- shows that terrorists can still pose a threat. Obama has been criticized for security failings at the embassy and for not having enough intelligence about the attack, especially in the immediate aftermath. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the tragedy reflects the president's foreign policy failings. ""If we can't figure out what went on in a relatively open city in a country we had helped liberate, why do we think we know what's going on with Iran's nuclear program?"" the former House speaker said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Romney's new debate strategy . Obama has taken an aggressive approach to pursuing al Qaeda terrorists abroad, and he's authorized six times as many drone strikes as his predecessor, according to CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. But will voters see the Benghazi attack as an indictment of his anti-terrorism efforts? Or will they consider it a tragic exception? China: A different kind of threat . China has been accused of anti-competitive trade practices that are undercutting U.S. industries and handicapping the American economy. ""One of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency,"" Romney said last week. ""China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years."" By keeping the value of its yuan low compared to the dollar, China makes its goods cheaper (and more attractive) to American consumers while U.S. goods are more expensive to Chinese consumers. That, of course, directly impacts American businesses and jobs. Obama has been applying pressure behind the scenes, said Adam Hersh, an economist at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, and China has raised its exchange rate nearly 8% from 2010 to April 2012. Other economists, however, think the yuan is still undervalued. Another way China directly the U.S. is that it is one of America's leading creditors. There is concern that because China owns so much U.S. debt, it might hold too much sway over what the U.S. wants to do in the future. CNN Electoral Map: The Race to 270 . ""A nation with our current levels of unsustainable debt ... cannot hope to sustain for very long its superiority from a military perspective, or its influence in world affairs,"" Adm. Michael Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last month. A recent poll shows that the public is divided about what to do about China. Should the U.S. be tougher on Beijing or try to build a stronger relationship? But a large majority in the poll say the U.S. debt with China is a very serious problem, as is the loss of U.S. jobs to China and the U.S. trade deficit with China. So even if tonight's debate is about foreign policy, expect the economy to make a cameo. 7 foreign policy questions you would ask .

"Havana (CNN) -- Cuba has stepped up efforts to douse speculation over the health of its former leader Fidel Castro by publishing an article under his name in state-run media in which he scoffs at recent rumors and those who circulated them. The article, published on the official website Cubadebate early Monday, is accompanied by photos of Castro, 86, walking with a cane in a garden and looking at a copy of Granma, the state-run newspaper. ""I don't even remember what a headache is,"" Castro writes in the article, saying the photos are ""proof of what liars"" those responsible for the rumors are. The article comes after a former Venezuelan vice president said Sunday that Castro was ""doing very well"" and showed reporters a snapshot of the former Cuban leader that he said was taken the day before. Read more: Twitterer denies his account is source of Castro death rumor . Speculation has surged over Castro's health in recent weeks. He has not been seen publicly since March, when he met with Pope Benedict XVI during the pontiff's visit to Cuba. In the article published early Monday, Castro cites the coverage of the Bay of Pigs attack and the Cuban missile crisis in the early 1960s as previous examples of misinformation by news media groups that are ""almost all in the hands of the privileged and rich."" He singled out for particular scorn a recent report by the Spanish newspaper ABC that cited a Venezuelan doctor as saying that Castro had had a stroke and was close to death. Elias Jaua, the former Venezuelan vice president, said Sunday he had discussed a variety of subjects with the former Cuban leader in a lengthy meeting. ""Comandante Fidel was kind enough to meet with us yesterday,"" Jaua said. ""We talked for five hours about agriculture, history, international politics."" Cuba state media releases message from Fidel Castro . The photograph, Jaua said, shows Castro and several members of his family in a van accompanying Jaua to the Havana hotel where he is staying. Employees at the Hotel Nacional said they spoke with Castro and he looked well. ""He had good color. ... He was happy, with a permanent smile on his face, and talking about a lot of things,"" said Antonio Martinez, the director of the government-run hotel.

On Wednesday, Cuban state media released the first communique said to be from the ex-leader since speculation over his health reached a fever pitch earlier this month. The message quoted Castro congratulating doctors graduating from a Cuban medical institute and mentioning the 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis. Castro's usually frequent newspaper columns and musings suddenly ended in June. But his silence after the re-election of close ally Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in October prompted many of his opponents to wonder whether Castro was again ailing or perhaps already dead. ""The comandante is well, following his daily routine, reading, exercising,"" said Alex Castro, one of Castro's sons, told Cuban state media after the reports of his ill health. Still, a barrage of postings on Twitter and other social media had Castro at death's door. He said in the article Monday that he had stopped his newspaper writing because it was no longer his ""role to take up the pages of our press"" when there were other issues requiring the nation's attention. Castro never fully recovered after a surgery for a still unknown intestinal illness in 2006. Two years later, his brother Raul Castro officially succeeded him.

"London, England (CNN) -- Two paintings by Pablo Picasso and a third by Henri Matisse were among works auctioned off Tuesday at Christie's, including ""Jacqueline,"" a Picasso not seen publicly since 1967. The 1963 work is a portrait of Picasso's second wife, whom he married in 1961, Christie's said. The painting -- ""Tete de femme"" is its French name -- sold for 8.1 million pounds (nearly $13 million), far above the pre-sale estimate of 3 million to 4 million pounds ($4.79 million to $6.38 million). ""Jacqueline became a regular model for the artist who had by this time become internationally famous,"" according to the auction house. ""She was an instrumental figure in protecting him from the increasing demands of his fame and reputation."" The woman had a very short neck, Christie's said, ""and it is said that Picasso would often humorously exaggerate its size in his portraits."" The couple lived at Notre-Dame-de-Vie, a large villa near Mougins, France, and Jacqueline ""became the most important of all his muses and models,"" the auction house said. The painting has never been offered at auction, and has been in the same collection since 1981. Also offered in the auction, called the ""Impressionist and Modern Art Evening Sale,"" is ""Homme Assis sur une Chaise,"" a Picasso portrait painted in 1956, soon after he had moved from Paris, France, to La Californie, a villa overlooking Cannes in the south of France. ""Settled at his new home, it did not take long for the proximity of the sea to have an influence on Picasso's work, and the present portrait shows a subject with traditional fisherman's shirt and with a fisherman's rugged features,"" according to Christie's description. The painting was expected to fetch between 3.5 million and 5.5 million pounds ($5.59 million to $8.78 million), according to the auction house, but ultimately sold for 6 million pounds ($9.7 million). ""Impressionist and modern art has continued to attract collectors over the last 18 months, and it has proved to be a robust and stable category of art,"" Giovanna Bertazzoni, director and head of impressionist and modern art for Christie's London, said in a statement. ""We saw a consistent demand throughout 2009, coupled with a significant drop in the levels of supply; however, during the last six months of 2009, there has been a noticeable uptake with a continuing growth in confidence from consignors."" Also offered was ""Nu Aux Jambes Croisees,"" a 1936 work by Matisse. The painting is offered at auction for the first time and has been in the same Swiss collection since 1963. And ""Mademoiselle Grimprel au Ruban Rouge,"" an 1880 portrait by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, portrays Helene Grimprel, granddaughter of Armand Grimprel, a wealthy banker who became a great patron of the arts, Christie's said. The Matisse sold for to 3.7 million pounds ($6 million), while the Renoir is expected to bring up to 3 million pounds ($4.9 million). Overall, Christie's said that four of the works offered Tuesday night went for more than 5 million pounds ($7.99 million) and 21 others topped 1 million pounds ($1.6 million). The total proceeds were 76.8 million pounds ($122.1 million).

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- Tuesday night, the Democratic Party displayed its deep commitment to women's equality. Drawing upon her own life story, a story of discrimination shared by too many women across America, Lilly Ledbetter delivered a rousing speech as only she can. Ledbetter, the face of the fight for women's equality, reminded us all just how far we have come in the last four years. She framed fair pay as both an economic and moral issue. She reminded us all of President Barack Obama's first act in office, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which he signed thinking of his mother, wife and two young daughters. Ledbetter, a former manager at a tire plant, knows that her family was deprived of thousands of dollars because of discrimination, money that could have been put back into the U.S. economy. As my mother's son and the brother to two older and wiser sisters, this issue resonates particularly deeply with me. Equal pay for equal work should not be a controversial issue in the 21st Century, but like the debate over contraception and choice, somehow the Republican Party has reignited a debate that should have ended decades ago. Just to be clear, my sisters would scoff if my work was ever called equal to theirs. In addition, first lady Michelle Obama reminded Americans that her most important title is still ""Mom in Chief."" She identified herself as yet another mother struggling with the difficulties of parenting who cares more than anything about the country that she will leave to her children. Michelle Obama did not need to shout, ""I love you, women"" in order to be understood by the women of America; her story is their story. While women will surely play a crucial role in this election, Tuesday night served as a reminder that Obama's commitment to women is not political -- it's personal.

"(CNN) -- English racing was deprived of its first Triple Crown winner in more than 40 years after Encke, ridden by Mickael Barzalona, got up to beat favorite Camelot by three quarters of a length in the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse Saturday. Camelot had been aiming to emulate Nijinsky by winning the 2,000 Guineas, the Epsom Derby and the St Leger in the same season. But he was out-gunned by Encke, whose victory gives his owner, Sheikh Mohammed, a sixth victory in this race and puts him second on the all-time list. French jockey Barzalona, riding in his first St Leger, described his victory aboard Encke as ""very easy,"" saying he was very happy with the result. In a highly tactical race, pacemaker Dartford dictated the early pace, with Camelot content to settle towards the back of the field. The legend that is Camelot . But when the field turned into the home straight Camelot's jockey, Joseph O'Brien, was unable to get his colt into space and Encke was able to open up daylight between himself and the chasing pack. When Camelot was eventually maneuvered into position he ran on well to close the gap on the Godolphin horse but could only get to within three quarters of a length. Encke's victory means that not only does England's 42-year wait for a Triple Crown winner continue, but also that Aiden O'Brien does not become the first trainer in history to make a clean sweep of the English Classics in one season; his Ballydoyle operation had already won the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby with Camelot as well as their fillies' equivalents, the 1,000 Guineas and the Oaks. Camelot's immediate future remains uncertain with a tilt at next month's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe now arguably more, rather than less likely following his defeat at Doncaster.","Camelot fails in bid to win prestigious Triple Crown in St Leger Stakes at Doncaster racecourse, England .

"(CNN) -- East Coast residents, some of whom have suffered without power for 12 days, waited Saturday for officials to come through on big promises to end the blackouts. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he expects power to be almost fully restored by the end of the day to the approximately 57,000 customers in his state living in the dark. ""Life will be back -- for most of New Jersey -- to normal come Sunday,"" he said Friday. One week ago, more than 2.4 million customers were without power in 10 states and the District of Columbia following Superstorm Sandy. This week's nor'easter hampered some of the repairs. By Saturday, about 225,000 customers remained without power in the region. Photos: Finding beauty in the chaos . The majority of New Jersey's outages are the responsibility of Jersey Central Power & Light. The company's website backed Christie's prediction, with a map showing that most areas will have electricity restored by Saturday night. Relief was not as certain next door on Long Island, where a majority -- 127,000 -- of customers remained in the dark. Those homes are served by the Long Island Power Authority, a utility that has come under fire from residents and politicians alike. High school football players help their fellow Sandy victims . Angry customers flooded the company's Facebook page with insults and stories of suffering a cold winter without power. One man redesigned the utility's logo to read ""Lie-pa,"" as opposed to its usual acronym, LIPA. LIPA officials stressed Saturday that getting people back online is the utility's top priority. ""We all want to get this wrapped up,"" said LIPA COO Mike Hervey. ""We want to get the lights on as quickly as we possibly can."" More than 1 million customers have had their power restored, according to John Bruckner, president of Long Island Electric Transmission & Distribution Services for National Grid. ""We expect to restore 99% of the customers who lost and can safely accept power by the end of day Tuesday,"" Bruckner said. Frustration mounts in New York neighborhood . On Friday, local and federal officials who stood to speak before residents in Oceanside, on Long Island, were met with boos and pointed questions about whether they had any power and how comfortable they were. ""What are you doing for us?"" some in the crowd shouted. Braving the boos, Kate Murray, presiding supervisor for the town of Hempstead, suggested residents ask themselves where the utility officials are. ""LIPA is the only entity that can turn on your electricity. Where are they?"" she said. ""They won't talk to us. We call them every day; they won't give us one answer."" Murray seemed to successfully shift the residents' cries against the politicians into chants of ""Where is LIPA? Where is LIPA?"" ""LIPA has absolutely abrogated all of its duties,"" she said. ""They should be wiped off the face of the earth."" No one from the utility was present to address the anger. In a written statement, the company said it has more than 8,200 linemen and tree-trimming crews making progress. ""When possible, we will restore power to customers who have been without power for the longest time,"" the utility said in the statement. ""Your safety and well-being remain our No. 1 priority and we thank you for your continued patience during this difficult time."" On Saturday, Bruckner acknowledged the frustration and said utility workers ""will not stop"" until power is restored to everyone.

"(EW.com) -- The writer James Dickey once described a poet as ''someone who stands outside in the rain, hoping to be struck by lightning.'' He could've been talking about Taylor Swift. When the Dean of Tween isn't inviting guys to meet her in the pouring rain, she's courting danger any other way she can, just for the drama of it all. Her new album is called ""Red"" -- as in red light or red alert -- and it finds her singing about walking directly into traffic, wading into quicksand, and flirting with the kinds of jerks Kanye West might toast to. ''You look like bad news,'' she purrs on ''22.'' ''I gotta have you.'' One gets the feeling that it's not this guy's love she's after. She's just using him for the breakup songs. This time around, it's getting harder to feel sorry for Swift. Whether she's plucking her mandolin, belting out U2-inspired arena rock, or harmonizing with Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol or Ed Sheeran, she never sounds happier than when she's getting dumped hard enough to justify a good revenge anthem. The quotable Taylor Swift . Luckily, she's recruited the world's greatest boy-shaming pop team -- Max Martin, the Swede behind Kelly Clarkson's ''Since U Been Gone'' and Pink's ''So What,'' and his partner Shellback -- to produce three of her best tell-offs yet. The smash ''We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together'' is such a sublime explosion of Euro-pop glee, robots will still pillow-fight to it in 2035. And between the dubstep-lite chorus of ''I Knew You Were Trouble'' and gooey-sweet synths of ''22,'' Red should be required listening at the EDM Camp for Girls, if such a thing existed. (In Swift's polka-dot world, it totally would.) ''22'' also shows how savvy Swift is about uniting guy haters of all ages. After enlisting her girlfriends to ''make fun of our exes,'' she invites them to dance ''like we're 22.'' She is 22, but this song belongs just as much to the preteens and power moms who pretend to be that age. At times, Swift sounds too eager to TMZ-ify her own life. ''Starlight'' seems to nod to her recent Kennedy wedding-crasher scandal (''We snuck into a yacht-club party/Pretending to be a duchess and a prince''). And ''Treacherous'' is nearly NC-17. (When she sighs, ''I'll do anything you say, if you say it with your hands,'' it's safe to assume she's not dating an ASL interpreter.) But the dishiest track is also one of the best. Over plaintive acoustic strumming, ''All Too Well'' recalls a trip to meet an old boyfriend's family (Thanksgiving with the Gyllenhaals, perhaps?), and goes into heartbreaking detail about nights spent singing to the radio or flipping through photos of her ex as a ''little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed.'' She leaves her scarf at his sister's place, and he keeps it long after they've split, which makes you wonder. ""Red"" might be about flirting with danger, but who's risking more here: Swift, or the guy whose baby photos are now public domain? For him, it's not such a fair trade. He walks away with a scarf.

"(CNN) -- North Korea says it will retaliate if its ""satellite"" launch from its northeastern coast is intercepted, with the communist nation saying interference would ""mean a war."" The statement came as the North cut off communications with neighboring South Korea. North Korean soldiers at the border village of Panmunjom on December 6, 2008. ""Shooting our satellite for peaceful purposes will precisely mean a war,"" a spokesman for the North Korean army said in a statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). U.S. and South Korean officials have said that North Korea appears to be preparing to test-fire its long-range missile, the Taepodong-2, under the guise of launching a satellite into space. The missile is thought to have an intended range of about 4,200 miles (6,700 kilometers), which -- if true -- could give it the capability of striking Alaska or Hawaii. North Korea's announcement comes as South Korea and the United States start their annual joint military drills on Monday. ""We have said several times that the U.S.-South Korean military exercises are annual defensive exercises,"" Kim Ho-nyun, spokesman for South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said at a news briefing Monday. ""We again urge North Korea to maintain the agreed stance of mutual respect and to stop its verbal attacks and actions that are raising tensions on the Korean peninsula,"" Kim said. The North said it has shut its borders to ""any enemies"" and has cut off ""the north-south military communications in order to guarantee the security."" North Korea said the communications channel will remain closed until the 12-day joint exercise by South Korean and U.S. forces ends on March 20, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. Kim said his government is urging North Korea ""to immediately retract this measure and to allow the smooth flow of personnel and communication."" As of Monday morning, hundreds of South Koreans were kept from crossing the border to and from an industrial complex because North Korea cut off military communications, preventing the workers from getting clearance to return home, Kim said. On Saturday, U.S. envoy Stephen Bosworth said he wants dialogue with North Korea, but he also spoke against North Korea's move to go forward with a launch, saying it would be ""ill-advised.""","North Korea says it will retaliate if a ""satellite"" from its north coast is intercepted .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan secured their fourth straight victory in Italy's top flight Sunday with a 2-0 win over Catania to maintain their pursuit of unbeaten Serie A leaders Juventus. Boosted by their 1-0 defeat of AC Milan in the city derby last weekend, Inter were always on top in the San Siro after star man Antonio Cassano headed home in the 28th minute. Rodrigo Palacio added the clinching second with five minutes to go as Diego Milito set up his fellow Argentine to score his first goal for Inter. Inter coach Andrea Stramaccioni was delighted by their performance, particularly after the break. ""We're a team that's growing. The coach should only try to improve the team match by match,"" he told the official Inter website. ""Today was a step forward with a spectacular second half. Perhaps it was the first time we were fluid without giving anything away."" They stay in fourth place, four points adrift of Juventus, who maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a 2-0 win over Napoli in a top of the table clash Saturday evening. Martin Caceres and 19-year-old Paul Pogba scored for Juve, who have opened up a three point lead over their opponents. Lazio's 3-2 win over struggling Milan has left them in third ahead of Inter on goal difference. The top four are well clear of fifth placed Fiorentina, who had to settle for a share of the points in the 1-1 draw at Chievo. French striker Cyril Thereau put the home side ahead in the first half but La Viola leveled only a minute later when Argentine defender Guillermo Rodriguez scored after a corner. In the English Premier League, fourth placed Everton had Steven Pienaar sent off in the second half at Loftus Road as they were held 1-1 by Queens Park Rangers. Midfielder Pienaar went for a second yellow card on the hour mark, but his side held on for a draw which leaves them a point ahead of Tottenham Hotspur. David Moyes' men went behind to a deflected Junior Hoilett strike before Sylvain Distin's header deflected in off QPR goalkeeper Julio Cesar's back for an own goal to level. Sunday's other game in the EPL saw Sunderland and Newcastle draw 1-1 in the Tyne-Wear derby. Newcastle took the lead at the Stadium of Light through Yohan Cabaye's early strike, but had Cheick Tiote sent off for violent conduct in the 25th minute. The home side pressed hard for an equalizer and were rewarded when Demba Ba diverted a John O'Shea header past his own goalkeeper late on. In the German Bundesliga, Augsburg were held to a goalless draw at Nuremberg, while Hamburg went down to their first defeat since Rafael van der Vaart signed from Tottenham as they lost 1-0 to Stuttgart.

"New York (CNN) -- A former teacher at a Brooklyn high school who claimed she was sexually harassed and verbally assaulted by her students has agreed to a $450,000 settlement from the city of New York, her attorney and school officials told CNN. As part of the settlement, Theresa Reel, 52, resigned from the School for Legal Studies in Brooklyn in exchange for having poor ratings on her employment record cleared, her attorney said. The settlement was reached ahead of a trial that was scheduled to begin earlier this month. ""I think we had a very strong case,"" said attorney Joshua Parkhurst, ""but this way my client can go on with her life."" Reel told CNN she was subjected to continuous verbal assaults and sexual harassment by students, who she claimed touched her breasts and wrote insults against her on a desk, shortly after she began working at the school in 2005. The educator said she reported the students' behavior to the school multiple times, but the principal's response was worse than inadequate. ""I was told I wanted to make the school look bad, I was called a troublemaker,"" she said. ""That was the worst for me: that my employer reacted this way. I felt so worthless."" In May 2008, Parkhurst wrote the New York City Department of Education to complain about the harassment allegations and the school's response, and to ask for compensation. He said his client in some instances had been reprimanded or threatened with discipline if she insisted the school administration take action in response to an incident. The department responded that in each instance of reported misconduct, the students involved were ""disciplined and/or dealt with appropriately,"" and that no poor job performance marks against Reel were ""a result of reporting any incident involving a student."" The department also said that in the course of its investigation, it was advised of an occasion in which Reel ""wore a low-cut, V-neck, lace top while teaching one of her classes."" The senior counsel wrote that ""she should dress in an appropriate manner when working at school and teaching her classes."" Reel said she made multiple requests for a transfer from the school before filing a discrimination lawsuit. In May of this year, a judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to decide the case and set the trial date for September 10. The city made its settlement offer before the trial began. The education department said it does not comment on ongoing lawsuits or settlements, but the New York City Law Department issued a statement saying the agreement was based ""on an assessment of the City's best interest in this case, which included obtaining an agreement from the plaintiff to leave the DOE's employment and not seek to be employed by our school system again."" When she took the job at the Brooklyn high school, Reel said, she had already been teaching at the high school level for seven years. ""I am not a 22-year-old without any experience. I know how to handle a class,"" she told CNN on Friday, but this experience was so bad that it brought her to the brink of suicide. ""Every school year I hoped the situation would get better but it didn't,"" Reel said. ""I just didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I was emotionally and physically drained."" Now, she says, she is happy to go on with her life. ""I also hope what I did will empower other school teachers to go forward with similar cases."" Reel said she is ""relieved"" by the settlement and would like to look for a new job, probably in another state.","Theresa Reel agrees to $450,000 settlement with the city .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick as Barcelona won a nine-goal thriller, 5-4 against Deportivo La Coruna at the Estadio Municipal de Riazor on Saturday and go three clear at the top of La Liga. Tito Vilanova's side looked to have the game wrapped up as early as the 18th minute when Lionel Messi scored Barca's third goal after Jordi Alba and Cristain Tello had netted in the opening 10 minutes. But Deportivo responded with two goals of their own. First, Portugal forward Pizzi converted from the penalty spot in the 26th minute followed by an Alex Bergantinos effort 11 minutes later. Barca were back in control by halftime as Messi bagged his second of the night to give the visitors a 4-2 lead. The home side reduced the deficit to one goal immediately after halftime with Pizzi scoring a second before Messi completed his hat-trick in the 77th minute. His teasing run followed by a thumping low drive past keeper Daniel Aranzubia looked to have finally settled matters. But Jodi Alba's own goal two minutes later once again threw the result into doubt. Urged on by their supporters, Deportivo searched for an equalizer but Barcelona clung on for the three points. Real Madrid enjoyed a comfortable victory 2-0 over Celta Vigo at the Bernabau on Saturday. A 10th minute goal from Gonzalo Higuain and a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty midway through the second half ensured Jose Mourinho's side continue their rise up the table after a sluggish start to the season. Madrid have now taken 13 points from their last four league games while newly promoted Celta continue their run of up and down form -- they have yet to draw this season -- and stay on nine points and currently lie 13th in the table. Malaga bounced back from defeat against Atletico Madrid earlier in the month with a battling 2-1 win over Real Valladolid at the Estadio La Rosaleda. The visitors took the lead in the ninth minute thanks to Manucho before Isco equalized five minutes before the break. Valladolid were reduced to 10 men for the final ten minutes of the game when Manucho received a second yellow card for a foul and Malaga took full advantage with Joaquin scoring an 87th-minute winner. The win means Malaga maintain their grip on third place with 17 points from eight matches. Second-place Atletico Madrid travel to Real Sociedad on Sunday. Meanwhile in Serie A, Juventus put daylight between themselves and second-placed Napoli with a 2-0 win. Uruguay's Jose Caceres and French teenager Paul Pogba both came off the bench to score late goals for the reigning champions and extend their unbeaten record in the league this season while bringing Napoli's to an end. The win means Juventus are now three points clear at the top of the table having taken 22 points from their opening eight games. Napoli remain in second on 19 points. Third-placed Lazio moved clear of Inter Milan (who play Catania on Sunday) with a 3-2 win over AC Milan at the Stadio Olimpico. The home side stormed into a 3-0 lead thanks to goals from Brazilian midfielder Hernanes (25th minute) Antonio Candreva (41st minute) and Miroslav Klose (50th minute). Milan looked dead and buried but mounted a spirited comeback with Nigel de Jong pulling a goal back in the 61st minute and striker Stephan El Shaarawy's 79th minute strike setting up a tense climax. Despite their best efforts, Milan couldn't find an equalizer, leaving last year's runners-up mid-table with just seven points from eight games.","Messi hat-trick inspires Barcelona to 5-4 win over Deportivo La Coruna .

"(CNN) -- It now seems like a lifetime ago that a young man in Circleville, Ohio, first pinned the Pickaway County sheriff's badge to his shirt. It was 1965, and he had just beaten the man who took the office from his daddy four years earlier. The young man is 80 now, with a lawman son of his own. But Dwight E. Radcliff is still wearing that badge. He is believed to be the longest-serving sheriff in the United States. Radcliff says he didn't set out to make history, and that it recently ""struck me that enough is enough."" He has decided to hang up his holster for good. From running the jailhouse to rounding up criminals, Radcliff witnessed the best and worst his fellow man had to offer during 12 terms as sheriff. He has worked for the department since 1953, when he started at the bottom as a deputy. ""I'm just thankful to the citizens of Pickaway County for seeing fit to elect me."" Radcliff recently told CNN in a telephone interview. ""It's been an enjoyable career and I'd love to do it again."" While Radcliff says he's ready for retirement, his wife of 58 years, Betty, isn't so sure. ""He doesn't golf, he doesn't bowl, he doesn't dance,"" she said. ""I don't know what he's going to do."" For starters, he will try to keep the sheriff's business in the family. His father, Charles Radcliff, was the Pickaway County sheriff from 1931 to 1961. Now, his son, Robert B. Radcliff, 50, is hoping voters will choose him on November 6 to succeed his dad and become the county's third Sheriff Radcliff. ""I never take anything for granted,"" Robert Radcliff said of his chances at the polls. ""But it's been going good, it's been very positive."" Pickaway County, population 55,000 or so, derives its name from the Pekowi band of Shawnee Indians. It is a slice of agricultural America near the center of Ohio and is also know for its golf courses. The county's most popular event is the annual Circleville Pumpkin Show, which is held each year on the third Wednesday in October. A Democrat like his father, the younger Radcliff is a veteran law enforcement officer. He spent 32 years climbing the ranks from deputy to lieutenant before retiring in February. ""My father never wanted to show any favoritism,"" he said, ""I was there for 12 years before I was promoted. Working for your dad wasn't easy. We butted heads a lot."" Dwight Radcliff was raised to be a lawman. He was born in the official sheriff's residence, located inside the old jail. What was confinement to the inmates was home to three generations of Radcliffs. ""I was the matron,"" his wife, Betty, recalled. ""I took care of all the adult women and the juvenile boys and girls, and that was quite an experience."" A new lockup replaced the old jailhouse 20 years ago. The sheriff's staff, which began with just a small handful, now numbers more than 100. Dwight Radcliff still goes to work on Sundays and holidays. He has 10 walkie-talkies in the house -- including one in the bathroom, and another in the laundry, said his wife. But if his dedication remains the same, many other aspects to the jobs have changed over the years. ""When I first ran for the office, there were a lot of things you can do with a handshake without worrying about the controversy,"" Dwight Radcliff said. ""And where I find it very difficult is the way criminal statutes have changed. The maneuvers you have to go through in the courts, it seems you have roadblocks wherever you go."" Those obstacles make the pursuit of justice more difficult, the sheriff says. ""I'm the kind of person that feels if you do something, you commit a crime, you pay,"" he explains. ""I don't want somebody charged that is not guilty. It used to be if someone was arrested they would have to get their own attorney, now all they got to do is say they don't have the funds and the state appoints a public defender and that's added money. You can't take a chance today."" Radcliff is passionate about his profession. ""He's given 24/7,"" wife Betty said. ""As sheriff, he never gets away. We've sat down for Thanksgiving dinner and he'd get a call and we wouldn't see him for 24 hours. He never stopped to eat, he would keep going until he got his man. And I understood that."" It's in Radcliff's blood, their son agrees. ""He demands so much. He wants to know everything that's going on. He lives it, eats it, breathes it."" Asked what the hardest part of the job is, Sheriff Radcliff doesn't hesitate: ""When you have to go to a motor vehicle accident and notify the next of kin. The knock on the door and the mom in her bathrobe answers and you have to tell them that her son was just killed."" Retiring will give Dwight Radcliff more time to spend with his children and grandchildren. He and his wife will get the chance to do things they never could while he was on the job. ""Our health is still good and we better take what time we have and enjoy ourselves instead of looking back and saying 'I wish we did this,'"" he said, adding that he leaves without regrets and knows he did the best he could. And he said he's ready for some down time. ""If anyone doesn't like me because of what I've done, so let it be,"" he said. I've done my job.""","Pickaway County, Ohio, Sheriff Dwight E.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama and rival Mitt Romney have targeted Ohio with incessant campaigning, a slew of television ads and nonstop political phone calls. The importance of the Buckeye State cannot be overstated: Ohio has not voted for the loser in the presidential election since 1960. In other words, as goes Ohio, so goes the nation. ""They're just going to badger voters over and over again until they cast a ballot,"" said Paul A. Beck, a political science professor at the Ohio State University. ""It doesn't really matter where they pick up the votes, so the campaigns are everywhere. They're visiting all over the state and running ads everywhere."" Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have visited Ohio 10 times in the past 30 days, including a rally in Dayton on Tuesday. Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, have stumped 21 times. It is the second most-visited state on the campaign trail, behind only Florida, another swing state. The Obama campaign has flooded the Ohio airwaves with $57 million in advertising; Romney for President has spent $34 million -- anything to pick up the state's vital 18 electoral votes. Five things we learned from the final debate . In fact, Beck said, all political ad space in the major TV markets has been purchased through the November 6 election. ""Ohio is ground zero for the jobs debate,"" GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos said. Castellanos, who was a top media adviser to the 2004 Bush-Cheney re-election campaign and a Romney adviser in 2008, said Ohio is ""a microcosm of American swing voters: Reagan Democrats; suburban soccer moms; and even Up-Tinos, upwardly mobile Latinos, an increasingly important target for both parties."" If the campaigns needed any more ammo for their efforts, they got it on Monday. The latest collection of polls in Ohio shows a razor-thin margin separating the candidates. The CNN Poll of Polls shows Obama at 48% and Romney at 45% in the Buckeye State. ""It's a very critical state,"" CNN Chief National Correspondent John King told Wolf Blitzer on Monday. ""Right now, you have that slight lead for the president; Gov. Romney's team would say it's a tie."" Pundits say that Ohio is a must-win state for Romney, that his chances for the necessary 270 electoral college votes become nearly impossible without carrying Ohio. ""This is the big one,"" King said. The Romney campaign also has focused on three typically Republican states that went for Obama in 2008: Indiana, North Carolina and Virginia. Getting those three states, plus Ohio, would be crucial in electing Romney as the nation's next president. By contrast, Obama could win by picking up Wisconsin, Iowa and Ohio. ""You could make an argument the president should just camp out right here in the Midwest,"" King said. At the center of it all is Ohio, one of the nation's great industrial states, with 11.5 million people. Cleveland, Akron, Youngstown and Toledo have traditionally voted Democrat in support of the auto, steel and tire unions, while Cincinnati and Columbus have leaned Republican. Obama carried Ohio in 2008 52% to 47% over John McCain, riding a wave of increased Democratic voter turnout over 2004 and winning traditionally Republican areas. But whether Obama can rally his base in the same numbers remains one of the lingering questions this election season. Campaign enters final stretch . ""It's too close to call,"" said Ohio State's Beck. ""The outcome is probably going to depend on turnout and how good of a job the campaigns do in getting out their faithful."" Buoyed by polling that shows Obama enjoying a wide margin among female voters (53% to 41%), Biden stumped in Canton, Ohio, on Monday, chiding Romney for his ""binders full of women"" response when the GOP hopeful was asked at the last debate about pay inequities in the work force. ""He started talking about binders. Binders?"" Biden said. ""Whoa!"" Romney leads among men by a similar margin. The gap between Obama and Romney has narrowed in the past month. Ahead of the first presidential debate, Obama enjoyed as much as a 10 percentage point advantage, and many political experts believed the election was virtually over. But then came Romney's October surge. ""It's very simple: Once again, it's all coming down to Ohio,"" said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former policy adviser to Bill Clinton. ""I feel quite confident this time around that whoever wins Ohio will be the next president of the United States, and I very much suspect that the campaigns agree with that proposition."" Beck attributes Romney's comeback to three issues: . Ã¢â¬Â¢ the first presidential debate, which most people believed Romney won. Ã¢â¬Â¢ the events in Libya that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Ã¢â¬Â¢ voters alienated by Obama who wanted to like Romney. Ohio newspapers ink their 2012 presidential picks . ""The first debate let people who were looking for reasons to support Romney and made them feel that he was of a presidential caliber,"" Beck said. He said he is paying close attention to the blue-collar Democratic areas in the northern part of the state, where race could play a factor in the voting. The auto bailout has played out well in Ohio (one in eight jobs is connected to the auto industry), and Beck said many blue-collar types would like to support Romney but have trouble relating to him because of his track record of shipping jobs overseas. ""They just don't resonate with Romney,"" Beck said. ""But they're not heavily attracted to Obama."" Obama and Biden have campaigned hard in Ohio and Michigan on Romney's opinion piece that said to let Detroit go bankrupt, repeating the refrain ""Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive.""A billboard in the Ohio city of Defiance, where GM has a plant, carried that same message for four weeks, but not before stirring a swirl of emotions. ""A lot of people here were offended by it, Republicans and Democrats alike,"" said Mayor Bob Armstrong, a Democrat. ""The message was just not a good message."" The Defiance mayor said he hopes Americans ""stop all the bickering"" and ""get behind our president, whoever it might be, and put all this behind us."" In a sign of voter enthusiasm, more than 1.4 million Ohioans have voted or requested an absentee ballot since early and absentee voting began on October 2. Almost a third of Ohioans voted early in 2008, in large numbers for Obama. Republicans say they're better organized this time around and hope to make inroads there. One thing's for sure, Beck said, Ohio voters can expect more campaign stops by the candidates, more phone calls, more political mailings. ""We're pretty well-balanced between the two parties,"" Beck said. ""And that means both candidates are going to court Ohioans because both sides feel they can win.""

"(CNN) -- The presidential face off on foreign policy between President Barack Obama and his Republican rival Mitt Romney was geared to sway U.S. voters, but at points on the globe that the candidates argued over -- from Libya to Pakistan to China -- netizens, analysts and activists tuned in and weighed in. China . After weeks of tough talk about China, the candidates made little mention of the growing superpower. Netizens in China did not seem to take sides but instead used the debate to banter about the relationship with the United States. ""Whoever the winner, they are still all scoundrels and will not benefit China in any way,"" a tweet by @SiShiSiNianDeSi read on China's Weibo social network. Five things we learned from the final debate . ""China only factors into a small part of the debate. From these bits and pieces, any conclusions you draw is like that of a blind man feeling out an elephant,"" said another post by @YouYiSuiYi. China's state news agency used the occasion to admonish whomever may become president to ""tone down his get-tough-on-China rhetoric made along the campaign trail"" and deal realistically with ""China's inevitable rise."" Which candidate is elected seemed only to make a slight difference to China to analyst Wang Feng, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center in Beijing. ""Yes and no,"" he said, when asked if there were significant differences in the candidates' stances as concerns China. ""Both candidates, they made it clear that they want to treat China as a partner and that they want China to play by the rules,"" Wang said. But Romney's negative rhetoric stuck out, particularly that ""he'll designate China as a currency manipulator,"" Wang said. CNN Fact Check: Obama ccuses Romney of criticiaing his handling of China tire case . He found Romney's idea that China could not enter into a trade war with the United States as a reaction to tough measures from Washington because of the already existing trade imbalance ""a very simple calculation."" ""The decisions to be made in Beijing here will not only be based on the trade volumes but on domestic political concerns,"" he said. But Wang advised that keeping up pressure on China about trade issues has been effective, particularly in the area of copyright. ""People start to use copyrighted materials, and people started to pay more and more respect to intellectual property,"" he said. Calls by the U.S. and international agencies to do so have ""certainly played a role."" Obama wins final debate, but does it matter? Afghanistan and Pakistan . In Pakistan, Romney's comments on the country's nuclear weapons program raised some ire. ""Pakistan and the U.S. have an old friendship, and it's disappointing to hear that Mitt Romney brought this relationship down to one that is purely based on Pakistan being a country with 100 nuclear warheads and counting,"" said Naveed Chaudhry, an aide to President Asif Ali Zardari. Chaudhry said he wishes the United States would recognize what Pakistan has done for the war on terror. Raza Rumi, director of the the think tank the Jinnah Institute, said it does not much matter who is president. CNN Fact Check: Romney, Obama and Iraq . ""Both candidates made reference to drone strikes and said they would continue,"" he said. ""Pakistani public opinion is really swelling against the drone strikes."" Rumi was also disappointed there was no mention of a long-term strategy towards Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""I can understand at the moment the American public wants the government to exit from Afghanistan, but surely there should be a strategy for that, because we have suffered once in the 1990s with that void, when Afghanistan was left (by the Soviets)."" Tweets out of Kabul, Afghanistan, indicated that viewers there felt left out of the debate. ""So who won the debate today? I know who lost. Afghans. Little mention of war, except for w/drawal. Differences not so different from e/o,"" tweeted someone who went by the name Subel. Another tweeter, Musa Mahmodi, wrote: ""Watched the US presidential debate, nothing new on Afghanistan, they both do not seem understand this country."" Libya . The port city of eastern Benghazi wants four more years Obama, one blogger said, who stayed up until 4:30 a.m. local time to watch the Monday night debate. Although the candidates did not slug it out over the deadly September attack on the U.S. embassy in the city, Ruwida Ashour felt Romney disregarded the progress in her country. Ashour already stood behind Obama, and nothing his challenger said changed her mind. CNN Fact Check: Comparing costs of Iraq, Libya missions . She believes Obama has brought more stability to the Middle East. ""I'm just not sure what Romney will do."" ""He said Libya is just six million people, and we have to take care of Egypt,"" which is much larger, she complained. As concerns Egypt, she said Romney misjudged the election victories by the Islamic party, the Muslim Brotherhood, as being a bad thing. ""It was the people's choice,"" Ashour said. She also found Romney's plans to stop terror attacks ""unrealistic,"" saying that the issue was too complex to solve comprehensively. Israel and Iran . Both candidates pledged to stand by Israel in the event of an attack by Iran. Between the two of them, Obama and Romney mentioned Iran 47 times. In one of the debate's notable zings, Romney pointed out that Obama did not visit Israel as president and left it out on a trip through the region. CNN Fact Check: Is al Qaeda's core decimated or is group growing? This got noticed in Israel, said CNN's Sara Sidner. There is some tension between Obama and Israeli Pesident Benjamin Netanyahu over how to handle Iran. But the two nations over the weekend kicked off a large military exercise, reiterating America's unbending support for the Jewish state. Policy towards Israel in the past has not changed much from one president to the next, Sidner said. There has not been much public reaction to the debate, which occurred in the middle of the night Israeli time. The Iranian press has reported on the debate, but so far has not come out with criticism towards anything the candidates said. Read a transcript of the debate .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The pilot and co-pilot of a Ugandan helicopter that crashed into the side of Kenya's highest mountain were confirmed dead Wednesday but the hunt continues for five presumed survivors, Uganda's military said. Two Ugandan military helicopters crashed and a third crash-landed on Mount Kenya Sunday as they were on their way to join a peacekeeping mission in Somalia. The crew of the helicopter that crash-landed was found and rescued Monday after the pilot issued a distress call. The sites where the other two crashed were found Tuesday. Those killed were named Wednesday as Capt. William Letti and Lt. Patrick Nahamya, who were pilot and co-pilot of the downed helicopter. ""We extend our deepest condolences to the bereaved families of the departed comrades. Our hearts are with those family members whose dear ones we are still searching for,"" a statement from the Ugandan Ministry of Defense said. Lt. Gen. Edward Katumba Wamala, Uganda's commander of army land forces, said Tuesday that 21 people had been accounted for after the crashes. Kenyan military officer Brig. Francis Ogola said the team at one of the sites found ""no dead bodies,"" but rather ""items ... arranged in a matter that suggest that they have evacuated from that location and they are somewhere in the mountain."" This is cause for ""good hope"" that the soldiers and airmen will be found, Ogola said. Conditions on the mountainside may be tough, however. The survivors will have to contend with rugged terrain and altitude. Mount Kenya is the second-highest peak on the African continent, after Kilimanjaro, at just over 17,000 feet, according to UNESCO. According to the Mount Kenya park service and UNESCO, elephants, rhinos, giant forest hogs and leopards are among the creatures that live in the area. The mountain sides are riven by steep valleys and the vegetation is alpine higher up, changing to bamboo further down the slopes, UNESCO says. The helicopters were part of the first deployment of air support for the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) in Mogadishu, where Ugandan, Burundian and other African Union forces are fighting Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked group. AMISOM said Wednesday that its operations in Somalia would continue despite the loss of the helicopters. ""At this time our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the bereaved, as well as with the people and government and security forces of Uganda,"" said Boubacar Diarra, the African Union's special representative to Somalia. ""We are gravely concerned for the safety of those still unaccounted for and continue to pray that they will be recovered unharmed,"" he said. Odongo said Tuesday the Ugandan government and army would reassess their capacity to continue with the deployment of military air power to AMISOM following the crashes. It had taken Uganda more than three months to prepare for the deployment, he added, with all crew undergoing U.N. training.","The pilot and co-pilot of one of the crashed helicopters are confirmed dead .

"(CNN) -- Gen. David Petraeus, head of the U.S. Central Command, met with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on Saturday in Yemen, according to a senior U.S. government source. During the meeting with Petraeus, Saleh expressed his appreciation for the United States' help in combating extremists, the source said. Saleh also offered more support for U.S. counterterrorism strikes and said he would continue providing assistance for the U.S. investigation into the attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines flight on December 25. The official said that Petraeus carried several messages and ""various items"" of information from Obama to Saleh. No further details were available. The two men discussed the latest intelligence on al Qaeda in Yemen, the official said, adding that the number of attendees was very small on both sides. Obama aide John Brennan briefed the president on Petraeus' trip to Yemen, after Brennan spoke with the general, the senior U.S. government official and a senior administration official said. ""Gen. Petraeus was in Yemen today as part of our ongoing consultations with and efforts in support of Yemen,"" the senior administration official said. ""We have made Yemen a priority over the course of this year, and this is the latest in that effort."" President Obama on Saturday linked the man accused in the botched attack to an al Qaeda affiliate based in Yemen. The group, called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, apparently trained Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the 23-year-old Nigerian national accused of trying to blow up Northwest Flight 253 en route from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, Obama said Saturday. The group equipped AbdulMutallab with explosives and ""directed him to attack that plane headed for America,"" Obama said in his weekly radio address. ""This is not the first time this group has targeted us,"" Obama noted. ""They have bombed Yemeni government facilities and Western hotels, restaurants and embassies -- including our embassy in 2008. ""I've made it a priority to strengthen our partnership with the Yemeni government -- training and equipping their security forces, sharing intelligence and working with them to strike al Qaeda terrorists,"" he said. Yemen is tightening security at its southern and western coasts in an attempt to thwart ""possible infiltration of militants"" from a Somalia-based Young Mujahedeen Movement, the official SABA state news agency reported Saturday. The group, also known as Harakat Al Shabaab, announced on Friday its ""readiness to support their brothers in Yemen,"" SABA reported. ""The group said its militants will cross the sea and fight on the side of the terrorists in Yemen against the enemy of Allah,"" the news agency said. SABA reported that counterterrorism troops in Yemen have in recent weeks raided several al Qaeda hideouts and training sites, and have killed and arrested scores of terrorist suspects. It also said that weapons were seized in recent months ""with a number of African infiltrators who crossed the sea into Yemen."" ""Authorities also said that dozens of Africans, most of whom were Somalis, were arrested fighting the army in support of the Houthi insurgents in the far north,"" SABA reported. American and Yemeni officials are now looking at fresh targets in Yemen for a potential retaliation strike, two senior U.S. officials told CNN Tuesday. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called Friday for an international meeting later this month to discuss how to counter radicalization in Yemen. On Tuesday, Yemen's parliament ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism, the official SABA state news agency reported. The move aligned Yemen with the United States in expanding the fight against terrorism to sources of funding. Petraeus and John Brennan, Obama's counterterrorism adviser, also visited Saleh in Yemen last summer to discuss the threat of terrorism. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Gen.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Malala Yousufzai's courageous blogging against the Taliban set her apart from other 14-year-old Pakistani girls. Growing up in a region once dominated by the Islamic extremists, she knew the fear associated with the word Taliban. One of her fears came to pass Tuesday, when gunmen sought her out and opened fire on her school van, leaving her seriously wounded along with two other classmates. 14-year-old girl wins Pakistan's first peace prize . The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, Taliban spokesman Ihsnaullah Ishan told CNN. Ishan blamed the shooting on Malala's activist blogging. Doctors removed a bullet lodged in her neck during three hours of surgery on Wednesday morning. ""Inshallah (God willing), she will survive,"" said Dr. Mumtaz Ali, a neurosurgeon who worked Malala with three colleagues. The attack began when armed militants stopped a van as it was taking her and two other girls home from school. The attackers asked which girl was Malala, said Kainat Bibi, one of the wounded girls. When the girls pointed Malala out, the men opened fire, Bibi said, wounding the girls before the van's driver was able to speed away. The other two girls' injuries were not considered life-threatening. Malala's blog . Malala lives in northwest Pakistan's Swat Valley -- one of the nation's most conservative regions. Her frustration with the Taliban's restrictions on female education in her town prompted her to use the Internet and speak out, effectively making herself a target. She reached out to the outside world online, taking a stand by writing about her daily battle with extremist militants who used fear and intimidation to force girls to stay at home. ""I had a terrible dream yesterday with military helicopters and the Taliban,"" she wrote in January 2009. ""I have had such dreams since the launch of the military operation in Swat. My mother made me breakfast and I went off to school. I was afraid going to school because the Taliban had issued an edict banning all girls from attending schools."" Opinion: Girl's courage, Taliban's cowardice . Malala's shooting has sparked national outrage -- forcing Pakistanis to take a harsh look at how extremist elements are shaping the nation. ""Our society is going through a very critical phase,"" said Aazadi Fateh Muhammad, a professor of mass communications at Federal Urdu University Karachi, in an e-mail to CNN. ""Civil society and civilians are in a war with militants and terrorists in every part of the region."" The attack on Malala, Muhammad said, is an example of this war. ""Dark hands,"" she said, tried to attack Malala's cause, ""but it will discourage many others who are fighting for light."" The Taliban controlled Malala's valley for years until 2009, when the military cleared it in an operation that also evacuated thousands of families. Attack on teen blogger consumes Pakistan . Last year, Malala told CNN she feared ""being beheaded by the Taliban because of my passion for education. During their rule, the Taliban used to march into our houses to check whether we were studying or watching television."" She described how she used to hide her books under her bed, fearing a house search by the Taliban. Malala's online writing against the Taliban led to her being awarded Pakistan's first National Peace Prize last November. Former Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani directed Pakistan's Cabinet to award the prize each year to a child under 18 who contributes to peace and education. President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the attack, which prompted outrage among residents on local media sites. Also condemning the attack was Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf, who spoke with Malala's father on the phone Tuesday, according to a statement from the prime minister's office. Taliban's vaccination ban may affect 280,000 children . Journalists Nasir Habib and Noreen Shams contributed to this report.","NEW: Doctors remove a bullet lodged in her neck .

"(CNN) -- Four NATO troops were killed Sunday in an attack believed to involve Afghan police in southern Afghanistan, officials said, in what appears to be the latest incident of local forces turning their guns on coalition partners. The troops died ""following an insider attack involving suspected Afghan police,"" said Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman with NATO's International Security Assistance Force. No more details were provided. The attacks followed news that insurgents disguised in U.S. Army uniforms carried out a coordinated assault Friday at a joint American-British base in the same region. That assault raised concerns that the attackers had inside knowledge. ISAF: Insurgents wore U.S. Army uniforms . It is too early to conclude whether the attackers had ""inside knowledge,"" Graybeal said. The incident is under investigation. The international coalition released details that suggest it was a well-coordinated assault on the fortified base in a remote desert region in Helmand province. Two U.S. Marines and 14 insurgents died in a firefight. The lone surviving insurgent, who was wounded, was taken into custody, the international coalition said in a statement. The insurgents -- organized into three teams -- waged an assault on the airfield of the joint base that includes American-run Camp Leatherneck and British-run Camp Bastion, where British royal Prince Harry is stationed. Six AV-8B Harrier jets were destroyed and two others were damaged, international forces said. Six aircraft hangers suffered damage, while six refueling stations were destroyed, it said. The international coalition gave no indication how the insurgents obtained U.S. Army uniforms. NATO denies civilians killed in air strike . The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack, calling it a response to the 14-minute movie trailer ""Innocence of Muslims"" that sparked protests in more than 20 countries. The trailer, which depicts the Prophet Mohammed as a child molester and ruthless killer, has roiled the Muslim world, . In Afghanistan, the Taliban have called on insurgents to step up attacks against the United States and its NATO allies in retaliation. Two British troops were killed Saturday when an Afghan police officer opened fire on them at a checkpoint in Helmand province's Nahr-e Saraj district, the British Defence Ministry said. Meanwhile, the international coalition declined to release details about the nationality and location of the attack that killed four troops in southern Afghanistan . Those deaths, including the two killed Saturday, raised the number to more than 50 coalition troops killed in ""green-on-blue"" or ""insider"" attacks in Afghanistan this year. ""Green-on-blue"" refers to a color coding system used by the military, in which blue refers to the friendly force, in this case ISAF; and green refers to allied friendly forces, in this case Afghan National Security Forces.

"(CNN) -- When I was a little girl, my parents would take me every year to see ""The Nutcracker."" I remember practically drooling in awe as the massive Christmas tree grew out of the stage until it towered over the audience, and hiding under my seat whenever that hideous, sword-wielding, gazillion-headed rat wobbled out onto the stage. Last year, I went to see it again, just for old times' sake. The takeaway: The grown-ups in ""The Nutcracker's"" day knew how to throw a hell of a party. It was all so pretty and elegant. Gorgeously clad ladies and top-hatted gentlemen arrived and immediately descended upon the champagne; they danced and gave toasts, and sumptuous platters of fruit and glasses of mulled wine were toted about by equally well-clad servants. The kids made themselves scarce and played together with quaint wooden toys. Ah, the good old days. As far as I can tell, there's no reason why we can't have that sort of cultivated, old-timey holiday rituals and flourishes today as well. What follows is a short list of such pleasures, just in time for Christmas and New Year's festivities. After all, if you can't be nostalgic during the holidays, when can you? Let's bring back ... 1. Champagne glass towers . A round pyramid of stacked coupe champagne glasses, in which champagne is poured into the top glass and trickles down to the lower tiers. Popular in the 1920s, such towers are gleaming monuments to pretty decadence. Can you think of a more spectacular way to ring in the New Year? 2. Winter picnics . A sublime way to spend a snowy afternoon. Bundle up, fill your wicker picnic hamper with white wine (which you can chill just by sticking it in a snowbank), a thermos of soup, and sandwiches. Bring along a cheerful red wool plaid blanket to sit on -- and don't forget your dog, who will love rooting around in the snow while you nestle and dine. 3. Brown-paper-and-twine-wrapped packages . Fraulein Maria loved them in ""The Sound of Music,"" and so do I. They are a democratic approach to gift-wrapping -- and terribly mysterious as well. There could be anything inside, from a diamond necklace to a slab of fish. 4. Bonbons . The perfect stocking stuffer for the glamorously indolent women in your life. While many types of candy today are described as ""bonbons,"" the cream-in-the-middle chocolate version of this confection used to be the symbol of lazy chicness: A lady of leisure would supposedly lie in bed all day and eat bonbons. In the popular imagination, these ladies were, of course, invariably clad in marabou-fringed dressing gowns. 5. Homely Christmas trees . Lopsided ones with fat colored lights and homemade ornaments and popcorn strings.  Matchy-matchy Martha Stewart trees with white lights and red plaid ribbons look constipated. 6. Figgy pudding . If the lyrics of ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" are an accurate indicator, something about figgy pudding makes people quite bossy and demanding: . Oh, bring us some figgy pudding and a good cup of cheer -- We won't go until we get some, so bring some right here. Well, if it's that good, maybe we should bring it back. 7. Punch bowls . Punch bowls are the Lolitas of serving ware: Filled with pink party punch, they look dainty and sweet and innocent but portend all sorts of naughty behavior. They used to be the life of the party and deserve that honor once again. 8. New Year's Day parties . A lovely, optimistic alternative to the typical New Year's Eve parties -- which are so often well-intentioned but disappointing. Set up a lovely buffet and open your doors at noon. Those who are nursing hangovers can stroll in later in the afternoon. 9. Skating parties . Grab ten of your closest friends, a handful of brightly colored stocking caps, and head to a pretty frozen lake or outdoor skating rink. These once-popular diversions were often followed by a post-skating party supper as well. The 1966 edition of ""The New York Times Menu Cook Book"" recommends this endearing menu: . Hot Buttered Rum Old-Fashioned Vegetable Soup Crusty French Bread Mixed Green Salad Cranberry Cheese Cupcakes . 10. Bing Crosby . His voice used to be synonymous with Christmas, thanks to his rendition of ""White Christmas"" in the 1942 film ""Holiday Inn."" The nostalgic, comforting tenor of the song strongly resonated with war-weary Americans and overseas soldiers; Crosby's ""White Christmas"" single eventually sold more than 50 million copies, making it one of the best-selling singles in the world, according to ""The Guinness Book of World Records."" Happily, you can find Crosby's Christmas recordings with the wonderful Andrews Sisters on iTunes -- although I maintain that they still sound best on scratchy old records.","Writer believes there used to be more glamour to the holidays .

"(CNN) -- A year to the day after racially abusing an opponent, John Terry stepped out as Chelsea captain wearing an anti-racism armband -- only for the Blues to suffer their first Champions League defeat since winning the trophy in May. Terry wore the band as part of a week of action organized by the group 'Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare)', which has asked all club captains in European competition to help its campaign. The 31-year-old is currently serving a domestic ban after being found guilty of racial abuse against Anton Ferdinand by the English FA -- but his suspension does not apply to European football, where Chelsea were subjected to a torrid time by Shakhtar Donetsk. Read: Terry waives FA racism appeal . Unbeaten over the last 11 months, the Ukrainian champions won 2-1 after Alex Teixeira gave the hosts the perfect start with a goal after three minutes as the ball ricocheted off Terry into his path. Shakhtar would have added to their lead but for some fine goalkeeping from Petr Cech and had to wait until the 52nd minute before Fernandinho rewarded their dominance with a deserved second goal. Late on, Oscar became the third Brazilian to score in the European tie but his close-range strike was too little too late as Chelsea lost their first Champions League game since going down 3-1 in Italy against Napoli in February. ""Perhaps it was one of our best games in recent times,"" Shakhtar coach Mircea Lucescu told the official website of European body UEFA. ""And I have to say that this Chelsea side are stronger than the one that won the Champions League last season. That makes our victory even more important."" Chelsea stay second in Group E after two-time winners Juventus could only draw 1-1 at the Danish home of tournament new boys Nordsjaelland. Elsewhere, Barcelona and Manchester United both came from behind as they struggled to beat less fancied opposition despite boasting home advantage. Deprived of some key personnel in defense, Barca were stunned when Scottish visitors Celtic took the lead through Giorgios Samaras' deflected header -- only for Andres Iniesta to draw the four-time champions level just before the break with a fine goal. After outstanding Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster thought he had done enough to repel the home side's best efforts, Barcelona secured their 100th Champions League win when Jordi Alba found the net four minutes into stoppage time to secure a 2-1 win. In England, Manchester United were equally surprised as Brazil's Alan gave Portugal's Braga a two-goal lead within 20 minutes inside a shocked Old Trafford. Mexican striker Javier Hernandez made the most of a rare start as he reduced the deficit shortly moments later, before wrapping up the win 15 minutes from time after Jonny Evans had scrambled home an equaliser shortly after the hour. ""It's been the story of our season at home -- start badly, lose goals and have to fight back to rescue games,"" said United coach Alex Ferguson after the 3-2 victory. ""Some of our football was fantastic but conceding so many goals is a concern."" Elsewhere, Spartak Moscow won their first match and points in Group G, beating Portuguese side Benfica 2-1 in Russia to trail Barca by six points and Celtic by just one. Spaniards Valencia were the biggest winners of the night, winning 3-0 in Belarus to bring home side Bate Borisov -- who stunned Bayern Munich 3-1 in their last European game -- back down to earth. Meanwhile, the Germans, who were beaten runners-up on home soil against Chelsea in the final in May, rebounded in solid if unconvincing fashion when winning 1-0 at French side Lille. Galatasaray could not profit from playing against a CFR Cluj side reduced to ten men for over an hour as the Turks conceded an own goal and missed a penalty before equalizing late on to draw 1-1.","Shakhtar Donetsk inflict first Champions League defeat on Chelsea since the English side's triumph in May .

"(CNN) -- As Hurricane Rafael sped away from Bermuda, taking with it heavy rain and wind, the government discontinued storm watches for the island. There appeared to be minimal disruption to life on Bermuda as the fast-moving storm roared by to the east, keeping the strongest winds well away from land. About 600 homes lost power, the Bermuda Electric Light Company said on its Facebook page. Glenn Jones, a business development and marketing manager for a Bermudian media company, said earlier that the wind was stronger than some locals expected. According to the Bermuda Weather Service, wind speeds reached 51 mph at the airport Tuesday night. The outer bands of the Category 1 hurricane had swirled over the 21-square-mile island as the storm raced north-northeast during the afternoon, bringing tropical storm-force winds and downpours. Late Tuesday, Rafael was about 135 miles (215 kilometers) east of the island, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. Meteorologists said the storm, with 85 mph sustained wind, was moving at 29 mph. Rafael becomes hurricane as it churns towards Bermuda . Forecasters said Rafael will break up late Wednesday or early Thursday after a turn to the northeast.

"(CNN) -- Fire engulfed five luxury homes Monday morning at a subdivision north of Seattle in what could be a case of ecoterrorism, officials said. Firefighters attack blazes at luxury homes Monday in suburban Seattle, Washington. A sign with the letters ""ELF"" was found at the scene of the fires in the ""Street of Dreams"" development in Woodinville, Washington, said Chief Rick Eastman of Snohomish County Fire District No. 7. Eastman did not say if the sign is believed to be from the Earth Liberation Front, which the FBI has called an ecoterrorist group. ""Built green? Nope black!"" the sign reads, according to an image from CNN affiliate KING-TV in Seattle. The sign calls the homes ""McMansions.""  Watch why ELF is so elusive Â» . John Heller, president of Seattle Street of Dreams model luxury home development, said he had spoken to the fire chief and was told that the fires were suspicious.  Watch fires burn luxury homes Â» . ""My understanding is that it was an act of terror,"" Heller said. The FBI said the fires are being investigated as an act of domestic terrorism. Heller said he was out of town on business and was rushing back to see what was left of the development. He said it was a new subdivision that featured luxury homes priced at $2 million. Video footage showed large grayish white plumes of smoke billowing in the air and firefighters trying to contain blazes in large homes in a heavily wooded area. Eastman said there had been no injuries and there were no suspects. He told KING-TV that police and agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were investigating.

Fire officials investigating the scene determined that kerosene was used as the accelerant in the arson, the FBI said. Last year, 10 people, including self-proclaimed members of the ELF and members of another organization called the Animal Liberation Front, were convicted for a string of arson fires that totaled more than $40 million in damage, according to an August statement by the U.S. Justice Department.

"Washington (CNN) -- Senators approved a giant farm bill Thursday that is estimated to cut the deficit by almost $24 billion, largely by ending direct payments to farmers and replacing them with taxpayer- subsidized crop insurance to assist farmers in need. Passage of the bill, by a vote of 64-35, was a rare agreement in a chamber that has been fractured by partisan gridlock over much of this session. Most of the bill's savings are achieved through changes to crop assistance programs that have been in place in one form or another since the Great Depression. ""We eliminated four different agriculture subsidies and instead have moved to risk management so we'll support farmers and ranchers when there's a loss, where there's a weather loss, it's a price loss, through crop insurance, through other things where the farmer has some skin in the game,"" said Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwomen Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan. Not everyone agreed this was the best way to reform these agriculture programs. ""Unfortunately, it seems that Congress' idea of farm bill reform is to eliminate one subsidy program only to invent a new one to take its place,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. The bill also saves $4.5 billion by making changes to the food stamp program. Known officially as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, these benefits, which were used by almost 50 million people last year, make up the bulk of the overall cost of the bill. ""The Senate is getting back to operating the way it traditionally does,"" said a satisfied Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, as the chamber was wrapping up votes on scores of amendments to the bill. Republicans have blocked many bills this session partly because they've been denied by the Democratic majority the ability to vote on amendments. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, seemed to agree. ""The spirit on the Senate floor was good,"" he said, because ""everyone can feel we're accomplishing something."" The bill still needs to be considered by the House, and it's unclear when that will happen.","The measure, estimated to cut the deficit by almost $24 billion, passes in 64-35 vote .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A California judge denied Thursday a request from an actress who, claiming she was a victim of fraud who'd been caused irreversible harm, wanted an inflammatory anti-Islam video in which she had appeared to be removed from YouTube's website. Cindy Lee Garcia, who was among those in ""Innocence of Muslims,"" had sued the producer of the film, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula -- who authorities say has numerous aliases -- alleging she is a victim of fraud, invasion of privacy and misappropriation of her likeness. In her complaint, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, Garcia also sued YouTube, the video-sharing website on which the film's trailer is posted, and its parent company, Google. She alleged the company caused her irreparable harm by not removing the video from its site and asked a judge to order the trailer be taken down immediately. YouTube attorney Timothy Alger, meanwhile, argued that federal law protects forums such as YouTube from abiding by such orders, from third parties, to remove videos. Actress in anti-Islamic film files lawsuit against filmmaker and YouTube . On Thursday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Luis Lavin ruled the company can leave the video up online, denying Garcia's request for a temporary restraining order. Last week, the actress told CNN she had been unaware the filmmaker dubbed over dialogue in the movie and had inserted anti-Islam sentiments. The producer's representations that he ""intended to make an 'adventure film' and that (the) plaintiff would be depicted as a concerned mother, were false,"" Garcia alleges in her lawsuit. The defendant ""made an anti-Islam propaganda film, in which plaintiff is falsely made to appear to accuse the founder of the Islamic religion of being a sexual deviant and child molester,"" says the complaint. The lawsuit claims Garcia lost her job and her privacy since the film, on September 11, went from being an obscure Internet video to a target of Muslim protests worldwide. The film mocks the Islamic Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer. From Morocco to Malaysia, demonstrators in more than 20 countries have railed against the ""Innocence of Muslims"" and the United States, since the film was (privately) produced and disseminated in the country. Some of these groups have targeted U.S. diplomatic missions, including those who breached the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, Egypt, and those who killed four Americans during an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Garcia said that, since the video got widespread attention, she has received death threats and has not visited her grandchildren out of fear that they will be harmed.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles detectives have vastly expanded their investigation into the ""Grim Sleeper"" serial killer case and are now looking at whether any of 230 murders are connected to the alleged slayer, police said Wednesday. In April, police were investigating the Grim Sleeper's connection to 55 unidentified women -- a quarter of what they're now probing -- whose photographs were found among 180 videos and photos taken from the Los Angeles home of Lonnie David Franklin Jr. Now, authorities have widened their inquiry to include all homicides that occurred in a general area of south Los Angeles where Franklin lived from the 1970s, when he got out of the military, through the 1980s, police spokeswoman Karen Rayner said Wednesday. That amounts to about 230 murders, and even though some had been believed to have been solved, police ""are taking a second look at all of them,"" Rayner said. Franklin, 58, is charged with the murders of 10 women as well as one attempted murder. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. He is accused of killing females ranging from ages 14 to 36 between August 1985 and January 2007. Many of the victims were prostitutes, authorities said. Most of the victims were discovered dumped in south Los Angeles alleys and covered with debris, authorities said. All victims were shot; some were strangled too, an indictment alleges. Prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty against Franklin. Prior to his arrest in July 2010, Franklin had worked for a time as a garage attendant at a Los Angeles police station, authorities said. A pretrial hearing for Franklin is scheduled for November 7, according to the prosecutor's office.","Lonnie David Franklin Jr. is accused of being the ""Grim Sleeper""

"(CNN) -- Two catchphrases have dominated stories about women in the election cycle this year: ""the war on women"" and ""having it all."" It is time to change the conversation. Women are the voters most likely to matter on November 6 -- they make up the majority of undecided voters and they outvote men. But to win women's votes, Mitt Romney and President Obama must talk about what really matters to them. I know something about that from my students. The young women in my classes look to the future and want to know how to create workable lives for their families. They know about the pay gap. They know their earnings will matter to their families. They know their mothers are often starved for time. ""How are we supposed to do it?"" they ask, over and over. We have not been giving them good answers. Undoubtedly, the issues raised in claims about a ""war on women"" and the difficulty of ""having it all"" are important. But those arguments don't fully address my students' questions. In order for the candidates to speak directly to women, they need to talk about jobs, but not just any jobs.ÃÂ  What matters are good jobs that make family lives sustainable. Pay equity is the tip of the iceberg. Consider this from the Center for American Progress: Including all workers, the median full-time female worker earned $10,784 less in 2010 than the median full-time male worker. Over a 40-year career, that wage gap adds up to more than $400,000. This pay discrepancy affects the economic well-being of American households. Women comprise two-thirds of American family breadwinners and co-breadwinners. Inequality in pay means families have less money for quality child care, less education, fewer doctor visits and more scrambling to make ends meet, year in and year out. It's not just households and family life that suffer. So does the economy. Studies confirm that stretched workers mean lower productivity. But pay alone won't make the difference. All workers have family responsibilities. When women ask about fair pay, they are also asking about how to get jobs that make it possible to take a sick child to the doctor. They are asking about how to make sure fathers can get away from work early enough to make dinner, too. Flexibility is a universal concern for American workers, not simply a women's issue. As President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers reported in 2009, workplace flexibility increases productivity and reduces turnover and absenteeism. It's good for the economy, and good for families. A Reuters poll this month showed that women make up 54% of the undecided voters and their No.1 concern is family well-being. Contraception and reproductive rights, of course, matter a great deal to female voters. But if that's the only issue the candidates talk about, they ignore the worries that women wake up to every morning as they hustle children through bowls of cereal and pile out the door to work. Here is what the candidates can do: . First, fight for the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would expand 1963's Equal Pay Act and make it easier for women to compare their pay with that of fellow workers. Paycheck Fairness was blocked this year in Congress; it needs to be reintroduced. In our service economy, women still dominate in the lowest-paid jobs.  Because women's pay has become more and more essential to their families, those historic inequities matter more and more. Second, fight for workplace flexibility. Family responsibilities burden all workers, men as well as women, regardless of pay. This is a social and economic reality that the nation must face. America needs leaders who will drag our workplaces out of the 1950s and into the 21st century. Finally, support paid sick days nationwide. Forty percent of the people in the work force do not have paid sick days, which puts them in danger of losing their jobs when they are sick; millions more cannot take sick days to care for their children. Support for the Healthy Families Act before Congress is critical. This legislation would grant workers up to seven job-protected paid sick days each year, to use not just when they are ill, but for helping sick family members and preventive care. There is still time, but not much, for me to tell my students that the candidates have some answers to their questions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kirsten Swinth.","Kirsten Swinth: Time to go beyond catchphrases ""war on women"" and ""having it all""
Women's votes are crucial for both candidates, she says, but they need to talk about jobs .
Swinth: Women bring home all or a share of household income and family is top concern .

"(CNN) -- The man suspected of killing one person at the World Changers Church International in suburban Atlanta was arrested Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Marshals said. Earlier, police named the suspect as Floyd Palmer, 52, and described him as armed and dangerous. Authorities said marshals and Fulton County police arrested the suspect at Lenox Mall in the Buckhead community of Atlanta, about 25 miles from the church. There were about 25 people in the massive church when the shooting happened, police spokeswoman Cpl. Kay Lester said. The golden-domed megachurch, which claims about 30,000 members, is led by well-known prosperity minister Creflo Dollar. The victim, whose name was not immediately released, died at a hospital. He was leading a prayer when he was shot, police said. Palmer is a former volunteer at the church who resigned in August, Lester said. She said police don't know whether the victim was targeted specifically. Dollar has built an international religious empire, with broadcasts of his sermons beamed worldwide and speaking engagements in Europe. Since he started his ministry in an elementary school cafeteria in 1986, Dollar has earned praise and criticism. Supporters say he has preached a message that's financially empowered his parishioners and challenged the idea that Christians should be ashamed to be rich. Critics call him ""Cash-Flow Dollar"" and say his message perverts the Gospel. The shooting as it happened .

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony's car reeked of what they deemed the unmistakable odor of a decomposing body, her father and a tow company manager testified Friday in the Orlando woman's capital murder trial. The odor was so powerful, George Anthony said he could not drive it home from the impound lot where it had been towed two weeks before without rolling down the windows, he said. ""I did worry for my daughter and granddaughter,"" George Anthony testified, noting that he had not seen Casey or her 2-year-old daughter Caylee since June 24. ""I didn't want to believe what I was smelling."" The defense pointed out -- and George Anthony admitted -- that he did not call police after noticing the smell, nor did he tell authorities about his concerns. Later that day, his wife Cindy did call 911, sparking the investigation that led to the discovery months later of Caylee's remains and the arrest of her mother for the toddler's murder. ""Looking back, sir, there's a lot of things I wish I would have done,"" George Anthony said, after being pressed by defense attorney Jose Baez as to why he didn't contact police immediately. Anthony's white Pontiac Sunfire took center stage in the fourth day of Anthony's capital murder trial. Anthony, 25, is charged with seven counts, including first degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading police in the death of her daughter, whose remains were discovered in December 2008. Prosecutors say Anthony used chloroform on her daughter and then put duct tape over her nose and mouth, suffocating the girl. Anthony's attorneys argue that she did not kill Caylee, but rather that the girl accidentally drowned in the Anthonys' pool on June 16. They say she and her father, George Anthony, panicked and kept the death a secret. George Anthony denied that claim in testimony Thursday. Anthony's car was found, apparently abandoned, in a financial-services company parking lot on June 24. It was towed by a wrecker service to an impound lot on June 30 and remained there for about two weeks, the wrecker service's operations manager, Simon Birch, told jurors. Closed up, the car gave off the faint smell of human decomposition, Birch testified. ""It's a very, very unique and distinctive smell,"" Birch said, noting that he has had the misfortune of coming into contact with decomposition in cars numerous times. Birch said the smell became more noticeable after George Anthony and his wife arrived to pick up the car and they opened first the door and then the trunk. George Anthony recalled his mind racing with concern for his daughter, whom he had believed was in Jacksonville, Florida, with the car, and his granddaughter, whom he had not seen in nearly a month. ""Please God,"" he recalled thinking as he prepared to open the trunk, ""don't let this be Casey or Caylee."" The smell did not seem to dissipate after they removed a lightly-filed garbage bag from the trunk, Birch said. But after being called back to the stand later Friday, George Anthony said he did not notice the stench was stronger after he opened the trunk and removed garbage from the trunk. In response to a question from Baez implying he was somehow trying to distance himself from evidence in a potential crime, George Anthony said, ""I would not have walked away ... from something. That's not in my make-up. ... I believe I'm a pretty good guy."" Before challenging George Anthony, Baez questioned why Birch never called police, even after learning the car had been towed by authorities for forensic analysis. ""I had no idea why it was towed to forensics,"" Birch said. William Waters, a friend of Anthony's who testified that he went shopping with her on July 5, testified that she had a friend's car at the time. He said she explained that she did not have her own because it needed an alignment or a tune-up. The car also figured in testimony Thursday, when George Anthony testified about an argument he had with his daughter over two missing gas cans from the storage shed at his house. On June 24, George Anthony called police to report the break-in and report the gas cans missing. He testified that he saw his daughter later in the day and argued with her about the missing cans. He had a hunch she had them, he testified, as she had taken them before. George Anthony said that when he went to get them out of his daughter's car, she bristled, brushed past him, quickly opened the trunk and retrieved the gas cans. Then she threw them down and told him, ""Here's your f---ing gas cans."" The cans are significant because duct tape on them appears to be the same as that found on the mouth of Caylee's skeletal remains, which were found six months after the child went missing. The type of tape, prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick told jurors in her opening statement this week, is relatively rare. George Anthony said that when his daughter returned the gas cans to him, there was no tape on them. He said he had put the tape on to replace a missing vent cap. In earlier testimony, prosecutors displayed evidence and questioned witnesses suggesting that Casey Anthony seemed unburdened in the days after her daughter disappeared -- attending a party and going shopping for furniture, clothes and beer. Jurors saw silent surveillance videos of Anthony shopping at Target, Ikea and other stores in the days following her daughter's disappearance. The videos were shown over the objection of defense attorneys, who said they were irrelevant to the charges against Anthony and could improperly impeach her character and state of mind in the eyes of the jury. They also heard Waters testify that Anthony attended an Independence Day party at his house on July 4, 2008 -- about two weeks after Caylee was last seen -- and that the two also went shopping the next day. She gave no indication that anything was wrong either time and only briefly mentioned her daughter, Waters testified. Waters' testimony was similar to statements Thursday from numerous witnesses who said Anthony did not mention her daughter's disappearance until her mother, Cindy Anthony, reported the girl's absence to police on July 15. Among the witnesses was a former boyfriend, Ricardo Morales, who said Anthony was ""happy, smiling"" during his encounters with her in July. Another friend, Matthew Crisp, testified that he met Anthony for lunch on July 7 and asked about Caylee. Anthony told him the girl was ""on a play date with one of her girlfriends who also had a child."" Another former boyfriend, Anthony Lazzaro, and his roommates said that when they asked where Caylee was, Anthony told them she was with her nanny, mentioning that the nanny was taking her to Universal Studios and to the beach. In the early days of the investigation, Anthony said the nanny, who she said was named Zenaida Gonzalez and nicknamed ""Zanny,"" had kidnapped Caylee. Authorities were never able to find the nanny but did track down a woman with that name who denied knowing Anthony and sued her for defamation. Anthony also repeatedly visited at least two nightclubs during the month Caylee was missing, once participating in a ""hot body"" contest. Defense attorneys explain Anthony's behavior as a result of what they allege was sexual abuse by her father beginning as a child. Anthony was schooled from a young age to ""hide her pain,"" her attorneys argue. In testimony, George Anthony has denied sexually abusing his daughter. In cross-examination by lead defense attorney Jose Baez, those who saw Anthony and her daughter together testified that Caylee was well taken care of and that Anthony, at least to their knowledge, appeared to be a good mother. In a dramatic moment Friday morning, the fiancee of Casey Anthony's brother broke down when asked to describe Anthony's relationship with her daughter. The fiance, Mallory Parker, described the relationship as ""amazing."" ""Casey and Caylee had a very special bond,"" Parker, a witness for the prosecution, said with a quivering voice while under cross-examination by Anthony's lead attorney, Jose Baez. Anthony appeared to cry as Parker spoke. In all, Anthony is charged with first degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and four counts of misleading police. If she is convicted of capital murder, she could be sentenced to death by the seven-woman, five-man jury. The trial, now in its fourth day, is expected to last six to eight weeks.

"(CNN) -- Major League Baseball said Sunday that an Atlanta Braves pitching coach accused of misconduct has been suspended for two weeks without pay and fined an undisclosed amount for his inappropriate behavior. Roger McDowell is accused of making vulgar, homophobic and threatening comments at a Giants and Braves baseball game on April 23 at the AT&T Park in San Francisco. The suspension is retroactive to Friday, when McDowell was placed on administrative leave. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement that he hoped the incident would raise awareness of the importance of sensitivity to others. ""Major League Baseball is a social institution that brings people together and welcomes all individuals of different races, religions, genders, national origins and sexual orientations into its ballparks. Conduct by people associated with MLB that shows insensitivity to others simply cannot and will not be tolerated,"" he said. The commissioner also commended Justin Quinn, a fan who attended the game with his wife and 9-year-old twin daughters and who brought McDowell's behavior to the attention of the public. Quinn and his attorney, Gloria Allred, accused McDowell of making lewd and homophobic gestures and comments to male fans in the stadium bleachers. They also said he threatened Quinn when he complained to McDowell that kids could hear. ""When I go to a baseball game and take my family I expect a higher standard of conduct from the team and its coaches,"" Quinn told reporters last week. ""Children should not be told that they do not belong at a ballpark.""

"(CNN) -- The ideal of childhood, and the protection of its innocence, is a central pillar of both our morality and our legal code. There is, therefore, little that shocks and outrages us more than crimes by adults against children. Unfortunately, we have much to be shocked and outraged about. There have, for example, been a number of recent pedophile criminal cases inside the Catholic church and at universities like Pennsylvania University. And in the Congo, the crimes against children by the warlord Joseph Kony triggered KONY 2012 -- an online crusade made up of mostly children against Kony's abuse of children. What is KONY 2012? The last couple of weeks have brought us two more disturbingly high-profile criminal cases against children. First there was the failed attempt by the medieval Pakistani Taliban to kill the 14-year-old education activist and BBC blogger Malala Yousufzai. And now there are the lurid accusations against the BBC celebrity Jimmy Savile, who is alleged to have sexually abused children. These grotesque crimes may have been separated by several decades and by thousands of miles, but they have one thing in common. Both the Pakistani Taliban and Jimmy Savile sought to destroy the innocence of youth. Savile is accused of treating children as if they had adult bodies and sexual appetites, while the Taliban attempt to murder Malala Yousufzai was driven by their rejection of the idea of education for girls and thus, in a sense, of the very idea of childhood itself. But Malala, who is now recovering from the assassination attempt at an English hospital, shares our modern conception of childhood. ""I have the right of education,"" she told CNN. ""I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk. I have the right to go to market. I have the right to speak up."" What Malala is claiming is the right to an autonomous childhood, the right to transform herself from an innocent child to a knowing adult -- and to be let alone by the adult world in this journey. This right is mirrored by the experience of Jimmy Savile's alleged victims, whose innocent childhoods were ruined by their exposure to his criminal adult appetites. A Taliban spokesman said of the attack on Malala: ""She has become a symbol of Western culture in the area. She was openly propagating it. Let this be a lesson."" The Taliban, with their rejection of the very idea of childhood, are of course wrong. But the Malala case does indeed offer us a ""lesson."" Yes, we should all be horrified by this appalling crime against a 14-year-old Pakistani girl from the Swat Valley, but I fear that, in our idealization of childhood and in our acute sensitivity to the innocence of brave young girls like Malala, we are ourselves vulnerable to transforming children into celebrity martyrs -- modern day versions of Joan of Arc. This happened with KONY 2012, a movement akin, as I wrote earlier this year, to a children's crusade. And Malala, who was nominated for the 2011 International Children's Peace Prize, is herself in danger of becoming a symbol of injustice exploited by everyone from UNICEF to Madonna and CNN itself. So how did this happen? Unfortunately, Malala was allowed, by her family, by many Pakistanis and by the media to become a spokesman against the Taliban. The well-meaning BBC is partially to blame here, for giving her a highly visible blog that would inevitably attract Taliban ire. Malala's equally well-meaning father holds some responsibility too, for allowing his daughter to become so vulnerable -- as does the world's media for transforming the teenager into a global celebrity. Our ideal of childhood is rooted in allowing children to being let alone by the adult world to develop themselves. We need adults to fight their political battles -- to have prosecuted Jimmy Savile, to hunt down Joseph Kony, to fight the Pakistan Taliban. Let's remember that children are, in every sense, innocent and thus shouldn't be encouraged to become the foot soldiers in the battle against their own exploitation. The story of Malala Yousufzai should be seen as both an inspiration and a warning. CNN is currently encouraging its readers to send messages to Malala. My message to her is twofold. Firstly, I dearly hope that you recover quickly from your wounds. And secondly, once you recover, I hope you'll be able to go back to the privacy of your childhood, to simply being Malala rather than a global celebrity whose image is owned by other people. (The BBC addressed its connection with Malala Yousufzai on its blog called The Editors, and you can read it by following the link here). The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Keen.","The ideal of childhood is a central pillar of both our morality and our legal code, Keen says .

"(CNN) -- Six months into his presidency, Mohamed Morsy has at times taken investors on a rollercoaster ride of uncertainty. Events of the past week are an accurate reflection of the ups and downs that investors have been experiencing. Morsy was front and center of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas while holding court in Cairo with the Prime Minister of Turkey, the Secretary General of the United Nations and the U.S. Secretary of State. Read more: Egypt president's tricky game of power . Hillary Clinton heaped praise on Morsy, suggesting he has stepped up to the plate to rebuild Egypt's pivotal role in the region. During the same week, after months of on again-off again negotiations, the International Monetary Fund signed a preliminary agreement to lend $4.8 billion to the cash-strapped country. But Morsy capped the week by making a power play to wrestle control of the constitutional drafting process by issuing a decree giving him unchecked powers. More from John Defterios: Why Iran is caught in currency crisis . Mohammed Al Ississ, professor of economics at the American University in Cairo, says the president ""tried to seize the moment and move ahead in capturing more power. What Egypt needs to focus on now is institution building rather than a power grab."" Investors feel the same way, getting their first chance to respond Sunday with the largest sell-off since January 2011, when the protests to oust Hosni Mubarak began. More than $5 billion of market capitalization was wiped out during the session. Read more: Egypt's new president: U.S.-educated Islamist . Al Ississ described the effort to leverage the goodwill built up by the ceasefire and meeting conditions for the IMF loan as a ""giant miscalculation"" by the Islamist leader. This move comes only ten days after the European Union stepped up to assist Egypt with a pledge to offer $6.4 billion in loans and grants to the Middle East's most populous country. Morsy has met a full range of challenges since taking office and has responded with decisiveness. Case in point: The outbreak of violence in the Sinai was met with a sweeping out of the top military brass in Egypt including field marshal Mohamed Tantawi. But his biggest challenge, strategists suggest, is trying to appease members of his own Freedom and Justice Party and the ultra conservative Salafis wing. At the same time, those who pushed for the removal of former President Mubarak believe their revolution has been hijacked. Morsy's gesture to meet with the Supreme Judicial Council calmed the markets, but he has to manage the ""man on the street"" as large scale protests unfold Tuesday. As this clash of opposing views takes place, the tough work of building a solid economic foundation gets delayed. ""Big reforms that need to be enacted have been at a standstill for the last few years,"" says Hisham El-Khazindar, co-founder and managing director of Citadel Capital. At the top of his list is cutting down the cost of fuel and food subsidies which took the budget deficit to over 10% of GDP in the last fiscal year. ""You have a budget deficit that is ballooning, a current account deficit deteriorating and you have investments both local and international at a standstill, you know taking a wait and see approach,"" says El-Khazindar. Citadel raised $3.7 billion to fund a refinery operation after the uprising. The private equity group says another $4 billion is sitting on the sidelines waiting to see how Morsy will play his cards this week and beyond. During the uprising, growth plummeted from over 5% down in 2010 to 1.8% last year and only climbed slightly to 2.6% in the latest quarter ending in September. This means making solid calculations for 2013 will prove to be difficult for everything from Suez Canal receipts to tourism visitors. ""We are back to ground zero when it comes to the uncertainty,"" said Al Ississ of American University in Cairo.","As Mohamed Morsy capped the week by issuing a decree giving him unchecked powers .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tabloid headlines that ""falsely trumpeted"" in bold letters that Tom Cruise ""abandoned"" his young daughter should cost the publisher $50 million, the actor's lawyer said Wednesday. The magazine covers appeared on Life & Style and InTouch in the weeks after Cruise divorced actress Katie Holmes, with whom he shares 6-year-old daughter Suri, according to a defamation lawsuit Cruise filed against the publisher in Los Angeles on Wednesday. ""Tom is a caring father who dearly loves Suri,"" Cruise lawyer Bert Fields said. ""She's a vital part of his life and always will be. To say he has 'abandoned' her is a vicious lie. To say it in lurid headlines with a tearful picture of Suri is reprehensible."" Fields said he sent two letters informing the publisher that the headlines were false and demanding retractions, but he was refused in each case. ""These serial defamers are foreign-owned companies with their global headquarters in Hamburg,"" Fields said. ""They take money from unsuspecting Americans by selling their malicious garbage. Having to pay a libel judgment may slow them down."" Bauer Publishing Group, which publishes both magazines, responded to CNN's request for a reponse with ""no comment."" The July 30 Life & Style cover read ""SURI IN TEARS, ABANDONED BY HER DAD,"" under a photograph of Suri appearing to have tears in her eyes while in her mother's arms, the suit said. The story inside explained she was crying ""as a result of Suri being upset over not being able to take a puppy home from a pet store,"" the suit said. The complaint also includes a September In Touch cover that read ""44 DAYS WITHOUT TOM ... ABANDONED BY DADDY ... Suri is left heartbroken as Tom suddenly shuts her out and even misses her first day of school... HAS HE CHOSEN SCIENTOLOGY OVER SURI FOR GOOD?"" Since the magazines are displayed at supermarket checkout lines, ""millions of people each day must see their covers which feature screaming headlines in huge, brightly colored letters that are typically of a false, lurid and titillating nature, and that are often entirely unsupported by the stories buried in the magazines' interiors,"" the suit said. ""Tom doesn't go around suing people,"" Fields said. ""He's not a litigious guy. But when these sleaze peddlers try to make money with disgusting lies about his relationship with his child, you bet he's going to sue.""

"Washington (CNN) -- With the conventions fading into the rearview mirror and the first presidential debate fast approaching, new polls in crucial swing states suggest that GOP nominee Mitt Romney's road to the White House is becoming a more challenging ride. Polls are a snapshot of how people feel right now. The election is still 6ÃÂ½ weeks away, with three presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate between now and then that have the potential to change people's minds. But the numbers in many of these new surveys seem to favor President Barack Obama over Romney. ""Throughout the spring and summer, Romney advisers would look at the mostly dead-even polls and tell me, 'I'd a lot rather be in our position than theirs,'"" said CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. ""They don't say that now, not because it's over -- clearly whatever edge the president has can be erased. They don't say that anymore because as fall opens, advantage Obama."" CNN's Polling Center . Romney was asked about the new surveys in an interview Friday that will appear on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday. ""Actually, we're tied in the polls. We're all within a margin of error. We bounce around week to week, day to day. There are some days we're up. There are some days we're down,"" Romney said. ""We've got a campaign which is tied with an incumbent president of the United States."" To win the White House, Romney needs to win all the states that Sen. John McCain carried in 2008, plus grab back about half a dozen that Obama turned from red to blue four years ago. Romney campaigned Thursday in Florida, where two nonpartisan live operator polls conducted over the past two weeks both indicate Obama has a five-point advantage, which is within the surveys' sampling errors. Both the NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist and Fox News polls have the race at 49%-44%. Other, partisan surveys released since the end of the Democratic convention suggest a closer contest. Florida's 29 electoral votes are the biggest catch of the nine or so battleground states that both campaigns are heavily contesting. In Ohio, an NBC/WSJ/Marist poll and a Fox News survey each have the president holding a seven-point lead, while an American Research Group survey shows Obama with a two-point edge, well within that poll's sampling error. And in Virginia, a Washington Post poll indicates Obama leading by eight points, while a Fox News survey shows the president up by seven. According to a Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll, Obama holds a four-point advantage, which is within that survey's sampling error. President George W. Bush won all three of those states in his 2004 re-election, but Obama painted them blue four years ago. In Wisconsin, home of Romney's running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, a Marquette Law School poll indicates the Democratic ticket with a 14-point lead over the Republican duo. But a Quinnipiac/CBS/NYT poll indicates a smaller six-point advantage for the president, and Obama is up by five points in an NBC/WSJ/Marist poll. Obama stumps in surprise battleground state . In Michigan, the state where Romney was born and where his father served as a popular two-term governor in the 1960s, a CNN/ORC International poll released on Wednesday indicated Obama up by eight points. An EPIC/MRA survey released the week before suggested the president was up by 10. Both Wisconsin and Michigan are states Democrats have long carried in presidential elections that the Romney campaign hopes to capture. New polls in two other battleground states, Colorado and Nevada (won by Bush in 2004 but by Obama in 2008), indicate much closer contests. ""For a campaign running one to two points behind, close polls are interesting in the spring and summer. They are worrisome in the fall,"" said Crowley, anchor of CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""The good news for the Romney campaign is every and any place the president is polling below 50% -- not a comfortable position for an incumbent."" Former President Bill Clinton, who has campaigned for Obama and gave a blockbuster speech at the Democrats' convention, says the race is far from over. ""I still think you have to assume it's going to be a close race, assume it's a hard fight and then fight through it,"" Clinton said in an interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN. ""But I think the president has the advantage now. We did have a very good convention. He got a good boost out of it."" Clinton: '47 percent' comments put 'heavier burden' on Romney in debates . Romney's campaign has struggled since the conventions. The release of secretly recorded video from a May fundraiser, in which Romney casts Obama supporters as dependent on government, dominated coverage of the race over the past week. And the week before, there was criticism in the media and even by some Republicans of Romney's response to the attacks against U.S. embassies in Egypt and Libya. But Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos says Romney has already proved this cycle that he can make a comeback. ""Despite the toughest two weeks of this campaign for Mitt Romney, these state polls tell us two things: One, this is still a jump ball; two, Obama has gotten slightly taller."" ""Romney has proven resilient throughout this campaign,"" said Castellanos, a senior media adviser to Romney's 2008 campaign. ""Now he's being tested again. He has to show voters he has presidential strength, the capacity to get back on his feet after being knocked down."" And Romney has 6ÃÂ½ weeks to do that.

"Mount Kisco, New York (CNN) -- No one disputes Douglas Kennedy carried his newborn Bo through the maternity ward of a suburban New York hospital and tried to take the baby outside. Nor is there any question an altercation ensued, involving nurses attempting to keep the baby on the floor. But beyond that, there are only open questions -- especially about why it all happened and who is to blame. Answers finally started to trickle in on Monday, as the trial of the late Robert F. Kennedy's youngest son began with opening statements and four witnesses taking the stand. Judge John Donahue -- not a jury -- is hearing the case involving misdemeanor charges of harassment and child endangerment. Kicking off the trial, the two sides outlined significantly divergent scenarios of what happened last January at Northern Westchester Hospital. According to Assistant District Attorney Amy Puerto, the nurses were simply following protocol set up in newborns' interests when they tried to keep baby Bo from leaving the hospital. The infant's father not only didn't back down, but he fought back -- even twisting one nurse's arm and kicking another -- the prosecutor said. One of the nurses, Anna Lane, testified Monday that she'd initially reached in to hold open an elevator door to prevent Kennedy from leaving that way. When he headed toward a stairway door, she ran to it and put her hand on the doorknob. ""I had my hand behind my back and he grabbed my left hand -- which was on the doorknob -- and twisted my arm,"" said Lane. Kennedy raised his foot and kicked another nurse, Cari Luciano, who'd come to help before entering the stairway, Lane added. But he only got down as far as the next landing, where he was met by security. The defense team was tough on the nurse. Suggesting she had an ulterior motive given Kennedy's high profile, lawyer Robert Gottlieb questioned a tearful Lane why -- if recounting her story was so emotionally difficult -- she had recounted her version of what happened so soon after the incident on NBC's ""Today Show."" Fellow defense lawyer Celia Gordon, in her opening statement, suggested Kennedy was calm and that the situation only deteriorated because of Lane. Any contact with the nurses was due to a father's instinctual reflex to ""keep someone from ripping his baby from his arms,"" the attorney added. ""(Lane) was abrasive, confrontational and changed the entire tone of the discussion ... and wanted to let him know who was in charge of his baby,"" Gordon said. The incident occurred at the hospital in Mount Kisco, located about 40 miles north of New York City and where this week's trial is taking place. After Kennedy was arraigned in February, his attorney released a statement stating that nurses initially agreed to let him take the baby outside and demanding ""appropriate disciplinary action"" be taken against Lane and Luciano. Timothy Haydock, a doctor at the hospital and longtime family friend who was with Kennedy at the time, asserted in the statement that ""nurses were the only aggressors."" But neither nurse recognized Kennedy as the child's father and intended to protect the baby, who apparently had not been discharged, according to Elliot Taub, the attorney for both nurses. They were trying to enforce hospital rules, he said. The hospital, in New York's Westchester County, issued its own statement in February supporting its nurses. ""At Northern Westchester Hospital, patient safety is our priority and we completely support the actions of our nursing staff in this case as they were clearly acting out of concern for the safety of a newborn baby."" The late Robert F. Kennedy was the younger brother of slain President John F. Kennedy and had served as U.S. attorney general and U.S. senator. He was assassinated in 1968 while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination. CNN's Yon Pomrenze reported from Mount Kisco and Greg Botelho from Atlanta.","NEW: A nurse testifies that Douglas Kennedy twisted her arm and kicked another nurse .

"(CNN) -- Two whistleblowers will divide nearly a half million dollars following the  latest settlement between the Justice Department and independent contracting firms  working in Iraq. DynCorp agreed to  pay the U.S. government $7.7 million, and its subcontractor The Sandi Group promised to pay a bit more than $1 million dollars for overcharges they  presented to officials, the Justice Department said Friday in a press release. Drew Halldorson and Brian Evancho, both former Sandi Group employees who alerted authorities about the overcharges, will divide $481,710 as their share of the government's recovery in the case, according to the federal department. DynCorp was sued for inflated claims involving construction  of camps from containers shipped to locations where contractors were able to set  up temporary accommodations for fighting forces. The Sandi Group was sued for  improperly seeking reimbursement for ""danger pay,"" which it falsely claimed to have paid  its employees in Iraq, the Justice Department claimed. ""The hard work of  stabilizing Iraq is challenging enough without  contractors and subcontractors inflating the cost of rebuilding by making false  claims at taxpayer expense,"" said Assistant Attorney General Tony West.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Six hip-hop artists from five countries speaking four languages are on stage, warming up for their show at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. International hip-hop artists warm up for their show at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday. ""Warming up"" doesn't really capture it; the dancers explode across the stage, each one with a different hip-hop style. Michelle Salazar is chic-grungy in black jeans and white T-shirt, her long black hair swirling around her head. Hassan El Haf, from Lebanon, tall and thin, does a kind of electric hip-hop mixed with salsa. Argentines Mauricio Trech and Silvia Fernandez move in a dramatic break dance. Both hail from Argentina, home of the tango. Hien Ngoc Pham from Vietnam, with a buzz cut and dressed in white jeans and a white T-shirt, has Broadway bravado in his every move. The dancing stops and Samer Samahneh begins rapping -- in Arabic. No translation needed; it comes from his soul. Three weeks ago, the dancers had never met, but now they're a team, participating in the State Department's Cultural Visitors Program. The program consists of three weeks of meeting American hip-hop artists and dancers and visiting New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. ""It's like a dream come true for me,"" Salazar said Tuesday, the day of the team's show, ""because I only read their names in the Internet and now, like, I met Afrika Bambaataa, the founder of hip-hop. I was right next to him. It's a real immersion into the culture. I don't want to wake up!"" Salazar isn't just star-struck. She's learning a lot and she plans to bring it back to her fellow dancers in the Philippines. ""Dancers in the Philippines don't have much of a foundation [in hip-hop],"" she says. ""They don't understand why dancers do this"" -- she moves her arm -- ""or why they do this"" -- she strikes a pose. ""Because if they knew why they would feel it. I can feel it by watching these [American] hip-hop dancers."" Samahneh agrees: ""You've got to feel it."" His rapping, he says, comes from inside-out. ""Even if you don't know the language, you can get involved with what I'm saying."" Samahneh says that when he raps in his hometown of Nablus in the West Bank, he is ""asking God to bring peace to our land."" Colombia Barrosse, the vibrant head of the State Department's Cultural Programs Division of the Bureau of Cultural Affairs, says the cultural cross-fertilization is the goal of the program. ""There is nothing that can substitute for being in the United States and meeting Americans in their place, to look at the richness and diversity of the United States. That's irreplaceable,"" she says. The Cultural Visitors Program is part of the State Department's cultural programming around the world. The $8.5 million budget is supplemented by institutions like the Kennedy Center, which is co-sponsoring this performance. Most of the visiting artists in the program found their way to professional dance through hip-hop. Pham, a member of the Vietnam Dance Association, is currently working to open a hip-hop training center in Ho Chi Minh City to reach out to young people. With a broad smile, he says, ""Hip-hop is such energy. It's so young. It's also an opportunity for our countries to get closer, and I have a lot of friends all over the world."" Hip-hop may have started in the United States, but it belongs to everyone. Here's how Hassan El Haf puts it: When he got to New York, he felt as if he had landed on his ""real planet."" ""Yeah, I see them, all the dancers in the street, the music, all the people that like hip-hop music,"" he says. ""When I do hip-hop, it makes me feel happy all the time. This is my life.""","Hip-hop artists from five countries visit the U.S. to meet U.S. artists, perform .

"(CNN) -- Tunisia's interim president declared Thursday that parliamentary elections will be held July 24. Fouad Mebazaa said he plans to continue serving in his interim role until the new parliament begins to work, the country's official news agency reported. At least three Tunisian government officials resigned Monday and Tuesday, the country's official news agency reported, in the wake of the resignation of the prime minister on Sunday. Popular protests in the north African nation led to the resignation of the long-time president in January, prompting a wave of unrest across the Arab world. But the flight from Tunisia of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali did not end the protests there, and Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi quit on Sunday. The minister of higher education and scientific research, Ahmad Ibrahim, and the higher education secretary, Faouzia Farida Charfi, both quit on Tuesday, Tunis Afrique Presse reported. Mohamed Nouri Jouini, the planning and international cooperation minister, resigned on Monday, the agency said. After Ghannouchi resigned, Tunisia's interim president tapped Al-Baji Qa'ed Al-Sebsi as the country's new prime minister Sunday, state-run media reported. Ghannouchi told reporters Sunday that he was resigning ""because I am not willing to be a person that takes decisions that could cause casualties."" Three people were killed during protests in the capital, Tunis, on Saturday. He also questioned ""why a lot of people considered their main target to keep attacking the government, although a lot of its members agreed to join in this critical time."" In addition to the three killed, nine others were injured during the mayhem in Tunis, according to an Interior Ministry statement cited by Tunis Afrique Presse. More than 100 people were arrested in the area around Habib Bourguiba Avenue, in the city's center, and accused of ""acts of destruction and burning,"" the ministry said. Protesters had gathered in the area to demand that the interim government step down and the parliament be disbanded. Demonstrators were also asking for suspension of the constitution and election of an assembly that can write a new one, as well as organize the transition to democracy. Protests in Tunisia erupted late last year. Fed up with corruption, unemployment and escalating prices of food, people began demonstrating after the self-immolation suicide of a fruit cart vendor in December. By mid-January, Ben Ali -- who had ruled Tunisia since 1987 -- had turned executive power over to his prime minister and fled the country.

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Isaac contributed to a moist air mass that brought torrential rainfall and street flooding Tuesday in Charleston, South Carolina, officials said. By evening, between 4 and 8 inches had fallen across the low-lying metropolitan area. ""We were stranded and had to be rescued ourselves,"" said Charleston County spokeswoman Tracey Amick. ""Our car had water coming through the doors. It's ridiculous right now. There are trash cans floating down the street, cars stuck, people trying to get through these flooded streets on bicycles."" The tropical moisture, combined with a trough of low pressure off the coast, prompted a flash-flood warning in the city that was to continue until 12:30 a.m. Wednesday. About 20 vehicles were stranded on streets at one time, said meteorologist Vern Beaver of the National Weather Service. Heavy flooding also was reported in Mount Pleasant and North Charleston. The College of Charleston reported 5 inches of rainfall by 7 p.m. Tuesday. West Ashley reported 7.5 inches, as did Daniel Island. Significant flooding was reported near the Historic Charleston City Market. The worst of the flooding appeared over late Tuesday, forecasters said. Senior forecaster Steven Taylor said most of the rain Tuesday afternoon fell during low tide. Winds were pushing slightly above normal tides in downtown Charleston. ""If we get heavy rain to fall during high tide, the flooding level will only increase,"" he said. Beaver expected rain to continue into Thursday, although it won't be as heavy as Tuesday's downpour.

"(CNN) -- Felix Baumgartner made headlines around the world when he fell 24 miles from near-space to a desert in Roswell, New Mexico, and lived to tell the tale. The jump put Baumgartner in the record books and spelled publicity for the sponsor, Red Bull, a caffeinated sugar-y drink building a reputation for risk and adventure. Now that the stunt is over, does it mean something to the rest of us? Baumgartner risked death. Why? Was it worth it? Something in the human character must yearn to break into the record books. Baumgartner did set a record for supersonic travel by a human, 65 years after Chuck Yeager exceeded the speed of sound in an experimental plane. One used a rocket engine, the other used gravity; both went pretty fast. But Yeager was testing experimental planes at higher and higher altitudes and speeds, one of the steps toward getting into space. He might have done it for the thrill but there was clearly a higher purpose, namely, the development of flight technologies. The Red Bull extravaganza, said several involved with the project, would be useful for developing new and better space suits. My guess is that tests in a wind tunnel or a freezer would suffice, and neither would require risking a life. The tech behind the Stratos jump . Or, astronauts could test suits outside the International Space Station, which is moving roughly 10 times faster than Baumgartner, in a much thinner atmosphere about 300 miles above the Earth, the real conditions that astronauts might face on a space walk. So NASA (or Space X) probably doesn't need Red Bull, or Baumgartner, whose other work may have been more about research and development and less about testing human limits. Opinion: The space adventure you can't miss . NASA astronauts have always risked their lives. They have to like the thrill, too, but they are motivated by the mission. After the Columbia accident in 2003, NASA limited further space shuttle flights to the essential -- mostly carrying cargo to finish the International Space Station. Anything that wasn't vital to the nation was not, decided NASA, worth the risk. That's why I remember the debate about repairing the Hubble Space Telescope one last time, to install two powerful new already-built instruments. I heard that the astronauts didn't hesitate for a minute to carry out this mission -- indeed, they argued to add it to the flight manifest. The Hubble science was too important. So let's not confuse a daredevil with a scientist. Although some scientists take risks, it's always driven by what is necessary to get an answer to a scientific question. As computers become powerful enough to simulate physical reality, even those risks diminish. Probably computers can help us understand things like, for example, how to make a better space suit. As one commentator noted, the Red Bull event was closer to PT Barnum than Albert Einstein or Marie Curie. The Curies did risk their lives, as it turned out. Radiation was more dangerous than they understood, and both suffered from its effects (although Pierre Curie died in a traffic accident). But their advancement of physics -- as was ultimately recognized by Marie Curie's two Nobel prizes (in physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911) -- helped usher in the modern age of quantum physics. As a physics professor, my reaction to the record-breaking skydive was a bit different than most. I started thinking about my physics students. Chuck Yeager retraces history in the sky, breaking the sound barrier -- again . Students of introductory physics can easily calculate Baumgartner's fall in the absence of air resistance. Starting at 128,000 feet, absent the braking due to friction with the air, he would have continued to accelerate all the way to the ground, reaching a final speed of 870 meters per second, or about 1950 mph. The fall would have lasted just 90 seconds. Instead, air resistance slowed him to a reported terminal speed of 833 mph, and the fall lasted nine minutes. More importantly, the air meant he could deploy a parachute to slow his descent even more. Modeling air resistance is a bit more advanced, but it's still basic physics. What else does physics tell us? Baumgartner needed a pressurized suit because the atmosphere is very thin at such high altitudes, as well as very cold. If you've ever taken a long distance flight that shows the airplane's location and other data, you know that such planes fly at about 35,000 to 40,000 feet, which is about seven miles up, and temperatures are well below freezing. Add in the wind chill -- since falling through air is the equivalent of standing still in a wind -- and unprotected warm-blooded animals would freeze quickly. Perhaps a bigger danger was that for the first 35 seconds, Baumgartner was tumbling out of control. Physicists would say he had ""acquired some angular momentum"" -- i.e., he was spinning. Did Baumgartner lean forward as he left the capsule, starting the rotation? In any case, by moving his arms or legs, he could change his orientation, increasing or decreasing his spin -- just as precision divers did in the London Olympics last summer. For any jump with a somersault or twist, the diver would initiate a rotation as he leaves the board or platform.

"(CNN) -- Tension loomed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo city of Goma on Monday night as rebel commanders refused to leave the city ahead of a midnight deadline imposed by regional leaders and the African Union. African leaders convened in neighboring Uganda over the weekend and released a statement demanding that the M23 group withdraw at least 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Goma as a condition of initiating negotiations. The leaders called on the rebels to ""stop all war activities,"" and ""stop talk of overthrowing an elected government."" But M23 leaders said Monday that they will leave the conflict-scarred city only if talks are successful. Both rebel and government troops were massing west of Goma, potentially leading to further clashes as the deadline passed. At the United Nations, a spokesman for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged the rebels ""to immediately lay down their arms in accordance with the agreements reached in Kampala and comply with the immediate withdrawal of their forces from Goma."" The spokesman, Eduardo del Buey, said Ban urged the parties to continue talks ""to address the fundamental causes of the conflict."" He said Ban will also make sure that the U.N. peacekeeping mission MONUSCO is able ""to respond to he evolving challenges."" But he added, ""The mandate of MONUSCO is to protect civilians. It is not to fight the M23 on its own. That is he responsibility of the Congolese armed forces, and the maintaining of security is the primary responsibility of the Congolese police."" The M23 group was named for a peace deal reached on March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. Rene Abandi, a spokesman for the M23 group, told reporters on the sidelines of the conference Saturday that the rebels' main aim was to force Congolese President Joseph Kabila to agree to talks. ""We want talks over human rights and insecurity (involving) issues contained in the 2009 truce, which he, Kabila, has refused to implement,"" Abandi said. The outstanding issues include positions in the national army, an equitable distribution of resources and infrastructure development in eastern Congo, Abandi said. Kabila was one of the African leaders who devised a new game plan at the Great Lakes region summit in Kampala over the weekend. But the consortium didn't just call for concessions from the rebels: The group's statement also called on the Congolese government to listen to and resolve the grievances of the rebels, who took control of Goma on Tuesday after days of fighting with government forces. In Goma itself, citizens are getting frustrated with M23, because many shops and all banks haven't opened, and only a few students have trickled back to school. International organizations such as Oxfam and World Vision and the United Nations have been forced to abandon operations in eastern Congo. Now, aid groups are warning of escalating risks of disease and abductions facing victims fleeing the violence and uncertainty.

"(CNN) -- Threats by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula against targets in Yemen prompted the closure of the U.S. and British embassies there Sunday, officials said. ""There are indications that al Qaeda is planning to carry out an attack against a target inside of Sanaa, possibly our embassy,"" John Brennan, the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""And what we do is to take every measure possible to ensure the safety of our diplomats and citizens abroad, so the decision was made to close the embassy."" The United States is working closely with the Yemeni government on the proper security precautions, he said. Another senior administration official told CNN late Sunday that the closing of the U.S. Embassy was because of a specific, credible and ongoing threat. No additional details were provided. The British Foreign Office told CNN its embassy also closed because of security concerns. A spokeswoman said a decision would be made later Sunday on whether it would reopen on Monday. U.S. State Department spokesman Fred Lash would not elaborate on any specific security threats, and said he did not know how long the embassy would remain closed. The embassy on December 31 alerted Americans in Yemen to remain on alert for the possibility of terrorist violence. On Christmas Day, a Nigerian man allegedly attempted to detonate an explosive device on board a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan. On Saturday, President Obama linked the suspect, 23-year-old Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, to an al Qaeda affiliate based in Yemen. Shortly after the incident, Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the bombing attempt. ""I think what we've seen over the past several years in Yemen is an increasing strengthening of al Qaeda forces in Yemen,"" Brennan told CNN. ""There are several hundred al Qaeda members there."" In a Sunday interview on the BBC's ""The Andrew Marr Show,"" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said besides increased security measures, ""We've got to also get back to the source of this, which is Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan, and we've got to recognize that we've got a group of young people who have been radicalized as a result of teaching by extremist clerics, and we've got to recognize that we're fighting a battle for hearts and minds here as much as everything else."" He said Britain will work with American authorities to support the Yemeni government in its counterterrorism efforts. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said the attempted attack on the airliner was in retaliation for airstrikes against it on December 17 and 24. One of those attacks targeted four al Qaeda operatives believed to have been planning an imminent attack in Yemen against the United States or Saudi Arabian embassies, or both, a senior U.S. military official told CNN on Sunday. Three of the targets were killed in the attack and a fourth was wounded, the official said. The wounded man was actually wearing his suicide vest when captured by the Yemenis, according to the official. On Saturday, Gen. David Petraeus, head of the U.S. Central Command, met with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen, a senior U.S. government official told CNN. During his meeting with Petraeus, Saleh expressed his appreciation for U.S. help in combating extremists, offered more support for U.S. counterterrorism strikes, and said he would continue providing assistance for the U.S. investigation into the attempted bombing, the official said. The official said that Petraeus was carrying several messages and ""various items"" of information from Obama to Saleh. No further details were available. The two men discussed the latest intelligence on al Qaeda in Yemen, the official said, adding that the group in the U.S.-Yemeni meeting was kept very small on both sides. In remarks Saturday, Obama pledged that everyone involved in the attack would be held accountable, and highlighted his administration's attempts to crack down on extremist enclaves in Yemen. The president also reiterated his long-standing promise to ""disrupt, dismantle and defeat"" al Qaeda. Obama said that AbdulMutallab had recently traveled to Yemen and that ""it appears that he joined an affiliate of al Qaeda."" Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula apparently trained AbdulMutallab, equipped him with explosives, and directed him to attack the plane, the president said in his weekly radio address. Obama has been criticized by some political opponents for not responding more aggressively to the bombing attempt. From the first day, the Obama administration has been focused on Yemen, Brennan said Sunday. ""We are very concerned about al Qaeda's continued growth there, but they're not just focused on Yemen,"" he said of al Qaeda. ""They are, in fact, looking toward the West."" That's why, he said, ""we have to get to this problem in Yemen now."" ""This is not the first time this group has targeted us,"" Obama noted. Recently, he said, ""they have bombed Yemeni government facilities and Western hotels, restaurants and embassies -- including our embassy in 2008."" ""Everything is possible"" in terms of U.S. military assistance, Brennan told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. The United States is providing Yemen with ""security, intelligence and military support,"" he said. ""We want to make sure the Yemenis have what they need."" He told CNN that while the United States has made progress in diminishing al Qaeda's capabilities, the organization is still a threat and still has the capacity to carry out attacks, and continues looking for ways to do so. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Obama aide cites indications al Qaeda planning attack in Yemeni capital .

"(LonelyPlanet.com) -- Now that you can fly to Iceland on the Iron Maiden plane (check out our recent Q&A with the plane's captain, Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson), we thought we'd acknowledge a few other ways you can travel 'with the stars' -- by going to their own shops, restaurants or private islands. Here's a sample: . Hotels and villas . Keith Richards: Rocky Point Villa (Parrot Cay, Turks & Caicos) For beach-time luxury, Keef really does home here -- it's just one of a series of celeb-studded three-bedroom villas with big sundecks, private pool and butler service in the Turks & Caicos that start at $10 million if you're looking to buy. To rent, it runs $8100 a week in peak season, but $4500 from June through October. Kate Pierson of the B-52s: Lazy Meadow (Woodstock, New York) Far far far more economical -- and funky -- is Kate Pierson of the B-52's boutique hotel, a renovated '50s cabin complex a couple hours from New York City in the Catskills. Rates start at $175 a night. Each cabin was decorated by the artists who lent their colorful home for the B-52's 'Love Shack' video, and there are '50s-era Airstream Trailers to rent out too. There's nearby streams, hiking trails and towns to explore. Lonely Planet: Countries that can still be traveled on the cheap . Doris Day: Cypress Inn (Carmel, California) Most equate Carmel with former mayor Clint Eastwood, but Doris 'Que Sera Sera' Day calls it home too. Airy, terra-cotta hallways give a Mediterranean feel to this historic hotel, open since 1929. And Doris' seriously pet-tastic rules (quote open to canine guests) is quite, um, 'que sera sera' too. Clint Eastwood: Mission Ranch (Carmel, California) Speaking of Clint, his Carmel ranch features a complex of 1850s buildings spread across sea-facing fields in Carmel too. There's some surprising deals from $135 a night for a room in the ranch house. Francis Ford Coppola: Coppola Resorts (Belize & others) Coppola's not just in it for the tourist dough, he steps in to help rebuild communities. Highly regarded resorts like Placencia, Belize's Turtle Inn are made from hurricane-wrecked predecessors transformed into a dose of paradise, with nice beaches and diving opportunities. Summer rates start at $285. Lonely Planet: 20 free attractions in London . Restaurants and bars . We all know about Bobby DeNiro's Nobu sushi franchise (seriously, he's even opened one in the world's most remote English-speaking city, Perth), so we've focused on a few you might have missed: . Mike Dirnt of Green Day: Rudy's Can't Fail Cafe (Oakland, CA) The recently opened second rock'n'roll themed cafÃÂ© -- named for a Clash song -- is set next to the historic Fox Theater in Oakland's rising 'Uptown' neighborhood, which was pretty much a ghost town a few years ago. Makes sense to co-owner Mike Dirnt (Green Day's bassist), who was born in town. It's a bit of a '50s throw-back, with thematic dolls and a hearty gamut of diner fare. Morgan Freeman: Ground Zero Blues Club (Clarksdale, Mississippi) Near the fabled crossroads -- down on Highway 61, where Robert Johnson supposedly sold his soul for guitar prowess -- Clarksdale is a slightly worn Delta town with a heavy dose of blues and barbecue. (April's Juke Joint festival is a sidewalk-spiller scene of ribs and blues bands; unreal). The town's focal point, right by the tracks, is the paint-peeling brick building known as Ground Zero, a blues bar co-owned by Morgan Freeman. It's only 10, but looks 80 -- in all the right ways. Carlos Santana: Maria Maria (Walnut Creek & San Diego, CA; Austin, TX) The Grammy-winning guitarist named his mini chain (four locations) of modern Mexican fare after his hit song. Food makes regulars forget any celeb connection, though if they look closely at the artist signature they can remember (Carlos' art decorates the walls). Shops and clubs . Jack White: Third Man Records (Nashville) Jack Whites -- of White Stripes (and 'Cold Mountain' let's not forget) fame -- opened this record shop in Nashville a couple years ago. He won't likely be manning the register when you go by, but it's clearly a business true to his unique aesthetic and something he means. It recently starred on the Comedy Central TV show, the Colbert Report, where the mock-conservative talking head recorded with the label's band Black Belles. (See Jack hold his own with Colbert.) Dave Eggers: 826 Valencia (San Francisco) Eclectic author, the guy behind the ever-artful McSweeney's literary journal, created this not-for-profit writing center/shop to inspire youth to write in San Francisco's Mission District. It's also a shop, famed for its pirate supplies for the 'working buccaneer.' When all else fails, what's wrong with a little fun and a lot of inspiration? See Eggers talk, nervously, on how he started it for TED Talks. Susan Sarandon: SPiN (New York City) She doesn't know how to play ping pong, or really care to learn, but sees her ownership role of the star-studded ping-pong club in Manhattan as something like 'Miss Kitty' from the TV show Gunsmoke. Why though? She said, after getting beaten in China, she likes any sport where a little girl can beat a tough guy. It's as much playing as, the site confesses, drinking or people-watching. The catch is to play you must apply for membership -- starting at $65 a month (the application requires self-evaluation at ping-pong skills, a seven-tiered rating from 'embarrassing' to 'professional'). Carly Simon: Midnight Farm (Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts) In Vineyard Haven on Martha's Vineyard -- the town that still makes boats, true to the island salty past -- Carly Simon co-owns the shop Midnight Farm, a precious little shop that covers most bases: wall art, sundresses, hand creams, books, and signed copies of Carly's CDs (her music always makes the website).

"(Financial Times) -- Eurozone finance ministers are eyeing a plan that would rapidly cut Greece's debt mountain in the early part of the next decade in an attempt to secure International Monetary Fund approval for an extended bailout for Athens. Policy makers gathering in Brussels on Tuesday are inching towards a provisional deal to pay Greece up to â¬44bn of long-overdue aid. The deal would involve a political fix to reset Athens' long-term debt target to after 2020. While the details are still under negotiation, the shape of the potential deal involves Greece missing its target of maximum debt of 120 per cent of gross domestic product by 2020 -- a benchmark of ""debt sustainability"" the IMF regards as sacrosanct. But additional debt relief measures would ensure that by 2022 Greece's debt would fall to less than 110 per cent of GDP. This compromise aims to reconcile the public spat between eurozone ministers -- who want the 120 per cent target pushed back to 2022 so that official creditors need not suffer losses on any Greek debt -- and the IMF, which is refusing to release bailout loans unless Athens is servicing manageable debts by 2020. The IMF can only disburse funds to countries deemed solvent. The IMF has urged European official creditors -- the eurozone rescue funds and the European Central Bank -- to take losses in one form or another on their officials loans or bond holdings to help reduce Greek debt. Heading into the meeting, the IMF remained sceptical that a comprehensive agreement was easily achievable, with the eurozone countries still privately at odds with each other about how to fill Greece's financing gap. As the meeting started, the fund was holding to its target of reducing Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio to 120 per cent by 2020 -- the goal which sparked a public disagreement last week between Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, and eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker. Fund officials have pointed to statements by the Netherlands and other mainly northern European countries making their support for any financing package conditional on the IMF's approval. Mujtaba Rahman, a former European Commission official now at the Eurasia Group risk consultancy, said: ""The IMF needs to push hard on debt sustainability for its own institutional credibility. They've finally understood that the Europeans want them in the mix for political blame sharing as much as for their actual policy prescriptions."" Greece's debt burden has ballooned since the last bailout deal in March because the country's recession has been deeper than expected and because privatisation plans have failed to get off the ground. Greek debt is now expected to peak at 190 per cent by 2014. Furthermore, an agreement last week to extend Greece's bailout by two years, giving Athens more time to hit austerity targets, requires an additional â¬15bn in financing that will further add to the country's debt pile. The sharper trajectory of reducing Greece's ballooning debt levels would come through a combination of cutting interest rates on existing bilateral loans, extending the debt maturities, launching a debt buyback scheme and the ECB forgoing any profits on its holdings of Greek debt. However, many analysts -- and some ECB policy makers -- are sceptical about whether these measures even in combination would be sufficient to hit 120 per cent in 10 years without more generous debt forgiveness. Most officials are optimistic that a tentative agreement will be reached on Tuesday to disburse the loans under an extended bailout programme, which would be formally approved after consultation with national parliaments, according to officials involved. The question is whether the IMF will agree to pay its slice of the loans to Greece. The most difficult element is likely to be bridging the divide with the IMF, which is insisting on firm pledges to ensure Greece is on a path to solvency. Mr Juncker said: ""There are good chances that we will come to a conclusive mutual solution."" But others were more cautious. Jutta Urpilainen, the Finnish finance minister, warned that the situation was ""very much open"" and might not be concluded. Athens is seeking a payment of â¬44bn, comprising â¬31.5bn of overdue loans and tranches of credit earmarked to it to the end of the year.

"(CNN) -- A third oil holding tank has gone up in flames at the Amuay oil refinery in northwestern Venezuela, Oil and Mining Minister Rafael Ramirez said Monday. The death toll has risen to 48, Stella Lugo, governor of the state of Falcon said Monday, two days after an initial explosion there. ""We have been serious, transparent and honest with the (death) figures,"" she added. On Sunday, President Hugo Chavez arrived at the refinery to survey the damage. Speaking to reporters, he said it was too early to speculate what could have caused the blast, which injured more than 80 people. ""There was a leak. The gas formed a cloud and it exploded. We must investigate why,"" Chavez said. The president declared three days of mourning. The early Saturday blast damaged refinery infrastructure and ripped through nearby houses. Among the dead were 18 members of the national guard and 15 civilians, according to Vice President Elias Jaua, state-run VTV reported. 20 killed in Venezuela prison violence . In total, 209 homes and 11 businesses were damaged, Jaua said. The refinery -- one of the world's largest -- is part of the giant Paraguana complex in Falcon state. Venezuela, a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is one of the world's largest oil exporters. U.S. gasoline prices rise again . The nation has a refinery capacity of more than 1 million barrels per day, according to OPEC. The organization said Venezuela's oil revenues represent some 94% of the country's export earnings, more than half of federal budget revenues and some 30% of gross domestic product. The South American country ships a large percentage of its exports to the United States. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","Death toll rises to 48, two days after an initial explosion there, governor says .

"(CNN) -- As backlash against airline passenger pat-downs intensified with a viral online video, the nation's top airline security official said Monday that his agency is walking a fine line between privacy concerns and public safety. A short video clip circulating on the internet shows a shirtless boy receiving a pat-down from a Transportation Security Administration agent. His father watches, hands on his hips, obstructing part of the view. But the words playing in the background are clear. ""Are they harassing a kid?"" one man asks. ""It's ridiculous,"" another voice chimes in. ""Unbelievable."" Finance student Luke Tait said he started recording the incident with his cell phone when he saw the ""visibly upset"" father while waiting in line Friday at the airport in Salt Lake City, Utah. ""It was an interesting situation. I never saw a little boy with his shirt off getting a pat down,"" Tait told CNN. TSA spokesman Dwayne Baird said screeners searched the child after he set off a metal detector alarm. ""The father removed his son's shirt in order to speed up the screening process. Once screening was complete, both proceeded to the gate for their flight,"" Baird said in a statement. Asked about the incident Monday on CNN's ""American Morning,"" TSA Administrator John Pistole said his understanding was the same as the account Baird gave. The TSA is trying to strike a delicate balance, Pistole said -- ensuring the safety of the traveling public while taking privacy concerns into account. ""The bottom line is, everybody wants to arrive safely at their destination,"" he said. In the short term, no changes will be made as the holiday season approaches. Some 2 million people a day are expected to travel on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. A Michigan man, who endured what he called an ""extremely embarrassing"" pat-down this month, disagreed. ""These new pat-downs have to be stopped until [TSA agents] are trained and are comfortable doing what they need to do,"" Thomas Sawyer told CNN's ""American Morning."" Sawyer, a bladder cancer survivor who has worn a urostomy bag since a surgery three years ago, said a TSA agent at Detroit Metropolitan Airport caused the seal of the bag to open partially during a pat-down, spilling urine on his clothes. Sawyer said he tried to caution the agent against pressing too hard on his abdomen because of the bag. The agent didn't understand and continued with the search, Sawyer said, and ""pulled the seal kind of half off"" the bag. ""These people need to be trained on medical conditions ... and emotional conditions,"" Sawyer said. He said the agent ""didn't apologize, he didn't do anything."" ""I'm a good American, I know why we're doing this and I understand it,"" Sawyer said. ""But this was extremely embarrassing, and it didn't have to happen. With educated TSA workers, it wouldn't have happened."" On Monday, the TSA said Pistole had reached out Sawyer to hear about his experience and assure him that officials would look into the matter. ""We have done extensive outreach to the disability community, and our officers take seriously their responsibility to be respectful and professional throughout the screening process,"" the TSA said in a statement. Pistole pointed out that the pat-downs are not mandatory -- passengers receive them only if they opt out of a screening with advanced-imaging technology. The technology is the TSA's best effort, he said, to head off attacks such as the would-be Christmas Day bomber last year. Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab allegedly had a bomb sewn into his underwear on a flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit. Asked whether the technology and pat-downs would have been able to find that device, Pistole said he believes they would have, saying it would have shown up as ""an anomaly"" with the imaging technology and then might have been located in a pat-down. There has never been an explosive found on a flight from one U.S. city to another, Pistole acknowledged. But, he pointed out, domestic terrorists exist -- Timothy McVeigh, Eric Rudolph and Ted Kaczynski, for instance -- and there are people who want to do the government harm. While America is ""fortunate"" that such an incident has not occurred on a domestic flight, he said, it could conceivably happen. ""We welcome feedback and comments on the screening procedures from the traveling public, and we will work to make them as minimally invasive as possible while still providing the security that the American people want and deserve,"" Pistole said in a statement released Sunday. ""We are constantly evaluating and adapting our security measures, and as we have said from the beginning, we are seeking to strike the right balance between privacy and security."" But Rep. John Mica told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday the enhanced screening shows the TSA is ""headed in the wrong direction as far as who they're screening and how they're doing it."" ""I don't think the rollout was good and the application is even worse,"" he said. ""This does need to be refined. But he's saying it's the only tool and I believe that's wrong."" The Florida Republican, who will be chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in January, has argued that airports should hire private security screeners. The ramped-up use of pat-downs and full-body scanning is needed to stop nonmetallic threats including weapons and explosives from getting aboard planes, the TSA said. And it appears that most Americans agree. In a recent CBS News poll, four out of five Americans supported the use of full-body scans. President Obama stood by the new controversial screening measures Saturday, calling methods such as pat-downs and body scans necessary to assure airline safety. The president told reporters that the balance between protecting travelers' rights and their security is a ""tough situation"" but stressed such methods are needed after what happened last Christmas Day. But Obama's support hasn't stopped a growing group of objectors, from civil rights and privacy advocates to scientists and pilots, from loudly claiming these measures are too invasive, ineffective and possibly unsafe. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, asked by CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday whether she would submit to an enhanced pat-down, laughed and said, ""Not if I could avoid it. No, I mean, who would?"" Pistole noted Monday that Clinton went on to say she understands the importance and focus on travelers' security. Some are calling the frenzied travel day before Thanksgiving ""National Opt-Out Day,"" urging travelers selected for full-body scanning to refuse. Travelers have the right to opt out of full-body scanning, according to the TSA, but the pat-down alternative has, in turn, created its own public furor. Last week, a San Diego, California, man's viral video of his clash with security screeners spawned several T-shirt designs with his ""Don't touch my junk"" quip. And CNN affiliates around the country have reported examples of passengers who say they find pat-downs embarrassing or invasive. But Pistole has told CNN the outcry over the new screening was overblown. ""Very few people actually receive the pat-down. In spite of all the public furor about this, very few people do,"" he said. CNN's Rick Martin and Marnie Hunter contributed to this report.","Cancer survivor describes pat-down that led to his urostomy bag spilling .

"(CNN) -- He works with the precision and concentration of a surgeon because, well, he is one. But in the basement workshop of Kirk Withrow's Birmingham home, the stakes are much lower. The ear, nose and throat doctor has what he calls a slightly ""obsessive"" passion for making things out of other things, chief among them, guitars from cigar boxes. A patient with a sinus infection introduced him to the instrument during his residency at the University of Alabama Birmingham about 11 years ago and gave him his cigar box guitar. He's been hooked ever since. ""There's a certain element of liberation to it. You're not bound by the rules of what you can get at the store,"" said the 33-year-old married father of two. ""You have the ability to change the things you don't like and make them to your liking... you're pretty much just limited by whatever you can think of."" In the past decade, he has created dozens of cigar box guitars, most of them 3-string, acoustic and electric, though the latter takes more time, he says. He has recorded albums and occasionally plays shows and festivals, though he claims he's not that great and reckons the appeal lies in watching some guy a play homemade instrument. His manual dexterity and steadiness from being a surgeon helps him shape and fret guitar necks, he said. But most of his day job is figuring out what do do and how to avoid surgery, exercises in problem-solving that translate well to making guitars from colorful, wooden boxes from local tobacconists and liquor stores. ""Surgery isn't as hard as it looks. It's all the thinking and preparing for surgery that takes work,"" said Withrow, a cheerful Southerner with the muscular build of a rock climber -- another hobby. ""That's what I like about my job and making cigar box guitars. It's all problem-solving and innovating."" His obsession makes him part of a small, eclectic group of musicians, crafters and weekend warriors, whose enthusiasm recalls a culture imbued by poverty, when homemade instruments were made out of necessity. The earliest known proof of a cigar box instrument comes from an etching of two Civil War Soldiers at a campsite, one playing a cigar box fiddle displaying the brand ""Figaro,"" according to CigarBoxGuitars.com. Copyrighted in 1876, the etching was created by artist Edwin Forbes, who worked for the Union Army. Cigar box guitars and fiddles, along with other homemade instruments, such as jugs and washboards, figured heavily in the rise of American jug bands and blues in the early 20th century, since most performers could not afford manufactured instruments. The Great Depression continued the trend when manufactured instruments were beyond the means of most, but cigar boxes, broom handles and a few wires from the screen door were available to mostly everyone. The modern revival is a likely tangent of the DIY culture, especially among fans of Delta blues and Appalachian music, which evoke a tinny sound that comes through on acoustic cigar box guitars. Online communities such as Cigar Box Nation host discussions among enthusiasts, whose passion extends to other homemade instruments such as ukeleles, diddley bows, mandolins, even violins. As with most obsessions, Withrow's takes up the basement level of his home, which is a workshop and shrine to the hobby. An area near the garage door contains the electric bowsaw he uses to shape the wooden necks and a workshop inside the garage contains the typical wall of assorted tools in various shapes and sizes. He claims to keep most of his guitars in rifle cases that fill the shelves because their shape makes them too awkward for guitar cases. Even the bathroom contains a draftsman's table for drying wood and linoleum print cuttings, another hobby of his. Withrow keeps the guitar his patient gave him in his musical man-cave, among other homemade guitars, a mandolin and a curious-looking stand-up bass known as a washtub bass (or ""gut bucket"") for its key component. His creations start at $100 on etsy, but he insists he's not out to make money. ""I absolutely don't want to make them to support myself. Once you switch from making something because you feel like it to doing it because you have to it takes away from it,"" he said. ""My main goal is to make them so they play very well. It's more about the process of doing it. I learn something new every time so I'm constantly reinventing.""","Patient gave Alabama surgeon his first cigar box guitar more than 10 years ago .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A grand jury returned an 11-count indictment against Lonnie David Franklin Jr., the alleged ""Grim Sleeper"" serial killer accused of murdering 10 victims over a 20-year span, authorities announced Thursday. Franklin, 58, was arraigned Thursday on 10 counts of murder with the special-circumstance allegation of multiple murders, said Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley in a written statement. He was also charged with one count of attempted murder in the case of an 11th victim who survived, according to the indictment unsealed Wednesday. ""The families of the victims should be accorded timely resolution of the allegations of the murders of their loved ones,"" Cooley stated. Franklin was arrested and charged with the same counts in July 2010, but the indictment allows the case to move directly to trial instead of a potential lengthy preliminary hearing process, according to Los Angeles District Attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons. Franklin is accused of killing his victims -- girls and women ranging in age from 14 to 36 -- between August 1985 and January 2007. Most of the victims were discovered dumped in South Los Angeles alleys and covered with debris. They were shot to death and some were strangled and shot, the indictment alleges. The charges make Franklin eligible for the death penalty, but the district attorney's office has not made a final decision on whether to pursue the death penalty, said spokeswoman Gibbons. Franklin has pleaded not guilty. Police were led to Franklin when authorities learned that a ""familial search"" of the DNA database by the California Department of Justice had come up with a convicted felon whose genetic blueprint matched a relative of DNA collected at 15 crime scene locations. Franklin's 28-year-old son was that convicted felon, prompting detectives to conduct a surveillance of Lonnie Franklin Jr., eventually obtaining his DNA sample from a slice of pizza that Franklin discarded, authorities said. When detectives announced the arrest, they also revealed that Franklin had, for a time, worked as a garage attendant at a Los Angeles police station and previously had an arrest record although his offenses did not require him to submit a DNA sample. Shortly after Franklin's arrest, police searched his home and said they found photographs and videotapes of another 100 women. In December, investigators released some of those photographs, which generated leads and millions of hits on the Los Angeles Police website, they said. In December, Los Angeles detectives disclosed the investigation of two additional homicides that may be related to the suspect. Detectives also said there are four missing persons cases that may be connected to their overall investigation.","The ""Grim Sleeper"" killings claimed at least 10 lives from 1985 until 2007 .

"(CNN) -- In an effort to understand why a truck serving as a parade float crossed in front of a fast-moving locomotive last week, killing four war veterans on the float, federal accident investigators on Tuesday will re-create the accident conditions. The National Transportation Safety Board will stage a locomotive and a truck at the railroad crossing in Midland, Texas, to measure the sight distances between the two. The test will answer the question: ""What could be seen, when, (and) where?"" board member Mark Rosekind said. The test comes as investigators this week examine a wealth of information about the crash, including several videos that captured the moments leading up to impact. They also are reviewing interviews with the train's engineer and conductor and are making plans to interview the truck driver. The accident happened late Thursday afternoon during the ""Hunt for Heroes"" parade to honor members of the U.S. military. The last flatbed truck in the parade was crossing the tracks when an eastbound Union Pacific train slammed into it, Midland police said. The safety board said the grade crossing warning system -- consisting of a bell, lights and a gate -- operated as designed, giving a 20-second warning of the train's arrival. But the truck entered the crossing, and the gate lowered, tipping over flag stands on the float, safety board investigators said. Some people were able to jump off the truck in time, witnesses said. But first responders found two dead at the scene, and two others were later pronounced dead at Midland Memorial Hospital. Fifteen others were injured, some seriously. Those killed were identified as Marine Corps Chief Warrant Officer 3 Gary Stouffer, 37, Army Sgt. Maj. Lawrence Boivin, 47, Army Sgt. Joshua Michael, 34, and Army Sgt. Maj. William Lubbers, 43. The safety board did not speculate or hint at the cause of the crash, but instead cited a number of facts that appeared not to be factors. The train was traveling 62 mph, the safety board said, under the 70 mph speed limit. No anomalies have been found in the grade crossing warning system, Rosekind said. Nor have investigators found any mechanical problem with the train's air brakes, nor defects with the tracks, Rosekind said. Rosekind said the south traffic light at the grade crossing turned green 21 seconds before the train's arrival at the crossing, as designed, to allow traffic time to clear the crossing. At 20 seconds before the collision, the bells and lights on the mast activated, in keeping with the minimum time under federal law. At 13 seconds before the collision, the gate started coming down, and a second later, the front of the truck crossed the north rail of the tracks. The engineer sounded the horn nine seconds before impact. At seven seconds before impact, the lowering gate struck flagpoles on the float. The train's emergency brakes were applied five seconds before impact, but it took the train 75 seconds to come to a complete stop, Rosekind said. Rosekind said investigators would remain on the scene through much of this week and said a conclusion to their work is months away. Investigators are reviewing video from a forward-facing camera on the locomotive, and video from a dashboard camera on a police cruiser that was behind the parade float, Rosekind said. They are also examining information on a data event recorder on the train, which recorded the train's speed, horn, etc. The grade crossing where the accident occurred had been designated a ""quiet zone."" Typically, trains blast their horns a quarter mile before a crossing. But the city of Midland applied to designate the crossing a quiet zone. Rosekind said alternative safety measures are provided in quiet zones. ""Our investigators will now be looking at exactly what those safety measures were and whether they were in place at the time of the accident,"" he said. The safety board will also be looking at the parade permits to see what conditions were placed on the parade and whether those conditions were met.","Train struck parade float in Midland, Texas, last week, killing four veterans .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Coagulated sheep's blood. Pig knuckles. Snake bile. Fried crickets. Sound like ingredients you might see bubbling away in a caldron, right? Zane Lamprey raises a toast to alcoholic beverages the world over. Well, these are just some of the unusual items Zane Lamprey has eaten -- yes, eaten -- during the course of his day job. No, he's not a human garbage disposal. Lamprey is a comedian who hosts a TV program about drinking, ""Three Sheets."" The show follows him all over the world as he samples local libations. Lamprey also claims to be in search of the ultimate hangover cure, which is why he's often called upon to ingest the indigestible. Not that the drinks are any better. Anyone for a shot of Belize rum that's had a dead snake fermenting in it for about a year? If the locals drink it, so will Lamprey. ""I'll try anything once,"" he said, adding that ""there's certainly a lot that I won't drink twice.""  Watch Lamprey use sword to open champagne Â» . Gross stuff aside, Lamprey has what many consider to be a dream job. And although he occasionally gets a little bleary-eyed, the Californian maintains that it's not a show about getting inebriated. ""I drink to try new things, to learn about drinking cultures or new drinks,"" Lamprey said. ""Sometimes levels of inebriation are the by-product of my job, but I'm certainly not going out looking to do that. If I did I think I'd be the wrong person for the job."" We caught up with Lamprey in New York's Bubble Lounge, where he was preparing (soberly, mind you) to use a sword to lop off the end of a champagne bottle, glass neck and all. It's a ritual he says started in the Napoleonic era as a way to celebrate victories at battle. While Lamprey might not be as battle-scarred as Napoleon's men, he does have a victory to celebrate: ""Three Sheets"" has a new home after being put in limbo for several months after its original network went off the air. The show now airs on the Fine Living Network, which has just popped the cork on ""Three Sheets' "" fourth season. New episodes air Monday nights at 10 p.m. ET and repeat throughout the week. Besides demonstrating how one sabers champagne, Lamprey talked to CNN about dealing with thumping hangovers, staying in shape and other challenges of hosting a TV show about alcohol. The following is an edited version of the transcript. CNN: Do you consider yourself a professional drinker? Zane Lamprey: I get paid to drink. If I got paid to play baseball, I'd be a professional baseball player, right? Yeah. So I guess I am a professional drinker. CNN: By now you must have discovered a cure for a hangover. Lamprey: There is no cure. Actually, there's two. Either don't drink, or don't stop. Once you break one of those, you get into trouble. We've found remedies, things that'll make it a little easier. I've jumped in freezing water, I've done just about everything, and nothing has wiped out my hangover. CNN: Where were you when you had your worst hangover? Lamprey: Oddly enough, I was in a place that I was promised by several people I would not get a hangover: Champagne, France. They said if you drink good champagne, you can drink as much as you want, and you won't get a hangover. So I put it to the test, and the next day, I had the worst hangover yet. It was horrible. Oh. So bad. CNN: In Iceland, you drank something called ""Black Death,"" the same name given to the pandemic that nearly wiped out Europe centuries ago. Taste good? Lamprey: I'm sure it tasted better than the plague, but not by much. It tasted like something that people shouldn't want to drink, like vodka mixed with black licorice and dirt. When I stepped off the plane, I was dying to try it. Then once I tried it, I was dying to drink something to get that taste out of my mouth. CNN: You've said that one of the worst things you've had to drink was viper rum in Belize, which had a dead snake soaking in it. What does a snake taste like? Lamprey: A dead snake tastes like what a dead snake smells like. When I actually had to smell the shot, which I was told not to do, I almost hurled. I managed to get it down, and I think I chased it with a piece of watermelon rolled in sugar. CNN: What does your doctor say about the state of your liver? Lamprey: I have one. It's sitting on my counter at home, and it's completely fine. ... When I finished this last season, I did go and get a full checkup, and I'm completely fine. CNN: How do you stay in shape while shooting ""Three Sheets""? Lamprey: I don't. Go look at a clip of me doing the show. I'm probably about 23 pounds heavier. I have taken my shirt off, and when I watch that sometimes I get a little, ""Oh, God."" But that makes me an everyman. People want to see an everyman. They don't want to see some guy who's all put together, which clearly I'm not. I don't profess to know anything about booze. I learn it from the people that show me. CNN: Do you find that generally everybody's attitude toward drinking is the same the world over? Lamprey: Absolutely. Everyone drinks to enjoy themselves. Everyone goes out with their friends because they're looking to have a good time. That's the same everywhere. CNN: You spend all this time in bars around the world ... your crew must be tempted to drink. Lamprey: Tempted to drink? Fact: I cannot keep up with my crew. CNN: So your camera operator has shot you drunk? Lamprey: I would say yes. CNN: That explains why sometimes you look blurry. Lamprey: I'm generally a very blurry-looking person.","Zane Lamprey hosts ""Three Sheets"" on Fine Living Network .

"Houston (CNN) -- If you are heading home after Thanksgiving still groggy from L-tryptophan and an early morning Black Friday shopping spree, you're counting on a team of airline workers you might never see to get your plane out safely and on time. ""I think the pit crew analogy is actually a really good analogy,"" explains Stephanie Buchanan, vice president of the Houston hub for United Airlines. ""We like to call it a highly choreographed ballet. There are a lot of moving pieces, a lot of teamwork that has to happen."" When a large aircraft lands, as many as 35 men and women -- most wearing orange or green safety vests -- swarm to the plane to get it ready to go out on its next flight. ""It has to be marshaled into a gate, the baggage has to be unloaded, the cargo has to be run to the freight warehouse, the passengers have to come off, it has to be refueled, catered again,"" Buchanan says. ""Everyone has to work as quickly as they possibly can to get everything turned and ready for the flight to go out again."" Best times to travel on a tight budget . Many aircraft have only 40 minutes between arrival and departure, so each gate has a large LED display counting down the seconds until the plane is scheduled to leave. This week CNN got special access to United Airlines' ramp-services operation at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport. When Flight 59 from Amsterdam pulls into Gate E18, the lead marshaler waves two orange wands directing the pilot where to park the Boeing 767 aircraft. Two crossed wands is the signal to stop. Within seconds, wheel chocks, complete with the airline's name printed on them, are placed behind and then in front of the aircraft's wheels to keep it from rolling. A thumbs-up from one of the workers signals the jet bridge to slide into place, as a warning bell sounds, and open the way for passengers get off. How to pay for your vacation . Ramp crews are already at the rear of the aircraft opening doors to retrieve the cargo and luggage inside. On this larger aircraft as many as 500 bags can fit into the hold with most packed into large shipping containers called ""cans."" ""You have someone actually taking the cans off the aircraft, onto the loader, and then you have a download crew which actually pulls the carts with the cans to their destination,"" Antwon Warden, a ramp service agent, says as he stands watching one of the contoured containers slide out. ""There is a lot of processes that go into getting a bag from one destination to the other, but we do it proficiently."" Computerized bar code scanners help the crews identify bags and where they are headed. ""When a person checks in for a flight a bag tag will be generated,"" Buchanan says. ""That bag tag will be read by a scanner and based on that information the agents know whether to put it on another cart to go connect somewhere else or to put it in our bag systems which can also read the tags and let us know whether that bag needs to connect to another flight or be delivered here locally."" 7 ways to go local while traveling . As bags are still being unloaded, ramp service agent Max Rivera is at the front of the aircraft attaching a large tug to the front wheel so the plane can be pushed back onto the taxiway when it comes time to leave. ""We try to stay one step ahead of our normal procedures as far as getting it ready to actually depart,"" he says. Inside the aircraft cleaning crews are already replacing the used pillows and blankets while a food service contractor is loading new meals and beverages for the return trip to Amsterdam. Buchanan says decades of experience have taught them how much of each item needs to be on each flight. ""You build up a database, if you will, of every type of flight, every type of market, based on how many people are going to be booked on it as to the quantity of each thing that you should board,"" she says. As maintenance crews make final checks, in the cockpit the pilots wait in the jetway ready to step into the aircraft. Outside the plane a worker is connecting two large fire hose sized gas nozzles to the underside of the wing to pump in the thousands of pounds of jet fuel needed for the flight. 5 post-Thanksgiving hotel sales . At the rear of the aircraft other hoses pump water in and lavatory waste out. ""I would say maybe the folks that have to empty the lavatories have the toughest job,"" Buchanan says. ""But they are all equally important in our minds."" Making sure every part of the process runs smoothly from the other side of the airport is BB Chavez in the Station Operations Control Center. ""I like to think of myself as an orchestra conductor,"" Chavez, manager of the operations center, says as he looks over the darkened mission control room filled with computer screens. ""Everybody in here plays a critical part. You have your vendors over here, your caterers, your fuelers, your line maintenance over here, these gentlemen watch the aircraft that come in and out, and this desk here watches the whole operation."" On his screen he can see video of the plane at E18 finishing its preparations. ""We still have a couple of passengers boarding,"" he says with 25 minutes to go until departure. ""Looks like everything is right on time."" Mind your digital manners . Turning planes around quickly might be nice for passengers, but it also means profits for an airline. ""Our airplanes are our assets and so we need to utilize them as much as we possibly can,"" Buchanan says. ""So the faster we can turn an airplane the sooner we can get it back in the air flying and earning revenue for us."" Back at the ramp, service agent Simi Kalasa is loading the last few individual bags into a compartment in the rear of the plane. For him, the holidays mean more luggage to load. ""That would probably be the toughest part, because you get a larger volume of bags and you have got to work a little harder."" Dear holiday traveler: Don't be a jerk . With one last minute bag loaded and the cargo doors shut it's time for takeoff, but one passenger hasn't made it. Since this aircraft is an international flight, their bags can't go if they aren't on board. The ground crew huddles and looks at their scanners to locate the bag packed away inside a can in the cargo hold. As they open the doors to start to retrieve it they get good news; the passenger has shown up and the plane can leave. A quick push back from the tug at the front of the aircraft and United Flight 58 is on its way back to Amsterdam. Only a couple minutes later the next plane pulls into the gate and the process starts all over again.

"(CNN) -- The father of a 12-year-old Virginia girl, who police say was abducted and taken on a week-long, cross-country trek by the man considered a prime suspect in her mother's death, on Monday thanked law enforcement, the media and the California woman who alerted police after spotting the girl. Calling what had happened ""nothing short of a miracle,"" Benjamin Smith said he was eagerly looking forward to reuniting with his daughter, Brittany Mae Smith, later Monday night or soon thereafter. ""I thought that the happiest day of my life was when my daughter was born,"" said Smith, addressing reporters in Virginia for the first time since his daughter was reported missing a week ago. ""Tonight has taken that number one spot."" Benjamin Smith said he spoke with his daughter on Friday, shortly after she was recovered by San Francisco police. Not sure if it was her -- and knowing ""there's probably 100 Brittany Smiths between here and California"" -- he said he asked her his dog's and then her dog's name, before being convinced and overcome with emotion. ""I don't think I said another word after that,"" he said, with a wide smile. The girl's father expressed gratitude to numerous people who worked on the case and who publicized the names and faces of Brittany and her alleged abductor, Jeffrey Scott Easley. He singled out Theresa Shanley, who recognized the pair outside a San Francisco supermarket, as ""my hero."" ""There's not anything I could say to describe ... the way my heart feels about you,"" said Benjamin Smith, adding he hadn't yet spoken with Shanley though he wanted to. ""A simple thank you and God bless you."" Despite Amber Alerts being issued in several states, authorities had no positive sightings of the girl and Easley until Shanley pulled last Friday into a Safeway parking lot in the Richmond district of San Francisco -- about 2,500 miles from where they were last seen together, in a Walmart in Salem, Virginia. Shanley told HLN's Nancy Grace she saw a man begging for money outside the store. But what most got her attention was a girl sitting on a nearby cement ledge. ""The hair on my arms stood up,"" recalled Shanley of that damp, cool afternoon. ""She spotted me, and I spotted her. And we never took our eyes off each other. (I felt) something is wrong here, something isn't right."" Shanley said she went inside the store, and asked a supermarket clerk to call police and tell them about the two. She told authorities that the girl might a missing child from Virginia and her alleged abductor. She said she believed she recognized the couple from pictures broadcast the previous night on ""Nancy Grace."" Shanley said she went back outside briefly, thinking she'd left her cell phone in the car, and again locked eyes with the girl, though the two never spoke. Later, after police arrived, she found out the girl was Brittany Smith, and the man was Easley. ""Sure enough, it was her and him,"" Shanley said. ""My intuition was right."" Two detectives from Roanoke County escorted the girl from California back to Roanoke, Virginia, on Monday, Roanoke County spokeswoman Teresa Hall said in a statement. The girl was to be released to her family. Easley, 32, remains in custody near San Francisco after being charged with abduction, credit card theft and credit card fraud charges. And Roanoke County police Chief Ray Lavinder has called him a ""very good suspect"" in the death of Tina Smith, Brittany's mother. Police believe that 41-year-old Smith, who was Easley's girlfriend, was killed between the morning and evening of December 3, Lavinder said. On that day, surveillance video shows Easley and Brittany Smith shopping for a blue domed tent at a Wal-Mart in Salem. Lavinder said authorities believe that the two left Virginia, heading toward California, that night or early the next day. They traveled cross country in Tina Smith's silver 2005 Dodge Neon sedan, which was found in a parking lot adjacent to San Francisco International Airport after authorities had found Brittany Smith and Easley. The pair were holding up a cardboard sign and asking for money when they were spotted, Lavinder said. The Safeway was within walking distance of the makeshift campsite containing the tent in which Easley and Brittany Smith had been staying. Easley did not resist when police arrested him shortly after 2 p.m. Friday, San Francisco police Officer Albie Esparza said. And Brittany Smith had no visible injuries, according to Lavinder. The chief added Monday that the girl was told, after being recovered by San Francisco police, that her mother was dead. The chief has said Easley met Tina Smith online this summer and moved into the family home in October. Police issued an Amber Alert for Brittany on Monday after finding the body of her mother. Tina Smith's co-workers had called to express concern that she hadn't shown up for work. Authorities in Florida and Alabama followed suit with Amber Alerts in subsequent days, and notices went out to law enforcement nationwide. Authorities said they do not know whether the girl went willingly with Easley. Regardless, with Brittany Smith safe, Virginia authorities say, they have now turned their focus to the homicide investigation. They are also trying to get Easley back east, though an extradition hearing hasn't taken place in California courts. He could go to Virginia relatively soon if he waives extradition, or the process may be delayed weeks if he contests his return.","NEW: Benjamin Smith says he's excited to reunite with his daughter .

"(CNN) -- A 13-year-old girl was fatally shot Tuesday morning on a private school bus while traveling with her 7-year-old sibling and seven other pupils in Florida, and another student has been arrested as the suspected shooter, authorities said. The younger sibling witnessed the shooting in Homestead, Florida, according to the Miami-Dade Police Department. The yellow school bus didn't have surveillance cameras, police said. The 13-year-old girl was airlifted to Miami Children's Hospital, where she died, police said. A motive hadn't been determined Tuesday, and police were investigating the relationship between the shooter and the victim, Officer Alvaro Zabaleta told reporters. ""It's traumatic for them for what they had to witness to begin with, and now you're going to have to question them to ask them exactly what they saw,"" Zabaleta told CNN affiliate WPLG. ""You know, it's tragic. Anytime it deals with a child, and then, of course, when we get the phone call that they confirmed that she passed away, it's very sad."" The victim was being bused about 6:30 a.m. Tuesday to Palm Glades Preparatory Academy Charter School in Miami, said Javier Baez, spokesman for Miami-Dade Police.

"(CNN) -- The former editor-in-chief of Al-Wasat, an opposition newspaper in Bahrain, says he and two colleagues have been summoned by the country's public prosecutor for questioning. Mansoor Al-Jamri told CNN he and two other former editors at Al-Wasat will go to the public prosecutor's office on Monday, a result of allegations the the newspaper falsified and fabricated reports during protests in the country that have led to a government crackdown. Al-Wasat's former managing editor, Walid Nouwaihidh; its former local news department head, Aqeel Mirza; and Al-Jamri were all fired earlier this month. At the time, the state-run Bahrain News Agency reported that the state Information Affairs Authority had ""instigated legal proceedings"" against the daily newspaper following the firings. ""The flagrant press irregularities committed by Bahrain daily Al-Wasat will be referred to the International Federation of Journalists and the Arab Journalists Union,"" the news agency reported. According to the news agency, the accusations against Al-Wasat also included ""deliberate news fabrication and falsification during the recent unrest which gripped the Kingdom of Bahrain."" Al-Jamri, a CNN contributor, denies the allegations. ""I have been subjected to a smear and unfair media campaign,"" Al-Jamri said. The protests in Bahrain are part of a wave of unrest that has spread through northern Africa and the Middle East as demonstrators rose up against their rulers. To quell the protests, the Bahraini government called in troops from member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The government crackdown and arrests are part of an effort to stop thousands of people who have been demonstrating in Bahrain since last month. Doctors Without Borders has accused Bahraini forces of raiding medical facilities to crack down on protesters, prompting injured people to avoid going to hospitals. ""Wounds, especially those inflicted by distinctive police and military gunfire, are used to identify people for arrest, and the denial of medical care is being used by Bahraini authorities to deter people from protesting,"" said Latifa Ayada, the organization's medical coordinator. The group is also known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres. The Bahrain Center for Human Rights reported last week that more than 400 people had been jailed or have gone missing since the government of Bahrain imposed a state of ""national safety."" Attached to the Bahrain Center's statement is a spreadsheet listing the names of 379 missing or detained people, all of them male. One of them, Nasser Ali-Jishi, was listed as having been ""of contempt run over and killed by police."" On Thursday, the country's crown prince defended the government's actions during the unrest. ""We were immensely concerned that some of our youth were pushed towards a destructive path, and that the nation was drawn along with them,"" Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa said in a speech, according to an official transcript.","Ex-editor Al-Jamri: ""I have been subjected to a smear and unfair media campaign""

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In the week since a 7.0-magnitude earthquake shattered this capital and jolted observers around the world, authorities have buried 70,000 bodies, about a third of the estimated final toll, officials said Tuesday. Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that at least 72,000 bodies had been recovered, a figure that did not include the unknown number of bodies buried by families or collected by the U.N. peacekeeping mission here. It was unclear how many of the dead had been identified prior to burial and how many of those burials occurred in mass graves. ""We know that bodies have been buried, we feel inappropriately,"" said Dr. Jon Andrus, deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization. He cited lack of refrigeration as a complicating factor. ""Despite all our efforts, situations, circumstances are such that we are disappointed in many cases on how this has been managed, beyond everybody's control,"" he said.  iReport: Search list of the missing and the found . PAHO, which is coordinating the health-sector response, offered a preliminary estimate of 200,000 dead. At least 28 of them are Americans, the U.S. State Department announced Tuesday. Despite the growing death toll, aid workers focused Tuesday on the living. The United Nations estimated that 3 million people were in need of food, water, shelter and medical assistance. Some needed more than that -- they needed rescue. In all, 43 international rescue teams composed of 1,700 people have carried out some 90 rescues, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told reporters. On Tuesday night, a team of New York City Fire Department and Police Department rescuers pulled two children alive from the rubble of a two-story building in the capital. The 8-year-old boy and 10-year-old girl were taken to an Israeli tent hospital. On Tuesday afternoon, Ena Zizi was rescued from rubble near the national cathedral, CNN's Anderson Cooper reported. Her son, Maxime Janvier, told CNN that he never gave up hope that she'd be found. ""We were praying a lot for that to happen,"" he told CNN on Tuesday afternoon, about 15 minutes after he learned she'd been rescued. Rescue crews said earlier two other survivors may be under the same pile. PAHO's Andrus said the need for blood donors was urgent, with the lack of refrigeration complicating medical workers' ability to store it safely. The world's generosity continued to overwhelm the ability of the airport in Port-au-Prince to process it. The result: some badly needed aid was left sitting on the tarmac. U.S. Army Maj. Daniel Allyn, the deputy commander of the Joint Task Force Unified Response, said flights would be diverted to two alternate ports of entry within the next day or two to relieve the pressure. On an average day before the earthquake, the airport was handling 13 commercial aircraft; in the days since, it was handling more than 200, he said. Some flights were diverting to Santo Domingo, causing congestion issues there, too, Andrus said. Nevertheless, advances were being made. Many roads that were impassable in the initial aftermath of the quake had been cleared so that supplies could be trucked to those in need, he said.         Full coverage    l     Twitter updates . And some hospitals appeared in better shape -- surgeries resumed Tuesday at University Hospital, the country's largest, Andrus said.  In Washington, U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Dr. Rajiv Shah told reporters Tuesday night that the U.S. response has been ""swift, aggressive and coordinated."" He cited the U.S. donations of 18 water production units providing nearly 2 million liters of drinking water per day and nearly 17 million meals as examples. The goal of the efforts, he said, ""is to make sure that the things we do collectively as an international community to support the relief effort are as sustainable as possible."" At the capital's general hospital, doctors were working under stressful conditions in buildings located away from the main building, which has been deemed unsafe. ""We have run out of IVs and IV needles and IV fluids,"" said Dr. Mark Hyman of Partners in Health. ""We've run out of surgical supplies. We have to wash with vodka and we have to operate with hacksaws because we don't have enough operating tools."" The military is going to help with organization and with supplies, Hyman said. ""They're going to help us get electricity, they're going to help us get food, they're going to help us get tents, they're going to help us get all the operating supplies in,"" he said. The United Nations Security Council approved sending an additional 2,000 soldiers and 1,500 police officers to the country and the port is expected to reopen next week, U.N. Secretary Ban said.  Fixing the port is a priority, since it is where fuel enters the country. Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez announced Sunday he will send 225,000 barrels of gasoline and diesel with arrival Thursday at a refinery in the Dominican Republic for use in Haiti. That represents nearly three weeks worth of fuel if Haiti were to continue the 11,000 barrel-per-day consumption that was typical before the earthquake. About 2,000 U.S. troops were in Haiti, and more than 5,000 were off-shore on ships, said Maj. Gen. Daniel Allyn, the deputy commander of Joint Task Force Unified Response. He said the U.S. military anticipated eventually having 10,000 troops in Haiti.  ""Our primary purpose is in getting to the population, whether it be the distribution of water, food, or, in this case, where they've got medical treatment going on and they're overwhelmed,"" Lt. Gen. P.K. Keen, head of U.S. Southern Command, told CNN.  In an interview with CNN's Amanpour, President Rene Preval applauded the progress aid workers made over the past week in restoring electricity and communication, clearing roads, erecting shelters, distributing food and re-establishing hospitals. He credited the international community for the aid. ""Without their help, it would be impossible for us to cope with the situation,"" he said.  High-resolution images of damage . Some Haitians welcomed the arrival of U.S. forces. But one man said Haitians needed more relief supplies, not troops or guns. The United States was conducting medical operations on board a vessel off the coast, the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson. And the USS Comfort, a hospital ship, was due to arrive Wednesday, Allyn said. Outside Haiti, people have contributed more than $220 million to major U.S. relief groups, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a newspaper covering nonprofit organizations. Dozens of Haitian children rescued from an orphanage arrived Tuesday in Pennsylvania to be placed with foster families until adoptions are finalized. Most of the children's adoption cases were at the end of the bureaucratic process before the earthquake struck. Occasionally, frustration in Haiti has erupted into violence, as occurred Monday when hundreds of Haitians broke into a damaged store in downtown Port-au-Prince, stripping it clean. But such incidents have so far been isolated, said Alain Le Roy, the United Nations peacekeeping director. But such incidents were isolated, Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters aboard a plane to India. ""I saw one reference to that for the last 24 or 48 hours or so. There has been a lot less violence in Port-au-Prince than there was before the earthquake,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The president of Bahrain's Center for Human Rights was referred Sunday to Bahrain's military prosecutor for publishing a photograph of a protester who died in custody that officials say he fabricated. Nabeel Rajab published on his Facebook page images of a man identified as Ali Isa Saqer. The man in the picture has multiple cuts on his front and back and heavy bruising across his body and face. Saqer, 31, died at a detention center Saturday, according to the general director of Muharraq Governorate Police. He was being held on charges of attempted murder of policemen while trying to run them over with his car on March 13. Authorities said Saqer was creating chaos at the detention center, and when security forces sought to subdue him, he resisted them and sustained various injuries in the process. He was sent to the hospital, where he later died. But Rajab and other activists say the photographs of Saqer show he was tortured and killed while in police custody. ""Yes, I have published a picture but this picture was not fabricated. It was an actual picture of a man who had marks on his body from torture,"" said Rajab. ""But I think I have been targeted not because of that. I have been targeted for my work as a human right defender as I have been one of the main people showing the outside world what's happening ... which was making the government upset and angry,"" he added. In a statement on its website, Bahrain's Interior Ministry said the photograph Rajab published is different from the one taken in the presence of a medical examiner after Saqer's death. The ministry published two photos it also said were of Saqer. The face of the man in the ministry's photos was blacked out and it was impossible for CNN to independently confirm whether the ministry's images and Rajab's photographs were of the same man. In the ministry's photographs, minor cuts and bruising can be seen, but nothing suggesting the abuse the photographs posted by Rajab imply. A CNN documentary film team recently went to Bahrain, one of the United State's strongest allies in the Middle East, to work on a piece about internet bloggers, activists and the revolutions spreading across the Arab world. The group had arranged a series of interviews, but most of the sources who had agreed to talk had since disappeared. Family members or others close to the sources said they had been arrested or gone into hiding after security forces raided their homes and threatened them. While reporting the story, the CNN team was detained by security forces in the street outside Rajab's house. Members of the group were questioned for six hours and released, but warned not to film anything else without permission. Rajab, who was arrested last month, said that the government is engaged in a campaign of intimidation against him and other activists. ""They said that they were looking for a suspect who was armed and thought I might know him,"" Rajab said. ""They beat me, punched me, kicked me, handcuffed me. Blindfolded me."" The government confirmed Rajab was arrested but did not provide additional details. Protests swept the strategically important island kingdom earlier this year as populations across the Arab world rose up against their rulers. Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy anchors its Fifth Fleet, is a small predominantly Shiite country governed by a Sunni royal family. It called in Saudi Arabia and other regional troops to help end the protests last month. ""I think this is the cost of the human rights work that I do,"" Rajab said shortly after news of his impending legal battle broke. ""I knew that what I am doing is costly and it could cost me my life or my family life and this is the price we are paying for our work as a human rights activist in the region,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Prominent human rights activist Al-Amin Kimathi was released from custody Monday at the outset of the trial for suspects in the fatal July 2010 bombings in Kampala, Uganda. Ugandan High Court Justice Alphonse Owiny Dollo, who is presiding over the case, released Kimathi, a Kenyan, on grounds that the state had dropped charges against him. He was one of five suspects released Monday. Originally, 38 suspects were taken into custody, and that number had been trimmed to 19 before Monday. The defendants have remained jailed on charges of terrorism, murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. The twin suicide bombings occurred at a popular rugby club and an Ethiopian restaurant in the Ugandan capital where people had gathered to watch the World Cup soccer finals from South Africa in July 2010. The explosions, just minutes apart, left 76 dead and scores injured. The terrorist group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility, saying the attacks were in response to Uganda's involvement with the African Union Mission in Somalia. Kimathi has drawn specific attention to the case, as human rights activists have demanded his release. Human Rights Watch had issued a statement Friday demanding the Ugandan government ""disclose any evidence it claims to have against the detained Kenyan human rights defender Al-Amin Kimathi or release him."" The Kenyan government also had urged Uganda to send Kimathi back to Kenya to be tried. Kimathi's lawyer Ben Cooper told CNN that Kimathi had traveled to Uganda in his capacity as a human rights activist to ""uphold law and justice"" but instead had become a victim of injustice on allegations that ""could not stand up."" He was arrested on September 15, 2010, in  Uganda, where he had traveled   to observe court hearings of Kenyan suspects in the Kampala bombings  who had been transferred to  Uganda. Kimathi was charged with terrorism under Uganda's  Anti-terrorism Act, as well  as murder and attempted murder, and was  held in pre-trial detention for nearly a  year. Kimathi's brother Onesmus Mureithi Imanene was overjoyed, Cooper told CNN, and Imaneme felt his brother had been ""vindicated."" Uganda says it is still under threat from extremists. Last week, the government released a fresh terror alert and reminded the public to remain vigilant at all times and report anything suspicious to police. .","Al-Amin Kimathi was released from custody at the start of the trial in Uganda .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of inmates using pipes and shanks as weapons trashed a California prison, burning a courtyard, ripping beds to shreds and tearing bathroom sinks from walls, a new video of the weekend riot's aftermath shows. A dormitory is trashed after a riot at the California Institution for men, in Chino. Video shot by CNN affiliate KABC-TV gave the first glimpse of the damage to the California Institution for Men in Chino from a riot that authorities said was ignited by racial tensions. ""This certainly is probably the worst that we've seen, especially adding the extensive damage to the unit that has been burned,"" prison spokesman Lt. Mark Hargrove told reporters outside the prison Tuesday. ""That has never happened at this facility before."" The riot erupted Saturday night and raged until Sunday morning, injuring 250 inmates. Fifty-five inmates were taken to hospitals with serious injuries, including stab wounds and head trauma.  Watch the aftermath of the violence Â» . ""The prison is still under a state of emergency,"" George Kostyrko, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation told CNN, which means no visitors were allowed and the prison could not take any new inmates. Corrections officials said they transferred about 1,150 inmates to other facilities.  ""The ones that are there are likely in a lockdown mode until an investigation can determine whether or not they were directly responsible for the riot,"" Kostyrko said. The decision to lock down the Chino prison and nine others in southern California was still in effect Tuesday. ""The lockdowns will remain in effect until all the staff that we deployed to Chino from other areas go back home,"" Kostyrko said. The measure was taken to prevent copy-cat violence. Though other races were involved, the altercations at Chino mostly involved Hispanics and African-Americans, Kostyrko said. About 80 officers responded to the scene, but none of the staff was injured. A housing unit was heavily damaged by fire. Prisoners broke windows and pulled down pipes to use as weapons, Kostyrko said. The facility has seven units, each of which houses about 200 inmates. In one of the torched dormitories, burned red prison uniforms were strewn everywhere, the floor was covered with ankle-high ashes, windows were shattered and there was a large hole in the roof. In the mounds of trash that littered the floor of the dorm, a rusty foot-long pipe could be seen. Most of the residential areas were badly damaged and some inmates were being temporarily housed in tents, the spokesman said. Chino is about 35 miles east of Los Angeles.","Video gives glimpse of damage to the California Institution for Men in Chino .

"(CNN) -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy was released from hospital Monday morning following a night spent under observation after he collapsed while jogging in woodlands near Paris. French President Nicolas Sarkozy shakes hands with medical staff as he leaves hospital Monday. Sarkozy left hospital arm-in-arm with his wife, Carla Bruni, shaking hands with medical staff before being driven away in an official car, according to Agence France-Presse. The 54-year-old fainted while exercising with bodyguards in hot sunshine near his weekend home close to the Palace of Versailles -- though officials stressed he was never unconscious. A witness told AFP that Bruni arrived at the scene shortly afterwards on a police scooter. Sarkozy was then flown to the Val-de-Grace military hospital by helicopter. Officials said Sunday that Sarkozy's condition was due to a ""minor"" nerve condition known as a vasovagal syncope, which affects the flow of blood to the heart causing low blood pressure and faintness, according to AFP.  Watch more on Sarkozy's trip to hospital Â» . In a statement, the hospital said blood tests, brain scans and an electrocardiogram had detected nothing abnormal. It said Sarkozy had been urged to rest for several days but that no medical treatment had been prescribed. Sarkozy was due to visit the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel in Normandy on Tuesday but the appointment has been cancelled, according to the French presidency Web site. Sarkozy is expected to chair a meeting of ministers on Wednesday morning before going on a three-week summer vacation in the south of France. Since becoming president in 2007, Sarkozy, who is often photographed running and cycling, has cultivated an image as a healthy and energetic president -- in contrast with previous incumbents of the Elysee Palace such as Jacques Chirac and Francois Mitterand who governed into their 70s. Sarkozy also vowed to make public his annual medical check-ups, in contrast to previous presidents whose states of health were closely guarded secrets. Mitterrand privately battled prostate cancer throughout his presidency from 1981 to 1995, undergoing several operations and eventually succumbing to the disease a year after leaving office at the age of 79. ""President Sarkozy came to office saying he was going to be more transparent in office and so far he seems to be getting reasonably good marks on that,"" said CNN's Paris Correspondent Jim Bittermann. ""We certainly saw the president come out today smiling and apparently in good health. The French public appears to have been kept better informed than on previous occasions.""

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Thousands of people determined ""to exercise their Second Amendment rights,"" attended a gun show Saturday in Tucson, Arizona, one week after a well-armed gunman opened fire at a local shopping center, the show's president said. The mood at the show was somber, said Bob Templeton of Crossroads of the West Gun Shows. But the two-day event is expected to draw up to nearly 7,000 patrons, rather than the customary 5,000, Templeton said. Attendees waited up to 20 minutes to buy tickets Saturday morning, he said. ""We had a moment of silence here at the show,"" Templeton said, referring to the deaths of six people and the wounding of 13 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, after last Saturday's shooting. Donations were being taken at the show to assist victims and families. Jared Lee Loughner, 22, allegedly carried a knapsack to the shopping center, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation. He had a semi-automatic handgun, four ammunition magazines and a knife, according to the official. Loughner is accused of bringing a Glock handgun to the Giffords event and opening fire. Some critics have questioned whether the gun show was appropriate so soon after the shootings. Templeton knows there will be a renewed debate on gun control. ""It's going to be a long dialogue on gun control and gun rights, and it will be hard to strike a balance between those two positions,"" he said. ""Responsible firearm ownership means if you are going to have a gun, you should be trained to use it in a responsible way."" Bill Schaeffler of Tucson, among those at the show Saturday, said he knows gun control and high-capacity ammunition magazines will be hot topics. Still, he said, people want to protect themselves. ""There will be more guns owned in this state at the end of this month than at the beginning of the month,"" he told CNN. A member of gun-rights lobbying group said he would probably vote for Giffords if she returns to Congress. ""You just have to admire somebody ... who has that kind of perseverance,"" said Charles Heller, secretary of the Arizona Citizens Defense League. Heller argued that a well-armed society is a safer society. ""Being armed is the natural state of man,"" he said. Federal law enforcement officials were on site to monitor buyers and sales activity, Templeton said. ""They routinely watch gun shows near the border area to try and curb the flow of guns into Mexico."" Templeton told CNN affiliate KGUN the massacre had nothing to do with lawful gun ownership. ""It was about a madman who had an agenda and who committed unspeakable acts of mayhem and violence,"" he said.","Gun show held in Tucson, Arizona, one week after massacre .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- For the second time in two days, a deadly blast shook a northwest Pakistani city as worshippers marked the sacred holiday of Ashura. The explosion occurred near a Shiite Muslim procession in Dera Ismail Khan. The bomb was planted inside a bicycle repair shop, killing five people and injuring more than 70 others, said Mian Iftikahr Hussain, the provincial information minister. A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said the group was behind Sunday's bombing on the procession and warned of more attacks. A day earlier, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a blast that killed seven people, including three children, during a Shiite religious procession in the same city Saturday. That bomb was planted in a garbage container and exploded as the last section of the procession, in which children were following adults, was passing by, police spokesman Khalid Sohail said. Eighteen people, including five children and two police officials, were wounded in Saturday's attack. The spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, Ihsanullah Ihsan, said the group would continue ""its mission"" and attack Shiite Ashura processions across Pakistan. Pakistan has been on high alert because of the two-day holiday of Ashura, in which believers mourn the death of a key imam from the 7th century. The government increased security for the Ashura observance. Taliban claim blasts killing dozens in Pakistan . Shia Islam is a minority sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim country, and its members face persecution from extremists. The Pakistani Taliban took responsibility for similar attacks earlier this week. Interior Minister Rehman Malik temporarily blocked cell phone services in cities, where gathered intelligence indicated the possibility of bombs detonated by cell phone. He also banned motor bikes, often used to conceal bombs, for two days in some cities. Malik said the safeguards were specifically meant to protect Shiites. Pakistan Taliban threaten to target India after execution of Mumbai attacker . Despite heightened security, at least 31 people were killed and 68 wounded in multiple bomb attacks Wednesday. A Taliban spokesman said those attacks targeted Shiites, whom the terrorists believe denigrate the Prophet Mohammed with their religious observance. Ashura commemorates the death of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson, killed in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. The battle and subsequent death of Imam Hussein caused the split between Shiite and Sunni Muslims.","NEW: The Pakistani Taliban say they are behind Sunday's bombing .

"Washington (CNN) -- Step by step, die-hard conservatives are confronting their grief over President Barack Obama's re-election. But judging from blog posts and other public pronouncements, many remain stuck somewhere between denial and anger, very far from acceptance. So far this week, prolific blogger Judson Phillips on Tea Party Nation has called for boycotting the Electoral College to prevent validating the election result and lamented the triumph of liberalism in destroying national unity and therefore America's greatness. Over at RedState.com, a more sophisticated political analysis echoes calls by Republican leaders to better communicate conservative principles instead of softening or dropping them. Founder and CNN contributor Erick Erickson, who rejected any talk of electoral fraud or an unfair Obama victory, wrote Tuesday that ""there'll be no hand-wringing here and there sure as hell won't be any apologies for fighting for what we believe in."" ""Republicans are not successful when they run campaigns as the rich patrician out to make government more efficient so it can be more helpful,"" said another Erickson post Tuesday. ""Republicans win with conservative populists who run as men who pulled themselves up in life fighting big government and its cronies."" Some acceptance has been necessary. On Tuesday, tea party favorite Rep. Allen West of Florida conceded in his race for re-election after initially alleging electoral fraud. Little of the discussion focuses on the changing demographics of the country, identified by exit polls and many analysts as a major factor in both Obama's 2008 victory to become the nation's first African-American president and his re-election on November 6. In particular, Obama received overwhelming support from the nation's fastest-growing demographic -- Hispanic Americans -- to cause some high-profile conservatives including Fox radio and television host Sean Hannity to soften their stance on immigration reform. Overall, though, hard-core conservatives continue to reject that they are a minority in a country built on the core principle of liberty that they embrace. Instead, the initial reactions and subsequent attempts to explain what happened sought scapegoats, such as what right-wing critics describe as a deficient Republican challenger in Mitt Romney, electoral theft or a liberal-dominated media industry that is part of a broader Marxist effort dating back decades to undermine the nation. Study: Fox, MSNBC got more extreme . On November 10, Phillips alleged that more votes than registered voters in several Florida precincts were part of Democratic efforts to ""steal the election"" against West. There was no immediate posting Tuesday in response to West's concession. Six days later, Phillips took aim at Romney, calling the former Massachusetts governor a ""flip-flopping liberal who ran a content-free campaign."" In a response to Phillips' post, one writer ranted about what he alleged were ""the sexual perversions and drug use of the Obamas,"" the president's ""forged birth certificate"" and ""voter fraud of biblical proportions."" ""Why are we talking secession instead of removing the New York Times and supporting citizens' Grand Jury indicments against this unbelievable treason, felonies and usurpations raining down on us on a daily basis?"" said the post attributed to Royce Latham of Penngrove, California. Timothy Stanley: Don't dismiss secession talk . On Sunday, Phillips proposed an action plan -- getting Electoral College voters in states won by Romney to boycott the validation of the election result by the December 17 deadline. ""The 12th Amendment specifies the quorum or the necessary number of states for the College to act, is 2/3,"" Phillips wrote. ""In other words, if 17 states refuse to participate, the Electoral College does not have a quorum."" Without a quorum to decide the presidency, he continued, the Republican-led U.S. House will decide and presumably choose Romney. Phillips acknowledged such a move would set a ""dangerous precedent,"" but added that ""the situation is so grim we really have no other choice."" ""Does anyone really believe America can survive four more years of Barack Obama?"" he wrote, saying the president will seek to ""transform America from that shining city on a hill into a third world shantytown, with massive unemployment and a corrupt government."" What's next for Obama election organization? The next day, Phillips sounded more resigned, lamenting what he called ""the triumph of liberalism in America"" that he said was ""destroying our national unity and by extension destroying the freedom."" ""In America, until now we have always identified ourselves as Americans,"" he wrote. ""The balkanization that has been pushed by the hard left has one goal in mind. That is the end of America as a great nation. They are perilously close to succeeding."" Tuesday brought his attack on a carbon tax being discussed by some on both sides in Congress as a step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contributed to climate change. While challenging ""the mythical man-made global warming,"" Phillips also said a carbon tax would create a ""massive new tax stream"" for liberals bent on growing government. U.N.: Greenhouse gases set record in 2011 . The focus on a single issue certain to generate legislative and public debate signaled some change in the response to the election. To Phillips and other conservatives, any increase in revenue goes against their goal of shrinking the federal government by cutting spending. ""It is time for conservative activists to make the case to the American people that we have far more government than we can afford, or than we want, no matter what our politicians may think, or what deals they may be willing to cut with each other to keep spending other people's money until we are all bankrupt,"" said a Tuesday post on Tea Party Nation by Bruce Donnelly of Fox River Grove, Illinois. GOP, Dems seek common ground on fiscal cliff . Donnelly called for ""organizing voters to rein in the politicians, rather than let them keep playing the game by their rules with our money."" ""It's worth your effort to organize voters in your community and apply real political pressure for change, because if we just keep playing the game by their rules, your own financial situation will keep getting worse, rather than better,"" he continued. ""The politicians keep offering free stuff with other people's money, playing us all for fools. It's time to wake up the voters in every corner of America to the fact that they have been conned by these snake oil salesmen and their well-rehearsed lies and false promises,"" Donnelly said. In the end, a reviled Democrat in the White House may mean more followers of conservative websites such as Tea Party Nation and RedState.com. No one seems happy about the better business prospects, at least for now.","Die-hard conservatives blame Mitt Romney, electoral fraud and liberal conspiracies .

"Diyarbakir, Turkey (CNN) -- The jailed leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party has called an end to a mass hunger strike in Turkey staged by Kurdish prison inmates and politicians. ""End the hunger strikes as soon as possible without any hesitation ... this action has reached its place and fulfilled its goals,"" Abdullah Ocalan said, the Kurdish Dicle News Agency reported Saturday. Ocalan passed along that message to his brother Mehmet, who had been permitted by Turkish authorities to visit the notorious guerrilla leader on the island in the Marmara Sea where he has been kept in solitary confinement. Mehmet Ocalan then relayed along the comment Saturday to protesters, some of whom have gone without solid food for 66 days: . A leader of the main Kurdish nationalist party, Selahattin Demirtas, appeared to endorse the message. Turkish town on Syrian border deals with fighting, ethnic differences . The Kurdish lawmaker announced on his Twitter feed that ""the statement by Mr. Ocalan is a very important development... We support this statement...we hope that the prisoners will reconsider in light of the statement."" On Saturday night, after the entire predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir echoed with the clangs of residents banging pots and pans in support of the hunger strikers, two Kurdish lawmakers had been allowed into one of the city's main prisons, presumably to meet with inmates who have been starving themselves, a spokesman for the hunger strikers told CNN . There was a huge police presence in front of a municipal building where at least 22 Kurdish politicians, including several lawmakers from the main Kurdish nationalist party and the elected mayor of Diyarbakir, have been staging the hunger strike. The parliament members had joined a much larger mass hunger strike that started and spread through the Turkish penal system more than a month ago. More than 680 Kurdish inmates have now limited their diets to water, sugar, tea and salt. Those on the hunger strike have issued several demands: Authorize Kurdish language education in schools, allow defendants to speak Kurdish while representing themselves in court and Ocalan's release from prison. The problem is many Turks consider Ocalan the country's No. 1 terrorist. The movement he helped found decades ago has been fighting a guerrilla war against the Turkish state for 30 years, a conflict that has claimed more than 30,000 lives. Turkey, as well as the European Union and the United States, have labeled the Kurdistan Workers Party a terrorist organization. On Saturday, the governor of Diyarbakir blamed the hunger strike and the street protests on the party. Turkey needs to change course over own insurgency . ""The legal and civilian extensions of the terrorist organization are increasing the tensions on the streets,"" Mustafa Toprak, Diyarbakir governor, said in an interview with CNN. He said police reinforcements had been brought into Diyarbakir to deal with what was said to be a two-day strike. He also said more than 100 people had been detained this week, as Kurds have organized nightly protests in Diyarbakir and other cities and towns throughout the largely Kurdish southeast. Demonstrators appear to have adopted an unusual tactic to deal with the security forces. Throughout the Kurdish region of Turkey, the overwhelming majority of demonstrators seen burning tires and overturning garbage bins were children younger than 15. Boys as young as 7 and 8 were seen torching barricades that had been dragged out to block city streets. ""Children are not terrorists,"" said Toprak, the Diyarbakir governor. ""But the things they are doing, if they were committed by adults, would be considered terrorist acts."" According to a recent report by the nonprofit conflict mediation organization International Crisis Group, Turkish authorities have arrested more than 7,000 Kurdish activists on suspicion of terrorist activities in the past several years. Gulten Kisanak, one of the Kurdish parliament members on hunger strike, said she and her 34 fellow lawmakers from the Kurdish BDP party were battling more than 750 legal cases against them in court, which could lead to more than 3,000 years in prison. As barricades burned in the streets outside, Kisanak and her fellow hunger strikers gathered in a reception room decorated with a giant poster of Ocalan. ""We are willing to die,"" Kisanak vowed. And she repeated her demand for the release of Ocalan, a Kurdish leader she described as ""a man of peace.""

"London (CNN) -- Rupert Murdoch protÃ©gÃ© Rebekah Brooks was charged Tuesday with conspiracy over alleged illegal payments to a Ministry of Defence employee, London's Metropolitan Police said Tuesday. In a separate case, Andy Coulson, another former Murdoch employee who went on to work for Prime Minister David Cameron, faces charges of conspiring to make illegal payments to officials for information relating to the royal family, Britain's Crown Prosecution Service said. Read more: Why media fights back so hard . Brooks and Coulson are former editors of the now-defunct News of the World newspaper, owned by a UK subsidiary of Murdoch's News Corp., News International. Brooks also was editor of daily tabloid The Sun from 2003 to 2009 before becoming chief executive of News International. Two others face charges of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office alongside Brooks -- the former chief reporter at The Sun, John Kay, and Bettina Jordan-Barber, employed by the Ministry of Defence. A fourth suspect, identified only as a second public official, remains under investigation, the CPS said. The charges in this case relate to the period from January 1, 2004, to January 31 of this year, Alison Levitt, chief legal adviser to the director of public prosecutions, said in a statement. ""This conspiracy relates to information allegedly provided by Bettina Jordan Barber for payment which formed the basis of a series of news stories published by The Sun,"" Levitt said. ""It is alleged that approximately Â£100,000 was paid to Bettina Jordan Barber between 2004 and 2011."" Kay, 69, and Brooks, 44, were formally charged at London police stations Tuesday. Both are scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on November 29. The case in which Coulson is charged also involves former News of the World royal correspondent Clive Goodman. Both men face two counts of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office. ""The allegations relate to the request and authorization of payments to public officials in exchange for information, including a palace phone directory known as the ""Green Book"" containing contact details for the royal family and members of the household,"" Levitt said. Royal officials declined to comment on the charges. Coulson, who took over as editor of News of the World in 2003, having served as deputy editor for three years, resigned from the post in 2007. He was then appointed director of communications for Cameron but stepped down in early 2011 amid questions over allegations of phone hacking by the News of the World, saying he did not want to be a distraction. The charges against Coulson, Brooks and the other suspects result from a Metropolitan Police investigation into alleged illegal payments to public officials, codenamed Operation Elveden. It was launched in conjunction with police inquiries into alleged phone and computer hacking. The News of the World was shuttered in summer 2011 amid public outrage over revelations that it hacked into the voicemail of a missing schoolgirl, Milly Dowler, who later turned out to have been murdered. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto, Susannah Palk and Max Foster contributed to this report.","NEW: Rebekah Brooks will appear in court next week, charged over alleged illegal payments .

"(Oprah.com) -- All singles in search of a whine-fest should roll right on past this train stop -- anyone who gets off at Rachel Greenwald's station will be served a particularly strong shot of truth. Her first book, ""Find a Husband After 35 Using What I Learned at Harvard Business School,"" makes zero allowances for always-the-bridesmaid brooding. But for the woman who's ready to vault to the altar, Rachel has a promise: Put yourself on a 15-step plan she calls The Program, and you'll have one foot in that Vera Wang gown. Five years ago, Rachel launched her consulting business, FindAHusbandAfter35.com, in Denver and began teaching clients the same principles she'd used in packaging products such as Evian water (she once served as that company's marketing manager) and Carolee jewelry. ""I'm treating singleness as a marketing issue,"" says Rachel, who calls her program a ""strategic plan"" in which the woman is the ""product"" to be advertised. ""My program is for the woman who is sick of wallowing in why she's single. The point is that she is -- and what will she do about it? What I'm offering her is an objective business perspective."" But doesn't it seem a tad contrived to market a human being? ""If you were looking for a job, you could call it 'contrived' to put your rÃ©sumÃ© online, ask friends for leads, and buy a new interview suit,"" she writes. ""But you'd do it -- because you'd be more likely to find a job.... Why is it different with trying to find a husband?"" Oprah.com: 3 tricks for a happier marriage . This from a wife (and now mother of three) who met her husband 11 years ago using her own step number 12 -- ""Event Marketing: Throw a Program Party!"" which means creating a ""strategic networking event"" to showcase yourself. ""I felt so fortunate to have found my husband and to be so happy, I wanted my single friends to have the same experience,"" Rachel writes. As her company succeeded -- ""at least 80 percent of my clients have gotten married within 12 to 18 months of hiring me,"" she says -- word spread. She then took her act on the road with seminars (topic: Marriage 911) and now claims that while a husband is not a panacea, she can tell you how to find a good one faster than you can spell Tiffany princess-cut diamond. The day I catch up with Rachel at Manhattan's Harvard Club, I've come to see whether she can convince me -- the former chubby chick with the Afro -- that her techniques will work. I sashay in wearing a fire-engine-red dress (in her chapter titled ""Packaging: Create Your Best Look,"" she suggests ditching all that black for a color that will differentiate me from the 32 million other single women my age -- 30 -- and older). Perhaps because she's already married, she can justify her black suit, Jackie O chic as it is. Our quick phoner the previous day -- we were two strong gusts of energy spinning toward each other -- immediately becomes, upon meeting, a whirlwind exchange of chatter and laughter that draws glances from a few blue bloods around us. Rachel, who enunciates each of her syllables with English-teacher perfection, oozes intensity with every gesture she uses to punctuate her rapid-fire statements. She whisks me to an empty sitting room, seldom shifts her gaze from me as she listens to my dating history, then insists, as the pitch of her voice climbs, that The Program can rescue me. ""When you sign up 100 percent for anything -- whether it's losing weight, finding a job, or quitting an addiction, I have no doubt that it becomes a challenge you can rise above,"" she tells me. ""I've seen what the power of focus can do for a woman who's committed not just in words but in action."" Oprah.com: Test your intimacy quotient . Me, too -- which is why Rachel is my kind of gutsy girl: all the kick of Cheddar on rye, minus any trace of baloney. As in this bit of bluntness she delivers in her chapter ""Telemarketing: Bring Out Your Rolodex"": ""Let me tell you right up front that you're not gonna like this step!"" she writes. ""But trust me, it can yield very good results... You are going to call everyone you know and directly ask them to fix you up."" That means all human life forms currently listed in your Palm V -- landlords, lawyers, grannies, hairstylists, florists, stockbrokers, long-lost gal pals from summer camp, former colleagues, and even old boyfriends you're still on good terms with. Oh, exhale: This approach needn't make you seem desperate. ""Each person will probably think you're calling two or three friends, not two or three hundred,"" Rachel says. She estimates, based on her experience with clients and her business school training, that you'll score one blind date for every ten calls. ""Why go through this torture?"" she writes. ""This statistic says it all: 'Fifty percent of people now married or living together were introduced by good friends or family members.'"" After poring over the 15 steps -- everything from ""Make The Program Your Number One Priority"" to ""Pump Up the Volume"" (""My approach gives you the tools to attract the highest number of men quickly and efficiently"") -- I decide to test-drive creating a ""personal brand."" ""This is what sets you apart from your competitors -- and to be effective, it must be memorable and specific,"" she explains. ""Madonna's brand might be 'outrageous, sexual pop singer.' We're all multifaceted, so you need to give your friends who'll set you up on blind dates a shorthand way of summing you up."" This, she says, derives from the business principle that a well-defined brand is essential to the success of any product, be it Jo Malone fragrance, the U.S. mail, or you. Not only should your brand ring true to your ""customers"" -- the people you'll ask to scare up dates for you or the countless men with whom you'll click Cosmo glasses -- it should also be designed to attract the kind of partner you're looking for. Oprah.com: How to build intimacy in your relationships . Rachel has me draw up a megalist of my most appealing attributes, like ""resilience"" and ""playfulness."" Then I choose three (""writer,"" ""warm smile,"" and ""grew up in Phoenix"") as a basis for a brand -- ""sunny girl from Arizona."" On the two websites where I've posted a profile, I update my photo (in the old one, we agree, the bad lighting doesn't exactly say ""sunny girl""). I then begin ""advertising"" by calling every girlfriend I have and asking for a setup. This move alone nets me three dates. For those who snatch up Rachel's book, I suggest enlisting the help of a supporter (in step two, she suggests you find a ""program mentor,"" preferably someone married) who won't be any less shy than Rachel about delivering the hard news straight. (After seeing my potential online photo, in which I'm sitting on a bed, she asks, ""Do you want a husband or a one-night stand?"") In this program, the truth is the essential bottom layer upon which your entire five-tier wedding cake will stand. Within two weeks of trying Rachel's strategies, I, the girl who once spent Friday nights booting up Tivo for an ""American Idol"" marathon, am now juggling so many suitors that I've started a ""man-agement"" diary.

"(CNN) -- The Tunisian government declared a curfew Tuesday in eight governorates, including the capital city of Tunis, in an attempt to quell violence after protests that included radical Islamists. The 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew was announced by the Interior Ministry and the Defense Ministry ""in the wake of violence carried out by criminal groups against establishments of sovereignty and public and private property,"" a prime ministry communique said, according to the official Tunis Afrique Press. The curfew is to be observed in the governorates of Tunis, Ariana, Manouba, Ben Arous, Sousse, Jendouba, Monastir and the Ben Guerdane delegation in the governorate of Medenine, it said. Medical and night-shift workers are exempted. The announcement came hours after the offices and archives of the public prosecutor were set ablaze, Tunis Afrique Press said. The news agency, citing the Interior Ministry, said 97 people had been arrested since Monday night after rioting by ""criminal groups"" in the capital. ""According to a ministry's press statement, these groups destroyed and set ablaze public properties, attacked police stations and assaulted policemen and citizens,"" it said. ""These groups include Salafis and persons with criminal records."" Salafis are ultraconservatives.

Ben Ali has remained in exile in Saudi Arabia since the January 2011 uprising that forced him from office. He is being tried in absentia in the deaths of dozens of anti-government protesters during the revolt.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban vowed Thursday to carry out attacks against India to avenge the death of a man executed by Indian authorities for his role in the 2008 terrorist assault on Mumbai.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Seven years after politicians were accused in a vote-buying scheme, Brazil's Supreme Court on Thursday started the trial of 38 people suspected of involvement in the scandal. Eleven Supreme Court justices started the hearings in the capital city of Brasilia. The defendants are accused of using public funds to pay lawmakers monthly bribes for their support during the first government of President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva in 2005. Lula's former chief of staff, Jose Dirceu, is among the defendants, along with other top members of his Worker's Party, bankers and businessmen. The main accusation in what is known as the Mensalao scandal, which means ""big monthly allowance,"" is that the Worker's Party diverted funds from advertising budgets -- not for personal enrichment, but to ensure lawmakers passed Lula's initiatives through Congress. Defendants have been charged with money-laundering, corruption and accepting bribes. They deny the allegations. Brazilian media is calling it ""the trial of the century."" The trial is expected to last a month and could tarnish the Workers Party and Lula's legacy ahead of municipal elections. But current President Dilma Rousseff, also of the Workers Party, has never been connected to the scandal. In fact, Rousseff enjoys a strong approval rating of 77%. Many Brazilians' view is that she has taken a tough stand on corruption, tossing out six ministers who were suspected of misdeeds. Brazilians have seen their share of scandals. They impeached President Fernando Collor in 1992 for corruption, but he is now an active senator.

"(CNN) -- Ricky Hatton has hung up his gloves after suffering a ninth-round knockout in his comeback fight against Vyacheslav Senchenko. The 34-year-old, who was fighting for the first time since suffering a second-round defeat by Manny Pacquiao in 2009, had hoped to relaunch his career after deciding to return to the ring. 'The Hit Man' as he is affectionately known, had endured a troubled time since quitting the sport following the loss to Pacquiao . Hatton had faced a battle with drink, drugs and depression before deciding to give boxing one last shot. But the former two-weight world champion was shown no mercy by his opponent and was left to rue a career-ending defeat. End game . A badly bruised Hatton told reporters: ""I found out tonight it isn't there no more. I'm a straight-shooter and I tell the truth. I can look at myself in the mirror and tell myself I did my best, but there is always an excuse to find. ""I got in the best shape I possibly could, but if I hadn't been hit with that body shot I would have just scraped over the line with a points win and I honestly think I would still be telling you all the same thing.

Hatton became the British light-welterweight champion in 2000 after going 21 fights unbeaten. He followed that up the following year by winning the WBU light-welterweight title. It was in 2005 that he secured his legacy, defeating the then IBF light-welterweight champion Kostya Tszyu. He claimed a points victory over Luis Collazo in 2006 to seal the WBA welterweight title.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Madeleine Pulver's ordeal started last August when a man burst into her room and tied a fake bomb around her neck, and ended on Tuesday when he was sentenced to at least 10 years in jail. The Australian teenager was studying for her final year exams when 52-year-old Paul Douglas Peters broke into her suburban Sydney home and carried out what the prosecution called an act of ""urban terrorism."" ""The terror instilled can only be described as unimaginable,"" Judge Peter Zahra told the District Court in Sydney during sentencing Tuesday. Pulver was in the courtroom, as were her parents, and the man who, on a Wednesday afternoon, pushed open their unlocked front door and found the 18-year-old student alone in her bedroom. Armed with a baseball bat and wearing a multi-colored balaclava, he told the frightened teenager to sit on the bed while he fixed a bicycle lock attached to a black box around her neck. According to court documents, as Peters walked away, Pulver asked him where we was going. ""Count to two hundred ... I'll be back ...if you move I can see you, I'll be right here,"" he replied. She waited. Around her neck was also two-page typed note and a USB stick in a plastic sleeve. After a few minutes Pulver yelled out. There was no response. She texted her parents: Call the police. Then she read the note. ""Powerful new technology plastic explosives are located inside the small black combination case delivered to you. The case is booby trapped. It can ONLY be opened safely, if you follow the instructions and comply with its terms and conditions."" With one look at the word ""explosives"" she knew what was around her neck. She phoned her father. Call the police, she begged. The note went on: . ""If you disclose these Instructions, future instructions, any correspondence, Remittance instructions enclosures, direction or any other relevant fact outlined here or elsewhere, to any Federal or State agency, the Police or FBI, or to any non-family member, it will trigger an immediate BRIAN DOUGLAS WELLS event."" Pulver phoned her father back. Don't call the police. It was too late. Sitting alone in her bedroom, Pulver was presumably waiting for what would come first, the police or the blast. When officers arrived they ""found the victim in a hysterical state and crying uncontrollably,"" court documents state. Read more: New details emerge in Australian collar bomb case . It's not clear whether the name Brian Douglas Wells meant anything to the Australian schoolgirl, but Peters had borrowed the name of an American pizza delivery man who was killed after a collar bomb fixed to his neck exploded in 2003. He was forced to wear the device by co-conspirators in a bank heist. It exploded as he sat in a parking lot soon after being stopped by police. Peters was only in the house for a matter of minutes, but it would take police nine hours to determine that the box contained no explosives, and 10 hours to remove it. The entire time Pulver supported the box with her hands for fear it may explode. Outside the court Tuesday, Pulver expressed relief at the sentencing. ""I am pleased with today's outcome and that I can now look to a future without Paul Peters' name being linked to mine,"" she told the assembled media. Behind the events of that day is the tragic unraveling of a once successful man's life, from an international career in finance to divorce and a heavy drinking problem, where the lines between fact and fiction became increasingly blurred. According to court documents, Peters was an above average student who left university with a double degree in law and economics. He had a successful career in Hong Kong, where he grew up, before moving to the U.S. with his second wife and young family to take a high-level position with a U.S. firm. Promoted to be managing director of the same firm, he ""achieved substantial financial rewards and maintained a high lifestyle."" However, around six years ago, his marriage broke down. His wife filed for divorce and told him that he wouldn't see his children again. According to court documents, Peters told one of three psychiatrists asked to examine him that ""that is where the story really starts."" Disillusioned with the banking industry, Peters moved back to Asia and started writing a book. Initially it was a historical novel set in Hong Kong, but morphed into a tale of revenge featuring a character called ""John Chan."" Peters told the examining psychiatrist that he as became more involved in his book he took on Chan's persona. According to court documents, ""he said the suburb of Mosman was like the Hong Kong peak and he wanted to create in his own mind what the nemesis in his book could have been doing."" During sentencing, the judge debunked suggestions that Peters was motivated by a confused reality and said the motive, beyond reasonable doubt, was extortion. ""The offender intended to place the very young victim in fear that she was going to be killed in order to ensure compliance with the directions in the demand. The offender did so in order to extort money from the victim,"" Judge Zahra said. The plan ultimately failed, the judge said, because police were called, the media was alerted, and Peters decided to abandon his efforts to extort money. Five days after entering the house, Peters flew from Sydney to Los Angeles before boarding a connecting flight to Louisville, Kentucky. He was arrested there on August 15 and later extradited to Australia. It remains unclear why Peters targeted an 18-year-old girl and it would be ""unproductive to speculate,"" said Judge Zahra. Outside the court, Bill Pulver said of his daughter: ""Maddie Pulver is a very, very special young lady who has handled herself with incredible poise and dignity. We're unbelievably proud of her."" Peters was sentenced to 13 years and six months in prison, with a non-parole period of 10 years.","Man who attached fake collar bomb to Sydney teen sentenced .

"(CNN) -- As the dust settled over Gaza and Israel on Thursday amid relative calm, analysts were weighing who were the winners and losers from the conflict. How do the main players in the region now stack up? Israel: The conflict represents a qualified victory for the country and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to CNN's Paula Newton. ""Just months before an election, Netanyahu's government targeted and killed Hamas' military leader, Ahmed al-Jaabari. Hundreds of airstrikes on Gaza followed, but, the real victory was possibly the combat debut of Iron Dome, the U.S.-funded defense shield that kept dozens of Hamas rockets from hitting Israeli civilians."" The Israeli military itself said the intensity of its airstrikes on Gaza meant it made a significant dent in Hamas' offensive capability. Over the eight-day conflict, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) looked to deplete some of the estimated 12,000 rockets it says Hamas has in its arsenal and destroy tunnels that are said to be used to smuggle weapons. But some analysts questioned whether the death of al-Jaabari really would benefit Israel. Elizabeth O'Bagy, from the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, told CNN she believed it was in fact a mistake. ""It will lead to the proliferation of extremist groups (in Gaza), less control over rocket attacks and an increase in violence against Israel."" Analysis: Conflict shifts balance of power in the Middle East . Al-Jaabari controlled the militias with an iron grip, as Jon Alterman, for the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, pointed out. ""There were people in Hamas jails for firing rockets at the wrong time and al-Jaabari was one of the guys who put them in jail. Now when someone decides to take a pot-shot, they can take a pot-shot."" The background of the conflict took place in a region greatly changed since the last significant violence of 2008-09. In the UK's Daily Telegraph, Richard Spencer wrote that the Arab Spring had changed the situation significantly for Israel: ""Once it could afford to retreat into a default position of using overwhelming force in its own defence. After all, the Arab dictators it faced were equally unflinching -- in their rhetoric, at least, even if their actions often failed to match. ""Now Israel has a political base that is more divided and broad-ranging than ever before, and allies that are profoundly uneasy about its policies. And suddenly its neighbours are more pluralist. Hamas has new democratic allies abroad, in many cases allied to the U.S. -- Egypt, Turkey and Qatar prominent among them."" Israelis also have elections to think about . Even before the cease-fire was brokered, CNN's Nic Robertson observed: ""Where does this leave Israel? Simply put, while Israel is stronger militarily, it is in a weaker political position than it was in 2009. ""The long universal of the Arab world is a dislike of the Israeli state's treatment of Palestinians. In the past most Arab leaders were dictators, able to take a path far different from the views of the Arab street. Not any more. The region's new post-Arab Spring democratically-elected leaders are only too aware of the radical hardliners waiting for an opportunity."" Hamas: Despite the deaths and destruction in Gaza, the Islamist political movement that rules the territory has emerged emboldened from this conflict and its truce, according to some observers. ""Hamas has emerged stronger, it has consolidated its control over Gaza and it has gained now more legitimacy,"" said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center, told CNN. In the eyes of many Palestinian people, the militant leaders of Gaza took on Israel more boldly than ever before, firing rockets farther than ever before. And they may yet manage to get an easing of the Gaza economic blockade if a more comprehensive deal can be reached. Timeline: Israel-Gaza conflict . ""Look what they accomplished; they, rather than (President Mahmoud) Abbas, has put the Palestinian issue back on the international stage,"" says Miller. But with Al-Jaabari once a key figure in uniting rag-tag Hamas militias into organized brigades, counter-intuitively his death could mean more unrest ahead. ""He was an enforcer of peace as well as war,"" said Alterman, adding that his death may ""make it not only harder to reach a peace agreement, but it can make it harder to avoid war."" Fatah: Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah faction that governs the West Bank have lost much in this conflict, commented CNN's Newton. ""He was supposed to be the moderate peace broker who could finally forge a new deal with Israel. Now he cannot even claim to speak for all Palestinians and has shown that he has no leverage with Hamas, his archrival."" In an op-ed for CNN, Danielle Pletka, vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, said Hamas was not trying to destroy the state of Israel. ""Rather, it was to gain the upper hand in its endless and fruitless battle against Fatah for the Palestinian political mantle, ideally with the wind of the Arab world's Islamist revolutions at its back. That won't happen either. ""Egypt's Mohamed Morsy and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan are willing to lend rhetorical support and a few visits to Gaza, but they're never going to do anything substantial for Palestinians because they neither care enough about actual Palestinian people nor wish to queer their pitch with Europe and the United States."" Egypt: President Mohamed Morsy, clearly underestimated, deftly navigated what is a minefield of competing interests, including those of his own country. ""For a civilian president in Egypt perceived as a weak leader, he has, much to everyone's surprise, delivered,"" said Miller. Morsy proved he had the leverage necessary to bring Hamas to the table and get its leadership to agree to a cease-fire. Brokering that deal has given him much needed political capital in both the Arab world and the United States. Under former President Hosni Mubarak, the country's security forces had suppressed its own Islamists in the Muslim Brotherhood, even jailing Morsy at one point. That gave Morsy and his government influence with Hamas that Mubarak, a product of Egypt's military establishment, never had, said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations and Middle East analyst at the London School of Economics. ""Hamas listens to Mohamed Morsy,"" Gerges told CNN as the talks were still going on. ""Hamas looks up to Egypt now, at this particular stage, and that is why Egypt has emerged as the most important state vis-a-vis Hamas and Gaza."" Egypt's role in the talks was ""pivotal,"" he said. Egypt and Morsy proved 'pivotal' in Gaza cease-fire talks . Iran: The Islamic republic's nuclear program was one of the unspoken aspects to the conflict, according to world affairs columnist Frida Ghitis. ""Iran and its nuclear program also play a powerful psychological role, as observers and participants ponder the parallels between the latest Israel-Hamas conflict and a possible war in which Iran would stand against the U.S. or Israel, and perhaps other NATO allies. ""Little wonder then that Israel has received strong support from U.S. President Barack Obama -- who has repeatedly stated, ""We are fully supportive of Israel's right to defend itself from missiles raining on people's homes"" -- as well as from nations including the UK, Germany, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands and others. ""When Israelis see a rocket launched from Gaza, the thought that one day that rocket could carry nuclear materials burns hot in their mind."" But Iran's hand was arguably weakened after this episode as Israel's Iron Dome shot hundreds of its missiles out the sky, CNN's Newton said. While Israel has always accused Iran of smuggling weapons to Hamas through the Egyptian border, Iran today implicitly confirmed it. ""Gaza is under siege, so we cannot help them. The Fajr-5 missiles have not been shipped from Iran.

"(CNN) -- Palestinian Authority leaders renewed calls for unity with their Hamas-led rivals after the latest Israel-Gaza conflict, but the fighting may have left Hamas with the upper hand. The West Bank-based Palestinian Authority announced Thursday that the leadership of Hamas and its allies in the Islamic Jihad movement had decided to support the Palestinian Authority's bid for recognition as an independent state at the United Nations. But that statement was quickly contradicted by leaders of both Gaza-based factions, which have long opposed the gambit that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas launched last year. The Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas' Fatah party, has accepted Israel's right to exist, engaged in peace talks with the Jewish state and plans to renew its quest for the U.N.'s recognition of a Palestinian state this month. But the results of the recent fighting leave Abbas facing a ""cruel paradox,"" Middle East analyst Aaron David Miller told CNN. With conflict stopped, Israeli military touts successes . ""It was Hamas' rockets, not Abbas' diplomacy, that has once again put the Palestinian issue on center stage,"" said Miller, a longtime U.S. State Department adviser and a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington. Abbas may want to reach a negotiated settlement with Israel to end the decades-old conflict, but he's unlikely to do that ""if he can't preside over a unified Palestinian national movement."" Palestinian Authority spokeswoman Nour Odeh disputed any suggestion that the conflict has left Abbas with a diminished role. Abbas ""was in direct contact"" with the leaders of the rival factions during the Egyptian-brokered talks that led to Wednesday's cease-fire, she said, ""and being consulted on the details of this agreement, which we have to remember affects 1.6 million Palestinians that the president is still responsible for."" ""The idea of competition right now is really not on the national agenda,"" Odeh said. Winners and losers in wake of conflict . Hamas, an Islamist movement, does not recognize Israel's right to exist and has been branded a terrorist organization by the United States, European Union and Israel. It won legislative elections in 2006 and wrested control of Gaza from Fatah in 2007, effectively ruling the territory on its own. ""The Palestinian national movement looks like Noah's Ark right now. There are two of everything -- two constitutions, two presidents, two security services, two mini-states,"" Miller said. But after the most recent battle with Israel, ""It is Hamas's stock that is rising,"" he said. Israel and the United States refuse to deal with Hamas. But Daniel Ayalon, Israel's deputy foreign minister, told CNN late Wednesday that Israel would be ""very happy to talk to Hamas"" as long as it renounces terrorism and recognizes Israel's right to exist. But Rashid Khalidi, a Columbia University professor of Middle Eastern history and a one-time adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization, said Israel's continued expansion of settlements in the West Bank ""has made the Palestinian Authority look weak, feeble, unable to advance the Palestinian cause."" ""Most Palestinians are sick to death of this split,"" Khalidi told CNN. ""They understand that they are the weaker party, and that the split weakens them further."" He said the Palestinians need to unite to negotiate with Israel, and both Israel and the United States need to drop the ""fiction"" that they won't negotiate with Hamas. ""The world is dealing with Hamas,"" he said. ""The secretary of state is going to go to Cairo, and she's going to talk to the Egyptians and they will talk to Hamas. Israel is dealing with Hamas. Israel negotiated a deal for the release of Gilad Shalit,"" the Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza for more than five years. Israel treated the PLO the same way until the 1990s, when then-Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin ""was able to overcome that taboo,"" Khalidi said. ""It's time to overcome that taboo.""

"(CNN) -- Alabama's governor pledged to take quick action to clean up and rebuild his tornado-ravaged state in a speech to lawmakers Tuesday. The state will pay local communities' debris removal costs for 30 days ""to make sure there is no delay in getting this recovery and rebuilding process moving quickly,"" Gov. Robert Bentley announced, eliciting applause from legislators. ""We have spent much of the last six days in a rescue stage,"" Bentley said. ""And as much as we pray for additional survivors, we must now enter the recovery process."" Bentley spoke less than a week after an epic outbreak of violent weather killed hundreds as it ripped across the South. The National Weather Service has confirmed that more than 20 large tornadoes touched down in Alabama alone, leaving behind ""utter devastation in towns large and small,"" Bentley said. Officials there are still tallying the dead, clearing roads, trying to restore power and finding temporary homes for those displaced by the storms. Bentley said 38 counties in the state have been declared disaster areas by the federal government.. The state emergency management agency's latest death toll from the storms, released Saturday, was 250. The agency reported 2,219 injuries. The total number of people killed in five other states -- Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia -- during Wednesday's storms was at least 89. Alabama officials have said they would not release further death toll and injury reports until all the missing can be accounted for and final totals of the dead and injured can be confirmed. ""Our state has never seen a natural disaster of this magnitude,"" Bentley said. In Hackleburg, where authorities said a tornado tore through at 200 mph, the ""entire town is leveled,"" Bentley said. ""Many lives were lost, and the community's largest employer is gone,"" he said. On the opposite side of the state, in the town of Ider, Alabama, the situation is ""much the same,"" Bentley said. ""Not only did families there lose their homes, they lost chicken houses. Now, what that means is, they don't have any way to provide for their families. The story repeats itself in town after town,"" he said. Alabama poultry producers claim to have lost more than 2 million birds because of the storms, according to emergency management officials. Meanwhile, about 150,000 customers in the state remained without power Tuesday, emergency management officials said, and it could take another week to restore power in some areas. More than 400 displaced people were in 18 shelters. However, emergency responders say the actual number of people left homeless by the storms is much higher, because that total does not reflect the number of people taken in by family and friends. ""The road to recovery will be long and it will be hard. But I will share that road with you as it leads to a greater and a stronger Alabama,"" Bentley said.","NEW: ""We must now enter the recovery process,"" Gov. Robert Bentley says .

"(CNN) -- In November, dozens of armed men descended on a town in northern Nigeria and killed more than 100 people in a coordinated series of bombings and gun attacks. Many of those targeted were Christians, but police stations and mosques deemed ""insufficiently Islamic"" were also attacked. The town was Damataru, capital of the Nigerian state of Yobe, and the assailants belonged to the group Boko Haram, which translates from the local Hausa as ""Western education is outlawed."" In two years, Boko Haram has morphed from a radical Muslim sect into an insurgency responsible for dozens of attacks in Nigeria and beyond. Western intelligence analysts believe it is also developing links with al Qaeda affiliates in Africa. Boko Haram's targets include police outposts and churches, as well as places associated with 'western influence.' Its signature attack is a Karachi-style drive-by shooting from a motorbike, but this year it has begun a campaign of suicide vehicle attacks. In Maiduguri, the epicenter of the insurgency, there is a heavy military presence, with security checkpoints, sandbagged military positions and the scars left by bomb attacks. CNN.com: Nigerian officials condemn church attack . House-to-house searches are common. A senior military officer admitted last week that Maiduguri was a dangerous place, with ""miscreants"" slipping across the nearby borders with Chad and Niger. The Nigerian authorities seem unable to overcome Boko Haram -- and its growing footprint worries neighboring states and the U.S. Africa Command. Many Christians in northeastern Nigeria have fled their homes as the violence has worsened this year. A government offer of amnesty has had little effect; the deployment of 20,000 Nigerian troops to deal with ethnic and religious violence has failed to subdue the group. President Goodluck Jonathan has warned of ""swift and certain justice for criminal elements"" -- but analysts say that the inefficiency of the Nigerian state, rampant corruption and a heavy-handed military response may play into Boko Haram's hands. Until 2009, Boko Haram was a fundamentalist sect that espoused a Taliban-like interpretation of Islam. It did not advocate violence but it was hostile to Nigeria's Muslim leadership for its compromises with the 'infidel.' One day in July that year, police stopped some of its members on motorbikes -- and told them to wear helmets. Tempers flared. When the bikers resisted, police opened fire -- killing nine members of the group, according to witness reports collected by Shehu Sani, the President of the Civil Rights Congress. The Congress is an independent human rights group based in northern Nigeria, and Sani has had extensive contacts with figures in Boko Haram. In the days after that confrontation, hundreds of Boko Haram members were killed in clashes with security services. Among them, the group's charismatic leader Mohammed Yusuf, who died while in the custody of police, according to Sani. A secondary school dropout, Yusuf preached a strict application of Sharia law in northern Nigeria, arguing that the rich and connected had evaded Sharia despite its formal adoption by several Muslim-majority states in Nigeria. His message resonated with thousands of marginalized Muslims. Boko Haram can also draw on the deepening inequalities and religious divide between north and south Nigeria to help recruitment. After the crackdown, security services accused the group of planning an armed jihad in Nigeria by stockpiling weapons, including guns, explosives, and grenades, and purchasing land for paramilitary training. A significant number of members fled to neighboring Niger and Chad. But far from this being a victory for the security services, it brought Boko Haram members into contact with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). According to U.S. officials, the groups have since forged a partnership -- with AQIM sharing its evolving expertise in suicide bombing. ""We know that there are increasingly frequent contacts, and indeed, training of members of Boko Haram by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and that's of great concern,"" Ambassador Anthony Holmes, U.S. Africa Command's civilian deputy said earlier this month. Algerian officials, long concerned at the growth of AQIM, have voiced the same concerns. And last week a senior Nigerian military officer told Reuters: ""Boko Haram is al Qaeda."" In a global poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2009, a higher percentage of Nigerian Muslims (54%) stated they had confidence in Osama bin Laden than in any other Muslim-majority country. Boko Haram's muscle was enhanced a year ago when the group freed at least a hundred of its members from a prison in Bauchi in northeastern Nigeria. This year, Boko Haram has begun looking to new horizons, including the capital, Abuja. In June, the group carried out its first suicide bombing -- attacking the National Police headquarters. Two months later -- in a dramatic escalation of its campaign -- it launched a suicide car bombing against the U.N. headquarters in Abuja, killing 23. Boko Haram released a video featuring a martyrdom recording by the suicide bomber in the attack -- a-27-year-old from Maiduguri -- who praised Osama bin Laden and referred to the U.N. headquarters as a ""forum of all the global evil."" The U.N. attack, Sani says, was likely an attempt by Boko Haram to embarrass the Nigerian government. He believes the group's Shura Council decided that attacking the U.N. would create less of a backlash against the group than directly targeting American interests. ""When they attacked the U.N. headquarters, they had to pass the American Embassy to Nigeria just a few meters away, but they knew the implications of targeting American interests: that things would get worse for them,"" Sani said. U.S. officials believe some of those involved in that plot may have also trained with the al Qaeda linked militant group Al Shabaab in Somalia. In September, U.S. military officials warned that Boko Haram, AQIM, and al Shabaab might make common cause in targeting American interests in the region. Earlier this month, the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria warned that Boko Haram may be plotting to target three luxury hotels in Abuja. Al Qaeda in West & Central Africa? According to Shehu Sani, the group's agenda is still primarily local. ""The origin of their fight is with the government of Nigeria and the security agencies,"" Sani said. ""They want an end to the government's campaign against them and for them to pull troops out of northeastern Nigeria."" Analysts believe some Boko Haram members might be tempted by payouts made by the government to militants in the Niger Delta in recent years in exchange for their laying down arms. But one attempt at mediation has already ended in disaster. In September, a leading figure in Maiduguri connected to the group who sat down for talks with a former president of Nigeria was assassinated within 48 hours. Sani helped set up the meeting; he says he has since received death threats himself. Security analysts are concerned the group may try to target Nigeria's oil industry in the Niger Delta, destabilizing supplies from the world's eighth largest oil exporter. Over the past decade, pipelines and rigs in the area have been repeatedly targeted by the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND). The area is predominantly Christian and western intelligence sources say it would be difficult for Boko Haram to establish a presence there. Human rights activists say for now, the authorities' crackdown in northern Nigeria may have the effect of radicalizing more Muslims. According to Sani and others tracking the group, Boko Haram has drawn its membership mainly from disaffected youngsters and unemployed graduates. But it has also gathered support among the professions. Human Rights Watch says it has documented serious abuses by Nigerian police, including extrajudicial executions against suspected members of Boko Haram. ""The security forces are punishing people who they believe provide shelter to Boko Haram, but if you reveal the identity of Boko Haram fighters, then they'll kill you. You can see the dilemma,"" Sani said. ""If Nigerian government can't solve the problem, and the violence continues, then this virus will spread across the countries of west Africa and central Africa, emboldening the group and boosting its membership, making it a well-established part of al Qaeda,"" he said. Today the Nigerian media, like its politicians, are full of advice to the government on how to tackle Boko Haram -- from an even tougher military response to renewed attempts at dialogue, another amnesty and a more comprehensive effort to address the root causes of the violence. Neither carrot nor stick has worked so far.","Many of those targeted are Christians .

"(CNN) -- Last week, I sat down with colleagues and students to an early Thanksgiving meal prepared by my university's cafeteria. Along with our winter greens, butternut squash, brussels sprouts with apples and bacon, and pumpkin grits, we ate a roasted ""heritage breed turkey."" Accolades ensued: ""To me, all turkeys taste the sameâexcept for this oneâI can tell the difference,"" said William Payne who works in the medical school. The local greens from Georgia farms were ""really, really tasty,"" said a first-year student from the Atlanta area and her friend from Tianjin, China. The meal was Emory University's fourth Heritage Harvest Feast. The turkey that had everybody talking was a Narragansett,  a heritage breed native to Rhode Island. Along with Bourbon Reds, Narragansetts have been saved from extinction by farms like the Good Shepherd Poultry Ranch in Kansas, where Emory's turkey's come from, and by the efforts of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, a nonprofit dedicated to conserving rare breeds of livestock. The Heritage Harvest Feast is not only an occasion for thanks and a good meal, but it also is part of a commitment to building a more sustainable food system. Sustainability depends on variety. To preserve variety, we need to grow it and want to eat it! Thanksgiving advice, recipes, solidarity and sanity . Genetic variety in our food system is the result of thousands of years of farmer and consumer choices, in itself a precious human heritage. Adapted to local climates and all kinds of diseases and pests, the seeds and breeds that have survived until the present day are often hardier, more resilientâand can be more nutritious as well. As our planet warms and growing seasons shift, new patterns of flood, drought, frost and pests will stress our food system. When farmers plant large tracts of one variety--perhaps one that is bred to grow faster, is suited to mechanical harvest and travels well--or consumers demand only one breed of animal, our food supply is vulnerable. In the 1970s, for example, a disease wiped out more than 50% of the corn crop in some states, because those areas were planted to one single corn variety. Crop uniformity is the enemy of resilience. The hardy traits of older, heirloom varieties provide a safety valve. They allow us to breed new, more resilient crops using traits we don't even know we need until disaster strikes. But can we count on those genetic riches surviving today? Around the world, the loss of species to extinction is progressing faster than ever. And this loss includes our seed varieties. Studies using USDA crop lists from 1903 estimate that only 6-7% of the nation's named commercial varieties remained available by the 1980s. We lost, for example, 86% of our apple varieties and 92% of our lima beans. Cary Fowler and Pat Mooney in ""Shattering: Food, Politics, and the Loss of Genetic Diversity"" report that 93% of our lettuce varieties, 81% of our tomatoes, 93% of our carrots and 91% of watermelon varieties are extinct. To be sure, commercial seed catalogs now list many new hybrid crop varieties. But these hybrid seeds do not contain the range of genetic variability of the older, open-pollinated seeds (that is, plants pollinated by birds, insects or wind that ""breed true"") that reflect centuries of selection. This is a staggering loss of our precious genetic heritage. The best guarantee of a safe food supply as we head toward an uncertain global future is a large number of diverse food producers growing a wide variety of healthy seeds and breeds. But to save this rich biodiversityâof potatoes or turkeysâthere needs to be a market. Fortunately, there is a growing awareness of the importance of heirloom varieties, and local farmers markets and even some grocery stores feature multiple varieties. Savoring distinct flavors in special types of vegetables, fruits and meats encourages us to recognize, enjoy and support farmers who are preserving variety. iReport: Who's at your Thanksgiving table? That's why Cora and her husband, Simon, (who came from the chemistry department to our early Thanksgiving dinner) grow a garden with heirloom vegetable varieties. And they order a heritage breed turkey for Thanksgiving even though it costs more. They are willing to spend extra money because, says Cora, ""it's tastier, and we'd rather eat meat less often and not get mass-produced and flavorless turkey."" So, as you plan your feasts this holiday season, can you add an heirloom vegetable? Try a local specialty? Seek out a heritage breed? Our food future may depend on it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy F. Barlett.","Peggy Barlett: Early Thanksgiving dinner drew raves for tasty heritage turkey served .

"(CNN) -- Just six months after leading Chelsea to European Champions League and English FA Cup glory Roberto di Matteo has been sacked by the English Premier League club. He was sacked just hours after Tuesday's 3-0 defeat to Juventus left Chelsea on the brink of becoming the first defending champions to be eliminated in the group stages of the Champions League. Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who took over the club in 2003, is now looking for his ninth manager, with all the indications a replacement has already been found. Blog: Was Di Matteo the architect of his own downfall? ""The club will be making an announcement shortly regarding a new first team manager,"" said a statement on the Chelsea website. Third in the English Premier League despite a series of injuries to key players, Chelsea is on a run of just one win in five league matches and face league leaders Manchester City on Sunday, with the league champions four points ahead of the London side. Explaining the Italian's dismissal, Chelsea thanked Di Matteo for his""huge contribution"" but also said the team's results had ""not been good enough"". ""The owner and the board felt that a change was necessary now to keep the club moving in the right direction as we head into a vitally important part of the season,"" added the Chelsea statement. Managerial change . In order to reach the last 16 of the Champions League, Chelsea must beat Danish side Nordsjaelland in the final round of group matches and hope Ukrainian group leaders Shakhtar Donetsk defeat Juventus. Former Chelsea midfielder Di Matteo took over first team duties following the sacking of Andre Villas-Boas in March 2011. The former West Bromwich Albion manager guided Chelsea to English FA Cup success, beating Liverpool 2-1 in the final, before leading the west London club to its first Champions League triumph in May. The penalty shootout victory over Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena helped convince Abramovich that Di Matteo deserved the job on a full-time basis and the Italian was handed a two-year contract in June 2012. Eight full-time managers have worked under Abramovich since he took control of Chelsea in 2003. Tuesday's defeat came off the back of Saturday's 2-1 loss at Di Matteo's former club West Brom. John Terry . Despite attacking players such as Brazilian playmaker Oscar and Belgian forward Eden Hazard impressing since arriving during the last preseason, Chelsea has struggled defensively. Key has been the recent absence of captain John Terry who had to serve a four-match ban for racially abusing an opponent before picking up a knee injury in a 1-1 draw against Liverpool earlier this month. With Terry in and out of the team, Chelsea has conceded 20 goals in its last 10 matches in all competitions. Much of Di Matteo's tenure was overshadowed by the racism scandal which engulfed Terry and the club. Former England captain Terry was cleared by a London magistrate's court of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand but was then found guilty by an English FA tribunal. Di Matteo, whose team began the season with a 4-1 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the European Super Cup, has also failed to bring the best form out of Fernando Torres -- the striker who Abramovich splashed out $80 million to recruit from Liverpool. Spain international Torres, who won the golden boot at this year's Euro 2012 tournament, has scored just four goals this season and looks a shadow of the player who shone during four seasons at Anfield. Media reports are already linking Torres' former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez with the job. The Spaniard has been out of work since being sacked by Inter Milan in January 2011. Former Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola is also being linked with the Stamford Bridge vacancy. Guardiola led Barca to 14 titles in four years before stepping down from the Nou Camp hotseat at the end of last season. The former Barca captain is currently on sabbatical in the United States.","Chelsea face struggle to qualify for knockout stages of Champions League .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Prosecutors are expected to rest their case Friday in the seven-week-long trial of model Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend and two doctors. They are expected to call their last witness Friday afternoon. And defense lawyers said they will likely not call any witnesses. Smith's boyfriend Howard K. Stern and two doctors are on trial for allegedly conspiring to feed her drug addiction and using false names to obtain the drugs. One expert witness for the defense, a pain medications expert, has already testified for the defense. Dr. Perry Fine testified early because of scheduling issues. Jurors watched a video on Wednesday of the Playboy model singing, kissing and bathing with her infant daughter just two months before her February 2007 death. ""Momma didn't mean it, I'm sorry,"" Smith said when Dannielynn began crying as she washed her face. Prosecutors showed the 13-minute video to support their argument that Smith's speech was slurred and her mind was groggy from drugs. The defense does not deny Smith took a lot of drugs, but they contend Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor were treating her for chronic pain that other doctors had also diagnosed. ""If she's being treated for pain, it's not illegal,"" Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry said last week. Judge Perry has suggested several times in recent weeks that the prosecution had fallen short in proving the core of its case, including that Smith was a drug addict. The judge told the lawyers on Monday that he was considering dropping some of the charges before the case goes to the jury. ""I expect some charges will likely survive in some form,"" Perry said. The three are charged with a conspiracy to provide drugs to a known addict and using false names on prescriptions for Smith. They are not charged in her death, which a Florida medical examiner ruled was from an accidental overdose of a sleep aid, a lethal mix of prescription drugs and a viral flu. While much of the past seven weeks have been tedious testimony about medical practices and drugs, the video shown in court Wednesday captured the jury's full attention. Smith and her 2-month-old baby sat naked in a large tub in the Bahamas home where she spent most of her last months. The mother softly sang to her baby and kissed her repeatedly. ""Love the water,"" Smith said to her child. Stern smiled several times as he watched the video from his seat at the defense table. ""Come on, Danny, do something good,"" jurors heard Stern say from behind the camera. ""Show us you're a star."" In one moment, Smith and Stern seemed to joke about their rivalry for the baby's attention. ""Say 'Mommy,'"" she told the baby. ""Say 'Daddy,'"" he said. They repeated that exchange several times before Stern said ""She made a funny face, she pointed to the camera.""","Defense lawyers says they will not call any witnesses .

"New York (CNN) -- The shooting death of a New York City shopkeeper Friday is raising the possibility of a three-time killer on the loose, police said. A .22-caliber handgun is the link. ""The same gun was used in all three murders,"" said Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. But police are stopping short of calling the multiple deaths the work of a serial killer. ""It's too soon to tell,"" Browne said. ""There are similar things in each case, but that determination hasn't been made yet."" Ballistics tests on shell casings found at the crime scene indicate the .22-caliber gun used in the slaying of Vahidipour Rahmatollah, 78, at his clothing store in Brooklyn last week is the same weapon used since July in the killings of two other small business owners, also in Brooklyn. ""That doesn't say it's the same person who fired the gun, but that's the working premise, that it's the same shooter,"" Browne told CNN. Rahmatollah was shot three times in the head and torso and killed inside his women's clothing store called, She-She Boutique, according to police. Police said Sunday they wanted to talk with four ""unknown individuals"" seen on videotapes from security cameras in the area of the store between the time Rahmatollah was last known to be alive and the time his body was found. ""Detectives want to question them about what they may have observed because of the time of day and their proximity to the homicide scene,"" a police statement said. Forensic tests show the same weapon was used in the August 3 shooting death of Isaac Kadare, 59, who was killed in his store, Amazing 99 Cent Deals. Police said he was shot in the head. On July 6, Mohammed Gebeli, 65, was gunned down in his clothing shop, Valentino Fashion Inc. Besides being shot in the head, police said Gebeli was also stabbed in the neck. There are distinct similarities in the way the victims were positioned after their deaths. Law enforcement sources said each victim's body was pulled away from the stores' front windows and either covered by clothes or hidden by merchandise. ""It's consistent with hiding anything from immediate view of the street, so that it's not seen from someone passing by right away,"" said one source. ""It may have been done to give the killer more time to make (his) getaway,"" added another police source. Browne said all three victims have ties to the Middle East, but for now, investigators aren't drawing any conclusions. ""There's nothing to suggest a bias,"" Browne told CNN. However, a task force set up to help solve the first two slayings has now been expanded to add someone from the hate crimes task force, Browne added. ""Some of the victims had an Arabic or Persian background, one was Jewish, but there was no one religion or ethnicity, although that might not be obvious to the killer,"" Browne said. Some money was taken in the first two killings, raising the possibility of violent robberies. However, investigators said it's not yet clear in the most recent killing whether Rahmatollah's store had any money missing. ""We're still trying to determine that,"" Browne said. The FBI's website defines serial killers as ""three or more killings ... having common characteristics such as to suggest the reasonable possibility that the crimes were committed by the same actor or actors."" However, Paul Callan, a former deputy chief in the Brooklyn district attorney's office who helped prosecute the ""Son of Sam"" case in the '70s agrees with the NYPD's hesitation to label the three shopkeepers' deaths as serial killings at this stage. Enough isn't known, according to Callan, who is also a CNN legal analyst. ""Police will resist that characterization because they will be fearful that high publicity will alert the killer and impede the investigation,"" Callan said.","Three Brooklyn shopkeepers have been shot and killed since July .
The most recent killing occurred Friday .
The same gun was used in all three slayings, a police official says ."
"(CNN) -- The family that robs banks together stays together. That's what southeastern Texas authorities allege about a father, son and daughter, tying them to a pair of bank robberies in that state and possibly five others in their native Oregon. Now, weeks after those heists occurred, the three suspects are in the Fort Bend County Jail. In a press release issued Friday, the Fort Bend County, Texas, Sheriff's Office identified the three as 50-year-old Ronald Scott Catt, his 20-year-old son Hayden Scott Catt and his 18-year-old daughter Abigail ""Abby"" Catt. Before their arrests, authorities concluded they'd seen the father and son before -- in disguise -- in surveillance video shot October 1 in and around the 1st Community Credit Union in Katy. The footage shows a younger man with a fake mustache and an older one in a painter's mask, with both wearing dark sunglasses, hats and orange traffic vests that had an ""X"" on the back. Other images, released by local authorities to media, showed the two suspects pointing small guns inside the bank and emptying cash out of a vault. After that robbery, detectives went to a Home Depot near the sheriff's office and found the distinctive orange vests. They followed up a short time later by going to another Home Depot about 14 miles north in Katy, near where detectives found stolen license plates between the October 1 robbery and one in August in nearby Harris County. The two male suspects in the latter robbery wore painter outfits and masks. ""While viewing videotapes at the checkout counters, they identified Hayden and Abby Catt purchasing the vests with their father's debit card,"" the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office said. ""Ronald Catt was later identified purchasing a painter's mask."" Ronald and Hayden Scott Catt were arrested November 9 at a Katy apartment and subsequently were ordered held on $140,000 bail. Abigail Catt -- who police say was the getaway driver in the October 1 bank heist -- was taken into custody later that day, with her bond set at $100,000. Following interviews with the suspects, Fort Bend detectives notified authorities in Oregon -- where the Catt family is originally from -- as they ""believe the suspects may be connected to five bank robbery cases in the Portland ... area,"" the sheriff's office said.","Two men in vests -- one in a fake mustache, another in a painter's mask -- rob a bank .

Rock revealed that when Romney contacted him for his support during his presidential campaign, he demanded answers first. Romney's team agreed, and the two sat down at the rocker's house with a campaign aide, two Secret Service members and a preapproved list of questions. Rock said he wanted to ensure that Romney was not ""just a rich guy who wanted to become president to out-do [his] dad,"" but someone of greater substance. ""I know what it's like to want to be better than your father,"" Rock told Howard Stern. ""Of course, I'm getting these 'I really want to help America [answers]' and I said, 'Cut the s**t, this is my living room; this isn't going to leave here.'"" Rock's main concern was his hometown, and once he had a commitment towards improving Detroit from Romney, he was all in. Kid Rock also shared the story of hosting a dinner party with fellow Detroit native Eminem. ""He came by the house, we had dinner, I cooked, just having a sophisticated kind of dinner,"" said Rock. He added of the rapper, ""He's a great family guy."" Though he's a vocal conservative, Rock also said that he's not into right-wing social politics. ""I'm into less government,"" he said, adding, ""If gay people want to get married, I don't give a f**k."" For Rock, disagreement in beliefs is fine, but failing to vote isn't. ""It's OK to stand for something... I've got friends who didn't vote. I want to smack them upside the head,"" he said. Kid Rock also hinted today on his Facebook page about an upcoming tour to support his forthcoming album Rebel Soul, out November 19th.

"(CNN) -- It would be easy to look at the current conflict, Hamas's militant fighters and smaller militias firing rockets in to Israel and Israel's crushing bomb and missile barrages, as a repeat of the 2008/2009 confrontation that killed more than 1,300 men, women and children. But it is not. Hamas is in a whole new place now. Still trapped in the crowded confines of Gaza's close packed neighborhoods where they were elected six years ago, only now with more friends outside. What has changed came in the wake of the Arab Spring that swept away some of Israel's old regional allies replacing them with leaders more sympathetic to Hamas. Israel and Hamas: How the conflict reignited . Gone is Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak whom Israel could and did rely on to blockade Gaza and squeeze Hamas in 2008/2009. Gone is the Egyptian state repression of freedom of speech that helped keep in check popular anti-Israel passion. Instead -- almost unthinkable four years ago -- Hamas's political leader holds a live news conference in Cairo, as Israeli shells strike Palestinian broadcasters in Gaza. If proof of Egypt's new role was needed, this was it. Egypt didn't just send Prime Minister Hisham Qandil to Gaza Friday with expressions of support for Gazans, but handed Hamas the bullhorn for propaganda when it needed it most. It is a remarkable turnaround. Khalid Meshal, Hamas's political leader, reveled in the spotlight, as he described a new, much more Hamas-friendly Egypt. Q&A: What is Hamas? But Egypt is far from alone in the regional revolution that begins to isolate Israel. The tiny Gulf state of Qatar has proven perhaps the influential political player, helping shape the region the way it wants. It has been seen to favor governments like that in Egypt with roots closely tied to the moderate Islamist Muslim Brotherhood of which the Palestinian Hamas is a radical off-shoot, but long aligned with Iran. Last month when the Emir of Qatar made an historic visit to Gaza promising $400 million of aid, it appeared he was trying to pull Hamas away from Iran and closer to Qatar. Qatar has been laying the groundwork for this for some time. When Hamas leader Khalid Meshal fled exile from the spiraling civil war in Syria earlier this year it was the Qataris whose offer of safe sanctuary he accepted. The Qataris have leverage in a way they never did in the past. So where does this leave Israel? Simply put, while Israel is stronger militarily, it is in a weaker political position than it was in 2009. Why Israel might hesitate to start a ground invasion . Egypt is not going to help blockade Gaza by constricting the Rafa border crossing, or by offering the same level of intelligence cooperation to Israel that they have in the past. Indeed, by some estimates Egypt's security services no longer have the same control over Islamist militants as they once did. Many have been released from jail and are quietly regrouping in the capital's sprawling suburbs or the sparsely populated and almost lawless Sinai desert bordering Israel. If the Israeli government had hoped to count on some shreds of Mubarak-era support, it will be disappointed. Today's Egyptian rhetoric, while falling short of abrogating the peace treaty with Israel, has very much taken a pro-Hamas line. The long universal of the Arab world is a dislike of the Israeli state's treatment of Palestinians. In the past most Arab leaders were dictators, able to take a path far different from the views of the Arab street. Not any more. The region's new post-Arab Spring democratically-elected leaders are only too aware of the radical hardliners waiting for an opportunity. Smuggling weapons to Gaza -- the long way .","Some of Israel's old regional allies replaced with leaders more sympathetic to Hamas .

"Galway, Ireland (CNN) -- One fateful day in October, life changed forever for Praveen Halappanavar. The engineer from India, who had settled in Ireland four years earlier with his wife, Savita, found himself suddenly a widower. Savita, a 31-year-old dentist, had died of blood poisoning after being denied an abortion for a miscarrying fetus under Ireland's strict laws, her husband says. Read more: Protesters in Ireland rally for abortion rights . A month later, Halappanavar is without his beloved partner and the child they both longed for -- and now fears the truth behind her tragic death may be lost, too. ""We've seen some tampering (with) the medical records -- basically some key information in the medical reports is missing,"" he told CNN. The missing notes concern the couple's requests to hospital staff for a termination, Halappanavar said. The Galway/Roscommon University Hospitals Group has declined to comment on his claim. Meanwhile, heath authorities have already launched one inquiry into Savita's death, and a second into the care of critically ill patients was announced by the Board of the Health Information and Quality Authority on Friday. Read more: Woman's death prompts abortion debate in Ireland . But whatever conclusions are reached, they won't diminish her husband's grief. Prospects for the couple, who married after meeting in India, had looked so bright. Together they had dreams of a beautiful future in Galway -- of children, forming a family. ""She was looking forward ... in a way she found she was in the right place,"" said her husband. ""She was well-organized too. She knew what she wanted in life. That's why she had decided to settle here in the long term."" When Savita, an attractive woman who loved to dance, became pregnant they were overjoyed. But then their ordeal began. Seventeen weeks into her pregnancy Savita began suffering severe back pain, and sought medical help. Read more: Who calls the shots on abortion laws? Doctors at the Galway University Hospital told her she was miscarrying and that her baby would likely die. Savita's husband says his wife, who was in extreme pain, asked for a termination, but was told that Ireland is a Catholic country and that the procedure could not be carried out while the fetus was alive. ""We requested a termination,"" he said. ""We wanted to go back, to go home and think about the next pregnancy because it was a planned pregnancy. We were so happy, we wanted to have babies."" Three days after the request for a termination was made, the fetus died and was removed. Four days later, Savita was dead from a blood infection. Read more: Pregnant teen dies after abortion ban delays her chemo treatment for leukemia . The circumstances of her death have prompted outrage in Ireland. Protests in support of Savita, held not just in Ireland but across the world, have urged the country's politicians to update its abortion laws and prevent similar tragedies. In Ireland, abortion is legal if the mother's life is at risk, which differs from her health being at risk, said Kitty Holland, a reporter with the Irish Times. With abortion a hot-button issue in Ireland, there has been political fallout from the controversy, too. Prime Minister Enda Kenny is under pressure to get Halappanavar to assist with a Health Service Executive inquiry into his wife's death, which was the first investigation set up. But Halappanavar says government steps so far have done little to inspire confidence, not just because officials took weeks to announce the inquiry, but also because when they did, three of the seven medical professionals on the investigation team were from the same hospital where his wife died. Although they have now been replaced on the team, other issues remain, Halappanavar said. ""We made a request for termination and there is no note of the request at all, and of the medical notes. The response from the doctor is not in the medical records either."" Asked what he thinks has happened to the information, Halappanavar has no answer. ""We don't know what has happened to it,"" Halappanavar said. ""It is strange that all other information is in there -- when we requested things like tea and toast, and when things like we requested an extra blanket, all that is in the medical notes."" Halappanavar says he will settle for nothing less than a full public inquiry -- one in which the wider health service, not just his wife's death, is investigated by independent experts. ""Every single person in the family asked me how could this happen in a place like Ireland in the 21st century, because it was just so simple,"" he said. ""When they knew the baby was not going to survive, why not think about the bigger life which was the mother, my wife Savita? And they didn't."" All he wants, he said, is the truth.","Praveen Halappanavar believes notes are missing from his wife's medical records .

"(CNN) -- Jihadist social media postings helped lead to the arrest and charging of four Los Angeles area men who were allegedly on their way to Afghanistan to train with the Taliban and join al Qaeda, federal officials said. They were also plotting to kill American soldiers and bomb government installations, according to a joint statement Monday by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles. One of the men, a U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan, encouraged two of the others to embrace violent Islamic doctrine by introducing them online to radical teachings, including those of deceased U.S.-born al-Qaeda imam Anwar al-Awlaki. The three exposed their connection to each other and their radical leanings explicitly on Facebook for over a year. And one of them detailed his intentions to participate in jihad in an online chat with an FBI employee. Another man was recruited at a later point to join the other three in their training. All four were charged Monday in a federal court in California, where three of them appeared for the first time. One of the men was already in Afghanistan, where he was apprehended, said U.S. attorney AndrÃÂ© Birotte Jr. and assistant director Bill Lewis from the FBI's Los Angeles field office in a joint statement. Sohiel Omar Kabir, Ralph Deleon, Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales and Arifeen David Gojali face charges of supporting terrorists who conspired to kill, kidnap or harm U.S. officers and other U.S. citizens, as well as bomb public places and government facilities. The Joint Terrorism Task Force in Riverside, California, arrested Deleon, 23, Santana, 21, and Gojali, 21, on Friday. Kabir, 34, is in custody in Afghanistan, according to the criminal complaint submitted to the U.S. District Court. At a detention hearing Monday, Deleon and Santana were ordered held without bond pending another hearing on December 3. Gojali requested a delay in his detention hearing, according to the FBI, and it was rescheduled for next Monday. He will be held at least until that court appearance. ""If you notice their ethnicities, they're all from a variety of backgrounds,"" David Bowdich of the FBI told reporters Tuesday. ""You have Philippino, Vietnamese, Mexican and Afghani. ""They all had one common cause,"" he added, referring to the alleged terrorism. Bowdich is the special agent in charge of the counterterrorism division at the FBI's Los Angeles office. According to authorities, Kabir is a naturalized U.S. citizen, who was born in Afghanistan and lived in Pomona, California. Deleon is a permanent U.S. resident living in Ontario and was born in the Philippines. Santana, a resident of Upland, is a lawful permanent resident, born in Mexico, who has applied for U.S. citizenship. Gojali, 21, of Riverside, is a U.S. citizen. The men face a maximum sentence of 15 years in a federal prison, if convicted. Kabir entered the U.S. Air Force on July 20, 2000, and was honorably discharged on December 17, 2001, said spokesman Mike Dickerson of the U.S. Air Force Personnel Center. He was an airman first class whose specialty was mobility technician -- a logistics post -- and he served at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, Dickerson said. Kabir also spent six months in Germany before arriving in Afghanistan last July, where he was preparing for the others' arrival. Deleon's attorney, Randolph Driggs of Orange, California, declined to comment Tuesday. The attorney for Santana also declined to comment Tuesday. The 74-page complaint details evidence collected against the men from online chats with FBI employees, travel documents, extensive contact with an informant, recorded conversations and their active social media accounts. Kabir, Santana and Deleon all posted radical jihad content to their Facebook page, the court documents allege. But Kabir's page in particular contained multiple links to and videos by al-Awlaki, videos depicting mujahideen fighters in Afghanistan, improvised explosive devices and suicide bombings. ""Deleon and Santana 'liked' postings on Kabir's Facebook page as early as May 2011,"" according to the court document. Kabir led Santana and Deleon to convert and join the Taliban, eventually leading to membership in al-Qaeda, the criminal complaint alleges. Santana recruited Gojali, the fourth man, to join them for the trip abroad to train as terrorists. Santana tipped off authorities about his militant inclinations when a customs officer at the border with Mexico questioned him about the jihad magazine ""Inspire"" he was carrying into the United States. He allegedly engaged in chat conversations with an FBI ""online covert employee"" and confirmed his desire to join al Qaeda. An unnamed ""confidential source"" working for the FBI won the trust of Santana and Deleon, according to the complaint, spent time with them and recorded many of their conversations. ""Santana and Deleon told a confidential source...that they planned to travel to Afghanistan to engage in ""violent jihad,"" the FBI and U.S. Attorney statement said. Their conversations with the confidential source revealed details of their ""travel logistics, including flights, passports and visas."" Kabir was to meet up with the three others and lead them to the Taliban, the court document said. Santana and Deleon allegedly pre-trained on a firing range and at a paintball center and took the confidential source along with them. Deleon told the confidential source he would quit school and withdraw his tuition money to help pay for the trip to Afghanistan, the criminal complaint said. Santana told the confidential source said he would like to drive a truck bomb, if he could do it with a big truck. ""Just drive it into like the baddest military base,"" he said, according to the document. ""If I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna take out a whole base."" CNN's Irving Last, Jaqueline Hurtado, Michael Martinez, Kyung Lah and Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.","One defendant served in U.S. Air Force at Davis-Monthan base in Arizona .

"London (CNN) -- For the last three years Greek society has suffered a prolonged period of economic and political crisis, which has been magnified by unprecedented austerity measures. The crisis has caused social destabilization, and dramatically affected the everyday lives of Greeks. Read more: Will Greek crisis leave banks stronger? Such measures have never before been implemented in any European Union country, and their political and social consequences have not been effectively calculated or, in many respects, even anticipated.

Read more: Austerity anger drives Europe strikes . These all caused significant delays in social, political and economic development, and did not allow Greek society to form and organize freely. After the fall of the last military junta in 1974, democracy in Greece was rapidly restored but it was not done so systematically nor thoroughly. Inevitably, structural dysfunctions formed.

Today, Greeks are experiencing a different social reality, characterized by uncertainty, insecurity, distress, disappointment and the inability to map out any form of future for their lives.

Even those who have an income cannot escape, as cuts continue and salaries and pensions are sliced by 40%. The monthly basic salary has now dropped from 739 euros in 2009 to 586 euros in 2012. In contrast, the price of essential goods has not dropped, and taxes have continued to rise.

Greeks are progressively losing their trust in a political system which consists mainly of the parties and politicians who have governed the country during the last 30 years. Read more: Greeks fearful of what will follow U.S. election . The elections earlier this year resulted in a coalition government in which the two significantly weakened opposing parties -- who have governed Greece since 1974 -- joined forces in order to renegotiate financial aid. But the most damaging aspect remains how Greeks collectively and repeatedly fail to identify any possibility of future improvement as their faith in current government drops. Instead, they perceive the implementation of austerity measures as an ongoing punishment, even revenge, from the European Union which will have no positive result and have no end in sight. Read more: Barroso: Europe federation 'unavoidable' ""The situation is tragic, not because of the economy but because of the fact that there is no future,"" a 55-year old journalist said. ""We have been convinced about that. There is no prospect. This is killing us."" Other people explained that the lack of an inspirational politician or party, coupled with the realization that the worst is yet to come, has made them alarmed how they can face each day. For many the main priority is how to make a living, not lose their jobs or how to get a job. They are grateful if they are still employed, although some note that employment conditions are becoming more exploitative. As a 46-year old teacher put it: ""Professionally, I don't know if I will have a job tomorrow and, personally, I have no desire to do anything joyful anymore. There is so much insecurity about everything."" Read more: Give Greece more time, says French PM . As Greek society experiences unparalleled social, political and economic crises, it is still uncertain what peoples' tolerance levels will be once further austerity measures -- and their consequences -- are implemented. Participants expressed agony about the future of their country, although they have also realized their own part of responsibility in this crisis (even if it was passive). Many are mindful of passing on their harmful mindset to their children. Until there are improvements to everyday lives, the structure of the state or political life, then Greeks will continue to feel angry, cross and cornered. This has led to the popularity of extremist groups such as the right-wing Golden Dawn. This crisis has triggered an unpredictable domino of incalculable social consequences -- and when and how it will end is still unknown. It remains to be seen if other European societies will follow the Greek path or if social stability can be restored.

"On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. This week, King traveled to Missouri to learn about the effects of cutbacks on an already struggling economy. St. Louis, Missouri, is having to cut back on bus routes. This could devastate some of the area's most vulnerable. BALLWIN, Missouri (CNN)  -- For Stuart and Dianne Falk, it is a two-bus, 45-minute trip into downtown St. Louis to head to the gym and to volunteer at a theater group. And it is a lifeline that ends Friday. ""To be saddled, to be imprisoned, that is what it is going to feel like,"" says Stuart Falk. ""It is going to feel like being punished for something we didn't do."" Stuart and Dianne Falk are both in wheelchairs. And the bus route that takes them downtown, and to one of the few tastes of personal freedom they have, is being eliminated because of a funding crunch. In all, two dozen bus routes are being eliminated outright effective March 30. Numerous other routes have been shortened or otherwise modified, including less frequent runs. Light rail service schedules also have been scaled back as part of an effort to close a $51 million funding shortfall.  Watch the Falks ride bus that is about to be eliminated Â» . The reasons for the funding crunch have little to do with President Obama, or the federal government at all for that matter. But there are several connections to the big national political debates of the past several months, stretching back to last fall. It was then that St. Louis County voters were asked to vote in favor of a small tax increase to add funding for bus routes and other mass transit operations in the bedroom communities surrounding the city of St. Louis. Backers were optimistic, but then saw the mood change as the struggles on Wall Street mounted, and dropping 401(k) balances made voters more stingy. It didn't help, these backers contend, that anger at the first installment of the $700 billion Wall Street bailout also was festering on Election Day. Now, St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley worries the cutbacks will have an adverse effect on an already struggling area economy. ""The worse case scenario to me is this, if we donÂ¹t get people to goods and services, that means businesses will close their doors, that means more jobs are lost,"" Dooley told us in an interview on a light rail platform in Clayton just outside the city. Dooley also said mass transit cutbacks make it harder to attract new businesses. ""We're talking about economic development and entrepreneurship: Who is going to come to St. Louis if you canÂ¹t get people back and forth to work?"" Dooley said. Efforts to get the state to help close the budget gap have failed. And while many of those affected see it is a perfect use of the federal stimulus funds the president says are meant to create and save jobs, such spending is not allowed. Stimulus money can be used for new mass transit capital projects, such as building new stations or buying new buses. But the money cannot be used for operational costs, meaning it cannot be used to keep existing routes open. ""No, I donÂ¹t think that is right. Of course, that is not right,"" is Dooley's view. ""I mean at the end of the day, it's about creating jobs and opportunity. ... Could the stimulus bill be of a great help to us? No question about it."" Without any cash infusion, Metro says it has no choice but to cut back from 9,125 bus stops to 6,801, significantly cutting back its reach into the outer ring of St. Louis County. Riding the buses this week offered a glimpse at the impact. At one stop Wednesday, a handful of developmentally disabled passengers boarded outside a local facility where they work. One told CNN she optimistic ""something will get done about it"" but said she isn't sure how she is supposed to get around after Friday. Kimberly Barge is a staff attorney at Paraquad, the gym where the Falks and other local disabled residents attend classes. ""People are frustrated, angry -- almost to the point of hopeless in some cases because there aren't many other alternatives for the disability community as far as transportation goes,"" Barge told CNN. Jean McPherson boarded the bus with her infant daughter. The 20-year-old is going back to school to get her high school diploma and though short on cash, she says she is now forced to explore buying a used car. ""I might end up losing my job or not being able to take my daughter to day care,"" is how she sees the consequence of her bus route being shortened so that it no longer stretches out to her community. ""You can't afford a car; that is why you use public transportation. So a lot of people are going to be in a bad situation."" And the impact goes beyond Metro riders. Some 200 drivers also are slated to lose their jobs . Shaking her head, Dianne Falk offers this analysis: ""That doesn't seem like what (President) Obama wants.""","For some St. Louis area residents, loss of bus service would be devastating .

"(CNN) -- Polish authorities said Tuesday they've broken up a plot to bomb Parliament, arresting two people and recovering enough materials to make a 4-ton bomb. The investigation began with an analysis of the Internet shopping list of convicted Norwegian extremist Anders Breivik. The primary suspect is a university lecturer with expertise in explosives who told police he wanted to bomb Parliament with the president, prime minister and other officials in attendance, according to Piotr Kosmaty, the spokesman for the appellate prosecutor's office in Krakow. Read more: Eye on Poland . Nationalist and anti-Semitic interests motivated the 45-year-old chemist, who was not part of any particular party or movement, Kosmaty said. Police arrested the man November 9. His identity was not released. During the arrest, police found guns, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, body armor and materials that could be used to make a bomb, including fuses, detonators and other materials, according to Lt. Col. Maciej KarczyÃâski, a spokesman for the Internal Security Service. The second suspect, arrested Tuesday, is believed to be a loose confederate of the university lecturer, Kosmaty said. He had enough material to quickly assemble a 4-ton bomb, Kosmaty said. Police did not release that man's identity either. Police identified another suspect but said that person poses no danger, Kosmaty added. It was not immediately clear if that suspect had been arrested. Read more: Norway killer Anders Breivik ruled sane, given 21-year prison term . The plot first came to light with an investigation into Breivik's contacts abroad, the Polish prime minister's office said Tuesday. Breivik, a right-wing extremist, exploded a fertilizer bomb outside the Norwegian prime minister's office on July 22, 2011, killing eight people. He then headed to a Labour Party youth camp where he killed 69 more people. He was convicted in June and sentenced in August to 21 years in prison. According to the Polish prime minister's office, Breivik bought some explosive components from Polish sources via the Internet, and an examination of those contacts led police to start their investigation. Prime Minister Donald Tusk congratulated police on the investigation, and said the plot should be a wake-up call for the country. ""Let this be a signal to all of us that we should be wise from harm, and renounce the language of hatred and violence in the public debate,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Maybe the wish you made on a shooting star during the Leonid meteor shower last week didn't come true. You could get a second chance Tuesday as forecasters expect to see a secondary peak in this year's shower. NASA is predicting as many as five to 15 meteors per hour, sometime between 12:30 a.m. and 3 a.m. ET. The first peak happened early Saturday. The Leonids occur in mid-November each year as the Earth passes through debris from the comet Tempel-Tuttle. ""For best meteor viewing, dress warmly and go to a location away from city lights. You want clear, dark skies. Lie flat on your back and look straight up, allowing your eyes 30 to 45 minutes to adjust to the dark. No special viewing equipment needed -- just your eyes,"" NASA astronomer Bill Cooke said on the agency's website. One thing stargazers have working to their advantage, assuming clouds don't muddle the festivities, is that the moon will be a waxing crescent setting before midnight, meaning its light is less likely to obscure the show. Thankfully, there's no chance the Earth will crash into the comet Tempel-Tuttle this year. It was last in the solar system's inner orbit and closest to our planet in early 1998, NASA explains, and it won't be back for another 33 years. But it left ""a stream of dusty debris,"" known as Leonid meteors, when it moved on through. Some of these remnants have drifted into the Earth's orbital path -- and when our planet passes by, the meteors seem to be falling from the area of the constellation Leo, the Lion. A super-Jupiter is spotted 170 light years away . More space and science news at CNN.com's Light Years blog .","The Leonid meteor shower occurs in mid-November each year .

"(CNN) -- After dealing with porcupine creatures, shape-shifters and planes full of crystallized bodies over five seasons, star John Noble is still having the time of his life on ""Fringe."" The cult favorite sci-fi series is in the midst of its final season on Fox, and classic episodes premiere Tuesday night on the Science Channel. Noble, who plays the brilliant (and occasionally mad) scientist Walter Bishop, recently spoke with CNN about his experience with the show and what fans can look forward to in the remaining episodes, leading up to a January 18 series finale. CNN: Are you nearing the end of filming now? Noble: My goodness, yes. We start filming our penultimate episode Tuesday morning. We're very close to the end, mate. CNN: And what's that feeling like? Noble: It just feels like an awful lot of work (laughs). We've still got a bit to do. It's an exciting thing feeling it all come together. There's a sense of closeness among the crew. We're here in Vancouver; it's our fourth year and, for the cast, our fifth year together. It's a bit odd. We are friends, so it's a bit sad. CNN: Meanwhile, you're getting a second life on the Science Channel. Noble: The thing about Science Channel is that they know ""Fringe,"" and they love it. The people I know there have watched from the beginning. It's not just another product. They've brought people in to talk about the science of it. We're in a very good second home. CNN: This season, do you feel that Walter is bearing the weight of a tremendous amount of pressure to put together this plan to fight the Observers? Noble: Yes, but I think the pressure's on everyone. All the key players have to come to some sort of conclusion, and that's the gift of these last 13 episodes. Every character is under pressure, if you can call it that. But it's a good journey. Every episode takes us further on the track to the finale. It's like writing a novel and having the chance to write the final chapter. The stakes are lifted every week for us. It's kind of exciting. CNN: We've seen so many major twists just this season. What was your reaction to learning that Peter was going to utilize the tech of an Observer and sort of become one himself? Noble: Well, it's pretty inspired, really. If you can't beat them, join them. Peter realized to combat these people, he would have to be on equal terms with them. It also gave Joshua Jackson a marvelous journey, which I think he's done splendidly. The fun thing is that both men are struggling with their arrogance and hubris in different ways. It's a very interesting story arc to play as well. You have Walter not trying to be so smart and cruel, and Peter wanting to be more so. So that's playing out really well. CNN: The show took a short break in shooting this season, as you had to take some time to take care of yourself. Are you doing better now? Noble: I'm doing very well, mate. We decided we needed to address an ongoing issue, which been going on a long time for me, which is that I don't sleep. Ultimately, given the load of travel, I was starting to hit a wall. We did what we could to correct that. We probably really didn't need to take as much time as we did. The management was terrific and said, ""Get it sorted out."" We're still going strong at this stage, so something worked. CNN: Have you enjoyed discovering Twitter? Noble: I thought it was time I got with it. (Laughs) I resisted for so long. I have no idea, to be honest, what I'm doing. I just go on every once in a while and say something, and it gets retweeted 6,000 times. It's an astonishing way of communicating. Thank God for that, because it takes away the tyranny of those who would withhold information. I remember I tweeted, ""Just saying g'bye to Georgina Haig. Lovely woman!"" I just had afternoon tea with Georgina (whose character died in a recent episode). That was taken as, she's gone forever. At that stage, she was still on the show, so I thought ""What have I done?"" I knew she was gone! You've gotta be careful! (Laughs) CNN: Walter is famous for his love of junk food. Do you have a favorite junk food on or off set? Noble: To survive, I try not to eat junk food. I hate to destroy the myth! On a film set, if you eat junk food, you'd finish around 400 pounds at the end of the first season. That's just the nature of the work. To destroy another myth, we don't actually eat it, because we can't. In 40 takes, you'd be absolutely bloated with Red Vines or whatever else you're having. We go through the motions of it and then have to get rid of it to so we can do another take. There was a bacon sandwich I thought was rather nice ... CNN: And what can fans expect as it comes to a close? Noble: I haven't read the final episode yet, but I know that (executive producer) Joel Wyman has put everything, and I mean everything, he's got into this. He's directing the last episode. I think it will be a masterpiece. I haven't read it, but I can't imagine anything less with the amount of heart he's put into it. Fingers crossed, but that's my prediction. I think it will be a masterpiece.","John Noble's cult show ""Fringe"" is nearing the end of its run .

"(CNN) -- ""Admit it, you're lonely. In the end, whatever you say, you must be so lonely."" So said the otherwise obliging radio presenter when he interviewed me about a recent BBC article in which I had defended singledom. Read more: Single? You're not alone . After so often being asked at dinner parties or other social occasions, why I was not partnered, I had realized that the question is innately hostile. If I were to ask a similar question, ""Why have you settled for him?"" or ""How did you get stuck with her? Are you so afraid of being alone?"" this would be thought rude and intrusive. Read more: Still single? What's the matter with you? Increasingly, we realize our relationships might not or need not endure. Increasingly, we are choosing to live alone. And yet being or remaining single still is still too often considered a deviant status, a second best, a failing. We don't need stories of how to become couples. They are legion. We need stories about how to be single. We need them whether we are gay or straight. We need them whether we are single by choice, through separation, divorce, or bereavement or because this, for you, is how life has turned out. Read more: The stigma of being single in Shanghai . I did not claim the single state to be superior to coupledom -- nor ever will -- but that it is equally valid, as capable of joy, variety, adventure and eventfulness. And, yes, as liable to loneliness -- with the proviso that no one is quite as lonely as those who fear being alone. And why wouldn't we fear being alone? Aren't we encouraged in this fear? Every pop song has it so. Every movie touching on human relationships. Every advert selling us not just the better life, but the best life. Your family fear for you. Your friends. Sometimes you might frighten yourself. You are nothing, nothing, nothing if you don't have someone else to complete you? And who would want to remain a spinster? Ugly word. The word is innocent: the connotations are unkind. Doesn't it suggest that, withered, alone and childless, you have failed at life? Rebrand the word. Call yourself Spinsta! Say it like Gangsta! Fight for your rights -- or simply vote, as 68% of single women did for one candidate over another, and let it be understood that your interests are not in the economy, but your own sex life and your need for free birth control. Read more: The two kinds of single women . But then single people are most often defined by their sex life, muddily defined at that. A single person is sexless, celibate, repressed -- or the very reverse. Historically, the bachelor has had an easier time of it, but who calls himself a bachelor these days? Doesn't it sound suspect? Perhaps these male spinsters have ""issues""? Aren't lying about their sexuality? Aren't they emotionally retarded? Might they be users, fearful of real commitment? They will be punished. They do not know how lonely they will become. Even the gay bachelor can no longer escape. That gay relationships need protection of the law is both right and necessary, but why is the true confirmation of our sexuality to be in thrall to the tyranny of coupledom that for so long did us so little favor? People have told me that I have been brave to speak out as a single person. It did not seem so. It seemed timely and necessary. It seems right to keep on saying so. But, yes, I must be lonely, mustn't I? Despite all I believe and say, I must be lying to myself. I must realize I am failing at life. Read more: Jim Friel's blog . So, more or less, thought a therapist on that radio show. Much of his work was with single people. Sad single people. There can be no other kind. They sit alone in bars -- or, at least, the men do: the women dare not go out at night. He counseled such people, and he had discovered that each had sustained a psychic wound in childhood. He led them to a point where they realized that only union with another person could heal that wound. He did not know me -- he did not know me at all -- but he suspected this was my story, this was my life, and how it and I might be healed. I told him that I did not spend my time alone at bars, that I had, as single people do, friends. I had relationships, that my life was full. I told him that I was no more wounded than any coupled person, and that I looked with horror at any advice that led me to use another person as a band-aid. I cannot deny that I am sometime sorrowful, sometime lonely. I am human. Simply being human, single or coupled, means one has, running though oneself, a vein of sorrow, but I wonder, when the coupled person considers that vein of sorrow within themselves if they are not tempted to call it, I don't know, ""My husband""? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jim Friel.","As single man, Jim Friel often faces ""innately hostile"" question: Why are you single?
