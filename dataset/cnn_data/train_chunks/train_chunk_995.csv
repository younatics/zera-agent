"Furniture removal man Jack Turley has been given the job of carrying Edinburgh to victory over four-time Pro12 champions Leinster after a shock call-up from head coach Alan Solomons. The New Zealander had spent most of the week moving sofas, cabinets and tables in and out of houses for the Green Van and Man company — and fully expected to play amateur rugby in his role as Heriot’s captain against Glasgow Hawks this weekend. On his first day’s training with Edinburgh, however, he was told by Solomons that he wasn’t there to simply make up the numbers and would, in fact, be starting at the Royal Dublin Showground – one of the citadels of world club rugby. Jack Turley will be starting at the Royal Dublin Showground when Edinburgh take on Leinster . Turley admitted his sudden elevation has been ‘like a whirlwind’, with injuries to five out of the six second rows at the capital club leading to him being thrown in against one of the greatest sides in the northern hemisphere. ‘It has been an incredible week,’ said the 25-year-old, who played in the same New Zealand Schools Select team as 2011 World Cup-winning All Blacks Israel Dagg and Sam Whitelock. ‘I have gone from playing 80 minutes for Heriot’s against Gala on Saturday to playing on Monday night for the Edinburgh A team against a touring Canadian side to training with the full Edinburgh squad on Thursday. ‘When the call came to train, I thought it was one of the boys pulling my leg. Then I was told I was starting and ever since then I have been trying to take in a lot of information in a short amount of time, get clued up on the systems and calls and everything. Edinburgh coach Alan Solomons said he is not thinking about offering him a professional contract yet . ‘It has been a bit of a whirlwind and I’ll try and do a bit of homework and get it all sorted for the match. ‘I know it is a real challenge to do well against Leinster at the RDS but I haven’t even had time to work out who I am up against or to worry about them as I am just trying to get myself in the right frame of mind for the game. ‘It’s going to be awesome. I have never even been to Ireland before and to start against Leinster is a great chance for me to see how I fare against the big boys. ‘I know this is sink or swim for me but it is a great, exciting opportunity — I want to take full advantage of.’ The chance to show what he can do in the professional ranks is a dream come true for Turley, who left Christchurch in 2012 to try and make it in Scottish rugby. Turley has been playing for an amateur club and working as a removals man to earn extra money . His first year at Heriot’s was disrupted by injury but this season he has been in great form and helped his club to the top of the BT Premiership. ‘Being a pro rugby player is what it is about,’ he admitted. ‘It is something I want to aspire to and part of the reason why I came over here to Scotland. ‘I know the game will be a lot faster than I am used to and more physical. I will have to rise to the challenge and show what I can do at this level.’ Turley said his work were delighted at his call-up and had no hesitation in giving him as much time off as he needed. ‘I do a few days removals work and do some coaching at Fettes College at times,’ said the Auckland-born second row. ‘It is mostly furniture removal and it is run by one of the guys at Heriot’s who started a small business and hired some of the guys to help shift things. ‘The boss plays out of Heriot’s and he was just as chuffed as I was and has given me a few days off.’ Edinburgh's squad has been ravaged by injuries, meaning they have no choice but to turn to Turley . Solomons admitted he was not thinking of offering Turley a pro contract at this stage, even if he did well against Leinster, as he had not seen enough of him play. ‘We have five injured locks, with Ollie Atkins failing a fitness test on Wednesday, so we really don’t have anywhere else to go but Jack,’ said the Edinburgh boss. ‘I saw him play against Gala and he had a reasonable game there and then on the Monday night I thought he played pretty well for the Edinburgh A team against Ontario Blues. ‘He had a bit of an instructive morning with me on Thursday, going through the attack stuff, and going through the defence stuff with (assistant coach) Omar Mouneimne. ‘He’s an intelligent guy but this will be a test for him, especially coping with the physical level of the pro game. ‘There should be no expectation on him. He’s just got to go out there, give it a crack and see what happens.’ Leinster V Edinburgh at RDS Showground Friday. Kick-off 7.35pm.

"Australia can still win next year's World Cup despite their off-field turmoil, All Blacks fly-half Colin Slade has warned. Slade coolly slotted an overtime conversion to edge New Zealand to a 29-28 Bledisloe Cup victory on October 18, only to drop out of Steve Hansen's squad on Dan Carter's return to fitness. The Crusaders playmaker admitted he felt sympathy for the Wallabies, whose coach Ewen McKenzie confirmed his resignation in the wake of that Brisbane defeat.

Quade Cooper looks to pass on the ball during Australia's training session on Friday . The Kurtley Beale text message saga led to Di Patston quitting the Wallabies claiming stress problems, with McKenzie forced to refute allegations of an affair with the team business manager. Slade can heap yet more misery on Australia when he leads the Barbarians line at Twickenham on Saturday, but he is adamant new coach Michael Cheika will quickly whip the Wallabies into World Cup shape. 'They are definitely still contenders next year,' said 27-year-old Slade. 'They showed in that last Test they're not far away at all. 'We've never taken them lightly, whatever the media have said, we've always respected them. 'They've got a hell of a team, a lot of quality individuals. 'They are having a tough time at the moment, but I tell you what, situations like that can really galvanise the team in the long-term. 'They've got a new coach in so they will build from there. 'And they'll be a massive force by the time the World Cup comes, absolutely no doubt. The Australia squad line up for a squad photo at Twickenham on Friday . An overview of the famous Twickenham stadium as The Australia squad take part in a training session . 'It's obviously disappointing for them, the things that are happening at the moment, but I don't want to take any responsibility for adding to that with that conversion.' Slade remains on standby for New Zealand's northern hemisphere tour, despite missing out on initial selection owing to Carter's recovery from a litany of leg problems. Carter's Crusaders club-mate remains as unfazed as he is well versed in bowing to the world superstar's superior standing. When New Zealand lifted the 2011 World Cup on home soil, Stephen Donald had to be dragged away from a fishing trip to solve a fly-half injury crisis. Slade said such a last-minute reprieve proves it is never worth giving up on earning a recall. 'What's a blessing can also be a curse I suppose,' said Slade of his long-standing rivalry and friendship with Carter. 'I feel honoured to have played alongside and with Dan for so long. But at the same time selection comes down to numbers. Australia coach Michael Cheika orders instructions during the training session . 'And with him locked up in that in any team because he's such a world-class player it does leave one less spot for me. 'That's just the nature of rugby: unfortunately they can't take everyone and I got squeezed out of the tour. 'Myself and a couple of others will stay around after the weekend just in case of any injuries, we'll watch the England game and then go home. 'What happened in 2011 with Stephen (Donald), those situations can arise and you've got to be ready at any time. 'So you've got to prepare, work hard and stay ready just in case. 'You can't just cruise or fade away: you've got to work as hard as you can to get into that team. 'Even if you miss out, hopefully you're not too far away. 'If that situation happens again, you've got to be ready to step up.'","Australia lost to New Zealand 29-28 in the Bledisloe Cup on October 18 .

"Sam Burgess will be unveiled as a Bath player on Thursday, and the man tipped to become ‘the greatest rugby star on the planet’ will speak about his decision to switch codes in a bid for World Cup glory. The 25-year-old will hold a press conference at the Recreation Ground less than a month after guiding the South Sydney Rabbitohs to a historic NRL Grand Final victory, which saw him shatter his eye socket in the first minute but go on to earn the man-of-the-match award and, with it, a place in league folklore. The man they call ‘Slammin Sam’ needed five metal plates inserted to reconstruct his face following the dramatic triumph over Canterbury Bulldogs. Scroll down for video . Sam Burgess (right) said goodbye to  older brother Luke and girlfriend Phoebe Hooke at Sydney Airport . Burgess and his girlfriend Hooke were sad to part from one another on Tuesday . The surgery forced him to delay his return from Australia but enabled him to collect the international rugby league player of the year award in person; becoming the first Englishman ever to do so. The former Bradford Bull was lured to Bath by a big-money offer and the prospect of following in the footsteps of Jason Robinson — the only Englishman to switch codes and win the union World Cup. With less than a year to prove himself ahead of next September’s global tournament many doubt the 18-stone former loose forward — being lined up to play inside centre — can make the transition in time. His tackling technique, in particular, is likely to be heavily scrutinized. Robinson is not among the doubters. ‘It took me three months after my switch to play for England and get on a Lions tour and I’ve no doubt Sam can do the same,’ said the 2003 World Cup winner and former Wigan great. ‘He’s already got the title as the best player in rugby league and has all the ingredients to do the same in rugby union. I think Sam will play in the World Cup. I certainly think he can be the best-ever cross-code player.’ The two brothers embraced before Burgess jetted off on a flight to the UK to join his new club Bath . Burgess holds hands with his girlfriend, and the pair will be reunited in a couple of weeks . SAM BURGESS @SamBurgess8 . ‘Well, I’ve arrived in bath and been for a look around. What a wonderful town. Quite jet lagged now but powering on. What Restraunt tonight??.’ Burgess was happy in his new surroundings on Wednesday after flying in from Australia . The RFU insist they played no part in Burgess’s switch but Stuart Lancaster — a huge admirer of league — is clearly excited by the prospect of working with such a talent. England’s midfield is still not settled, with injury and lack of form hampering Lancaster’s attempts to forge a tried and trusted partnership. Burgess could yet be the answer to his prayers. ‘Having spoken to him, his mind-set obviously is to make the World Cup squad,’ Lancaster said. ‘We have some very good centres who will have something to say about that and he will have to learn quickly, but he’s mentally strong. If he can learn the game he’ll bring an invaluable amount to the group. He is a very, very good player and an impressive person. ‘What stands out for me is his mental toughness and strength, the desire to dominate his opposite number. It will be fascinating to see how he goes.’ Those who have worked with Burgess speak of an intensely competitive individual, even by the standards of professional rugby, with an almost superhuman capacity to absorb pain and a relentless work ethic which drives others around him. New Zealand-born actor and Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe — who signed him from Bradford Bulls in 2010 — described Burgess as his ‘sparkly-eyed man’. Without doubt, Burgess is a leader of men.

Hooke will fly to Bath in two weeks time to join boyfriend Burgess as he begins his rugby union career . Burgess said his loved ones  are excited for him joining Aviva Premiership side Bath . The death of his father, former professional league player Mark, at the age of 44 is said to have had a profound effect on Sam, along with his three younger brothers, who he has left behind at the Rabbitohs to forge a new career in union. ‘Sam has made himself a legend in rugby league,’ said Bath owner Bruce Craig, a key player in the deal to bring Burgess to the Rec. ‘It was absolutely extraordinary that he was able to play 79 minutes with a broken cheek bone and be man-of-the-match as well. He is a warrior who is going to create huge interest in the English game. It can only be good for rugby.’ His arrival is set to attract unprecedented attention on Bath — an upwardly mobile club with a great history and an increasingly rosy future. On Tuesday, Wallaby scrum-half Will Genia indicated his interest in joining Burgess at Bath. ‘Obviously the chance to possibly play with someone as special a player like that is definitely appealing,’ Genia said. Burgess (far left) with mother Julie and brothers Luke, George and Thomas after the 2014 NRL Grand Final . The Bath star celebrates with Russell Crowe after the Rabbitohs won the NRL Grand Final match in Sydney . ‘You saw the type of character he was in that NRL grand final. You always want to play with guys who are inspirational and make such an impact.’ But what do those already at the Rec think of his pending arrival? ‘When (Bath coach) Mike Ford spoke to me about signing him the first thing he mentioned was his character,’ said Bath captain Stuart Hooper. ‘He felt he would fit into our Bath system. I’m excited about welcoming him and helping him learn our sport and ultimately become a very successful rugby union player. I don’t think there’s a danger of his arrival disrupting us. We’ve got numerous people who could be involved with England through to the World Cup. ‘If everything goes to plan and England win they will all be superstars. We’re aware of this. You have to deal with it. It’s part and parcel of wanting to become a great club.’ Of course, a pocket of union diehards will dismiss Burgess’s chances out of hand. Time is against him and history suggests more converts fail than succeed. But such was his league stature, and such is England’s desire for him to make the grade, it would be folly to write off his chances of making the World Cup; despite the inconvenience of a depressed fracture of his cheek delaying his start until the turn of the year. Hooke admitted that 'there were a few sponge baths' as Sam recovered from his on-pitch clash . Burgess poses after being awarded rugby league's International Player of the Year award last week . His brutish carrying, sublime off-loading and incredible work-rate has drawn comparisons with Sonny Bill Williams, who switched codes at short notice and became an All Black World Cup winner in 2011. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Burgess leapfrogs Brad Barritt, Billy Twelvetrees and Kyle Eastmond to claim the England No12 jersey. ‘He won’t take much bedding in because his size and the threat he poses in league make him a completely different kettle of fish,’ said another successful cross-coder, Saracens and England winger Chris Ashton. ‘Sam’s an exception. If you watch him play league, he’s the best player on the pitch every single time. There aren’t many players like that — he’s up there with Sonny Bill Williams.’ Time will tell. But whatever Burgess achieves in union, and however long he sticks around, the mark he has left in Australia, where league is king, is indelible. ‘People talk about Sam becoming the greatest English forward to ever come to Australia,’ said Rabittohs chief executive Shane Richardson. ‘The reality is he could be one of the greatest forwards to have ever played the game.’ Burgess has a new game to play now. Buckle up. It’s going to be some ride.","Sam Burgess left Australia to fly to the UK to join new club Bath .

"After his grand arrival into rugby union, Sam Burgess will prepare to enter a school of hard knocks in a ‘padded cell’ with Bath’s back-rowers, while his new club may find themselves on a collision course with England. The world player of the year in league was unveiled amid great fanfare at The Rec and he handled the glare of attention with considerable aplomb, despite the jetlag induced by a long-haul trek from Sydney. There was ample diplomacy as he explained his cross-code move and ambitions, but the subject of his likely position in the 15-man game kept recurring as a potential sticking point. Stuart Lancaster, the England head coach, would welcome the prospect of Burgess making a late charge for World Cup selection in midfield, and at the start of this season it appeared Bath were ready to co-operate by deploying him at inside centre. But, amid a spate of back-row injuries, now it appears they may revert to their initial intention by unleashing him at No 8, whether that is in the national interest or not. Sam Burgess has made the switch from rugby league to union and is being touted for a place with England . Burgess and Bath head coach Mike Ford prepare to face the media during the player's unveiling . Sam Burgess was unveiled as a Bath player on Thursday following his switch from rugby league . Having welcomed his new recruit, Bath head coach Mike Ford emphasised the club’ s right to harness his imposing presence as they see fit, having had to stump up the full transfer fee without assistance from the RFU. Whether or not a padded cell actually awaits Burgess, what does is a crash-course in the breakdown and other aspects of back-row play, just in case that is where he is employed. Asked where the newcomer would play, Ford said: ‘If you want my gut feeling, I think Sam’s going to play in the back row. I’ve got a good relationship with Stuart, but we have not really talked about Sam positionally, only “when is he coming, is he healthy and do you need any help in the way you develop him, we can help in that respect”. But the decision will be Bath’s and Sam’s. I can afford to experiment and see what the best position is. ‘We have quite a few back-row players injured and we have a padded cell which we will put them in over the next few weeks so the guys can take Sam to one side and say, “This is how you present the ball, this is how we clear”.’ The 25-year-old played 13 times  for the England rugby league side, and also played twice for Great Britain . Stuart Lancaster would likely welcome Burgess challenging for a place in the England World Cup squad . 1. He can be a bit of a teacher’s pet. Growing up watching rugby league, his favourite player was former Wigan star Andy Farrell, which could be a popular choice if Burgess is called up for England — Farrell is the backs coach for the national team. 2. He’s not always been so keen on a cross-code switch. In a Q&A in 2009, the former Bradford Bulls man was asked about whether he was concerned too many players were swapping rugby league for rugby union. He said: ‘It is definitely something rugby league as a sport should be worried about. I played a little bit of rugby union when I was younger, but I’m definitely on the side of league.’ 3. He made a flying start to his league career. In 2007, as a strapping 18-year-old, he made a spectacular international debut for Great Britain, scoring in a 20- 14 win over New Zealand. The last 18-year-old to score on debut against the Kiwis? A certain Andy Farrell. There is still a chance that once Burgess is fit to start his union career after recovering from facial surgery, he will first surface at centre for Bath, but the uncertainty is not good news for England. The national coaches will be desperate to see him wear No 12 as soon as possible, but the man himself was at pains to play down his Test hopes — well aware it would not send out the right message at his new club to suggest he wants to run before learning to walk in the rival code. However, England’s autumn internationals last year played a part in convincing him to cross the divide. ‘I did see the games — I was in the country,’ he said. ‘I did think it was fantastic, the way it was built up at Twickenham; it looked like a fantastic experience to be a part of. I guess that’s one great thing about rugby union. ‘But I’m here now as a Bath player. I’ve been asked a lot about England but for now it’s important to sort this face out, get some fitness back in, get in the padded cell, earn the respect of the boys and let them know I’m here for the right reasons.’ Outlining the motivation behind leaving league, he added: ‘I’ve always had an ambition to play union. I didn’t think it would come this early. I came back at the end of 2013 to play in the Rugby League World Cup and I really missed England and English people.

Burgess's mum Julie poses with her Rabbitohs sons (from left to right) Sam, Luke, George and Tom . ‘I saw Mike and Bruce (Craig — club chairman) at Bath and I saw it as an opportunity. I believed in the vision they had for the club and thought it was a great fit. My goal at the moment is to get fit and find a spot in Mike’s team. I don’t know where that is yet. Over time we’ll work that out.’ Burgess has made his move after some time off to recuperate from his operation, having broken a cheekbone and eye socket during his man-of-the-match contribution to the South Sydney Rabbitohs’ first NRL title in 43 years. He spent some time with club owner and film star Russell Crowe on his farm — ‘we had a couple of beers together, we had a good time’ — before flying home to embrace this new challenge. Burgess (right) said goodbye to his loved ones older brother Luke and girlfriend Phoebe Hookeat at Sydney Airport on Tuesday ahead of his flight to England and Bath Rugby . He declared himself at ease with the pressure which will accompany him in union and backed his ability to learn a whole new ball game. ‘It is not going to be an easy transition,’ said the man known as Slammin’ Sam. ‘But I don’t lack belief.’ There has been contact with the England coaches, but Burgess played down the significance of their conversations. He said Lancaster had merely called him a few times to say ‘G’day’ and his mistaken use of the Australian phrase brought a laugh. It will take time to acclimatise to being back in this country, let alone being in the other code. Asked if any of his three brothers who are still at the Rabbitohs might be tempted to head home and turn their hands to union, Burgess said: ‘I don’t think so! Thomas and George are living on Coogee beach and loving it in Australia. My oldest brother (Luke) has settled down and has a family in Sydney.’ So Sam appears to be the only member of the clan who will make this leap into the unknown, at least for the time being. But for Bath and for England, wherever he ends up playing, this big brother could be a revelation. Time will tell.","Sam Burgess unveiled by Bath on Thursday .

"The FIA has decided not to penalise Caterham and Marussia for their absence from this weekend's United States Grand Prix. The demise of the two teams over the past week forced the stewards present at the Circuit of the Americas to review the circumstances behind their withdrawal. With both marques in breach of the sporting regulations which state they are to 'participate in every event with the number of cars and drivers entered', the FIA naturally had to look into the matter. F1 team Marussia has followed Caterham into administration this season . A security guard takes down the British flag after the Caterham factory in Oxfordshire was closed . Via a statement, the FIA has commented that 'in view of the current financial circumstances, the stewards decide not to impose any penalty'. In addition, the statement added: 'Because of the particular nature of the breach, the matter is referred to the attention of the FIA president (Jean Todt).' With the two teams given dispensation by F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone to miss this race and the next one in Brazil, the stewards overseeing the race at Interlagos will be faced with the same situation. For the first time since the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix, the race at COTA has its lowest number of entries on the grid.

FIA President Jean Todt has questioned financial failings after seeing his calls for a budget cap rejected . Instead of six cars exiting at the end of each of the first two sessions, it will now be four, ensuring the top-10 shoot-out remains. The FIA, meanwhile, has again questioned the financial 'failings' of Formula One in light of Marussia and Caterham being forced to enter into administration. Earlier this season Todt's plans to introduce a budget cap for 2015 was torpedoed by the major marques. Despite an indication the teams were willing to finally accept a cost cap - after a 2009 proposal under former FIA president Max Mosley was also rejected - it was ultimately thrown out to Todt's fury. Now, in the words of Mosley earlier this week 'the chickens have come to roost', with the financial unsustainability of running a Formula One team leading to Caterham and Marussia's woes. Offering a clear indication the situation has to change, the FIA has vowed to pursue a situation where the gap between the haves and have nots closes.

'As such, the FIA, in close co-operation with FOM (Bernie Ecclestone's Formula One Management) and the different stakeholders in F1, will continue to work towards maintaining the attraction of the championship and the equitable participation of the teams in it in the years to come.' Many will view the FIA's response as simply hot air as it has so far failed to turn meaningful actions in the past into reality.","The FIA will not punish Caterham and Marussia for missing US Grand Prix .

"Home favourite Brian Harman was one of four Americans at the top of a crowded leaderboard after the first round of the McGladrey Classic in Georgia. Harman lives in Sea Island and looked to be enjoying some home comforts as he shot a five-under-par 65 to share the lead with Michael Thompson, Erik Compton and Will MacKenzie. The 27-year-old won his first PGA Tour tournament at the John Deere Classic in July and, after not playing the opening two events of the season, was glad to be back in action. Another home favourite, Davis Love III, watches his drive off the 10th tee during the first round . Brian Harman leads the McGladrey Classic . 'I was nervous starting,' he told www.pgatour.com. 'It has been a while since I played a golf tournament. I took the first two tournaments off because I wasn't quite ready to go so I wasn't quite sure how things were going to go. 'It was windy, it was cold this morning, it was tough conditions and I just outlasted it and finally started getting comfortable and playing better and finished real nice.' Starting on the back nine, Harman bogeyed 14 but followed that with two birdies and reached the turn in 34. The birdies were coming in bunches and Harman picked up further shots on three, four, seven and eight to get off to a good start in a season that will see him make his Masters debut at Augusta in April. 'After you win, you kind of feel invincible for a little while and feel like you ought to win every week but it just doesn't turn out, there are so many factors that go into it,' he said. 'So work hard, see what happens, do your best and stay patient. That's what I'm trying to do.' Fellow University of Georgia alumni Compton also carded six birdies and a bogey to hold a share of the lead and Thompson's scorecard also showed just the one dropped shot. 'If you get it going the greens are really quick and they're very true,' said Compton. 'So if you're playing well I think there's some good scores out there. 'Conditions I think will definitely get tighter during the week and (these are) definitely the fastest greens we've putted on in a while so you've got to be careful.'

"Silviniaco Conti is poised to try and reclaim the bet365 Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby on Saturday. The 2012 winner, fourth in the Cheltenham Gold Cup to Lord Windermere, is one of two Paul Nicholls entries alongside Rocky Creek, not seen since finishing a creditable fifth in last season’s Grand National. Silviniaco Conti wound up his campaign with victory in the Betfair Bowl at Aintree in the spring and is likely to use Saturday’s feature chase as a springboard to the valuable Betfair Chase at Haydock next month. Silviniaco Conti (R) won the BetFred Bowl Chase at this year's Crabbie's Grand National . Ladbrokes World Hurdle winner More Of That could be the star attraction in the bet365 Hurdle at the same venue. The exciting six-year-old, who took his unbeaten record to five with victory in the staying showpiece at the Cheltenham Festival, is one of 10 entries and may renew rivalry with At Fishers Cross who was back in third in March. More Than That has been tipped to perform at the bet365 Hurdle in Wetherby . Newbury, pilloried by many for their decision to rebrand the track as The Racecourse Newbury, has dumped the rather grandiose title. The track attracted widespread criticism for the decision of joint managing directors Stephen Higgins and Sarah Horden to rename the Berkshire course as part of a strategy which also featured the introduction of an ill-informed dress code. Higgins and Horden left the racecourse last year and the dress code has since been relaxed, while track officials confirmed yesterday the course would revert to the banner of Newbury Racecourse.","Silviniaco Conti will return to the bet365 feature chase at Wetherby .

"Epsom officials appear to have decided on a 4.30pm start for next year’s Investec Derby as they continue to wrestle with ways of increasing disappointing Channel 4 viewing figures for Britain’s most important Flat race. Any change remains subject to approval from the Royal household. The change of start time from 4.00pm will mean a later start to the whole meeting, with the first race off at 2pm as opposed to 1.35pm in June. There had been speculation that both Epsom officials and sponsors Investec favoured a move to an evening Derby. But no change would be considered which would jeopardise the ability of the Queen to attend. Epsom officials are considering putting back the start time of the Investec Derby to 4.30pm . Jockey Joseph O'Brien rides Australia towards the winners enclosure after triumphing in this year's race . An added complication for an evening slot in 2015 is that it would throw up a clash with the Champions League Final, something bookmakers have argued would be a damaging diversion to betting turnover. Channel 4 viewing figures for the 2014 Derby saw a fall from 2013 levels for peak audience (1.55million compared to 1.95m), audience share (14.7 per cent compared to 21.8 per cent) and average audience (770,000 compared to 834,000).

"Dreams of another Investec Derby winner being trained at historic Kingsclere stables will live on through the dark winter months after Andrew Balding-trained Elm Park conclusively landed the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster. The historic Hampshire yard was once the base for John Porter, the legendary trainer who landed the Epsom Classic six times during the 1800s. It was also there that Mill Reef was prepared for his successful assault on Flat racing’s most important race by Balding’s father Ian and a statue of the 1971 Derby hero stands proudly in the stable. Andrea Atzeni rides Elm Park to victory in the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster on Saturday . Andew Balding-trained Elm Park streaks the field in the Racing Post Trophy . Elm Park's owner Sheikh Fahad Al Thani talks on the phone after his horse's comprehensive win . With Andrew in Australia on Saturday, where he saddled Side Glance to finish fourth in the Cox Plate, it was appropriate that Ian accompanied daughter-in-law Anna Lisa to Doncaster to cheer home a horse bred by his wife Emma. In an additional link to Mill Reef, in his first three races and until purchased by Qatari Sheik Fahad Al Thani, Elm Park had even carried the same distinctive black and gold silks that once represented the great horse’s late owner Paul Mellon but now are the livery of the Kingsclere Racing Club. An emotional Balding said: ‘We have had five generations of this family and to have bred him is special. Elm Park has the right temperament which is so important. You need that and Mill Reef had it in spades.’ With four Racing Post Trophy winners this century going on to the Derby, the most recent being Camelot in 2011, the race has developed into an important pointer to the Classic . The succinct post-race verdict of BHA two-year-old handicapper Matthew Tester that Elm Park was a ‘good winner of a disappointing race’ looked an accurate assessment keeping the result in perspective. But it is hard not to be very taken with the son of Phoenix Reach, who surprisingly providing Balding with his first British Group One winner since Casual Look won the 2003 Oaks in his first season at the Kingclere helm. Elm Park will have high hopes of landing the Investec Derby in the new year . Atzeni claimed his second win in the race in successive years after winning the 2013 edition on Kingston Hill . Coral cut Elm Park’s Derby odds to 14-1 after he secured the last Group One of the domestic Flat season by two and three quarter lengths from Aidan O’Brien’s Aloft. Sir Mark Prescott’s Celestial Path was a further half-length back in third. If the success meant a lot to the Baldings, it was also special to jockey Andrea Atzeni who had landed the race 12 months earlier with subsequent St Leger winner Kingston Hill. Atzeni was only signed up at the new No 1 jockey for Sheik Fahad’s Qatar Racing organisation in August after the surprise announcement that Jamie Spencer was retiring and to post a top-level success so early in their association is an early down dividend on the faith put in him. O’Brien may have lost out at Doncaster but gained more than adequate compensation when his three-year-old Adelaide won the Cox Plate in Australia under a trademark power-packed Ryan Moore ride.","Andrew Balding-trained Elm Park won the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster .

"Boss Neil Warnock would welcome a Crystal Palace takeover, but admits he is facing deja vu. The Eagles drew 2-2 at West Brom on Saturday, having led 2-0, after reports linking American billionaire Josh Harris with the club emerged. Harris is worth more than £1.25billion, according to the Forbes guide, and owns NBA franchise the Philadelphia 76ers and NHL side the New Jersey Devils. Warnock was in charge at Leeds and QPR when they were sold, and knows the feeling after Palace were linked with a takeover. Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock was at Leeds and QPR when they were taken over . 'Yes, because it's happened many times,' he said. 'At Leeds it happened, at QPR there was a takeover and now Palace. 'But it is difficult for managers now. Every club would love a billionaire. There are not that many about - you have to snap their hand off. 'It must be lovely, but it brings a different kind of pressure, to be able to spend millions and get top players. 'It must be brilliant for any manager to spend millions and get to work with players like (Chelsea's Diego) Costa. American investor Josh Harris is in talks with Crystal Palace about purchasing the Premier League club . Warnock was QPR manager when Tony Fernandes took over the club . 'I don't really know what a billionaire could do for Palace - I have only been here six weeks. You'd better ask the chairman. There are not a lot of billionaires in Yorkshire.' Palace were 2-0 up at the break at The Hawthorns after Brede Hangeland's opener and Mile Jedinak's penalty. Victor Anichebe made it 2-1 in the second half after Craig Dawson barged into Julian Speroni, leaving Warnock baffled as to why referee Mark Clattenburg did not award a foul. It forced the goalkeeper off with a head injury and Clattenburg also failed to give Palace another first -half penalty when Dawson felled Wilfried Zaha. Palace went ahead through Brede Hangeland and then Mile Jedinak put them 2-0 up but West Brom pegged them back . Saido Berahino's stoppage-time spot-kick salvaged a point for the Baggies and denied the Eagles a third win of the season. 'I wanted to see the referee and I was told he was going to stay, but he didn't,' Warnock said. 'I saw (fourth official) Chris Foy and the others, but I am afraid Mark had gone. 'That was old-fashioned stuff, the smash on Speroni. The smash on (Jason) Puncheon by (James) Morrison (in the build-up to Albion's penalty) could easily have been a free-kick.' He added: 'I came along to Palace to help them out really. They had lost their manager at a difficult stage of the season, so it has been nice to steady the ship.

"Billionaire American investor Josh Harris has opened exploratory talks with Crystal Palace over a potential purchase of the club. Palace are one of a number of clubs that Harris is understood to be looking in to purchasing as he looks to expand his sports portfolio. Harris - worth more than £1.25billion according to the Forbes guide - also owns NBA franchise the Philadelphia '76ers and National Hockey League side the New Jersey Devils. American investor Josh Harris is in talks with Crystal Palace about purchasing the Premier League club . The 49-year-old Harris owns the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils and may take over at Palace . He would become the fifth American owner of both an English football club and a U.S. franchise but will have to persuade the club's owners to sell. Palace were rescued from administration by four supporters comprising the consortium 'CPFC 2010' four-and-a-half years ago. Co-chairman Steve Parish has made it clear that he would welcome significant new investment providing it is right for Palace’s long-term future. Crystal Palace lost their last match 2-1 against Chelsea and are 16th in the Premier League . 'Josh obviously knows how to run pro sports franchises,' Sal Galatioto, who was involved in the deal to sell the 76ers to Harris, told Bloomberg. 'It’s a very interesting investment that should be a very good one for him over the long run. ' Harris would join John W Henry (Liverpool), the Glazer family (Manchester United), Stan Kroenke (Arsenal) and Shad Khan (Fulham) in owning clubs both sides of the Atlantic.

"Everton have revealed record profits of more than £28million for the 2013/14 season. The profits of £28.2m come off the back of a 39 per cent rise in turnover to £120.5m, boosted by broadcast revenues of £88.5m courtesy of the Barclays Premier League's new broadcast deal. The Toffees' operating gains before player trading in the financial year ending May 31 were £23m, a dramatic increase on the £700,000 recorded during the previous campaign. Everton finished last season with a record points tally before posting record profits of over £28m .

On the pitch Roberto Martinez guided the team to fifth with a record Premier League points haul of 72 and chairman Bill Kenwright could not hide his delight. 'It was a special season that blended the optimism of youth, a much talked-about, bold new style, individual brilliance and an enduring team spirit that runs through every Everton squad,' he said. 'A season that brought a club record Premier League points haul - a total that in almost any other year, would have sealed Champions' League football. 'It was a season that, quite simply, we didn't want to end.' Marouane Fellaini's sale to Manchester United will have boosted the Toffees' coffers . Martinez guided the team to a fifth place finish in a season when broadcast revenues were increased . The club also managed to reduce net debt from £45.3m in 2013 to £28.1m with gate receipts up £1.9million and sponsorship, advertising and merchandising revenue up from £7.6m to £8.4m. 'The strong results for 2013/14 are a reflection of the drive, commitment and hard work of all staff at the club,' said chief executive Robert Elstone. 'Teamwork and clear priorities will always be fundamental to our success. And, at the most senior level in our club, the passion and talent of our outstanding manager fits seamlessly with the vision and dedication of our chairman.

"Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet has warned his first-team hopefuls to be ready as he considers making changes for Monday night's trip to Crystal Palace. The Uruguayan has presided over an 8-0 horror show at Southampton and last weekend's error-strewn 2-0 home reverse at the hands of Arsenal, with keeper Vito Mannone and central defender Wes Brown among the guilty men as the Black Cats contributed to their own downfall. Mannone was one of the heroes of last season's Capital One Cup run and remarkable Barclays Premier League survival fight, but with understudy Costel Pantilimon breathing down his neck, he could find himself sitting on the bench at Selhurst Park. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet admits he is ready to make changes against Crystal Palace on Monday . Costel Pantilimon (left) could replace Vito Mannone (right) in goal at Selhurst Park . Pantilimon, a summer arrival from Manchester City, is yet to make a Premier League appearance for the club with his only involvement to date coming in the League Cup, but Poyet wants the giant Romanian - and any other player with hopes of forcing their way into his plans - to be prepared. He said: 'That's something we will know if he plays and how he performs. I tell my son to be ready - imagine my players. 'Be ready, then if I give you the chance and you are not ready, you cannot blame me. I cannot send you a text, an e-mail, WhatsApp, whatever you want, to make sure that you're ready. 'It's part of the job. A few players are pushing for their places and I need to make sure that I pick the right team.' John O'Shea (left) warms up during the Black Cats' training session at the Academy of Light on Friday . Midfielder Jack Rodwell grins during training as Sunderland prepare to face Neil Warnock's side . Mannone endured an intensely difficult day at the St Mary's Stadium with three of the goals he conceded being scored by his own team-mates, and it was he who served up the ball to Gunners midfielder Alexis Sanchez to score at the death last Saturday after Brown had done much the same before the break. But Poyet, who insisted before the Arsenal game that he would not drop the Italian because of one sub-standard performance - but might if his dip in form continued, will not make a snap decision. He said: 'I will look at the decision and I am going to make a strong decision either way. Keeping Vito or not playing him is a strong decision because he's a very important player. You will know on Monday night.' Poyet seems certain to make changes, although given that injuries continue to deprive him of the services of defenders Billy Jones and Sebastian Coates and midfielders Ricky Alvarez and Emanuele Giaccherini, his options are decidedly limited. Poyet, pictured speaking to his team in training, wants his entire squad to be ready to play on Monday night . However, he has had one piece of good news this week with striker Steven Fletcher, who announced his return to the side with a double in the 3-1 victory over Stoke on October 4, having shaken off the foot problem which curtailed his involvement against Arsenal. Poyet said: 'Fletch is back and he has been training this week similar to before Stoke, so I am really looking forward to seeing Fletch on the pitch on Monday.'","Sunderland have won just one game all season and sit 18th in the table .

It is understood they are now in talks with American millionaire John Jay Moores, as well as his long-time associate Charles Noell. Moores, 70, previously owned the San Diego Padres Major League Baseball franchise in California and a Swansea source told Sportsmail that the Texan is discussing the possibility of purchasing an equity stake in the club, though no offers have yet been made. The club have refused to confirm or deny Moores is in talks. Swansea’s current board has taken the club from League Two to the Premier League and Monk said on Thursday: ‘It's important as a club that we look to push forward. ‘The way to do that is maybe attract other interest and other investment and there are areas of the club that need to be strengthened - facility-wise, commercially, infrastructure and expansion of the stadium. ‘What I would say is over the last 10-11 years you speak to everyone who's been involved at this club and Huw and the board have always made the decisions with the best interests of the club in mind. ‘It's not about someone coming in and taking over everything - people should have trust in the board that they will do whatever's best for the good of Swansea.’ Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins (centre) has helped club go from League Two to the Premier League . He added: ‘The bigger clubs are going to stretch away with more money and the clubs that are left behind must try to stay on their heels enough to compete. ‘This is a way of doing it and that's what the club is looking at. Of course I can understand the fans' concerns but Huw and the board are very shrewd in what they do.’","Swansea City Supporters Trust are wary of external investment in a club .

"Lee Cattermole is urging Sunderland to take a leaf out of Newcastle's book as they look to bounce back from their self-inflicted wounds. The Black Cats head for Crystal Palace on Monday evening having endured a nightmare fortnight, scoring three own goals in an 8-0 defeat at Southampton and then handing Arsenal a 2-0 victory on a plate at the Stadium of Light last weekend, courtesy of individual errors from Wes Brown and Vito Mannone. As a result, Gus Poyet's men have slipped into the Barclays Premier League's bottom three, rekindling memories of last season's desperate fight for survival. Sunderland players look dejected as they fell to a 8-0 humiliation at Southampton earlier this month . Lee Cattermole says Sunderland can look to rivals Newcastle United for inspiration to turn season around . Moussa Sissoko celebrates scoring for Newcastle United during the 2-0 victory at the Etihad on Wednesday . In the meantime, arch-rivals Newcastle have lifted themselves out of the drop zone with victories over Leicester and Tottenham, and booked themselves a place in the Capital One Cup quarter-finals following an unexpected win at Manchester City. Cattermole said: 'It can change so quickly - look at Newcastle up the road. That's football. 'We're looking to bounce back on Monday, it's a massive game for us. 'We can't get too carried away with a couple of bad results. We've all been here that many times. We've got to cut the errors out. You cut them out and you suddenly make teams beat you. 'But it's a hard thing to do.' Sunderland did just that last season when, having gone into the final six games of the season seemingly doomed to life in the Sky Bet Championship, they managed to draw at Manchester City and win at both Chelsea and Manchester United as they collected 13 of the last 18 points on offer to stay up. Sunderland's Vito Mannone - who made errors in the defeats to Arsenal and Southampton - could be dropped . While there may be trepidation on the terraces over the club's current plight, there is a belief within the dressing room that the picture is far from as bleak as that which has been painted, and Cattermole insists the last two games have to be put into perspective. He said: 'Results are the big thing but as players, you tend to judge by the performance. We were on the pitch and you feel the way the game was going. 'We went down to QPR and got beaten 1-0 and everything you read in the paper wasn't great, but we actually dominated them from start to finish. They couldn't get two passes together. 'That was an enjoyable game to play in, even though we got beaten 1-0. We felt we were there all the game, pushing. I know which team I would have wanted to be on. Newcastle celebrate as the Magpies beat Manchester City 2-0 in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday . 'We've got to think about some of the positive performances and not get too downbeat about losing 2-0 to Arsenal. We've got to bounce back. 'We know how punishing the league is and we've got to look to move on as quickly as we can.' Cattermole will run out at Selhurst Park on four bookings for the campaign and knowing a fifth is inevitable sooner or later because of the nature of his game. However, he has worked hard on his discipline and is confident he has made progress. He said: 'I've played every minute of every game so far, so there's a good chance I'm going to get booked. Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko look deflated at the restart as the holders lost at home to the Magpies . 'Maybe that would have affected me more when I was younger, but five bookings before December 31 - that's maybe 18, 19 games. (Calum) Chambers got booked in the first five games of the season (he was booked in five of the first seven league games) without a mention, Jack Wilshere and Jonjo Shelvey missed a game. 'There's been a couple I haven't been happy with, but it's part of the game, isn't it? It's basically not a problem. 'I wouldn't want to miss a weekend. If I miss a midweek it's not so bad, but a weekend disrupts your rhythm.'","Sunderland have lost their last two games an aggregate of 10-0 .

"Ronny Deila has been accused of being an idealistic manager of Celtic. Pressed on what it might take to keep John Guidetti on a permanent basis, however, he became a hard-headed pragmatist. ‘Money is always a key factor,’ said the Norwegian bluntly. ‘We will see what happens, but everyone has to know we really want John to stay. I’ve talked with him and he loves being here. He loves the club and we need to do everything we can now to make his move a permanent one.’ Swedish striker John Guidetti is on a season-loan at Celtic from Premier League champions Manchester City . Saying it is the easy part. Putting together a deal which might make Guidetti commit himself to a Scottish footballing landscape in financial decline is a trickier business. With eight goals in eight games - including Wednesday night’s hat-trick against Partick Thistle in the League Cup - the striker has told anyone who will listen that he is honoured to be at Celtic and enjoying his football for the first time since a successful loan year at Feyenoord. Whether that translates to a permanent transfer is another story. Guidetti is believed to earn around £40,000 a week at Manchester City - significantly more than the highest-paid player at Celtic. There are parallels with the capture of Joe Ledley from Cardiff City. The 22-year-old scored a hat-trick against Partick Thistle in the League Cup, taking his tally to eight for the club . Like the Welshman before him back in 2010, the fact that Guidetti turns 23 this season means he could join Celtic on a cross-border Bosman when his City contract lapses next summer without the need for compensation. English clubs, in contrast, would be obliged to pay Manchester City a development fee for his services. The main question, then, revolves around wages. And Deila is hopeful that the sway of rebuilding an injury-plagued career with Celtic can outweigh financial considerations when it comes time to reach a decision. Asked what a player faced with a choice of £25,000 a week at Parkhead or £40,000 a week at a middling English Premier League club should do, the Norwegian was blunt. ‘The decision is very easy. You stay at Celtic,’ said Deila. ‘It’s also important to know that Celtic, if you take away the money, is still one of the biggest clubs in the world. ‘If you come here you have everything. You have stadium, supporters, fantastic pitches, good staff, history, and you have European football. Ronny Deila is confident Guidetti can be persuaded to stay at the club, even if they can't offer huge wages . ‘Here you have what you need to get to your potential.’ During his time in charge at Stromsgodset in his native land, Deila signed players previously considered unobtainable by convincing them that a step backwards could bring two forward at a later date. He will try the same pitch with Guidetti. ‘John loves football. Money is important but that comes because of good performances,’ said the Celtic boss. ‘The best players always think: “Football, development, then the money comes as a consequence.” ‘I’ve seen it the other way around many times before. And it finishes very quick. ‘You can see the people that really want to learn and develop. You can see it in their attitude. Those are the kind of players that we want at Celtic. They will get the money also.’ Deila has already spoken to Guidetti about the possibility to staying on. For his part, the player says he has no desire to lose his focus and form by thinking of the future too soon. Guidetti's City contract expires in the summer, so Celtic could sign him on a Bosman . ‘I want to give 100 per cent every game for Celtic,’ said the Swede after Wednesday night’s game. ‘When my agent comes to me and says: “Okay , John, this is what’s going to happen,” then I listen.’ Agreeing with those sentiments, Deila said: ‘He was happy. But it’s important that he keeps focused on playing football. It’s easy to lose focus and to think of other things. It had to happen with the agent and the club and we need to concentrate on performing every week. ‘We have good contact with them [his agent] as well. ‘He had been injured for a long time and there was a question mark over that. ‘But now things are going well and we hope we can keep him here. It is perfect for the club and the way we want to play. Deila said Celtic is the perfect place for Guidetti to get his career back on track after a string of injuries . ‘Manchester City cannot sell him to another club in January because we have him on loan for the season. So I don’t think that is possible. We have a good relationship with City and we talk to them a lot.’ Asked if Celtic can afford Guidetti’s wages, Deila conceded the need for goodwill and compromise if the player is to remain on the books at Parkhead. ‘I think he has to go into our economy. I think that’s possible. ‘It’s important that he is performing well here and that he feels loved and wanted. To play at Celtic when that happens, you can’t be in a better place. ‘I’ve said to John that he needs stability to play. ‘He is a very good football player and he has started very well for us. He has a lot of potential and he still has a long way to go. ‘He is enjoying every minute here and he is wanted here. He is also loved here. It’s also important that he is not just giving something to us, but we are giving something to him. ‘I think he sees that he is performing well now because the team are performing, too. Those things are important when young players are picking the next stage of their career and the next club.’","John Guidetti is on loan at Celtic from Manchester City .

"Ally McCoist admits he’d rather avoid Celtic if Ronny Deila’s side join Rangers in the League Cup semi-finals. In the first game of the Mike Ashley era, the Ibrox side claimed their place in the last four of the competition with a one-goal victory over Premiership St Johnstone courtesy of Lewis Macleod’s header four minutes from time. Provided Celtic see off Partick Thistle on Wednesday night, there’s a one in three chance of a first Old Firm game in almost three years. Rangers manager All McCoist can't hide his delight as Lewis MacLeod's header proves to be the winner . MacLeod celebrates his fine header with just four minutes to go to secure Rangers' win at Ibrox . But McCoist admitted he’d rather be paired with any side other than their old rivals. ‘When you get to the semis, you can’t really pick and choose,’ McCoist said. ‘We all know who would be favourites to pick up the domestic trophies before the season starts. ‘I don’t think that would change, so in that respect I would probably take anyone else other than Celtic. ‘I don’t think it is rocket science to work out it would maybe give you a better chance of reaching the final, although it wouldn’t guarantee it. ‘It would be a very, very tough game (against Celtic). Stating the obvious, we would very much be the underdogs. But underdogs can sometimes win.’ Speaking after his manager, however, match-winner Macleod said he’d relish the prospect of facing Celtic in three months’ time if fate decreed it. ‘It goes without saying that it would be one of the most hyped up games for a wee while,’ said the 20-year-old. ‘But we will see how the draw goes at the weekend and we will look forward to the semi-final no matter who we play against.’ Former Newcastle Director Derek Llambias (left) was in the stands after becoming a Rangers consultant . Rangers captain Lee McCulloch rises above the St Johnstone defence as he attempts to head his side in front . Just 13,023 turned up at Ibrox for the first game since it was confirmed that Newcastle owner Ashley’s £2million loan would give him control over the boardroom. Ashley’s right-hand man Derek Llambias — who has initially been employed as a consultant — watched proceedings from the main stand amid an air of expectation that significant change is in the air. It was later confirmed that communications director Paul Tyrell, who was brought in by former chief executive Graham Wallace, is leaving the club with immediate effect. Asked if he believed he’d be reporting directly to Llambias, McCoist replied: ‘I don’t know. I haven’t been told anything and I haven’t met anyone yet. I don’ t have any doubt that time will come. But right now it’s about getting the boys brushed down and ready for another tough tie on Saturday (against Dumbarton in the Scottish Cup). ‘I spoke to the chairman (David Somers) and Sandy (Easdale) on Monday and as I see it just now, I’ll have discussions with anyone - board members or shareholders. Anyone who wants to talk, I’ll talk.’ Asked if he’d spoken with Llambias yet, McCoist said: ‘I haven’t, no. I obviously was preparing totally for the game Saturday but I’m looking forward to meeting him. ‘We are in tomorrow morning and the boys will do their cool down. I am available to meet anyone at any time but there are no plans as such.’ Nicky Law (left) is challenged by Christopher Millar as Rangers managed to prevail in the Scottish League Cup . Kenny Miller loses possession on Tuesday but helped Rangers reach the League Cup semi-final . McCoist admitted he was surprised at the low attendance. ‘It’s not the norm, I accept that,’ he said. ‘But as I said before the game, whether there are 500 or 50,000 in the ground, the job is still the same and you have to be professional in the manner you go about your job. I felt we did that tonight. It was a tough, stubborn first half but we lifted it in the second half and deserved to go through.’ McCoist also heaped praise on Macleod for his part in extending his side’s run to five straight wins. ‘He’s a top player,’ he added. ‘I have to say, it was a very important goal but equally the delivery in was from another young lad (Fraser Aird) who has been doing really well for us last year and this year so it was very positive that the two young lads linked up to get us into the semi-final. ‘We asked Lewis at the start of the season to contribute a bit more in terms of his assists and his finishing and he’s certainly doing that. ‘I thought particularly in the first half it was pretty tough and stubborn. In the second half, I thought we were a lot better, the better team, and deserved to win the game. It was a goal worthy of winning any game.’ McCoist revealed that goalkeeper Steve Simonsen required hospital treatment after colliding with the post while saving Brian Graham’s second-half header. ‘I am concerned because he’s off to hospital for a wee check-up,’ he went on. ‘The doc said it’s hopefully more precautionary than anything else but wouldn’t be qualified to give you a comment on it until he’s been looked at in the hospital. Fingers crossed he will be all right. ‘I haven’t seen it but the boys told me that straight away that was pretty clear. You can always tell by the players’ reaction when another player goes down injured, normally the severity of it, and our lads were wanting the doc on and there was a substitution straight away so it was worrying — very worrying.’ Rangers keeper Steve Simonsen clatters into the post during Rangers' League Cup clash with St Johnstone .

'We have players in different age groups and we are not just leaving the team to grow old, although admittedly the players we signed in the summer were experienced ones, with the exceptions of Ter Stegen and Douglas. 'But we are building a team for a season, not just one match.' The former Barcelona and Valencia goalkeeper said of Enrique's appointment at the Nou Camp: 'Luis Enrique was always first choice.

"Manchester City striker Stevan Jovetic believes plenty of goals in a victory against Manchester United this weekend will be the perfect way to lift the club. The Barclays Premier League champions appear to have lost their sparkle in recent games, with a shock Capital One Cup defeat by Newcastle on Wednesday following a loss to West Ham and a Champions League draw at CSKA Moscow. Jovetic said: 'We need to be more determined and we need to score goals, because we are a team that scores more goals than everybody and when we don't score we have problems. Stevan Jovetic fights off Paul Dummett in Manchester City's Capital One Cup tie with Newcastle . 'It happened last night. I hope the next game we will score again. 'We won this cup (the Capital One Cup) last year and we wanted to win it again. 'Unfortunately we didn't make it but now we must forget, recover well and think about the next game.' The next week could be critical to City's campaign. They already trail impressive leaders Chelsea by six points in the Premier League and another loss to United could seriously damage their title defence. That game is quickly followed by a visit from CSKA and anything less than victory in that game could leave them struggling to maintain interest in the Champions League. That in turn could put Pellegrini under the spotlight. Jovetic is keen to fight for the Man City cause as he tries to stop Haidara getting past him . City manager Manuel Pellegrini had a night to forget against Newcastle. He made seven changes but two of the stars who did start, David Silva and Yaya Toure, suffered injuries. Silva is now a doubt for the derby after limping out of the action with a knee problem after just nine minutes. Toure was later withdrawn as a precaution due to a groin injury. Asked what went wrong against Newcastle, Jovetic said: 'I think maybe the goal - they scored early. After that we tried, we played, we had some chances but we couldn't score. 'At the end they scored a second goal. They deserved the win.' David Silva is an injury worry for Newcastle and went off in the first-half of his side's Capital One Cup loss . Like Jovetic, goalkeeper Willy Caballero also believes the United clash could offer the perfect opportunity to restore confidence. The Argentine, signed in the summer from Pellegrini's former club Malaga, said: 'It's a big opportunity for us to change this. We need to recover, forget about this match and only think about United. 'It's always a really, really big match. When I have watched these games from my house you can tell how big it is.

"After holders Manchester City were dumped out of the Capital One Cup on Wednesday, Manuel Pellegrini may not wish to be alerted to the League Cup-winning manager's curse that has developed since February 2007. Between the 2007 and 2013 competitions, five out of the six managers to win the tournament  left their club less than a year later. The Chilean boss should not be feeling the heat just five months after winning the Premier League, but the list of managers to have lost their jobs so soon after lifting the League Cup in recent years is a reminder of how quickly things can change in football.

Back in February 2007, few could have foreseen that Jose Mourinho, who had just won the Carling Cup for the Premier League champions would be gone just seven months later. A year later, Juande Ramos lifted the trophy for Tottenham after a 2-1 win against Chelsea, which was meant to herald a bright new dawn for Spurs. Eight months on the Spaniard was unceremoniously given the boot after a run of poor results. Sir Alex Ferguson bucked the trend by winning the tournament in 2009 and 2010 and remaining in his post until 2013, but since then the curse has continued. In 2011, Birmingham defeated Arsenal in the final but suffered relegation from the Premier League just three months later. The following month, manager Alex McLeish resigned  via email. Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish won the Reds' first trophy in six years in 2012 when he managed the team to  League Cup victory after a penalty shoot-out win against Cardiff. It didn't do him much good – he was sacked less than three months later.

For years it was Liverpool who found themselves at the receiving end of Ferguson's caustic comments, until they stopped being a threat. Arsenal's Arsene Wenger appeared only to have to smile his enigmatic smile to rile the managerial Godfather of England. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Man United achieved unprecedented success under Sir Alex Ferguson but have struggled since his retirement . Eric Cantona scores  against Man City at Maine Road  in 1996 when United were clear top dogs in Manchester . Ferguson would often feud with rival Arsene Wenger at a time when Man City weren't even on the Scot's radar . Edin Dzeko and Aleksandar Kolarov celebrate the 'noisy neighbours' 6-1 win at Old Trafford in October 2011 . CITY . League titles: 4 . European Cups: 0 . FA Cups: 5 . League Cups: 3 . UNITED . League titles: 20 . European Cups: 3 . FA Cup wins: 11 . League Cups: 4 . Head-to-head . City  wins: 42, United  wins: 59, Draws: 49. When it came to the 'other' club in Manchester, however, well they were miles off Ferguson's radar for years. Then along came a Middle East takeover, some serious spending and a genuine rivalry for silverware and Manchester City were paid the biggest compliment of all – Ferguson described them as 'small with a small mentality' and branded them the 'noisy neighbours'. That was the point that City finally got under the skin of a manager who could see the axis of power shifting to the east of Manchester. Admittedly, the decision to plaster a huge poster of ex-United striker Carlos Tevez all over Deansgate with a 'welcome to Manchester' message was pretty well guaranteed to irritate Ferguson and everyone at Old Trafford. Talking the talk has evolved into walking the walk. Look at the Premier League table for the last four years and it has a very northern hue. City or United, United or City. Ferguson has gone, David Moyes has come and gone, Roberto Mancini has gone and now it is Louis van Gaal versus Manuel Pellegrini. Manchester United won the Champions League in 1999 - the same year rivals City were playing in the third tier . Paul Dickov scores against Gilligham at Wembley as Man City went on to win on penalties to earn promotion . City soon got under the skin of United - thanks to their takeover - starting with this Carlos Tevez poster . After decades of living in United's shadow, the Premier League champions are now the best team in the city . United are in a lowly eighth place on 13 points while City are in third but only four points better off. No-one would suggest that City are the poor relations any more. The reverse could be argued. Yet it was only in 2001 that the clubs reached a fork in the road which would see City relegated while United went from strength to strength on the back of their 1999 treble-winning season. Most people would remember 2001 and Old Trafford for Roy Keane's assault on Alf-Inge Haaland but it was also the season City slipped out of the Premier League. Roy Keane peers over Alf-Inge Haaland following an horrendous tackle on the Manchester City midfielder . Even though United did not regard their noisy neighbours as a serious threat in terms of League position, local bragging rights were just as important. There have been some memorable derbies, not always for the right reasons. Rio Ferdinand's bleeding head from a thrown coin blighted the 2012 meeting in which Joe Hart also tackled a pitch invader after Robin van Persie's late winner to make it 3-1. City fans will remember the 2007-8 season with fondness as that was the first double since 1969 when Marvin Gaye was hearing it through the grapevine and George Best was taking delivery of a brand new Lotus Europa, whatever that is. Rio Ferdinand holds his head during a clash in December 2012 after being struck on the head by a thrown coin . Two years later the derby was labelled the best Premier League game of the season. United 4, City 3 with Michael Owen scoring the winner in the fifth minute of injury time. Owen said recently, annoyingly referring to himself in the first person: 'I think if you ask any United fan what was the best ¬moment of Michael Owen's time here they'd all say that derby goal – and it's probably the stand-out moment for me too. 'It's a special memory because it won us a memorable derby and was in front of the Stretford End – the fans don't forget something like that.' United's Michael Owen celebrates his injury-time winner against City during 2009's seven-goal thriller . Neither do the players. Wayne Rooney, who appeared close to signing for City at one point until he was given a bumper new deal by United, settled the Old Trafford clash in 2010-11 with a bicycle kick. This is how he described it in his autobiography: 'I'm Wayne Rooney. I've played Premier League football since 2002 and I've just scored the winning goal in a Manchester derby – probably the most important game of the season to fans from the red half of town. 'A goal that puts our noisy neighbours – the other lot – in their place. A goal that reminds them United have more history and more success than they do right now. A goal that warns the rest of the country we're on our way to winning another Premier League title. Wayne Rooney scores one of the Premier League's greatest goals with an over-head kick in February 2011 . 'As I stand with my arms spread wide, head back, I can feel the hate coming from the City fans behind me, it's like static electricity. The abuse, the screaming and swearing, is bouncing off me. I don't give a toss. 'I know how much they hate me; I can understand where they are coming from though, because I go through the same emotions whenever I lose at anything. 'This time, they're wound up and I'm not. I know it doesn't get any better than this. 'As I jog back to the centre circle, still tingling, I go into rewind. It's ridiculous, I know, but I'm worried I might never feel this way again. I want to remember what's just happened, to relive the moment over and over because it feels so good.' Rooney holds his arms out  to celebrate the goal and admitted 'it doesn't get any better than this' in his book . Back to City and another hugely important result. Yaya Toure stopped United from reaching a ninth FA Cup final as City went on to win their first major trophy since 1976. (Brotherhood of Man top fo the charts with 'Save your Kisses for Me'). The to-ing and fro-ing continues with United taking FA Cup revenge in 2011-12 while City made the biggest noise of all when they thumped Ferguson and Co 6-1 at Old Trafford. Jonny Evans was sent off and City scored three goals in injury time. A certain Mario Balotelli grabbed two, just after letting off fireworks in his house, while Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and David Silva chipped in as well.

"Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Daniel Sturridge is out of Liverpool’s biggest week of the season as he continues his recovery from a calf problem. Liverpool face a trip to Newcastle on Saturday before heading to Spain for a Champions League clash against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and round off a demanding seven days with a showdown against Chelsea at Anfield. Sturridge, who has not played for his club since August 31, 11 matches ago, damaged his calf two weeks ago in training as he was working his way back from a thigh injury. Brendan Rodgers has confirmed Daniel Sturridge will miss Liverpool's match against Newcastle . Sturridge picked up his latest injury on England duty and hasn't played since the beginning of September . Daniel Sturridge went on Twitter on Thursday to reveal he his feeling 'closer to full fitness' Crunch matches he will miss . Newcastle (a) - November 1 . Real Madrid (a) - November 4 . Chelsea (h) - November 8 . England vs Slovenia - November 12 . Scotland v England - November 15 . Liverpool initially hoped he might recover within a fortnight but there is no prospect of that and Rodgers has reluctantly accepted that time has run out. ‘I don’t think he will be fit,’ said Rodgers. ‘The bottom line is that he is injured. He strained his calf. So he is injured. We will just wait and work with him until he gets back fit. ‘I have to find the solutions without Daniel. You are learning every day about the players. Gradually as each day goes by, I sense and feel we are getting better.’ The ramifications of Sturridge’s absence from those matches is that he will not be available for England’s games against Slovenia and Scotland next month, either. The England striker tweeted that he is getting 'closer to fitness each day' but will be out of a crucial week . Sturridge signs autographs before Liverpool's Capital One Cup game against Swansea on Tuesday . His absence has come as a source of great frustration to his manager, as the 25-year-old’s pace, clinical finishing and dynamism are crucial to Liverpool’s gameplan and they have certainly missed him. Rodgers would not be drawn on Sturridge’s claim on talkSPORT that his fitness problems might be ‘hereditary’ as both his father (Simon) and uncle (Dean) endured muscular injuries like him, but the manager wants to see his striker have a consistent run in his team. ‘When you have that talent, you just have to keep yourself fit and available as you possibly can,’ said Rodgers. Rodgers would not be drawn on Sturridge's claims that his fitness problems might be 'hereditary' ‘We will work with him and hopefully we will get that bit of luck when he comes back. When he comes back, hopefully we will have him for the rest of the season. ‘I can only concentrate on his injury now. He’s just recovering and we will see the length of time it takes. He is probably speaking how he felt. That is the way of the world. ‘I am not an expert on any genetics code, or medicine, so I can’t comment. ‘All I know is it’s a calf strain on the back of his last injury and he’s working to recover.’","Daniel Sturridge expected to be out until mid-November with calf strain .

"Manchester United summer signings Angel di Maria and Daley Blind have praised the club's fans after settling in well to life at Old Trafford. Di Maria left Real Madrid to become Manchester United's record signing for £60milion and has since impressed with a series of fine performances. Dutchman Daley Blind made the switch from his boyhood club Ajax to United and both players have signalled out the warm welcome from fans behind their strong starts. Manchester United playmaker Angel di Maria has made an excellent start to life at Old Trafford . 'The people here are amazing,' Di Maria told Inside United. 'I feel really comfortable, very happy and really pleased. The way that people treat you really makes you feel good in your heart. 'I have not really had much of a chance to get to know the city very well, with the move and with my family, but I am really pleased and happy to be here. So far I have just been going to work and then going home. United are eighth in the Premier League, but Di Maria insists he is happy and proud to be at Old Trafford . 'When I first arrived here, I was in the city centre for a couple of days but I have seen nothing else really, but I plan to in the future. 'When we are coming out after training or after the games, I have had a chance to meet some of the fans and it makes me happy that they love us so much and have got so much affection for us. 'I am trying to do my best to pay them back when I am on the field, so that the people are happy. They are really polite, they are always saying please and always saying thank you. That is really nice and I am really happy here.' Daley Blind, celebrates scoring at West Brom, has thanked the Man United fans for making him feel welcome . The majority of Manchester United fans have stuck by their team despite a rocky start to the season, and Blind was keen to show his gratitude. 'Having everybody behind you at Old Trafford all the time is great as well,' he said. 'The fans are always singing and supporting you. When things aren't going well, they still carry on supporting you and that really pushes you on and makes you want to give your most.'","Angel di Maria joined from Real Madrid for a club record £60million .

"Rio Ferdinand was at the centre of another embarrassing Twitter storm after being charged by the Football Association with misconduct for making an abusive comment. At a time when Ferdinand appears to be looking beyond his playing career with moves into the media and football administration, he has become embroiled in a row with a Twitter follower who made a remark about his club QPR needing to sign a good centre half. Ferdinand responded on September 1 by tweeting: ‘Get ya mum in, plays the field well son! #sket.’ Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand has been charged by the Football Association for a tweet . Ferdinand has been charged for this tweet, made on September 1, for using the slang term 'sket' Ferdinand (right) is alleged to have 'included a reference to gender' and has been charged with misconduct . VIDEO Ferdinand to be charged by the FA . According to various dictionaries, ‘sket’ is a Caribbean term for a whore, and the FA received a number of complaints from members of the public. A statement on the FA website said: ‘It is alleged the comment posted on his Twitter account was abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper. It is further alleged that this breach is aggravated pursuant to FA Rule E3(2) as it included a reference to gender.’ Ferdinand has until Tuesday to respond but it is not yet clear whether the 35-year-old former England captain would contest the charge. He was previously found guilty of improper conduct and fined £45,000 by the FA for comments on Twitter when Ashley Cole was called a ‘choc ice’, hinting that the former Chelsea defender is ‘black on the outside, white on the inside’. The defender, pictured here playing for QPR against West Ham United, has until October 21 to respond . But this is becoming a complex area for the FA when Ferdinand will be only too aware that in recent months the governing body took no action against either Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore or FA referees chief David Elleray over discrimination issues. No action has yet been taken against Malky Mackay and Iain Moody for their comments in the Textgate scandal last month when they were accused of sending or receiving sexist, homophobic and racist texts. That said, the FA have charged Ferdinand, despite the fact that he has been a member of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s England commission. He was even linked recently with the post of FIFA vice-president. Ferdinand is active on social media, with 5.9million followers on his Twitter page and over 14,500 tweets . Ferdinand’s profile is huge. He has 5.9million Twitter followers and embraces social media to such an extent that he launched a chapter of his new book on Facebook. He is also an ambassador for BT Sport — indeed he was involved in a BT Sport event with presenter Jake Humphrey in London on Tuesday night — and has worked as a pundit for the BBC. Both BT Sport and the BBC declined to comment on Tuesday night, but a tweet from Gary Lineker was fairly representative of the wider response. The Match of the Day presenter said: ‘Thanks to @rioferdy5 I’ve just learnt a new word. The most surprising aspect of his charge is that the FA knew what a “sket” was.’","Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand charged with misconduct .

"The 168th Manchester derby is looming on Sunday and the match has gained added importance for Manuel Pellegrini’s men. By their high standards, Manchester City have slipped into slumber over the last three games with two losses and a draw characterised by unimaginative, jaded displays from their most important players. A 2-0 defeat at the hands of Newcastle United to send them out of the League Cup alone would have been enough to cast a shadow over Pellegrini’s week, but it followed a lacklustre Premier League defeat at West Ham and a stuttering Champions League stalemate with CSKA Moscow. Manuel Pellegrini has plenty of issues to address if Manchester City are to recover their form this season . City's players trudge off dejected after their 2-0 home loss to Newcastle United in the Capital One Cup . City find themselves six points behind leaders Chelsea ahead of the weekend's Premier League action . Striker Edin Dzeko looks dejected after seeing City's defence of the Capital One Cup come to an early end . It is fair to say the Chilean is in the midst of the most trying week of his City career so far, with City in danger of going out of the Champions League and at risk of repeating their doomed title defence of 2012-13. He must arrest the slide on Sunday if they are to keep Chelsea in their sights. Here are five items in Pellegrini's in-tray at the moment. The defence is still a cause for concern . Pellegrini said the team had been working on its defence before the Newcastle game but there was scant evidence of that as Alan Pardew’s side, largely without the world class talent of City, were allowed too much time and space to make their breakthroughs. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce fired the warning shots at the weekend when he pinpointed City new boy Eliaquim Mangala as one of the weaknesses his side exploited last week. Eliaquim Mangala was unable to stop Newcastle's Rolando Aarons scoring their opening goal on Wednesday . Pellegrini believes Mangala has been a scapegoat like Martin Demichelis (right) was last season . City line up to defend a Ryan Taylor free-kick during Wednesday night's match at the Etihad . The 23-year-old, bought for £32m in the summer, has failed to justify his price tag so far but Pellegrini suggested he was being scapegoated in the same way as Martin Demichelis was last year. The City manager will hope Mangala can emulate the Argentine by turning his career at the Etihad around in a similar fashion. Injuries are in danger of derailing progress . Pellegrini’s decision to field a strong starting XI in the League Cup, the competition which gave him his first silverware in England, is laudable. But the sight of playmaker David Silva limping off after eight minutes, with a derby four days away, suggested it had perhaps been ill advised. The Spaniard is a vital cog in the City side and a game changing talent. City suffered another blow when playmaker David Silva limped off after just eight minutes . Silva's injury presents another headache for Pellegrini ahead of Sunday's clash with United . Pellegrini might have been better off resting him in midweek, having played against West Ham just four days previously. City will receive news about Silva’s knee injury on Thursday and will be hoping for a positive report. Yaya Toure also exited lamely after an hour last night with a groin strain, although Pellegrini said that was merely precautionary. City are a team struggling for confidence . The current run of results - draw-loss-loss - would not be viewed as a mini crisis at most other clubs but this is is a side that has become accustomed to victory. They have won just six of 15 games in all competitions this season and are now on a three-match winless run for the second time in a season that is less than three months old. Pellegrini conceded that his players were low on confidence and suffering from a ‘lack of trust’. With the defence leaking goals and attacking players not capitalising on chances, the confidence problem will only intensify if they fail to get a result against United. Sergio Aguero looks crest-fallen after referee Stuart Attwell shows him a yellow card . James Milner bellows instructions to his team-mates during the Newcastle game . Joe Hart fails to keep out Diafra Sakho's header in City's 2-1 loss at Manchester City last Saturday . The City defence react as CSKA Moscow are awarded a penalty in last week's Champions League tie . Just what has happened to Yaya Toure? Last season he was the driving force at the Etihad, dominating with his trademark runs down the centre of the pitch and leading by example. There have been glimpses of his greatness this season, too, but he has been largely ineffectual, lacking sharpness, being outmuscled by his opponents and occasionally looking disinterested. He has scored only one goal - an impressive strike against Aston Villa and even then he was poor for the rest of the game. If he doesn't start improving soon he'll be lucky to get a birthday card, never mind a cake from City. Yaya Toure grimaces as he leaves the field after an hour of the match with Newcastle . City are growing a reputation for being a lousy cup team . Manchester City have a proud and rich history in the cups, with their first FA Cup trophy dating back to 1904. They have had success recently, too, winning the FA Cup in 2011, the Community Shield in 2012 and lifting the League Cup earlier this year. Pellegrini clearly values them, too, consistently fielding strong teams. But for some reason, they just can’t find their feet this season. Including the Community Shield, they have one just one of six cup games and that was against Championship side Sheffield Wednesday. Pellegrini has inspired City to reverse their form before, encouraging his side to magnificently catch and overhaul Liverpool in last season’s title race. His side showed real character and focus to hunt down Liverpool and secure the title on the final day of the season, meaning he had a League-cup double to show for his first season in charge.

"Atletico Madrid captain Diego Godin is delighted by the fighting spirit in the camp as the reigning Primera Division champions aim to continue their recent good form. Los Rojiblancos take on promoted and winless Cordoba at the Vicente Calderon stadium on Saturday evening seeking a seventh win in eight games in all competitions. Uruguayan skipper Godin has marshalled an Atletico defence which has not conceded in any of their last three games, since a 3-1 loss at Valencia. Atletico Madrid captain Diego Godin believes his side are growing stronger each day as a group .

Nothing will divert us from day to day and now we only think of Cordoba.' Cordoba were promoted via the play-offs last season having finished seventh in the Segunda Division, and have drawn five and lost four of their nine league games so far to sit 18th out of 20 in the early top-flight standings.

"CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail's interview with Steven Gerrard as the Liverpool captain talks Balotelli, Sturridge... and the future (you will be surprised by what he says!) At the tender age of 34, Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard admits that having the correct fitness routine is 'key' to him being able to perform each week at Anfield. Gerrard may no longer be the box to box midfielder of old, but his role in Brendan Rodgers' side is vital to the team's success. Here, the Liverpool midfielder details exactly what he needs to do to keep himself in good shape for the grueling Premier League campaign. Steven Gerrard takes Pilates sessions to increase his flexibility and keep in shape for Liverpool . Gerrard's performances last season played a huge role in Liverpool's Premier League title challenge . 'If I am playing Saturday to Saturday, managing my workload during the week is key. 'When I’m training off the pitch I normally do three weight sessions each day to improve my upper-body strength and one working on my lower body to improve leg strength. I also do two core or Pilates sessions to increase my flexibility. 'On the pitch I train for an hour and a half each day. That includes drills, ball-work, cardio and a lot of running. 'On a match day, diet and hydration is so important. The 34-year-old has barely missed a minute of Liverpool's Premier League campaign this season . 'My diet is heavy with protein and carbohydrates on a match day to provide energy. That means lots of chicken, fish and eggs for the protein and pasta, rice and potatoes for the carbs. I also eat yoghurts. 'You’ve got to make sure you get the right amount of sports drinks on match day to keep up your energy levels. In the morning I have plenty of fluids, so water and Lucozade Sport for the electrolytes.' The Reds veteran reveals he trains for an hour and a half each day on the pitch .

"Andrew Cole expects Wayne Rooney to take out his pent-up frustration on Manchester City this weekend. United captain Rooney is available for selection for the first time in five weeks following his three-match ban for a kick on West Ham's Stewart Downing. During his absence Rooney has cut a rather frustrated figure as he has watched on from the stands and Cole expects the 29-year-old will be fired up and desperate to make an impression in the Barclays Premier League encounter at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Wayne Rooney made the challenge as Downing tried to break clear and lead a West Ham counter-attack . Andrew Cole, pictured celebrating scoring against Bradford, says Rooney's return is a huge boost to United . 'He has got to be raring to go,' the former United striker said. 'He is a professional footballer. When you miss games through injury or illness or suspension, you are going to be disappointed. 'I have no doubt he will be chomping at the bit now and ready to go having missed three games. 'It's going to be a massive boost to have a player of his quality back. 'Hopefully we can go to Man City and get a positive result.' Manager Louis van Gaal defended Rooney in the wake of his dismissal, which he received for kicking Downing from behind while the West Ham midfielder was mid-sprint. But former captain Bryan Robson has warned Rooney he must not make a habit of getting sent off because of his new role of responsibility at the club. 'The one thing Wayne has to take on board is that he's under even more scrutiny now. We saw him get sent off recently and, as a captain, you can't be doing that,' Robson told United's website. 'But Wayne knows that - I spoke with him at the training ground after the incident and he's well aware of it. 'I think he's done that because he's keen to impress, desperate to show people he cares. I don't think it'll happen again.' If - as expected - Rooney overcomes a minor foot injury, he will start at City, possibly alongside both Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie. Manchester United fans will be hoping for a repeat of Rooney's sensational goal against City in 2011 . The England captain bagged three goals in six matches before his suspension, so if he continues to scoring at that rate, he will soon overtake Cole and become the second-highest scorer in Barclays Premier League history. Cole, who is 11 strikes ahead of Rooney in the all-time standings, is sure the former Everton frontman will surpass his total by the end of the season. 'Of course he can do that,' said Cole, who scored 187 Premier League goals - a feat only surpassed by Alan Shearer. 'If Wayne breaks it, it has been broken by a fantastic player. 'He has played at the highest level for 10 years now.' Rooney's experience of Manchester derbies - this will be his 22nd outing for United against City - will be vital in helping the club's new faces know what awaits them at the Etihad. Van Gaal, who is also facing City for the first time, could field up to six players who have not played in a Manchester derby before. But Cole is sure the likes of Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Ander Herrera will not freeze under pressure against a City team that will be itching to take all the points following a disappointing three-match winless streak. Manchester United skipper Rooney celebrates scoring against West Ham before his red card in September . 'They are professional footballers. They have nothing to be scared of,' said the former United striker, who also spent a year at City before he retired. 'They are playing in front of 70,000 every other weekend and those players have played in big games like European matches and internationals before. 'They will not be thinking: 'I am going to be worried about playing in the Manchester derby.' They will appreciate it.' Andrew Cole was speaking at the unveiling of the 'Treble Collection' and customised First Team squad watches by Bulova, Manchester United's Official Timekeeping partner.","Wayne Rooney was handed a three-game suspension for kicking out at West Ham's Stewart Downing at Old Trafford in September .

"Alan Pardew has pinpointed Newcastle’s come-from-behind draw against Hull in September as the catalyst for his side’s dramatic upturn in fortunes. The Magpies have won three on the spin going in to Saturday’s home match with Liverpool in front of a lunchtime television audience. They were also live on the TV on Wednesday as Pardew’s young team made it through to the last eight of the League Cup with a shock 2-0 victory over Manchester City. Papiss Cisse inspired a Newcastle comeback against Hull and they have been in fine form ever since . That came on the back of wins at home to Leicester and at Spurs, easing the pressure on the manager. Pardew was the subject of fan fury ahead of that visit of Hull with many calling for him to be sacked after a winless start to the season. But Papiss Cisse struck twice in the second half to salvage a point and so began United’s revival. ‘The comeback against Hull was possibly the turning point,’ said Pardew as he reflected on his three straight victories. Newcastle have built a strong team spirit and will be hoping they can win their fourth game on the spin . ‘We were 2-0 down at home on the back of a difficult run and a defeat would have been really tough to take. ‘Papiss getting those two goals and coming back to fitness gave us that boost we needed and we’ve taken it on into all the games since then. ‘Our points total is improving and we want to keep improving our position by beating Liverpool. Pardew, whose first game in the Newcastle dugout was a 3-1 victory over Liverpool, added: ‘It’s always a great fixture and a tough game. There’s a certain romance to it and all makes for a really cracking game. Facundo Ferreyra adapts to life on Tyneside and is hoping to break into the first team . ‘It was my first game as Newcastle manager and we’ve had some good ones against them and more than held our own. I’m pretty confident about what Liverpool will do. ‘I think I know Brendan (Rodgers) well enough to know how they will play, but I think we can surprise them. ‘One thing’s for sure - Brendan won’t know my team, but I’m confident what his well be.’ United will be without the injured Cheick Tiote but Papiss Cisse has a chance of recovering from his knee problem. Gabriel Obertan is all smiles as he prepares for Newcastle's clash with Liverpool . Pardew, meanwhile, has revealed that his message to the players remained the same during their recent period of struggle. ‘You have to be strong and be consistent with your players, whether you are going through difficult times or really good times,’ he said. ‘I can’t go bounding in this morning all happy and excited as if we’ve won the World Cup, we have won one game. It’s the same when you get beat. You have to have a consistency of what you are about. ‘We were planning for Liverpool from 8.30 this morning and that is how we work. Everybody else can say and do what they do in the background, we have to ignore that and get on with our job.","Newcastle have won three games in a row since drawing with Hull .

"Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn believes drastic changes need to be made to address the financial folly that has led to the demise of two Formula One teams over the past week. Kaltenborn has long expressed concern at the escalating costs in F1, with organisations such as Ferrari, Red Bull, Mercedes and McLaren operating on budgets of £200-300million per year. Unable to adequately compete, back-of-the-grid marques Marussia and Caterham have entered into administration, and the belief is they are unlikely to be seen in F1 again. The Marussia F1 team have followed Caterham into administration this season . The soaring financial implications of competing in F1 have resulted in Sauber's future being placed in doubt, although Kaltenborn claims that whilst precarious, her team's position is not as bad as Caterham and Marussia. Kaltenborn is, however, angered by what has occurred, particularly as the teams had the opportunity at the start of the year to address the situation, only to reject FIA president Jean Todt's plans for a cost cap from 2015 onwards. 'I'm beyond the stage of frustration,' said Kaltenborn. 'It's one thing to just talk about this terrible scenario that some teams are not going to be there, but for the people responsible for the sport to have let it come this far is extremely disturbing. 'What we really need to look at - and we as a team have been saying for so long - is to get the figures right in the sport. 'It's a real shame we have turnovers of billions of dollars, yet as a sport, as a community, we are not capable of making sure that 11 teams survive. Now you try to explain that to somebody.' In particular, Kaltenborn has called for a re-think as to how money is distributed amongst the teams. At present, given various agreements and deals between the teams and F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, what a marque such as Ferrari receive in revenue outstrips that of Marussia and Caterham four fold. A security officer takes down the British flag as the Caterham  factory in Oxfordshire is closed . 'There should be a certain amount that allows each and every team to at least live decently,"" added Kaltenborn. 'No-one is saying you should have the most luxurious standards. We should be allowed to participate in the sport. 'We have put in so much investment in order to reach this level, and that should be respected whereby you get a certain basic amount that is the same for everyone. 'And given the brands, already so established, a team like Ferrari will attract different sponsors and amounts than ourselves. 'But at least an environment has been created whereby a smaller team does not have to suffer that much. Referring to one of Ecclestone's oft-repeated comments, Kaltenborn said: 'It's pretty outdated to say if you don't have the money then don't be in the sport. 'Even small teams are putting a lot of money into the sport - at least for normal people it's a lot of money.' Sauber team principle Monisha Kaltenborn urges F1 teams to have a financial re-think . Another issue is the self-interest of the larger teams, who possess power that allows them to go against the seemingly greater good of F1. Kaltenborn feels if the teams could be united then the sport would benefit, thrive and attract new marques and sponsors. 'As teams we should first find this collective which is not there at the moment. That made us strong in the past,' said Kaltenborn. 'We all have at least one common denominator which is to survive in this sport and make the sport something healthy, because we all will attract our sponsors. 'Like it used to be in the past and not too long ago, you had the big ones, the medium teams, the smaller teams and they all attracted very good brands. 'You could attract them because the product was so good, because people wanted to come into the sport, and not everybody can go to the top three. 'That's what we first should focus on before we start pointing here and there.'","Monisha Kaltenborn believes drastic changes are needed in Formula One .

"It went down in football history as one of the most infamous and controversial sending off incidents the game has ever seen - and would define the careers of all those involved. The year was 1991 and Nottingham Forest are playing West Ham in an FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park. The opening 20 minutes had been bossed by the Hammers, who played in the division below Forest and were clear underdogs. Then came a moment that would alter the course of the match and the entire season, plus set a precedent that would change refereeing and the art of defending for ever. Scroll down for video of Gale and Hackett discussing the incident 23 years on . West Ham's Tony Gale is left stunned after referee Keith Hackett punishes his professional foul on Nottingham Forest's Gary Crosby in the 1991 FA Cup semi-final with a straight red card . Gale brought Crosby down as he broke clear on goal after 22 minutes of the semi-final . Gale was the first player to be sent off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity, with the rules having been altered just a few days before the match at Villa Park . As Forest's Gary Crosby broke clear, he was brought down by West Ham defender Tony Gale. To everyone's astonishment, referee Keith Hackett reached for his pocket and brandished a red card. Gale became the first-ever footballer to be shown a straight red card for denying an attacker a goal-scoring opportunity with a professional foul. It is a rule we're all familiar with now, but back in 1991 Hackett's decision took many by surprise and Gale is among many of a West Ham persuasion who have never forgiven him. Forest went on to beat the 10 men 4-0 and advanced to the final against Tottenham at Wembley. Now, 23 years later, the two men have been re-united and Gale still blames Hackett for ruining West Ham's Cup dream. Hackett attempts to explain his decision to Gale, who took some persuasion to leave the field . Speaking in a video for you-are-the-ref.com, Gale said: 'I still probably think I wouldn't have got sent off nowadays and I still question the decision. 'I just couldn't believe it, you know. I couldn't believe it would be someone like me getting in this kind of situation. 'That was the only blot on my copybook and probably made me infamous. It might have made Keith famous but it made me infamous at the time and it was something that I thought was unforgivable.' And Gale goes further, saying he believes Hackett wanted to make a name for himself: 'I thought it was a bit of an egotistical one at the time, in that Keith wanted to be the first one to make that decision.'

Forest's Mark Crossley, Steve Chettle and Tommy Gaynor celebrate their passage to the final . The defender, who made 300 league appearances for West Ham between 1984 and 1994, also believes his suspension led to West Ham missing out on the second division championship. Hackett insists Gale was the victim of new rules introduced by the Football Association just a couple of days before the big match. He said: 'On the Thursday, Ken Ridden at the FA called all referees in to discuss this particular type of incident. The managers, even the referees below Football League level at that particular time were not aware of this interpretation. 'if this incident happened a week before, Tony wouldn't have received a yellow card never mind a red. VIDEO: Highlights of the match after Gale's sending off . Gale in action for West Ham against Gary Lineker of Tottenham the following season . 'It ruined the game. It ruined it for the spectators and dare I say that I wasn't happy myself and the culmination was I came into the car park after the game really unhappy, very unhappy in this particular decision. 'I threw my bag into the car and there was an FA guy there... he tapped me on the shoulder and just said, ""Well done. If you hadn't have sent him off you'd have been suspended."" 'I always remembered that because I then had some choice words for him. I [later] had the death threats, which were taken quite seriously.' Hackett added that he is still not in favour of the rule despite it being a well-established part of the game now. Tottenham went on to beat Nottingham Forest in the final at Wembley, winning the match 2-1 . Forest manager Brian Clough, in iconic green jumper, leads his team out at Wembley . 'I still think that denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity is a bad law... in the case of a defence inside the penalty area, you know, that denial of the goal is replaced by the penalty kick. 'So it's an offence where the punishment is a triple jeopardy - it's dismissal, it's a penalty and it's a suspension and that can't be right.' Brian Clough's Forest went on to lose 2-1 to Terry Venables' Spurs in the final but the controversy of Gale's red rumbles on to this day.

"Arsene Wenger's 65th birthday celebration finally went off with a bang on Wednesday night. When Lukas Poldolski hit the hugely unlikely 90th-minute winner here, frustrated Anderlecht fans threw an exploding firework on the pitch. It was an act of extreme recklessness but doubtless caused by utter frustration and disbelief in the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium. As a knot of Arsenal players celebrated their unlikely saviour in Podolski in front of their travelling fans in one corner of the ground, all around there was a sense of incredulity. For 88 minutes Anderlecht, the Belgian champions, had not just held Arsenal at bay; in the second half they had dominated them. They were were well worth their 71st-minute opener, set up by the excellent Dennis Praet, once a Gunners trialist, and finished at the near post by Andy Najar.

Arsene Wenger turned 65 on Wednesday and he celebrated reaching that landmark with a late, late win in Belgium . Anderlecht: Proto, Vanden Borre, Mbemba, Deschacht, Acheampong, Tielemans, Defour, Najar, Praet (Dendoncker 88), Conte, Cyriac (Suarez 83). Subs Not Used: Roef, Colin, Kljestan, Kabasele, Mitrovic.

Subs Not Used: Huddart, Rosicky, Arteta, Bellerin. Booked: Monreal, Welbeck. Goals: Gibbs 89, Podolski 90. Att: 25,000 . Ref: Carlos Velasco Carballo (Madrid). Not only that, they should have finished Arsenal off. It was Emiliano Martinez, the 22-year-old goalkeeper on whom so much pressure had been placed, who kept them in the game, making a string of saves, notably from Matias Suarez on 84 minutes. And it was the post that rescued them from an Anthony Vanden Borre chip on 80 minutes. Arsenal were creaking, the limitations of this squad seemingly exposed for all Europe to see, as were their pretensions as challengers for this trophy. But something curious has happened to Arsenal this season; the spirit that once characterised this side has returned. Their late comebacks are becoming a regular feature of games. This, though, topped the lot. Wenger, understated as ever, took the dramatic last two minutes completely in his stride. ‘It’s a bit unexpected to take the three points, considering the quality of the match that Anderlecht played tonight,’ said Wenger, his lips curling into the beginnings of a grin. ‘I know by experience that the last five minutes in the Champions League, the nerves play a part. And that we had to get into these five minutes without conceding the second goal.’ ‘A bit unexpected’ was stretching it. When Calum Chambers advanced into Anderlecht’s half in the 89th minute there had barely been a significant Arsenal chance since Santi Cazorla forced a 64th-minute save from Silvio Proto. But Chambers, who had endured a troubled night, redeemed himself: his cross was superb, the finish from Kieran Gibbs, at the far post and drilled across goal, even better. That in itself would have represented something remarkable. Just over a minute later substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain advanced goalwards, with Anderlecht complaining bitterly of a foul. His pass found Alexis Sanchez, who shot, and amid a rebound and something of a scramble, up popped perennial reserve Podolski to record the most improbable victory . ‘We always know he can score,’ said Wenger, denying that his German World Cup winner had been close to leaving in the summer due to his lack of appearances.

It took him a while to get back to a good physical level after the World Cup and now he’s nearly there. ‘He has 115 caps for Germany; that is not a coincidence, that shows you the quality. I think he is a guy you want to have the ball in the box. His shot is fantastic, his accuracy is great and he has very short backlift.’ There was praise too for Martinez, very impressive since it was his third Arsenal appearance. I had no worry for our goalkeeper because he has the presence and the quality and he resists stress well. For the rest? There was little to say. ‘We had the spirit,’ said Wenger. ‘It was disappointing we didn’t create more chances tonight but I put that down to the fact as well that Anderlecht defended very well.' Prior to that spectacular ending, Wenger’s birthday celebrations were proving very flat in Brussels. It was as though all the invited guests turned up but there was no cake, an absence of party poppers and definitely no champagne moments.The vintage Arsenal of old, with which we associate Wenger, went missing.

The defender sinks to his knees and is congratulated by Monreal after scoring his first goal in the Champions League . A solid Anderlecht side, who made up in endeavour what they lacked in quality, were too much for the visitors. The first half was a rum affair, neither side displaying much quality other than on the defensive side. The second started more promisingly. Ibrahima Conte almost provided Arsenal with the unpleasant shock on 48 minutes. Mertesacker mistakenly let the ball run across the box and Conte found himself with time and space to shoot. His strike was deflected wide but it was enough to lift the Anderlecht crowd, who increasingly believed they had the measure of the Premier League side. Their cause gathered momentum when Praet, increasingly influential, had space to play in Conte down the left on 53 minutes. Chambers seemed to react slowly and for a moment the 23-year-old Anderlecht winger looked as though he had the measure of Arsenal’s right back, and was poised to beat him as Chambers struggled back. Ultimately Chambers came out on top, winning the ball back cleanly, despite penalty appeals from his opponents. Arsenal could muster precious little in response. Sanchez again got clear on 55 minutes and pulled back a cross but Ramsey fired his effort well wide.

"Arsenal left it late to stage a dramatic comeback against Anderlecht and keep their Champions League hopes on track. The Gunners were heading for a shock loss after Andy Najar opened the scoring for the hosts in the 71st minute but a Kieran Gibbs equaliser and a Lukas Podolski strike completed the turnaround in the dying embers of the match. Emiliano Martinez was superb in goal for Arsene Wenger's side as the third-choice goalkeeper made his European debut. Here Sportsmail's Rob Draper gives his verdict on how the players performed. Arsenal (4-3-3) Emiliano Martinez - 8.5 - STAR MAN . Superb night with no nerves and he kept Arsenal in the game. Emiliano Martinez had a sublime goal in for Arsenal - in only his third appearance for the club . Calum Chambers - 6.5 . Bad night but provided a great cross for Kieran Gibbs' equaliser. Per Mertesacker - 6.5 . Kept defence together in the first half but was less successful in second. Nacho Monreal - 6, . Satisfactory performance, given that he’s out of position at centre-back. Kieran Gibbs - 7 . At fault for goal, but what a finish for the equaliser! Kieran Gibbs started Arsenal's dramatic comeback scoring a beautiful volley with minutes remaining . Aaron Ramsey - 5.5 . Struggled in his first start back for the Gunners from injury. Mathieu Flamini - 5.5 . Organised things as well he could but little impact otherwise on midfield. Jack Wilshere - 5.5 . Passing awry, the midfield couldn’t get a grip of the game. Alexis Sanchez was full of energy as the Gunners clawed their way back into the match . Alexis Sanchez - 6.5 . Always energetic, always showing: vital contribution for the winner. Danny Welbeck - 6 . Started well but faded away, as Arsenal lost control of the game. Santi Cazorla - 5.5 . Not his greatest night: peripheral, missed 64th minute chance. Santi Cazorla was largely ineffectual for the English side against Anderlecht on Wednesday night . Substitutes . Joel Campbell (76, for Welbeck) - 5.5 . Couldn’t really make an impact on the game . Lukas Podolski (84, for Wilshere) - 8 . Superb. Just when Arsenal needed him, he popped up . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (76 for Flamini) - 7 . Eventually found those driving runs to trouble Anderlecht . Lukas Podolski produced a stellar substitute appearance - scoring the Gunners' winner late on .

"Arsene Wenger hailed his team's late fightback as 'vital' after the Gunners scored two late goals to beat Anderlecht 2-1 on Wednesday night. The win keeps his side firmly in contention to qualify from Group D and leaves the Premier League outfit placed second behind Borussia Dortmund. Kieran Gibbs cancelled out Andy Najar's opener in the 89th minute, before Lukas Podolski scored the winner in injury time.

Arsenal players celebrate with Podolski after his decisive goal at Constant Vanden Stock Stadium . 'We kept going and managed to score two good goals because we had the spirit and refused to lose the game,' Wenger told Sky Sports 1. 'Anderlecht played well tonight and you see that this country produces top-class players. 'It was vital for us to have a chance to qualify. We are in a strong position now. 'Galatasaray and Anderlecht have only one point, we have six and Dortmund nine, so it's down to us now to win our home games and we are through.' Wenger remains confident that Arsenal can still top Group D ahead of Dortmund. Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs scores the equalising goal in the 89th minute in Belgium .

'Dortmund can be a tough opponent. We now play Anderlecht at home. 'Let's just qualify and then we will see how far we can go.' Arsenal were on course to return to London empty-handed and Gibbs admits his side were disappointed for their performance before the late rally. 'I felt we controlled quite a lot of the game,' said Gibbs. 'Our final ball was letting us down massively and that was frustrating .

"Per Mertesacker accepts Arsenal are still misfiring despite pulling off a dramatic late 2-1 win over Anderlecht in Brussels to stay on course for the Champions League knock-out stages. The Gunners got away with a largely average display at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium, where a second-half header from Andy Najar looked to have put the Belgians on course for a famous win to ruin manager Arsene Wenger's 65th birthday. However, just as they did in rescuing a point at home to Hull with a stoppage-time equaliser in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday, Arsenal struck late. First, left-back Kieran Gibbs volleyed in a superb finish in the 89th minute and then substitute Lukas Podolski crashed in a dramatic winner. Per Mertesacker admitted he has struggled for motivation since winning the World Cup with Germany . Arsenal now have qualification for the knock-out stages back in their own hands ahead of next month's return tie against Anderlecht at the Emirates Stadium, and then hosting Group D leaders Borussia Dortmund. Mertesacker, though, knows the Gunners cannot afford the continued inconsistencies which have seen early-season promise quickly turn back to familiar questions about the direction of Wenger's squad following only five wins from the opening 14 matches. 'Everyone knows that it was a difficult start for us and our confidence is not that much how we wanted it,' the German defender said. Arsenal players celebrate with Lukas Podolski after his decisive goal at Constant Vanden Stock Stadium . 'The character is good, the mentality is good, but football-wise, we lack a few things. 'Our passing game is not as efficient as last year. We are not at our best. We have to admit that, be honest with ourselves and train harder.' By his own admission, Mertesacker has not produced the consistent form of last season, with the 6ft 7in German culpable for failing to deal with a cross which lead to Hull taking the lead on Saturday. The 30-year-old retired from international football after Germany's summer World Cup triumph but accepts the highs in Brazil came at some cost to his subsequent club performances. Summer signing Alexis Sanchez has been one of the few impressive Arsenal players this season . 'Personally it is difficult at the moment because that was really a long season last year and to come back from that World Cup and get the motivation back... I am nearly back, but you can feel there is something missing at the moment,' he said. 'With those games, the belief and the mentality is there, but the motivation will come back. 'We didn't even have time to celebrate [the World Cup win] properly, that was the first thing, but you realise month after month what happened. 'I am still not there [taking in] what happened in Brazil, maybe in five or 10 years you can really realise what was going on there. Arsene Wenger's side are seventh in the Premier League and second in their Champions League group . 'We came back to Berlin, got on the stage, waved our hands, showed the World Cup and then everyone disappeared to their families to get some holidays, some rest and calm.' Mertesacker said it was a struggle to relax into 'a proper holiday' and said the resumption of club football was on his mind. 'That was really a problem, but I am happy not to have picked up an injury yet and I am confident that I have already been through the dangerous period,' he added. Aaron Ramsey passes the ball under pressure from Anderlecht's Dennis Praet and Youri Tielemans . 'I am really happy that I am slowly fit and ready for the proper fight during the winter period.' Wenger allowed his World Cup winners to miss the opening games of the season to fit in a suitable break. 'It is harder mentally because we started literally when the season (had already) started. I have never experienced that,' Mertesacker said. 'But slowly, now it is 100 days or so after the World Cup final, so the season is going to start (for real).'","Arsenal beat Anderlecht 2-1 in their Champions League clash .

"Gus Poyet will make changes to the team thrashed 8-0 at Southampton when Arsenal visit the Stadium of Light on Saturday.

"Liverpool and England are too reliant on Raheem Sterling, according to former Reds captain Graeme Souness. The 19-year-old has been the best player at Anfield this season and he has become an increasingly effective player for the national team. Against Real Madrid in the Champions League last week Liverpool's game plan appeared to consist of just getting the ball to the teenager at any opportunity and he even played the second half as a striker after misfiring Mario Balotelli was substituted. Raheem Sterling is challenge by Hull City's Alex Bruce during Liverpool's 0-0 draw at Anfield on Saturday . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers issues instructions to Sterling on the Anfield touchline . But while Sterling's talent is not in question, Souness believes he is being asked to do too much when there are more experienced players around him who should be shouldering the burden. 'It is true (Liverpool) are placing a lot of responsibility on him but the same can be said of England and if they are relying on a 19-year-old kid then I think it does not reflect well on England's group,' he said. 'The same can be said for Liverpool: if you are relying on a 19-year-old to deliver in big games for you it is not how it should be.' Sterling has been by far Liverpool's most potent attacking threat this season . Souness also criticised Liverpool's defensive organisation and believes they have to get back to basics before they can get through their current malaise of conceding sloppy goals. 'They are conceding bad goals now and if you are doing that it drains confidence and they must be at that point now,' said the Scot, who was speaking on behalf of Capital One, the credit card company which sponsors the League Cup. 'It is not about what type of football you are trying to play; you can play the football you want but if you are conceding poor goals it drains confidence. Liverpool's defence scramble to try and stop a goal at QPR earlier this month . 'Liverpool have to get back to stop giving away daft goals - especially at set-pieces - and then start again and rebuild confidence. 'From where they were last year to where they are now they are a team playing without great confidence. 'It is not just about back four and goalkeeper; if your midfield is working hard to stop quality balls being played into your back four the defence has a far better chance to deal with the crosses. 'But they are not putting the ball under pressure and the guy is able to cross it.' Former Liverpool captain and manager Graeme Souness poses with the Capital One Cup trophy . Captain Steven Gerrard, so effective in a deep-lying midfield role last season has struggled to impose himself on games in the current campaign but Souness believes it is too early to write him off. 'I think Steven Gerrard can play in that position for at least another season after this one with the proviso he has the right player around him; Henderson plus one other,' he said. 'He still has the range of passes and he is still passing it better than anyone else at the club but he needs people either side of him as they are a little bit light in there.' Souness believes Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has been exposed this season in midfield . Liverpool host Swansea in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday and Souness believes it is a competition they should take seriously despite the glamour of the Champions League. 'It's a great opportunity for Liverpool to win a trophy,' he added. 'You can never play in enough cup finals or win enough medals. Winning is a habit. When you've been to a final and won a cup you want it again and again and it gives you that inner belief you can do it again.'

"Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James has called for shorter seasons in the NBA to reduce the risk of serious injury. The NBA are experimenting with shorter quarters - reducing their duration from 12 minutes to 11 minutes - following claims that players are being over-played. But James believes that is not the solution, with the American calling for fewer games, rather than shorter games, to resolve the issue. Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James (23) drives against Indiana Pacers forward Damjan Rudez (9) Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James gestures from the bench against the Indiana Pacers . 'Less games is less concessions and less tickets and all that, but at the end of the day we want to protect the prize, and the prize is the players,' James told Akron Beacon Journal. 'If guys are being injured because there’s so many games, we can’t promote it at a high level.' He added: 'The minutes don’t mean anything. We could play 50-minute games if we had to. Once you go out and play on the floor it doesn’t matter if you’re playing 22 minutes or 40 minutes. Once you play it takes a toll on your body.' But Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan disagreed with James, suggesting that basketball players face fewer risks to health than American football players, who have been campaigning heavily against the long-term negative impacts of playing professional sport. 'I loved playing,' Jordan, who now owns the Charlotte Hornets, told ESPN. 'If I wasn't playing 82 games, I still would've been playing somewhere else because that's the love for the game I had. As a player, I never thought 82 games was an issue. Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan celebrates after beating the Phoenix Suns to win the NBA title in 1999 . Michael Jordan believes the NBA season should not be shortened, contrary to James' claims . 'But if that's what they want to do, we as owners and players can evaluate it and talk about it. But we'd make less money as partners. Are they ready to give up money to play fewer games? That's the question, because you can't make the same amount of money playing fewer games.

He underwent tests and the team said Sunday in a statement he was diagnosed with a 'Jones' fracture - a broken bone at the base of the small toe. It's unclear how the injury happened.

"Brighton may not have won for six games and are in desperate need for their strikers to start scoring, but Joe Bennett insists they can cause a shock at White Hart Lane. The left-back, on loan from Aston Villa, got the goal to earn his team a draw against Rotherham in their last Championship game and believes a victory is close. Bennett backs under-pressure manager Sami Hyypia and believes a good performance against Tottenham in the Capital One Cup can provide a catalyst. ‘I don’t see why we can’t go there and get a result,’ said Bennett. ‘It will be a tough game, you never know what team Spurs might put out.

Craig Mackail-Smith is the only striker to find the net in the Championship, once, while Sam Baldock and Chris O’Grady are yet to score. ‘In training they’ve been really good, they are all good finishers,’ said Bennett. ‘It’s up to the team as well, we need to create more chances for the lads to finish.

He has one year left on his contract and would like the opportunity to re-establish himself under Paul Lambert once this season is over. ‘I’m focused on doing well for Brighton first,’ he said. ‘Over the last year or so I’ve improved and matured as a player, both mentally and physically.’ Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino will have to be careful against a Brighton side looking to cause an upset .","Brighton face Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on Wednesday night .

City just cannot get to grips with the Champions League, its unique mental demands and its relentless rhythms.

By the end, however, City were staring at a disappointingly early end to their Champions League season yet again. As peculiar as it is to say, the current English champions continue to stand still in Europe. This was a pretty grim experience all told in Moscow. Freezing temperatures, a stadium echoing to the boorish, boozed-up chanting of CSKA fans who shouldn’t have been anywhere near the place and a late penalty decision so dreadful it’s tempting to check the Hungarian referee’s passport for Russian lineage. CSKA are a dreadful club. Ignorant to the behavioural problems that afflict them and their supporters, they were contemptible and contemptuous all at the same time. Officials brushed aside suggestions that CSKA fans had been given access to the main stand and attempted to blame UEFA. As they left the room, they were applauded by their own media. The World Cup here will be a hoot, won’t it? All of this will irritate City, of course. It will be a frosty boardroom at the Etihad Stadium when the teams reconvene next month. Last season, the CSKA party turned up in jeans. Here, some of City’s most prominent officials – including their chairman and chief executive – didn’t even attend. That says everything. What will bug Pellegrini and his players most, however, is the result and their second half performance. Pellegrini summed it up best when he said afterwards that he hoped people would see performances of Premier League standard from his team as they go after the three wins they will need to qualify between now and mid-December. Certainly, what City continue to serve up in Europe is unrecognisable from the football they routinely play domestically. They were so superior in the first half that they should have been out of sight. By the end, though, they were hanging on for a point. Bizarre. Truly bizarre. The two sides played out the match in front of an empty stadium after CSKA Moscow's fans were banned for racist chanting . Manchester City right back Pablo Zabaleta shoots with his left foot as CSKA Moscow defender Aleksei Berezutski attempts to block the ball . CSKA Moscow midfielder Georgi Milanov grimaces as he loses a boot during the clash against the Premier League champions . And so to the good part. CSKA began the night well and were briefly lively in front of Joe Hart’s goal. A long shot from Ahmed Musa had Hart scrambling early on before former Manchester United winger Zoran Tosic cut inside to curl a left foot shot wide with Hart once again in some trouble. Certainly there was enough there early on to cause City some concern and twice in the opening twenty minutes captain Vincent Kompany had to contribute vital tackles, once to stop Tosic and then to thwart Musa after a heavy touch from the striker. Slowly, though, City took hold of the game and twice they could have taken the lead before they actually did score as Pablo Zabaleta and Milner volleyed wide of either post from tight angles after good balls from the impressive YaYa Toure. When City did score, it was a super goal. David Silva split the CSKA defence with a through ball to Edin Dzeko and the Bosnian waited for Aguero to arrive to his right before slipping the ball to his partner for his eleventh goal in as many games this season. Coming in the 29th minute, the goal served to settle City down and suck a little of the life out of the Russians. At least for the time being. As such it was no surprise that City scored again before half-time. Again it was another lovely team goal and this time Aguero played his part in its creation, volleying the ball across goal for Milner to score from a yard after Zabaleta had headed a Toure diagonal ball down in to his path. Milner jumps over the challenge of Dmitri Efremov as the CSKA Moscow man wins possession back for his side . Yaya Toure's heat map shows the Ivorian covered a huge amount of ground for Man City - CLICK HERE TO SEE MORE . There was still time for City to strike the post – Milner again – before the interval and Pellegrini’s team went in at the break knowing they were halfway to getting themselves right back in to the group. After that, though, it all went wrong. CSKA played a part in their own revival. Their coach Leonid Slutski changed his formation and threw on Seydou Doumbia, who was to be influential. Nevertheless, it was City who lost their tempo, City who lost their momentum and their pace of play. As a result, it was City who began to experience danger where previously there really hadn’t been any. The turning point arrived with 25 minutes left. City gave the ball away cheaply, central defender Eliaquim Mangala left flat-footed by a ball inside his right shoulder and when Mousa crossed low Hart and Kompany were left on their backsides as Doumbia bundled the ball in from six yards. It was a blow but it needn’t have been fatal. City were still ahead. Briefly they rallied and regained some authority but still they gave the ball away and when the defining moment arrived at the death they played their own part in it. Certainly it was a shocking decision by referee Vad. To suggest Alexsandar Kolarov impeded Doumbia was preposterous. If anything, the foul was by the attacker. But Pellegrini will have noticed that Toure initially surrendered possession with a cheap back heel in his own half and by the time Bebras Natcho despatched the penalty the City coach was buttoning up his coat in anticipation of some tough questions. Pellegrini didn’t discuss the referee but his silence on the matter spoke volumes. In terms of his team he knows the script. They are not good enough. A bad night, indeed.

"It was a transfer that added gloss to Aston Villa’s summer business. Tom Cleverley, signed initially on loan from Manchester United following a tumultuous deadline day, brought 13 England caps and one Premier League winners’ medal to a club shorn of success in recent years. A good move for the player, who wanted to escape the ‘negativity’ of Old Trafford, as well as both clubs concerned. Yet that spark has yet to ignite on Cleverley’s career in Birmingham, and the defeat at Queens Park Rangers on Monday night was an opportunity missed. His statistics from the 2-0 loss are actually fairly positive. He misplaced just seven of his 65 passes to record a success rate of 89 per cent, higher than any of his team-mates, excluding Gabriel Agbonlahor who completed only 18 passes.

Cleverley falls to the ground as QPR's Mauricio Isla (front) makes the slide tackle during Monday's match . He struck a sweet volley through a mass of bodies that Rob Green did well to keep out late on too. But that drive forward to start and finish attacking plays was missing. When your star striker is still shaking off the effects of six months spent on the sidelines through a ruptured achilles it shows. As Cleverley’s touch map shows, he was busy but rarely did he get involved at the sharp end. Only once did he touch the ball in the box, and he tried just three passes into the 18-yard area. Two failed. When he was unveiled to the press at Villa’s Bodymoor Heath training ground, he spoke about hitting both boxes and being the most advanced of a midfield trio. Manager Paul Lambert asked Cleverley to play on the left of those on Monday night, with Carlos Sanchez holding and Ashley Westwood right. Tactics heavily influence where a player makes an impact of course, but the dynamism desperately needed by Villa was lacking. Cleverley's pass map against QPR on Monday is shown on the left, with his touch map on the right . Those of us who remember the impact Cleverley made in the 2011 Community Shield know he has it within him to affect and create where it matters. He played two first-time passes, including the key assist to unlock Manchester City’s defence for Nani’s equaliser, in a fast-flowing move around the area. There was also the 8-2 win over Arsenal where he looked a player who had found himself following successful loan spells at Leicester, Watford and Wigan. The promise never quite materialised but it is worth noting that even while getting pilloried last season he made 35 appearances for club and country. The campaign before, Sir Alex Ferguson started him against Real Madrid in a match (and tie) United were winning until Nani got a straight red card. The Madrid midfield that night contained Xabi Alonso, Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira. Cleverley keeps close to Tottenham's Moussa Dembele (left) during an appearance for Manchester United . Cleverley celebrates after scoring for Manchester United against Sunderland in December 2012 . That could not have been blind faith from Ferguson, the most successful British manager in history, in a game he was desperate to win; this United academy graduate can play and fulfill instructions. Against Liverpool he came straight into the Villa team and helped carry out Lambert’s defensive plans to a tee. Brendan Rodgers’ team were pressed tight in central areas and suffocated from inflicting their usual attacking verve. That result bears contextualising with Liverpool’s recent struggles to break down defences, notably Hull last weekend. Nevertheless, Cleverley can do the dirty stuff when asked. Subsequent losses against Arsenal, Chelsea, City, and Everton saw that initial glow fade, although he has already created eight chances, compared to 10 in the whole of last season. That is what Villa, a side without a goal in more than eight hours, need from him now: vibrancy in the final third. He may never return to United, but this is his chance, at 25, to show he can still be a very good Premier League player.

"Goalkeeper Rob Green believes Monday night's victory over Aston Villa will see the QPR squad regain their confidence ahead of the west London derby with Chelsea. A brace from Charlie Austin saw Rangers pick up their second win of the season and move off the bottom of the Barclays Premier League - moving to within three points of Villa in the process. In a game of little quality, it was former Burnley forward Austin who settled the game, but Green also played his part as QPR boss Harry Redknapp saw his side pick up just their second clean sheet of the campaign. Rob Green applauds the QPR crowd after just his second clean sheet of the season during Monday night's win . The result may hold more importance for the R's, who face local rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday before welcoming reigning champions Manchester City to Loftus Road. And Green - who recovered from an illness to take his place in goal for QPR in time to replace Alex McCarthy (thigh strain) - feels he and his team-mates are now ready for the challenges ahead. 'It is pleasing to get the win, I'm delighted for everyone,' he said. 'It gives you that little bit of a lift going into two tough games. If we hadn't won you'd be looking at the next two games with a bit more concern. 'I think games at home in this respect are key so it is that bit more pleasing. It reinstalls the belief you've got. Green gets down smartly to thwart on-rushing Villa striker Christian Benteke . 'Particularly at home, you play against teams and if you really give it a go and put it to teams then sometimes they can't come up with answers. 'We asked questions of Villa going forward quickly, hitting Bobby (Zamora) and stuff like that and it proved fruitful. 'In that respect it is finding a way to win games, finding a way to cause problems and believing in our own ability as much as anything. 'If it means killing games off after an hour then so be it that is the sort of thing you have to do.' High-profile summer signing Rio Ferdinand was again left on the bench as QPR kept Villa, the league's lowest scorers with just four goals, at bay with Steven Caulker and ex-Villa defender Richard Dunne developing an understanding. The QPR No 1 has been impressed with the central defensive pairing of Steven Caulker and Richard Dunne . Both scored unfortunate own goals in the 3-2 defeat to Liverpool but were kept at the heart of Redknapp's defence on Monday night, with Green impressed by Dunne's display. 'Dunney is Dunney - he gives his all,' he added. 'He's great at what he's great at and he's a great player to play behind because you know what you're going to get. 'He is consistent in that respect. You look at something like the play-off final. He came off man of the match and proved his worth. 'You could have signed him on a 10-year contract off the back of that game. I think Dunney was in fantastic form against his old club.' Striker Charlie Austin (left) was QPR's hero with two goals, one in each half . Despite Villa going for almost nine hours without a goal, it was at the back where manager Paul Lambert was critical. Skipper Ron Vlaar was partnered in defence with Ciaran Clark and the Holland international knows the Villains need to turn around their run of five straight defeats to start breeding more faith among the players. 'It is frustrating to lose again,' he told AVTV. 'We started quite well and conceded a goal - we have to do better that is for sure. 'We have to start picking up points again, results give confidence and that is what we have to do. It is easier said than done but we have to work hard to achieve something and then build on that. 'It is always easy to talk afterwards about what went wrong and what the problems are but there is only one thing we have to do and that is step up.'","QPR beat Aston Villa 2-0 at Loftus Road on Monday night .

"Perhaps Newcastle’s players will be docked wages for this brazen disregard of club policy? For how dare they ignore the Magpie mandate - We Do Not Prioritise Cup Competitions – and do so in front of a live television audience? These were the understudies, supposed to exit stage left and allow the leading men to concentrate on the cash cow that is the Premier League. A cup run, after all, is a distraction. Ryan Taylor (left) hadn't played a competitive match for Newcastle since August 2012 . Rolando Aarons (left) scores Newcastle's opening goal of the Capital One Cup clash . But the black-and-white boys did not read the script. Instead, they defied the odds, the odds which pitched a starting XI worth £20million against the strength of a City side valued at 10 times that meagre amount. And do not forget, this was a Newcastle team which included Ryan Taylor, a player making his first appearance in 26 months and admirably making it through the 90 minutes. He was, in fact, man-of-the-match. ‘He was outstanding,’ said Alan Pardew. ‘He got a special round of applause when he came in the dressing-room afterwards and our players love him. VIDEO Pardew proud of youngsters . Aarons is congratulated by Magpies boss Alan Pardew for his early goal against Manchester City . The Newcastle fans perform the 'Poznan' to mock the City supporters after their side go 2-0 up . ‘But all of the players were magnificent and we thoroughly deserved that victory.’ Taylor had a hand in the opening goal, robbing Fernandinho to set free the brilliant Rolando Aarons who did the rest with a cool finish. He also inflicted the injury which unsettled City, his inadvertent trod on David Silva ending the Spaniard’s evening after just nine minutes. But there was nothing accidental about Newcastle’s valiant display. Aarons – returning from a six-week hamstring layoff – was a menace during the opening 45 minutes in which he outshone the likes of Stevan Jovetic and Samir Nasri. And this from an 18-year-old making only his second senior start. Newcastle have knocked City out of the Capital One Cup after goals from Aarons and Moussa Sissoko (above) Daryl Janmaat, meanwhile, has only been on Tyneside since July but, speaking before the game, he mentioned the club’s 45-year wait for a trophy – we take it he didn’t pick that up from a Pardew team-talk, for six changes reinforced Newcastle’s Premier priority. The manager, though, has to play politician and, had he named his strongest XI, it would not have been to the liking of his paymasters. But his understudies are now just two games from the biggest stage of all, how dare they… .","Newcastle caused a big upset on Wednesday night, beating Man City 2-0 .

"Ryan Taylor had not played a competitive match since August, 2012 but returned to action at the Etihad. The Newcastle utility man has spent the past 26 months on the treatment table, in the gym, in the swimming pool, even in the stands scouting – anywhere but a football field. Two cruciate-ligament injuries have been the cause of his absence but Taylor’s smile was wider than anyone else during the warm-up and his beam got even bigger after his challenge laid on the opening goal for Rolando Aarons after just seven minutes. Ryan Taylor (left) hadn't played a competitive match for Newcastle since August, 2012 . Rolando Aarons (left) scores Newcastle's opening goal of the Capital One Cup clash . Aarons is congratulated by Magpies boss Alan Pardew for his early goal against Manchester City . Toon break CITY hoodoo . It is fair to say that City have had the Indian sign over Newcastle of late. In the previous 17 meetings between the pair they had been unbeaten, winning 15 of those matches. You have to go back to a Michael Owen goal in 2005 for the last time the Toon triumphed. The Magpies had never won at the Etihad and, while we’ re at it, it was City who proved their conquerors at this stage last season, winning 2-0 after extra-time at St James’ Park. It just goes to show, history only counts for so much. No silva lining for Pellegrini . David Silva might have been forgiven for wondering why he was even involved, for the City playmaker hasn’t had much of a rest recently. Having started the previous six matches – including last week’s trek to Moscow – Silva was a surprise inclusion given the proximity of the Manchester derby. And Manuel Pellegrini paid the price with the Spaniard lasting just seven minutes before succumbing to Ryan Taylor’s early challenge. Silva has missed just one game all season – the third-round tie at home to Sheffield Wednesday – so to see him included against an under-strength Newcastle appeared somewhat needless. David Silva was forced off with an injury in the first half following a challenge from Taylor . Louis van Gaal was not present to check on City ahead of Sunday’s Manchester derby. Instead, the United boss sent trusted lieutenant Marcel Bout to run the rule over their neighbours. Perhaps the Dutch boss has done his scouting over the television, for last night’s transmission was the 12th time from 15 matches that they have been broadcast live this season. Van Gaal would no doubt have enjoyed the sight of City struggling to handle a strikeforce which cost a combined £3m – wait until Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie are unleashed this weekend… .

"Peter Schmeichel has admitted that Manchester City are now a bigger club than rivals United on form ahead of this weekend's derby match. The former goalkeeper played for both clubs, spending eight years with United from 1991 to 1999 before finishing his career at City in the 2002-03 season.

"Christian Eriksen admits Tottenham remain a 'work in progress' under Mauricio Pochettino. The Danish international has been a cornerstone of Pochettino's first season at White Hart Lane, though both player and team have been inconsistent thus far.

"After Tottenham fell to a 2-1 home defeat to Newcastle on Sunday, Sportsmail asked fans' blog SpursWeb what exactly is going wrong under manager Mauricio Pochettino. Joseph Meakin gives us 10 reasons why the former Southampton boss is finding it tough in north London. Newcastle's Ayoze Perez (left) heads his side's winning goal against Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday . Back in May I wrote for MailOnline Sport explaining how excited I was for the Mauricio Pochettino era to begin at White Hart Lane. Nine games into the Premier League season, Spurs sit 11th in the table having suffered their worst start to a league campaign since Juande Ramos' infamous return of two points from eight games in the 2009-10 season. Here is why it is going wrong for Pochettino so far. Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino throws the ball back as he watches his side lose to Newcastle at home . Europa League hangover . Three out of our four league defeats so far this season have come after matches on Thursday in the Europa League. I really do not see this as a coincidence. Although Pochettino has often made wholesale changes to his starting XIs selected between the weekend and Thursday nights, mid-week journeys to the likes of Limassol and Belgrade cannot be helping our first team players' energy levels, even if they just sit on the bench. Mentality and a lack of characters . Pochettino described Tottenham's problem as 'not tactical or physical', but to do with 'mentality' after Sunday's defeat to Newcastle. This suggests he is extremely frustrated with some of his players and and feels like they all have a lot more to give. With the likes of Sandro, Rafael van der Vaart, Lewis Holtby and Scott Parker leaving Spurs over the last few seasons, the squad does appear a little devoid of players with genuine passion for the club. Emmanuel Adebayor (right) is one of a number of senior players who needs to step up and lead from the front . It is time for experienced heads like Emmanuel Adebayor, Hugo Lloris and Younes Kaboul to lead, inspire and play by example to try and inspire some of the members of the squad who are perhaps not quite performing. Defensive weaknesses . Tottenham have conceded 13 goals in the league this season and this really is no surprise. Whilst captain Kaboul seems like a first-choice selection, it does appear that Pochettino doesn't know who his most suitable partner is. Federico Fazio, Eric Dier, Jan Vertonghen and Vlad Chiriches have all had a go next to Kaboul and have all looked pretty unremarkable. Pochettino needs to make a call, stick with a defensive pairing and bring continuity to the back line. Pochettino seems unsure whether to partner summer signing Federico Fazio with captain Younes Kaboul . Injuries to Kyle Walker and Kyle Naughton, in addition to the inability of Ben Davies to break into the first team, have also meant we have been poor at full back. I feel like it is a matter of time before Ledley King comes in as a defensive coach. Levy short-changing yet another manager? The signing of Benjamin Stambouli is a puzzling one. Pochettino seemed pretty dead certain that he wanted Morgan Schneiderlin this summer, but instead a cheaper option at holding midfield was brought in. The same applies to Fazio – a much cheaper option to Mateo Musacchio, a defender Pochettino wanted. How can Levy expect good results when the boss doesn't get the players he wants? Chairman Daniel Levy would not sanction a big-money bid for Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin . Close the revolving door . Levy has continually allowed our best players to leave, this must stop. From Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov to Luka Modric and Gareth Bale, Spurs are very much a selling club. The suits will point to the huge profits made on the that quartet alone, but what does it say about our ambition? The big test next summer will be Hugo Lloris. Arguably the league's best shot-stopper - playing behind one of the leakiest defences – would fit in at any of Europe's elite teams. Let him go and once again Levy will be adding credence to the argument that the best are just don't want to stay at Tottenham. Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris (left) is likely to attract attention from other clubs despite signing a new contract . Difficult fixtures . What must not be forgotten is that Tottenham have already played three out of last season's top four, with two of these games being away from home. We have also played bogey team West Ham – our early season fixture list has been very tough. With Aston Villa, Stoke and Hull to play next month, Pochettino has the chance to put a run together and should be targeting nine points. New signings failing to impress the manager . Nearly a quarter of the way into the season, only one new signing has managed to properly force his way into the first-team for league games. Whilst Dier has been excellent, academy prospects Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb are preferred to Benjamin Stambouli. Fazio is in and out of the team and Davies cannot seem to usurp Danny Rose at left-back. Pochettino cannot be happy. Benjamin Stambouli has failed to make an impression since joining Tottenham in the summer transfer window . Misfiring strikers . Adebayor, who could not stop scoring under Tim Sherwood, has looked like a Championship player so far under Pochettino. Soldado has also failed to impress, and his penalty miss against City shows how low his confidence must be. I find it utterly bemusing that Harry Kane hasn't yet been given a chance in the league, and Pochettino really needs to give him an opportunity. Striker Roberto Soldado misses a chance to score against Newcastle as his poor form continues . Negative atmosphere at White Hart Lane . Tottenham have the second most expensive tickets in the Premier League. The crowd expects entertainment for the prices they pay and atmospheres often become hostile and negative if things don't go to plan. Whilst White Hart Lane isn't quite as quiet as The Emirates, things do appear to be heading that way. Improvement needed. Pochettino's philosophy taking time to work . Pochettino is a modern coach with modern ideas. It took half a season of foundation laying at St Mary's before his Southampton side took the Premier League by storm. Spurs fans do need to be a little more patient. Pochettino has tried to implement his own style at White Hart Lane but it is taking time to work .

In a tight contest that looked to be headed for a stalemate, Sonupe settled the match in the closing stages as he rifled an effort into the roof of the net after the ball broke to the 18-year-old in the Chelsea box. The goal condemned the Blues to their first Under 21 Premier League defeat of the season as the home side shaded a tight match that was largely bereft of chances and quality.

Sonupe's (left) strike condemned Chelsea to their first Under 21 Premier League defeat of the season . In an entertaining first half both goalkeepers were called into action during the early stages. Chelsea striker Dominic Solanke, who made his first-team debut when he came on as a second-half substitute during last week's 6-0 Champions League win over Maribor, saw his effort smothered by Spurs keeper Luke McGee. And moments later influential Tottenham midfielder Christian Ceballos forced Chelsea keeper Mitchell Beeney into a smart save.

And it was Spurs keeper McGee, who had remained a by-stander for much of the half, that had to react brilliantly to tip Fankaty Dabo's effort over the bar. Chelsea finished the first half the stronger of the two sides as McGee had to be alert again to keep out Alex Davey's header before the 19-year-old saved from Solanke as the half ended goalless. Chelsea started brightly after the interval and Charly Masonda hit a rasping drive but the 18-year-old's strike whistled over McGee's goal.

As the second half began to fizzle out Alex Kiwomya's low drive on 82 minutes took a wicked deflection on the way through to McGee, who got down superbly to make a one-handed save.

Stoke City vs Southampton (7.45pm) Tottenham Hotspur vs Brighton and Hove Albion (7.45pm) LIVERPOOL AND BALOTELLI HOPING FOR CUP COMFORT . Their inconsistent form has probably already put paid to a repeat of last season's Premier League challenge, so Liverpool may well target one of the Cups. After their marathon penalty shoot-out success against Middlesbrough in round three, they now face Swansea City at Anfield on Tuesday night. With changes expected to be made, it remains to be seen if the misfiring Mario Balotelli - who still has just the one goal since his arrival - is given another chance to prove himself. The Reds have already suffered five defeats this season and though the Capital One Cup is last on their list of priorities, another one here will be sorely felt. Misfiring Mario Balotelli will be hoping to retain his place and find some form for Liverpool against Swansea . SWANSEA HOPING FOR REPEAT PERFORMANCE . Swansea won 3-1 at Anfield at this same stage in 2012 en route to lifting the League Cup, the first major piece of silverware in the club's history. Garry Monk's side have started the Premier League season well - currently sitting sixth - and they will hope this form translates to the Cup. They've already dumped out one Merseyside opponent already, beating Everton 3-0 in the last round. Having been part of that 2013-winning team, Monk will fancy another long Cup run and is expected to resist wholesale changes to his line-up, though Wayne Routledge and Gylfi Sigurdsson will be rested. Monk is, of course, going head-to-head with a former manager at Swansea in Brendan Rodgers. Chico Flores (centre) was on target when Swansea beat Liverpool 3-1 at this stage two seasons ago . SHREWSBURY'S BIG NIGHT . This was the fixture that jumped out from the fourth round draw - a real David vs Goliath tie in the best of Cup tradition. A staggering 72 places separate Premier League leaders Chelsea and their League Two opponents Shrewsbury but a sell-out crowd at the Greenhous Meadow will be cheering on the underdogs. The Shrews have already dumped Blackpool, Leicester City and Norwich City out of the competition and their manager Micky Mellon believes anything can happen. 'We aren't here to clap people on to the pitch,' he said. 'We going to try and knock them out. We know the task is massive but we want to reach the quarter-finals.' While Chelsea's squad cost £307m to assemble, the Shrews' side was put together on a shoestring. But knockout football can be a great leveller. Shrewsbury manager Micky Mellon (right) celebrates with Andy Robinson after their win at Leicester . SHOWCASE FOR CHELSEA'S KIDS . Chelsea have one of the best academies in the country and are the current holders of the U21 Premier League and FA Youth Cup. And some of their emerging talents are likely to feature at Shrewsbury on Tuesday, including Lewis Baker, Nathan Ake, Dominic Solanke and Jeremie Boga. Dutch defender Ake has already tasted first-team football and started in the last round against Bolton. England Under 20 international Baker has made just one first-team appearance but is hotly tipped to become a star for club and country. Solanke is also highly-regarded by Mourinho and came on last week in the Champions League match with Maribor. He helped England win the Under 17 European Championships in the summer. French playmaker Boga, 17, is a regular starter in the Under 21 Premier League and the UEFA Youth League. Dominic Solanke featured in Chelsea's Champions League win over Maribor last week . BOURNEMOUTH HOPING TO CONTINUE SCORING SPREE . Nobody will fancy taking on the in-form Cherries at the moment, especially after their 8-0 rout of Birmingham at the weekend. Eddie Howe's team sit fourth in the Championship and they have won their last four matches, so this will be a real test for Alan Irvine's West Brom. It is 51 years since Bournemouth last made it to the fourth round and this is the furthest they've ever progressed, so history could be made on Tuesday night. 'They are really nice milestones because you don't set out to achieve things like that... hopefully someone will be talking in 50 years' time about this team,' said Howe. Irvine must decide whether to rest players ahead of the weekend trip to Leicester but that could prove a dangerous strategy. Bournemouth celebrate Mark Pugh's (right) goal on Saturday, the fifth in their 8-0 win at Birmingham City . LEAGUE ONE DUO HOPING TO MAKE A NAME FOR THEMSELVES . As Bradford City proved when they reached the final in 2013, lower league clubs can progress in this competition. So though the meeting of League One sides MK Dons and Sheffield United is not the most glamorous tie of the round, both will see it as an opportunity. The Dons created a seismic shock when they thrashed Manchester United 4-0 in the second round and are into the fourth round for the first time in their history. The Blades, who profited from an unexpected run to the semi-finals of last season's FA Cup, enter the contest in good form, having won their last three matches. MK Dons striker Benik Afobe celebrates his goal during their 4-0 rout of Man United in the second round . ANOTHER CHANCE FOR KIT SYMONS TO STAKE HIS CLAIM . When these two sides met back in August, Derby thrashed sorry-looking Fulham 5-1. Fast forward two months and the London side are a very different proposition. Caretaker boss Kit Symons has galvanised the Cottagers since he took over from Felix Magath and has won five of his eight matches in temporary charge. A win against Derby on Tuesday night and a place in the last eight of the Cup will further boost his chances. Steve McClaren's team are currently top of the Championship but produced their worst performance for some time in losing at home to Wigan at the weekend. Still, they will head to Craven Cottage as the favourites. Kit Symons has another opportunity to stake his claim for the Fulham job on a full-time basis against Derby . SAINTS HOPING KOEMAN RENAISSANCE CONTINUES . After that exodus of talent in the summer, few expected to see Southampton second in the Premier League table at the start of November. Ronald Koeman reinvested the transfer cash shrewdly and with the likes of Graziano Pelle, Sadio Mane and Dusan Tadic impressing, they are flying high. Having beaten Stoke 1-0 at St Mary's on Saturday, they face a quick re-match at the Britannia on Wednesday night. Stoke boss Mark Hughes lifted the League Cup with three different clubs - Manchester United, Chelsea and Blackburn - and back-to-back home wins over Swansea and Newcastle suggest their fortunes are improving. Mark Hughes and Ronald Koeman are set for a speedy reunion when Stoke host Southampton on Wednesday . NASRI SET FOR MAN CITY RETURN AGAINST NEWCASTLE . After losing further ground in the title race at West Ham on Saturday, Manchester City will be seeking a return to winning ways when they play Newcastle at the Etihad on Wednesday night. With a derby against United looming on Sunday, Manuel Pellegrini is expected to make changes and Samir Nasri could return after a month out following groin surgery. City lifted the League Cup last season and regard the competition as worthwhile. They will start as clear favourites against Newcastle. Sunday's win at Tottenham lifted some of the pressure on manager Alan Pardew but he'll admit the Cup plays second fiddle to trying to avoid a relegation struggle this season. Samir Nasri is set to make his return from injury when Manchester City take on Newcastle . BRIGHTON SEEKING TO PILE MORE MISERY ON SPURS . Tottenham were heavily criticised after throwing away the lead to lose at home to Newcastle United on Sunday and recent results have shown they are far from top four material. The Cup should offer some comfort to Mauricio Pochettino and his under-performing team but they'll have to be on their guard against Brighton on Wednesday night. Pochettino is likely to rotate his squad for the visit of Sami Hyypia's men, who currently sit one place outside the relegation zone after a very disappointing start to the season. Having said that, Brighton have gone 10 league matches without a win and so Spurs will start as clear favourites.

"Spanish newspaper AS has made it clear who it sees as the favourite for the Ballon d'Or award with a headline that read 'Cristiano Ronaldo and 22 more', after the 23 nominees for the prestigious award were announced on Tuesday. The Real Madrid forward has made a blistering start to the season, with 21 club goals in 14 games, and earlier this year he inspired Los Blancos to a Champions League and Copa del Rey double. Ronaldo is the current holder of the award and he will hope to lift the trophy ahead of Barcelona's Lionel Messi who was given the accolade every year between 2010 and 2012. Spanish newspaper AS believes Cristiano Ronaldo is the heavy favourite for the Ballon d'Or . Over in France, L'Equipe has questioned the Spanish FA's decision to ban Zinedine Zidane from coaching for three months due to him not having the required Level 3 qualification to coach in La Liga.

It's not the first time that supermarket brand and Sturridge have formed a partnership. Earlier in October, Sturridge posted a picture on Instagram of him at a Sainsbury's checkout with the message: 'Late night shop... What's everyone's fave food?'

In his absence the Anfield outfit have struggled domestically and in Europe with Reds boss Brendan Rodgers desperate for him to overcome his injury. Sturridge scored 22 Premier League goals for the Merseysiders last season and and Rodgers is keen to get the forward back in the team and scoring. 'Top players have such an influence on the team,' said Rodgers. 'When you are under the cosh, you know that you have strikers who can score out of nothing. 'When you have that as a team, it is a big weapon. Sturridge is one of them. That is where we aim to get with Daniel.' Despite missing the last two months of the season, the Liverpool boss is confident Sturridge will be firing on all cylinders when he makes his comeback. 'When he comes back into the team, you will see the confidence because of the movement and the dynamic. But he isn’t fit and he hasn’t been for a long time,' he added.

Emnes will also be hoping for some game time, having not made an appearance for the Swans in over a month. The dutch striker scored his only goal of the season in the third round of the competition against Everton. Liverpool will be looking to bounce back from disappointing results against Hull City and Real Madrid in their previous two games, and are expected to field a strong side.

"Garry Monk escaped FA punishment after comments made about referee Michael Oliver in the wake of penalty controversy at Stoke. The official handed the Potters a penalty after Victor Moses appeared to dive, with the Swansea manager scathing in his assessment after the 2-1 defeat last Sunday. Monk - who called for the introduction of retrospective action to stop simulation - had been ordered to explain his comments to the FA but will now face no action. Swansea boss Garry Monk believes the introduction of retrospective punishment would improve football . Monk was not happy with the way Stoke winger Moses fell to the ground to win a penalty on Sunday . Swansea defender Angel Rangel was penalised for fouling Nigerian international Moses .

Click here to read Monk's comments in full . He insisted that he stood by his remarks, which included telling Moses he should be ‘ashamed’ of the manner in which he won a soft penalty – a decision by Oliver that Monk branded ‘disgraceful’. A Swansea statement read: 'Swansea City can confirm that the Football Association will not be taking any further action regarding media comments made by manager Garry Monk following the recent Barclay Premier League fixture at Stoke City. 'The FA, who asked Monk for his observations following the fixture, has reminded the Swansea manager about his responsibilities regarding media comments.' Monk, who says he would fine any member of the Swansea team who dives in a match or training, had gone on to claim that retrospective bans and financial penalties would be the only way to deal with simulation. He added: ‘I've spoken to all our players.

"Harry Redknapp has admitted he must use Bobby Zamora sparingly to control the QPR striker's chronic hip problems. Rangers boss Redknapp hailed the 33-year-old's resolve for playing through the pain, but conceded the former Tottenham forward cannot last a full 90 minutes. Zamora has battled rumbling hip complaints for almost two years, but Redknapp said QPR are fighting to keep him in action as long as possible. Bobby Zamora gets ready to pick himself up after a challenge during Monday night's win over Aston Villa . Zamora trains alongside his QPR team-mates in London earlier this week . 'Bobby has been very important for us,' said Redknapp, ahead of Saturday's Premier League trip to Chelsea. 'After about 60 to 65 minutes he has to come off, but when he's on the pitch he has been outstanding. 'We were bringing him off the bench to start with, but we've reversed it and started him recently. 'He's been captain and great in the dressing room, I couldn't be more pleased with Bobby. 'He's got his hip but he manages it and when he plays he's been great and his attitude has been first class.' Zamora celebrates with Charlie Austin after his striker partner scored the first of two goals on Monday night . Zamora is taken off by Harry Redknapp in the second half of Monday night's win . Zamora proved a constant thorn for Liverpool's defence when QPR lost out 3-2 at Loftus Road despite a battling performance, and impressed again when Rangers saw off Aston Villa 2-0 on Monday night. The Barking-born target man has added an extra focal point to QPR's attack, freeing up Charlie Austin and Eduardo Vargas to push for goal-poaching opportunities.

"Roberto Martinez has hailed Samuel Eto'o's impact on Everton's squad and described his signing as a 'gift from the footballing Gods'. Eto'o's influences on Everton's team has been growing with each week and he was outstanding in last Sunday's 3-1 win at Burnley, scoring twice and coming within the width of a post of collecting the match ball. Martinez moved late to sign the Cameroonian in the final days of the transfer window, taking the chance to recruit him as a free agent after Liverpool opted to pursue a £16million deal for Mario Balotelli instead. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez call Samuel Eto'o a gift from the gods . Everton manager Roberto Martinez has said the signing of Samuel Eto'o is a 'gift from the footballing Gods' Samuel Eto'o's stunning curled effort ensured Everton's three points late on as the Toffees beat Burnley . The deal already looks smart business as Eto'o has scored four times but, more than anything, it is the impact he has had on Everton's dressing room that has so impressed Everton's manager. 'Nothing changes from our point of view in terms of how we will use him,' said Martinez. 'Having Samuel Eto'o here is like a gift from the footballing Gods for us. He is the perfect ingredient for our young players, a phenomenal example. 'The way he has been working to get his fitness is pristine. He is a player of the highest, highest calibre. To see his performance on Sunday – and every role he has played so far – has been so exciting and his knowhow has been very important, particularly in European games. 'But the way he took his finishes at Burnley was like the old days. I hope he can enjoy his football here and we are working hard to make that happen. I think he is enjoying it and that is very important. Eto'o is a phenomenal example for Everton's youngsters, including Ross Barkley (left), according to Martinez . Samuel Eto'o worked his socks off in Everton’s win at Turf Moor. Far from his more familiar role as a target man, he played as an attacking midfielder in support of Romelu Lukaku. Though  playing down the left, he moved across the width of the pitch, as the heat map of his main areas of activity shows (below). And he put in a shift in his own box for corners too. Not too shabby for a 33-year-old. 'He has that stimulation to win things. He comes in every day with the highest standards and he wants more work. I think Everton can give him an important chapter in his career.' Eto'o could retain his place on Saturday when Everton seek their third consecutive win in the Barclays Premier League against Swansea, the club with whom Martinez started his managerial career. He expects Romelu Lukaku, who suffered what Martinez called 'a couple of heavy knocks' at Turf Moor last Sunday, to be in contention and Martinez is thrilled with the attacking options Everton have. Martinez is thrilled with his attacking options and Eto'o could retain his place for the visit of Swansea . 'We started the season well in terms of our attacking play,' said Martinez. 'We have been able to score in every game and there have been eight different scores so far. The goals we scored against Chelsea showed we have the potential to hurt anyone. 'We were a bit soft at the back early on and conceded some goals that affected results. Rom is getting stronger game by game and we are very happy with the squad. I just want them to be in the best physical shape for the second half of the season. 'But we are a lot tighter now, we have had back-to-back wins and it has been good to enjoy good performances in Europe.

"Michael Higdon came off the bench and scored two late goals to send Nigel Clough’s Sheffield United into the quarter-finals. Striker Higdon, 31, headed his first on 86 minutes from Jose Baxter’s cross and added his second four minutes later with a shot into the bottom left-hand corner to snatch a dramatic victory. MK Dons’ two brightest young prospects, both of interest to Premier League clubs, had combined to put their side ahead. Michael Higdon (left) of Sheffield United celebrates scoring the winning goal at Stadium mk . Higdon strikes to score his second goal that sealed a Sheffield United comeback .

Subs not used: Turner, McGinn, Kennedy, Dimaio. Booked: Alcock, Baxter. Scorer: Higdon 86, 90. Man of the match: Delle Alli. Referee: Roger East 6. Delle Alli, the 18-year-old starlet with a wealth of admirers in high places, enticed a foul in the box with an electric run before Benfik Afobe, 21, an on-loan Arsenal striker confidently netted from the spot for his sixth Capital One Cup goal of the season. Alli lit up the second round as MK Dons dispatched Manchester United 4-0. This fourth-round tie had little of the magic of that occasion but Alli again showed why he is being courted by the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal. MK Dons breakthrough came in the 66th minute when Alli was brought down by Craig Alcock and Afobe coolly slotted home. It was a rare moment of quality until the dramatic late finish. If one action summed up a lacklustre first half it was United defender Robert Harris’s free kick from 25 yards out in the 40th minute which he lamely lifted high and wide. MK Dons started brightly, with Afobe coming close to connecting with a looping ball into the box from Tom Flanagan in the second minute. Afobe admitted wanting to impress Arsene Wenger, ahead of his contract running out at the end of this season. Holding midfielder Alli looks a classy prospect and linked up well with Afobe. Alli sparkled in the second half, skipping away from challenges and creating space for his teammates. But it was the United who dominated the opening stages of the second half. Clough shook his head in disbelief as his side failed to score in the second minute after the break when a group of players in the box lunged for the ball but missed the chance to score. Clough again had head in hands when Stefan Scougall headed over by he was dancing with joy at the final whistle thanks to Higdon’s heroics. There was plenty of grabbing and grappling in the box in the second minute of the second half when several Sheffield United players were held by MK Dons defenders. This went unpunished by referee Roger East. East was more inclined to reach for his book when Dele Alli was floored by a sliding tackle by Craig Alcock. heffield United manager Nigel Clough looks on during the Fourth Round tie .

The 37-year-old has given thought to retiring since his stunning stoppage of George Groves in May, not least because his hopes of boxing in the world’s fight capital had apparently died with Chavez’s reluctance to face him. Those talks with the Mexican former world champion resumed at the weekend, however, and further significant discussions are scheduled for later this week.

Froch said: ‘I’ve said before if I can’t fight in Vegas I’ll probably call it a day. It has to be big, and Chavez Jr is that man, and I have had a good chat with my promoter and we are making good progress with that fight and hopefully we’ll have an announcement soon.’ Hearn, who believes the fight would most likely happen in early 2015, added: ‘As we all know, anything can happen in boxing, but I am hopeful that a fight can be made with Chavez in Las Vegas. ‘Chavez’s situation with his promoters, Top Rank, is complicated, but one way or the other I believe this fight will now take place. 'For Carl, it has always been his dream to fight in Vegas so it is a fight we will try hard to finalise. ‘It had seemingly died in the water, but I took a call from Top Rank on Saturday and they wanted to explore the possibilities further. 'I am now expecting to be on a conference call with Chavez’s representatives later this week where we will try to make more progress.’ If Froch vacates, DeGale will likely fight for the belt early in 2015, with Hearn considering a Wembley bout between Froch and DeGale next summer if they both emerge unscathed.

"Everton’s South African midfielder Steven Pienaar has admitted the death of his team-mate Senzo Meyiwa is ‘difficult to understand’. Meyiwa, 27, was gunned down as he tried to protect his pop-star girlfriend Kelly Khumalo after masked raiders broke into her house late on Sunday night. Pienaar said on Everton’s website: ‘I want to express my sincere sympathy to Senzo’s family and friends at this very sad time. To lose your life at a young age when you have so much ahead of you is tragic and very difficult to understand. Everton's Steven Pienaar said the death of Senzo Meyiwa was both tragic and difficult to understand . The goalkeeper last played for his club on the Saturday evening and had recently captained his country . 'Senzo was a very talented goalkeeper who was well-liked by team-mates and opponents alike. Our nation has lost a popular sportsman and he will be missed.’ South Africa will decide later this week whether to call off next month’s African Cup of Nations qualifier against Sudan. South African president Jacob Zuma led the grieving yesterday saying: ‘Words cannot express the nation’s shock at this loss.’ He added that the police would ‘leave no stone unturned in finding his killers’. This weekend’s derby between Meyiwa’s club side Orlando Pirates and their Soweto rivals Kaizer Chiefs has already been called off as a mark of respect.

"All the world's gold and platinum ore came from outer space after a mammoth meteorite shower battered the Earth more than four billion years ago, scientists revealed today. Researchers also discovered there is enough gold and platinum in the Earth's core to plate the surface of the globe with a layer of priceless bling four metres thick. These huge gold deposits appeared during the Earth's formation when molten iron sank to its centre, dragging with it vast quantities of precious metals. Rock on: Gold and platinum arrived on Earth from space, claim scientists . This left the Earth lacking gold and platinum until a cataclysmic meteor shower bombarded the earth 200 million years later. A staggering 20 billion billion tonnes of meteorite matter, including gold and platinum, slammed into the earth during the 200million-year-long shower. Geologists at the University of Bristol have discovered this mammoth meteorite shower replenished the earth's lost reserves of precious metals. Rock samples found in Greenland - which were formed at the Earth's formation - contained a marginally higher ratio of the tungsten isotope 182W compared to more modern rock. Therefore, modern rock must have come from a meteorite shower which proves today's gold and platinum deposits came from outer space. Spaced out: Gold arrived on Earth during a monster meteor shower lasting 200 million years . Dr Matthias Willbold and Professor Tim Elliott, of the Bristol Isotope Group in the School of Earth Sciences, led the research. Dr Willbold said: ‘Extracting tungsten from the rock samples and analysing its isotopic composition to the precision required was extremely demanding given the small amount of tungsten available in rocks. ‘In fact, we are the first laboratory world-wide that has successfully made such high-quality measurements. ‘Our work shows that most of the precious metals on which our economies and many key industrial processes are based have been added to our planet by lucky coincidence when the Earth was hit by about 20 billion billion tonnes of asteroidal material.’ The metals from these earth-shattering meteorites were stirred into the planet's mantle by gigantic convection processes. These later emerged in newly formed continents, concentrated in the ore deposits which are mined today. The research, published in Nature, was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council, the Science and Technology Facilities Council and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.",There's enough gold and platinum on Earth for a 4m-thick layer that covers the entire surface .
"Divorced parents are often in denial about how badly the break-up has damaged their children, a survey has found. More than three quarters believed their children had ‘coped well’ – even though just 18 per cent of youngsters said they were happy with the situation. Many parents fail to notice that their children are turning to drink and drugs, or even considering suicide, the poll found. Some were insensitive enough to break the news of the divorce to their children by text. A Netmums survey has revealed that parents underestimate the impact divorce has on their children . One in five of the children polled felt there was no point confiding in either their mother or father because they were ‘too wrapped up in themselves’. The survey, by parenting website Netmums, polled about 1,000 divorced parents and 100 children aged eight to 18 from broken homes. Three quarters of adults believed their children had 'coped well' while just 18 per cent of children said they felt happy . Although it featured only a relatively small pool of youngsters, a stark picture emerged of the struggles that many of them face when coping with their parents’ break-up. One in 20 had turned to alcohol and one in nine had deliberately wounded themselves. A further 6 per cent had considered suicide, while two of those polled had tried to kill themselves. Almost a third described themselves as devastated by divorce, while one in 12 thought that it meant their mothers and fathers ‘didn’t love them’ and had ‘let  them down’. But despite the damage wrought by their parents splitting, few children felt able to speak openly and honestly about their emotions. Nearly 40 per cent said they hid their feelings from their parents because they did not want to  upset them. Many children felt forced to look after their mothers and fathers as the relationship broke down, and 35 per cent claimed that one parent had tried to turn them against  the other. To make things worse, parents often vastly underestimated the impact of their behaviour on their sons and daughters, the survey found. Only 8 per cent admitted trying to turn their children against their partner. And just 10 per cent said their children had seen them fighting – even though 31 per cent of youngsters told of witnessing rows. One in ten knew their children were hiding their true feelings about the divorce but fewer than one per cent were aware of them drinking, self harming or taking drugs to cope. Meanwhile, just 5 per cent guessed their children blamed themselves for the split – even though 13 per cent of youngsters admitted feeling this way. One in ten parents thought their offspring were actually ‘relieved’ they had left their partner. Children felt unable to talk about their emotions, with 40 per cent saying they hid their feeling from parents . The survey found the most common way to break the news about the divorce was for mothers to tell their children face-to-face. But 13 per cent of youngsters had heard the revelation during a row and one per cent had been told about it by text. Once the parents had decided to break up, two in five of those polled said they left that day, with 18  per cent leaving the family home within a week. In many cases, they never returned. Almost a quarter of youngsters said that they had not seen their father since the split. Both the parents and children polled wanted better support during the separation, such as counselling and the opportunity to talk to someone outside the family. The findings have been released ahead of January 6, dubbed D-Day, as the day that many couples, struggling after a stressful family Christmas, finally file for divorce. Almost a third described themselves as devastated by divorce, while one in 12 thought that it meant their mothers and fathers 'didn¿t love them' and had 'let  them down' Netmums founder Siobhan  Freegard called for parents to talk more to their children about their feelings. ‘Divorce may be a little word but it has a huge effect,’ she said. ‘It’s estimated that one in three children see their parents separate before the age of 16. ‘While experts acknowledge it is better to come from a broken family than live in one, this research shows not enough is being done to support youngsters through the break-up process. ‘While divorce may be the best thing for many families, we have to ensure children are helped to understand the split isn’t their fault and that they are still loved.’","Netmums survey reveals parents deluding themselves about divorce .

"Australians are being told to brace for a summer of early and devastating bushfires as  figures reveal half the country is at above average risk. Two years of persistent droughts along the eastern states, coupled with a predicted hot spell for spring and summer, will bring the threat of bushfires forward for much of the eastern seaboard, South Australia and large parts of Western Australia. A study published by the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre shows the regions at 'above normal' risk and the trending weather patterns increasing the bushfire threat. Scroll down for video . The risk of bushfires across the country are highest along the eastern seaboard and Western Australia . An illustrated graphic showing the predicted fire threats show half of the nation faces an above normal risk. In the east of Australia, the prevalence of fire is greatest in  NSW, Victoria and Queensland - a state which has been declared 75 per cent drought affected. Above normal fire potential has been assessed for most of south east Queensland, from Biloela in the north west down to the NSW Border. Above average temperatures for NSW and Victoria, and very little rainfall on the horizon for either state could bring a fire season 'slightly more active than 2013-14,' the centre's data revealed. In NSW, the state's coastal table lands and central slopes have been declared a high-fire danger, while in Victoria the central Wimmera and Malle regions are at risk. Centre CEO Richard Thornton said densely populated zones in dry forested areas that have received little rain will be worse affected. 'The forested area in the east - that covers southern Queensland, most of eastern NSW and down through into Victoria - is largely driven by rainfall deficits over a long period of time,' centre CEO Richard Thornton said. 'That is leading to much higher than normal levels of potential for fire in the coming year.' Australians should brace for 'above normal' bushfire threats in large parts of the country . Bushfires could come earlier  than they did in 2013 - the warmest Australian year on record . Planning for the bushfire season can never start to early . He said it is unlikely that even big rain events like those experienced in Queensland and NSW in recent weeks will alter the outlook. 'We'll always get rainfall somewhere. What it will do is delay the onset a bit in general, but a few good, hot days will dry that out,' he said. In Australia's less populated regions, higher-than-average rainfall has increased the  risk of grass fires on the Nullarbor Plain, in the mid-west and desert regions of Western Australia and South Australia's Eyre Peninsula. 'The south central parts of WA, through the midwest and the desert region, is dominated by a fairly wet period that has caused the grass to grow in this area.' Dr Thornton urged Australians to prepare now for the bushfire season. 'It's never too early to start to prepare,' he said. There is physical preparation that you can do and there is a bunch of other things you can do like your fire plans. 'Make sure you've got them written down, know what you are going to do if a fire threatens, no what your triggers are going to be.' ACT: Strong winter grass growth, predicted above average spring temperatures and lower recent rainfall suggest above normal bushfire risk. NSW: Well below average rain and warm temperatures to August drying heavy forest fuels but reducing grass growth. Dry, warm spring expected in south. Above normal fire conditions expected in the east. QLD: Drought has curbed grass grown and grass fire risk but forest fuels are drying out. Above normal fire potential in much of southeast. SA: Increased grass fire risk in parts of north west Pastoral, west coast, eastern and lower Eyre Peninsula, Flinders and mid-north with grass growth from above average rain. Likely longer fire season. TAS: Above normal potential for fires expected only in Swansea/St Helens/Fingal region. VIC: Above average fire risk expected in much of central, north and western Victoria. Early and slightly more active fire season than last summer expected. WA: Low rain, dry soil and high fuel loads increases fire risk in southwest forests. Above average rain in the mid-west, south and desert regions produce higher grass fire potential.","A lack of rain and warm conditions will fuel bushfires along the east coast .
In WA, recent rain will provide fuel for the grass fires to burn increase .

"David Cameron showed how deep his support for British Fashion goes – literally - last night at a reception to celebrate the start of the London Collections for Men at Downing Street. Tieless, in a Richard James suit, Charles Tyrwhitt shirt and Oliver Sweeney shoes, the patriotically attired PM also revealed he was wearing M&S pants. But it seems shopping is not his strong point, as he admits he instead of being allowed to browse freely, he is instead banished to the changing rooms. All together now: David Cameron was joined by Dylan Jones, Natalie Massenet, Tom Ford and key figures in the men's fashion world . He said: 'When I go shopping my wife doesn't . allow me to look around the store at all. I am put in a changing room . and things are passed to me like you would pass food to a prisoner.' The London Collections of Men are now in their second year and celebrate the successes of British men’s fashion – a sector that accounts for 50 per cent of the luxury goods market. This year, London has pulled off something of a coup as big name designers Alexander McQueen and Tom Ford – the latter who attended last night's Downing Street event - will both stage catwalk shows in the capital instead of Milan. In the name of fashion: David Cameron hosted a reception at No. 10 Downing Street this evening to celebrate the launch of London Collections: Men . Chatting fashion: The PM chatted enthusiastically to designer Tom Ford ahead of Men's Fashion Week . Celebrating alongside the fashion industry elite last night were singer Tinie Tempah - GQ magazine’s best dressed male of 2012 - and dapper male model David Gandy. And to show just how deep his commitment to the British fashion industry goes, David Cameron divulged: ‘I go to bed every night with a designer; and wake up every morning with a designer. 'The same one, obviously; my wife Samantha.’ Which doesn’t sound like hard work at all. Fashion's famous faces: The likes of designer Tommy Hilfiger and Dee Ocleppo attended as well as popstar Tinie Tempah .

"Hallucinogenic drugs may actually be good for you, a team of researchers has concluded. Norwegian scientists have carried out extensive research on the effects of LSD - or trips - by studying drugs surveys from tens of thousands of Americans. The findings are at odds with the long held belief that LSD and other 'mind-enhancing' drugs - such as mescaline and the drug psilocybin, found in magic mushrooms -  result in flashbacks, paranoia and long term mental health problems. Norwegian scientists have carried out extensive research on the effects of 'mind-enhancing' drugs - such as mescaline and the drug psilocybin, found in magic mushrooms - by studying drugs surveys from tens of thousands of Americans . Researchers Pal-Orjan Johansen and Teri Krebs from Norway’s University of Science and Technology in Trondheim examined the drug taking habits of more than 130,000 American citizens between 2001 and 2004. Last year the duo even recommended that LSD could be an effective treatment for alcoholism. Some 22,000 of those surveyed had taken psychedelic drugs at least once. Their findings were published in the science journal PLOS One. They wrote: 'There were no significant associations between lifetime use of any psychedelics, or use of LSD in the past year, and an increased rate of mental health problems. Rather, in several cases psychedelic use was associated with a lower rate of mental health problems.' Mr Johansen said that previous studies on the psychedelic drugs had not proved that they caused chronic health problems in an interview with Norway’s English-language news website, The Local. Dr Timothy Leary Phd (who died in May 1996) an American writer psychologist, was an advocate of psychedelic drug research and use. He is pictured here holding a press conference in New York . Mrs Krebs added: 'Everything has some risk; psychedelics can elicit temporary feelings of anxiety and confusion, but accidents leading to serious injury are extremely rare. 'Over the past 50 years, tens of millions of people have used psychedelics and there is just not much evidence of long-term problems.' Instead, they said, the idea that the drugs caused mental health problems came from a small number of case studies, and that these patients were already suffering some form of mental illness. They said psychedelic drug use and mental health problems both occurred in late adolescence and so were wrongly linked by researchers, the Independent reports. Last year, the pair wrote in the British Journal of Psychopharmacology that  one dose of LSD was 'a highly effective treatment' for alcoholics, and was 'just as effective' as approved and currently used medications. Sixty per cent of the patients tested who had been given a dose of LSD had either stopped drinking completely or were drinking less than they were before taking the drug.","Study of drugs surveys on effects of LSD on tens of thousands of Americans .

"Two Mexican nationals were arrested in south Texas yesterday in connection to the December Target credit card breach which compromised the personal bank information of an estimated 100million customers. McAllen, Texas police arrested 27-year-old Mary Carmen Garcia and 28-year-old Daniel Guardiola Dominguez as they were trying to cross into the U.S. from Reynosa, Mexico. Both are from Monterrey, Mexico. Police say the couple crossed into the U.S. last weekend with 100 fraudulent cards and spent tens of thousands of dollars and brought an addition 96 cards with them on Sunday. Arrested: Police arrested 27-year-old Mary Carmen Garcia (left) and 28-year-old Daniel Guardiola Dominguez (right)  trying to cross into the U.S. Sunday with credit card information believed to have been acquired in a December security breach of Target . Loot: Garcia and Dominguez's mugshots are displayed on a poster board behind dozens of credits cards found on them as they attempted to enter the country from Mexico on Sunday . The credit cards they were carrying are believed to contain information obtained in the Target secuirty breach last month, which resulted in the release of credit and debit card information belonging to 40 million customers and the account and personal information of an additional 70 million customers. The credit cards Garcia and Dominguez were carrying were from Mexican banks but contained the account information of south Texas residents. Chief Victor Rodriguez of the McAllen Police Department told The Monitor they already had warrants on the couple so when they tried to cross the Anzalduas International Bridge, they were arrested on the spot. Fraud: An estimated 100million Target customers had their credit and debit card information released in a breach of the retail chain last month . But police believe Garcia and Dominquez are just two of a larger group out to exploit the stolen credit cards. 'Every day that goes by we think that the Target breach data may be devaluating so there will be more pressure to capitalize on them sooner rather than later,' Chief Rodriguez told KGBT. More information on the couple will be released after formal charges are filed.","McAllen, Texas Police arrested Mary Carmen Garcia, 27, and Daniel Guardiola Dominguez, 28, on Sunday .

"Susan Aflak was working punishing hours as an investment banker when a trip down to a lunch truck gave her an idea. If lunch could be delivered quickly and easily to her downtown LA office, why couldn't a manicure? That lightbulb moment inspired her to quit her job in finance and launch La Lacquerie, the first on-demand mobile manicure truck catering to time-short professionals in need of a quick fix. Based in San Francisco, a company can call to book the truck to park outside its office. La Lacquerie then pulls up curbside, and opens to employees or passers-by. Polished: Based in San Francisco, a company can call to book the La Lacquerie manicure truck to park outside its office. It then pulls up curbside, and opens to employees or passers-by . 'When I was in banking I was working such crazy hours. I never had time to run beauty errands or do anything for myself,' the 33-year-old told MailOnline. 'Nails were the one thing I did for myself and it was always such a hassle to take my one Saturday or Sunday and schlep across town to get my nails done. But while I was working, I would run downstairs to food trucks all the time. I thought to myself, if only there was a way to combine the food truck model with beauty service.' Aflak put together a business plan, purchased a 26ft Airstream trailer and even went back to beauty school to get her manicurist license. La Lacquerie was born in January 2014 and Aflak has been on a roll ever since. Manicures in La Lacquerie's pink plush interior range from $16 to $38, with pedicures costing between $19 and $45. The manicures are full salon quality from top coat to base polish, and the pedicures are given 'dry' with a hot towel wrap to soften the skin. Lightbulb moment: Susan Aflak came up with the idea for La Laquerie while getting a bite at a food truck. If lunch could be delivered quickly and easily to her office, why couldn't a manicure? 'A lot of salons skimp out. They'll use the nice polish but everything else is lower quality' Aflak explained. 'Our products are all top-quality salon products. The polishes are OPI and Essie.' Up to three nail technicians are on-site at all times ready to accommodate walk ins, and Aflak herself even pitches in. 'I thought to myself, if only there was a way to combine the food truck model with beauty service' 'I'm on the trailer at all times doing work. I oversee the nail techs, I roll up my sleeves and do services when we're busy. I check people in, I check people out, I help people pick colors. I also do all the finance and accounting for the business,' she said. The truck is a large part of what immediately brought La Lacquerie attention. Aflak spent a year renovating the gigantic 1960s trailer she purchased on Craigslist, and installed plush seating, pink curtains and a crystal chandelier. 'People love the Airstream - I think that sets us apart,' Aflak says. It was a challenge to get the power running, and getting the trailer up to the California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology's standards took time, but once complete, word about La Lacquerie traveled fast. Retro vibe: The manicures and pedicures take place in Aflak's 26-foot Airstream trailer . 'Silicon Valley is a big place, but word travels so quickly' Aflak said. 'Once people started posting [on social media] the requests started coming in.' La Lacquerie is now regularly parked at Google, Gap, Facebook, EA and YouTube. There's even a waitlist for the trailer, and Aflak has begun sending nail techs to conference rooms to perform manicure meetings. No additional salon services are available at the moment (such as eyebrow waxing or massage), but that is definitely in phase two or three Aflak confirmed. 'Hopefully it will all come soon,' she says. 'We just have the one truck at the moment.' Trucks may eventually roll into other cities, too. 'We're still a young company, so I'm trying to get us self sufficient here and then we can focus on expansion.' But 'expansion is definitely always in the back of my head' Aflak admits. In the meantime, she may need to hire more drivers. 'Driving the 26-foot trailer is the craziest part of my morning, but I've gotten used to it. I'm working for myself and I love my job.'","Susan Aflak, 33, came up with the idea for La Laquerie while getting lunch at a food truck near her office .

"The bond between two brothers documented in dozens of letters dating from World War Two have today given a fascinating insight into life on the frontline, battling the Hitler's Nazi force. Separated by thousands of miles, brothers Douglas and Clarence Dover sent dozens of letters to one another throughout the conflict, determined not to let distance come between them. Douglas, an infantryman, was stationed in northern Africa and Italy while Clarence, a devout Christian and pacifist, helped manage medical supplies in China. Throughout his time fighting on the frontline during WWII, Douglas Dover, left, wrote dozens of letters to his pacifist brother Clarence, right, telling of brushes with death, bouts of boredom and thoughts of home . Describing day to day life on the frontline, Douglas also recalls attacks by the German enemy. In one letter he tells Clarence: 'Our guns and planes finished off nine of them. But we lost one man and a lorry through them' The brothers both married, Douglas tied the knot with Barbara in 1953, . while his brother Clarence wed his bride Mary Flintoff after meeting her . at a church youth group . The series of letters were unearthed by Clarence's daughter June Cobley, at her home in Beeston, Nottinghamshire - six decades after the conflict. They tell of gun fights, aerial attacks and swarms of . locusts plaguing troops while bouts of boredom and thoughts of home made . soldiers long for the end of the fighting. While Douglas took up the call to arms and fought for his country, his brother Clarence, a devout Christian, travelled to the Far East with Quaker-run organisation the Friends Ambulance Unit - to help in a warehouse handling medical supplies flown in by planes during the war. In the letters, Douglas, who served with the Royal Army Service Corps, describes with remarkable good humour the daily fight against the Nazis in the harsh desert battles of northern Africa. Now, 68 years after the end of the war, . Mrs Cobley, 61, has discovered the correspondence in a dusty cardboard . box in the loft, after her father passed away in 2002. However the . letters her father sent back to Douglas did not survive. The letters continued until May 1946 when Douglas began his final journey home . Douglas shares with Clarence the freezing conditions and downpours the Allied troops faced . Retired midwife Mrs Cobley, said: 'Dad (Clarence) never talked about the letters but I think they were precious to him as he adored all his family. 'I did know he had letters but he only showed me one when he was alive. 'It has only been in the last two years when I had time to go through them properly and type them up. 'It took ages but I enjoyed going through them. They make me laugh and cry. Despite Douglas fighting the war and my dad being a pacifist, the letters show just how close they were.' In his first letter, sent from Egypt . in May 1943, Douglas sets the scene for his brother. The . soldier, who worked as a driver in the army, said: 'We are getting a . good bit of bathing in the Med, and it’s lovely to swim and lay in the . sun. 'You almost forget there’s a war on so near. But you can’t forget for long. In a bit the whistle goes and it starts up again. 'It is almost unbearable in the lorry cab. We were without water for two days. And is it agony to be really thirsty and not be able to get anything to drink. Your lips and the tongue go like leather.' Dozens of heart-felt letters written by June Cobley's uncle to her father during World War Two were discovered in a dusty cardboard box at her home in Beeston, Nottinghamshire . In another letter Douglas describes . attacks by swarms of locusts and frogs before adding: 'The cup of char . is the mainstay of the 8th Army. 'I remember in the push there was a sign which said, ""When in dowt brew-up"".' Describing an attack by German Stuka dive bombers in another letter, Douglas added: 'We saw about 20 planes high up and they slowly peeled off one . by one. We soon got down when we knew it was us he was after. 'All of them come down in a dive and let their bombs go. The . fourth one must have been hit as it went right down with smoking . engine, and hit the deck at full speed. Then our Hurricanes came in and . did Jerry run. 'Our guns and planes finished off nine of them. But we lost one man and a lorry through them.' In August 1943 Douglas and his comrades formed part of the Sicily invasion force in Italy. His correspondence tells of a sense of relief after escaping the intense African heat. In one touching exchange, Douglas reveals his sadness at not being able to see his brother while on leave from the frontline. Clarence was working for a Quaker-led organisation in China . Another, written at Christmas of the same year, Douglas shows his humourous side by saying: 'We look like having a good Christmas. 'But there is one thing, we cannot possibly have a worse time than last year. When we (sic) was out in the rain all night and day and had bully and biscuits for dinner. 'One of my pals is making a pretty lousy noise on a small accordion. Never mind, he’ll get fed up of it soon. 'By the way I hope you are behaving yourself with the girls. Cheerio for now, old man.' As the war in Italy drew to a close, . Douglas’ letters revealed he had visited Rome, Florence and Venice . before moving into Austria. In . one remarkable letter dated May 7, 1945, Douglas described the . end-of-war celebrations and said his colleagues have filled up their . water tanker with wine. He . wrote: 'Dear Clarence, Here’s wish you well, I hope you are as glad as . we all are at the news today (from German sources) that the war in . Europe is now over. 'Churchill is expected to be giving a speech any hour now to give the official statement. 'PS, our water tanker (capacity 250 gallons) has gone out today to fill up with vino for peace celebration.' As well as worrying about attacks from their enemy, Douglas and his comrades faced swarms of locusts, frogs and sand flies . The letters give a fascinating insight into life on the frontline for the Allied troops fighting in Italy and northern Africa . In August 1945, after spending time sightseeing and walking in the Italian mountains, Douglas was granted leave to return home. But in a poignant letter to Clarence, he wrote: 'Only one thing is missing and that is that you will not be there, but maybe will we be together soon.' And on his arrival back home in Nottingham, he sent another letter telling Clarence: 'Nottingham looks very much the same as when we left, but the girls seem to have lost all sense of moral control.' The letters continued even though Europe was at peace until May 1946 when Douglas began his final journey home. And the remarkable collection ends with the lines: 'Well C, I will not make this a very long one. 'For the folks do not know I’m coming... cheerio for now, my next letter will most likely be from home.' Douglas emigrated to Australia in . 1960 and had four children with his wife Barbara before he died aged 67 . in August, 1989 in Maryborough, Queensland. After the war, Clarence became a successful export salesman and married Mary, who he had met through church youth groups. He died in March 2001, at the age of 81. The letters show Douglas's determination not to allow distance get in the way of the brothers' relationship. Clarence's letters to his younger brother did not survive . Mrs Colby, a mother-of-three, is hoping to type her uncle’s letters and produce a book for the family to keep as a memento. She said: 'I am really proud of my dad for refusing to fight. I could not have done that at the age of 20. 'We . never quite knew what his family’s reaction was at the time but I have a . letter from his mother in which she said she was standing by him. 'She wrote to him: ""I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that you have laboured for the benefit of peace"". 'My father did not talk about it much. In some ways, I think he was braver not to fight because of the pressure that was on him. 'I am quite happy for people to know. Too little is known about conscientious objectors, they kept their history to themselves.' Just a year before he died in 2000, Clarence spoke about registering as a conscientious objector. He told his local newspaper, the Nottingham Post: 'I was getting regular Christian teaching and I was able to think more deeply about it and apply it to my life. 'By the time war came in 1939, I had made up my mind. You had to convince them of your sincerity and how far you were prepared to go. 'They realised there was no point in pursuing conscientious objectors very hard because they could not win.'","Soldier tells of brushes with death, bouts of boredom and thoughts of home .

"When bad things happen in good houses, there's only one man desperate homeowners should call: Randall Bell, Master of Disaster. Dr Disaster: Randall Bell is a real estate appraiser who specializes in properties where disaster has struck . Laguna Beach, California resident Bell, 54, works as a consultant in diminution value, or stigmatized real estate. In other words, he puts a price tag on properties that have been damaged by natural disasters or stigmatized by actual or perceived horrors, such as murders, suicides or, as in one recent case, accusations of being haunted by reality television shows. Bell's services don't come cheap - his rate is $375 an hour. He . provides his clients with reports - sometimes 100 pages thick, . with details on the property's problematic history, cases studies of . similar troubles and the unmatched expert's final appraisal. Bell's dominance and expertise in the field of stigmatized real estate has earned him the title of 'Master of Disaster.' He . has valued homes where some of the most infamous murders in U.S. history occurred, including Nicole Brown Simpson's condo, JonBenet . Ramsey's home and Charles Manson victim Sharon Tate's mansion. The father of four carved out his niche from a career in conventional property appraisal. After the 1992 Rodney King riots in LA he was called in to assess the damage . and found his calling, deciding to focus only on damaged property. 'I love a challenge - the biggest, baddest, bring it on,' Mr Bell told the LA Times. 'Every day of the week, there are new places to go and new disasters.' Stigmatized: Bell was called in to value the Rancho, Santa Fe mansion where police discovered the bodies of 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult . Grisly assignments: Bell has consulted on the house in Boulder, Colorado where JonBenet Ramsey was killed . Media attention: The more notorious a case is, says Bell, the more a property's value will be damaged, as in the case of Nicole Brown Simpson's condo . He's in hot demand due to an uncommon skill-set: Bell has the ability to adjust for for stigma as well as physical damage when he values a property. The National Association of Realtors describes a stigmatized house as one 'that has been psychologically impacted by an event which occurred, or was suspected to have occurred, on the property, such event being one that has no physical impact of any kind.' Television show Ghost Adventures recently featured a Las Vegas mansion, the halls of which, they claimed, stalks a 'nasty, evil spirit.' This came as news to the property's owner Keith Resnick who wanted to sue the Travel Channel for damages for lost property value. Apart from the physical damage from ghost-hunting vandals who broke into the home (and performed satanic rituals in its rooms) Resnick had to account for the loss of value due to the stigma now attached to the house. Who was he going to call? Natural disaster: Bell also consults on property damaged by other means, such as houses affected by Hurricane Katrina . Damage control: Bell's research on environmental catastrophes has taken him from New Orleans (pictured) to Chernobyl . Bell visited the home four times before making his final appraisal, according to the LA Times. Ghost Adventures claimed the house was the site of mob murders, though Bell found no evidence of any such thing. But that fact made no difference - the property had been stigmatized by the claims, so Bell made his valuation as though the house had played host to grisly murders. Resnick eventually sold the house earlier this year, though the final figure of the damages he's suing for remains confidential. Terrorism: Randall Bell was called in to consult on the World Trade Center attacks in New York . Bell's skills are based on thorough research - he is uniquely qualified in his area of expertise, having traveled to every state in America, not to mention each continent in the world several times over, to observe the effects of disasters, terrorism, murder and suicide on properties.His work has taken him to Chernobyl, Hiroshima, the World Trade center site and the West Bank, where he was searching for comparisons of properties damaged by terrorists. Bell told the LA Times that near the city of Hebron, a man threatened to kill him and his guide with a machine gun. Before he could make good on his threats, an air-raid siren went off, a bomb exploded and machine-gun fire deafened him. 'I hit my limit with Hebron,' he says. New path: Bell's first taste of appraising damaged property came after the 1992 LA riots . His meticulous research makes him the go-to guy for governments and . organizations seeking  put a figure on losses after mass disasters. Bell has consulted on . Hurricane Katrina, the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, the September . 11 attacks at the World Trade Center site, and the United Airlines . Flight 93 crash site in Pennsylvania. He explained to Today's Realtor that any reduction in value of a property due to stigma depends on the scope of the tragedy and the media attention it received. According to Bell, there is usually a 15- to-25 per cent decrease in value for two or three years after the event, which then diminishes over a one- to-25-year period. Some cases are special, though. The Milwaukee apartment building in which Jeffrey Dahmer lived and murdered his parents caused a mass exodus of the entire neighborhood. 'Dahmer's crimes were so horrific that not only the building was stigmatized but also the neighborhood, and that's very unusual,' he says. 'Occupancy went from 80 per cent to 20 per cent, as people in adjoining buildings wanted to leave the neighborhood.' The house was eventually demolished. Value restored: The home where Sharon Tate was murdered by the infamous Manson Family was eventually sold two decades after the murder . A seller is obliged to tell you if the roof leaks - but do they have to tell you about the dark event in the basement? Bell advises real estate agents that disclosure is the best policy. More . than 20 states have laws that clarify real-estate agents' duty to . disclose psychological stigma and protect sellers from liability. The . statutes vary from state to state - California's requires sellers to disclose a . murder, but only within three years of the crime, and there is no . requirement to disclose other felonies or suicide. In any case, says Bell, all stigmas eventually fade. He says the owner of the house where Sharon Tate was so brutally murdered along with her unborn baby held onto the house for 20 years, then sold it at market value without any trouble at all.","Randall Bell specializes in appraising properties where notorious events have taken place .

"Paul Luker mowed down and killed a senior RAF officer . A delivery driver who mowed down and killed a senior RAF officer as he cycled home was today spared jail. Paul Luker, 51, claimed he was 'blinded by the sun' when he hit Group Captain Tom Barrett, the 44-year-old Station Commander of RAF Northolt. Gp Capt Barrett, who leaves behind two daughters,  served as an aide to the Queen, as well as in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan as a jet pilot. He had also been awarded an OBE. Described as an 'avid cyclist', he often used the journey from the base in Ruislip, west London, to his home in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, as a training exercise. He had travelled less than a mile when he was hit by Luker's transit van at 5.07pm on March 10 last year on the A40. Luker was found guilty of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving following a trial at Harrow Crown Court. Sentencing . Luker to a 12-month community order and 100 hours unpaid work, Judge . John Anderson said: 'The consequences of your driving were terrible on . Gp Capt Barrett's wife and family, to whom once again I pass on my . deepest sympathies. 'But I'm . quite satisfied this offence arose out of your momentary inattention . and as such, it is an offence that falls into the lowest category of the . sentencing guidelines for death by careless driving. 'I'm satisfied of the deep remorse you . have shown for the victim, his family and colleagues, and that this has . had, and continues to have, a profound effect on your mental wellbeing. 'I take the view that a community order would be the correct sentence in your case.' Fellow motorists told of a 'loud bang' and a 'twisted wheel' flying through the air after the crash. Honour: Group Captain Tom Barrett receiving his OBE from The Queen at Buckingham Palace in 2008 . Royal connection: The senior RAF officer served as a personal aide to the Queen . The impact of the collision caused Gp Capt Barrett to be thrown of his bicycle and land on the roadside. He was rushed to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington but died of multiple injuries. In a victim impact statement, Gp Capt Barrett's father, Anthony, said: 'Tom's death has turned our lives completely upside down and his loss has caused the greatest distress to my wife Christine and I, his sister, Lisa, his wife, Sophie, and his two daughters, Emily, 11 and Alice, 10. 'We are a very close family and he was the driving force of all of us. 'His sudden death is an incalculable loss to all of us. Sophie has lost a husband and best friend. 'The girls have lost a devoted father who they adored. A very special light has gone out and can never be rekindled.' Mrs Sophie Barrett described her husband as 'her soul mate', adding: 'The girls have lost a loving father who was an enormous influence on them.' Luker - who was driving at 50mph, under the speed limit - wept giving evidence, as he told how he simply could not understand why he did not see Gp Capt Barrett. The self-employed delivery driver told how the crash had left him needing counselling and had stripped him of his happy-go-lucky personality. RAF Northolt: Group Captain Tom Barrett was the station commander of the base . Luker, who has been driving since 1984, said the sun had been 'quite low' as he drove on the Greenford flyover. 'I was very short-sighted, I was struggling to see the brake lights of the car in front of me, so I decided I needed to slow down. Tragic death: Group Captain Tom Barrett was a father of two young daughters . 'At that point I was in the middle lane and the sun got worse, so I put a cap on but it didn't help much. 'The sun was as low that day as I have ever known. 'The only way I could get the sun out of my eyes was to put the sun visor fully down, but I would have been blinded by that, so I put it on an angle. 'I could see people flashing me for going too slow so I decided to go into the inside lane and remember looking in my mirror for motorcycles. 'All of a sudden I felt a bump.' Luker added: 'I immediately slowed down and decided not to do an emergency brake because the car behind me was too close and stopping suddenly might have caused an accident, so I geared down. 'I thought I hit a deer. I never saw anything. 'I saw the bicycle wheels along the road and then I realised I hit a cyclist. 'I remember shouting ""oh no, oh no,"" - I was in some sort of shock. 'Mr Barrett was lying face down and I saw blood coming out of his ear and mouth and I knew at that stage it was quite a problem. 'I just don't understand why I didn't see him,' he said. 'I would have done everything in my power to avoid any accident. 'I think about it all the time. I was a pretty happy go lucky sort of fellow until that day.' Luker, of Beaconsfield Road, Farnham Royal, Bucks, was also banned from the road for a year and must complete an extended test before he can drive again. Wearing a dark suit, white shirt and blue striped tie, he wept as he hugged family and friends after being released from the dock. Speaking outside court, he said: 'I agree with the sentence and I'm going to do it.' Luker, who is suffering from financial difficulties, was not ordered to pay any costs after Judge Anderson ruled he did not want to 'heap further misery upon misery'.","Group Captain Tom Barrett died after collision on A40 .

"After 50 years as the lead singer of the Rolling Stones, Mick Jagger has regaled the world with some of the ­lessons he has learned from a lifetime of rock 'n' roll. On an American TV chat show last week, he revealed his ten pearls of wisdom. Not surprisingly, these included his views on that unholy trinity of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Now in his 70th year, he self-deprecatingly quipped: 'You start out playing rock and roll so you can have sex and do drugs. But you end up doing drugs so you can play rock and roll and have sex.' Rock veteran: Mick Jagger performing with The Stones earlier this month in New York . It was a good joke. But, with the career he's had, he must surely have picked up more than a mere ten ideas as to how life should be lived. Here are a few he appears to have overlooked. DON'T WRITE LOVE LETTERSOr, if you must, always put in something so secret, so deeply embarrassing about the recipient that she can never sell it for fear of making the information public. If he had heeded this, Jagger would have avoided the ignominy of his former lover Marsha Hunt, the mother of his daughter, Karis, auctioning his letters to her for £175,000. LIKE ROYALTY, NEVER CONFIRM OR DENY ANY RUMOURSThis is one lesson Jagger learned long ago. That means the public still does not know for sure if he was indeed caught in flagrante at Kensington Palace with Princess Margaret. Rock royalty: Jagger with (from left) Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones in 1964 . BE YOUR OWN BOSS Though one of the biggest acts in the world, the Rolling Stones still don't own the rights to their biggest hit records from the Sixties, such as Satisfaction and Little Red Rooster, due to ­contracts signed early on. KEEP A DIARY Decades ago Jagger agreed to write his autobiography and took a very large advance from a publisher, only to have to return it when he realised he couldn't remember anything of what he had got up to in the Sixties and Seventies. He must have lost millions in potential book sales. START MOISTURISING AT AN EARLY AGELike a middle-aged woman, Jagger was faced with the choice between keeping his face plump and sacrificing the figure, or maintaining those slim hips and sacrificing the face. He went with the gamine shape. Enough said. FORGET SOLO ALBUMS Whenever . he has brought out a solo album it has bombed. Primitive Cool, released . in 1987, was described as 'garbage'. The Rolling Stones is the brand — . almost as famous as Coca-Cola. He's just their poster boy. Ex: Singer Marsha Hunt sold love letters Jagger sent to her for £175,000 at auction . NEVER SHARE A GIRLFRIEND WITH MATESGirls talk, as he found out a year ago to his embarrassment. Keith Richards's autobiography contained a very unflattering revelation from Jagger's former girlfriend Marianne Faithfull about his the size of manhood ­ ­ ­— disclosed while she and Keith were in bed together. ... AND EXPECT TROUBLE IF YOU DO Richards might not have been so spiteful if his mate hadn't been romancing Keith's girlfriend Anita Pallenberg at the same time as him. TAKE CARE NOT TO PLAGIARISEIn . 1997, Mick and Keith had to share royalties with singer-songwriter . k.d.lang for accidentally borrowing from her hit 'Constant Craving'. Neither Stone can explain how the lifted tune ended up on the Stones' single, 'Anybody Seen My Baby?', but it was definitely there. HELL'S ANGELS DON'T MAKE GOOD SECURITYThe . Stones hired Hell's Angels to police a concert at Altamont in . ­California in 1969, only for the bikers to beat and stab a fan to . death. Trouble: Richards, left with Anita Pallenberg and son Marlon in 1969, and right on stage with Jagger this month . KEEP THEM GUESSINGAndrogyny doubles a star's appeal, which doubles the number of potential fans of either sex — which, in turn, ­doubles the profits. NEVER GIVE UP ON THE CRICKETAn English rock star will be ­forgiven almost anything if he's spotted in a floppy hat at Lord's on a summer's day.

The word is . that any of the crew caught taking drugs while working is sacked! Pearls of wisdom: Jagger revealed the lessons learned on David Letterman last week . VANITY WILL GET YOU EVERYWHERECarly . Simon was right, when she sang the lines 'You're so vain: you probably . think this song is about you.' Regardless of whether she was singing . about Jagger or the actor Warren Beatty, vanity never held either back. MOVE ON QUICKLY Luckily, . everyone's already ­forgotten about Super Heavy, the supergroup he . formed a ­couple of years ago with soul singer Joss Stone and Eurythmics . front man Dave Stewart. KNOW YOUR WORTH When . the band began they were just five guys on stage, with no fireworks and . no massive stage effects. But, the greater the effects, the more they . can charge for seats, and therefore the bigger the profits. TAKE A RISK Before . Jagger, world famous rock stars didn't have degrees, and as an . undergraduate he wondered if it was worth the risk of dropping out. It . was. He left the LSE two years into his degree — albeit with the option . of going back to finish his studies if the Stones didn't make it. Bad boy: Marianne Faithfull outside Marlborough Street Magistrates Court in London with Jagger in 1969 . BE RUTHLESS                                                                                                                                        For the good of the group, Brian Jones had to be pushed out of the Stones when his drugs habit spiralled out of control. CHARM THE GREAT AND THE GOODIt's all very well having great mates, but it never hurts to have friends in high places. In 1967, Jagger was jailed for a minor drug offence. Then, after an editorial in The Times saying the sentence was draconian, he was swiftly released and helicoptered to a TV meeting with the editor of The Times, a former Home Secretary and a Bishop. NEVER BE DULL In a letter to singer Marsha Hunt, Jagger described John Lennon and Yoko Ono as being 'boring' when they went on their peace campaign in 1970. He could never be accused of that. SELL OUT IF YOUR MUST                                                                                                              Keith Richards accused Jagger of being too willing to be influenced by the Establishment. But that was just Keith, clinging to his buccaneer image. Having Tony Blair as a fan got Jagger a knighthood.

"There was shock and disappointment in the west of Scotland this week when an absentee landlord told two employees that, after decades of service, they won’t be needed on his farm after Christmas. From the employees’ point of view this is obviously upsetting. But when the landlord is Paul McCartney and the farm is on the Mull of Kintyre, a remote part of Britain he once loved as a family hideaway and then made famous musically in one of his biggest hits, people around the world take notice — and wonder why this might be happening. In one of the shots taken at the farm McCartney bought at the height of the Beatles fame, Linda is pregnant with daughter Stella . It’s believed the former Beatle has rarely spent much time on his vast 600-acre farm since his first wife Linda died in 1998, and that the house has fallen into a state of some disrepair. That’s sad for a once much-loved home, but it also reveals a touching trait of human nature that we all share. High Park Farm was the first home Paul and Linda created together. He’d bought it in 1966 when living with actress Jane Asher, but it was only after he married country-loving Linda in 1969 that he began to spend much time there. I’d known Paul since 1967 when we met on the filming of the Magical Mystery Tour. But the first I ever heard about High Park Farm was early in 1970. Paul McCartney, pictured with his late wife Linda and their children, has told employees at High Park Farm that their services will no longer be needed after Christmas . We were sitting in a fish restaurant in London and Paul, with Linda at his side, was rhapsodising about the mud and the simplicity of the place, about not having a bathroom and how he’d made the furniture, fixed leaks in the roof and sheared a sheep. It sounded to me like some kind of hippy purgatory in endless, lashing rain, but he insisted he loved it. The Beatles had secretly broken up the previous autumn, and he’d been devastated. Playing with the band had been the only job he’d ever had, and, unemployed though rich, he’d gone to Scotland to grieve. Paul McCartney with children James and Stella in Scotland in 1982, captured by his late wife Linda . Paul McCartney cradles a lamb in his lap while Linda cuddles him in this intimate shot at High Park Farm . After seven years during which he’d never been out of the world’s microscopic gaze, his only need was the comfort of his wife, and daughters Heather and Mary. He would say later that, in his despair, he flirted with hard drugs while there, but that would have been only a momentary aberration as Linda, Mull and Mother Nature, in all the kindness of her sometimes inclement weather on the Mull, set about healing him. ‘I’m not some kind of hermit or recluse with a long beard having an awful time,’ he told me that day. ‘It’s a tramp’s life and I can wear the same shirt for ages up there. I need to get with the earth a bit. I love nature.’ Indeed, as he sang in Mother Nature’s Son on the Beatles’ White Album, love it he did. And as the McCartney family added Stella and James, and the house near Campbeltown took shape around them, Linda coaxed Paul’s confidence back. Sitting with his acoustic guitar, some of his best post-Beatle songs were written there in the heather in the early Seventies, while Linda took her photographs of him and the children. For generations, rich Englishmen have bought great estates in Scotland, and taken their smart friends up to shoot the animals and birds. But toffing and killing was never the McCartneys’ way. And the local people admired them for it. Animals were never shot at High Park Farm: quite the reverse. It was while having Sunday lunch with the children, watching young lambs bouncing happily in the field, that the entire family suddenly pushed aside the roast on their plates and decided to become vegetarians. Later Linda, with an evangelistic fervour, would create a whole range of vegetarian foods. The west of Scotland wasn’t the handiest place for an international rock star to bring up his family, so another estate was found in Sussex. There, once again, the McCartneys started with a small house followed by a much bigger one and more and more land was added. But always their homestead on the Mull of Kintyre was waiting for holidays. Wings: Linda and Paul, with Danny Laine  strolling in the heather during filming of the promotional film for their Mull of Kintyre single . Then, in 1998, Linda died, and the visits to High Park Farm became fewer. In his solitude, the memories of a family starting out 30 years earlier in this place of romantic isolation would have both comforted him and lanced the pain of his loss. By now, all the McCartney children were grown up with their own lives to lead. The Scottish farm had been a part of Paul’s life with Linda. Without her, it wasn’t the same. Now he has a new American wife and life and several other homes, even his helicopter visits to his Sussex house are fewer, and he’s rarely been busier. This week he’s flitting from TV studio to radio microphone promoting a new album. Speaking about his country life, he once told me: ‘I do all the things everybody else does. The only difference is I’m more famous and richer than they are.’ And, like all of us, it seems to me that Paul is moving on, as he has to, as we all have to — though it isn’t easy. How many of us think fondly of our childhood home, picturing its cosiness, almost smelling the polish on the furniture? Or do we see home as the sanctuary we decorated as  newly-weds, where we ladled Polyfilla into gaps in the plaster, then later watched as our young children rolled and giggled on our proud new carpets? High Park Farm, where Paul and Linda McCartney first lived after they were married . We think we’d like to go back, but we know we can’t. As Paul McCartney is no longer the 26-year-old restarting his life in the ‘mists that rolled in from the sea’, as he told us in Mull Of Kintyre, we are not the same people we were either. Time changes us and the people we shared those moments of our lives with have changed, too; some to leave us, some to grow up, some sadly to die. And without those loved ones, the place will neither look nor feel the same. Often, against your better judgment, you revisit a place you loved 20 years ago — only to be confronted by a noisy holiday village and  sun-worshippers occupying almost every grain of sand. Obviously, it’s good that more people can enjoy the sunshine, the sea and the sun, you might try to think, but, in your heart you’re with Joni Mitchell when she sang: ‘They paved paradise, put up a parking lot.’ In truth, we shouldn’t even try to go back. It rarely works, seductive though the memories may be. The word in Scotland is that Paul McCartney wants to discuss with the Forestry Commission new ways to manage his land. Does that mean he wants to turn it back to the historic, natural woodland it would have been before sheep farming overran Scotland,  as some environmentalists  now advocate? It wouldn’t surprise me. But we’ll have to wait and see. In the meantime, though the ‘smiles in the sunshine and tears in the rain’ he once sang about are long behind him, the memories of Mull will remain. He, like us, will always have the memories, often better preserved if we don’t try to relive them.As for the staff about to lose their jobs at High Park Farm, I’m sure a comfortable compensation will be negotiated.

"A former NFL cheerleader accused of following a 12-year-old boy into a bathroom, fondling his penis and offering him oral sex has been spared jail, it has been reported. Elizabeth 'Leigh' Garner, 42, who was charged with sexual battery and solicitation of a minor for child rape has instead been sentenced to 18 months probation, TMZ.com reports. Garner is understood to have pleaded no . contest in October. As part of her conditions she must . stay away from the boy and his family, submit to drug testing and attend . AA sessions twice a week. Scroll down for video . Probation: Former cheerleader Elizabeth 'Leigh' Garner, 42, has reportedly avoided jail after pleading no contest to sexual battery and solicitation of a minor for . child rape . Garner had been released on a $30,000 bond and had faced more than eight years' prison. She was expected to go on trial this month. According to Murfreesboro police, the . married Nashville woman, who cheered three seasons for the Tennessee . Titans until 2008, was at a party in February when she tried to seduce . the boy. The boy told police that Garner asked him whether he'd 'ever been with a woman' before she tried to pull down him pants.

"Raheem Sterling's former club QPR stand to make £15million if the teenage England winger leaves Anfield in the summer. Sterling will return to Loftus Road on Sunday for the first time since he moved to Liverpool in 2010 and Brendan Rodgers is expected to start the 19-year-old after he was controversially left on the bench by England in Estonia last Sunday with Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson claiming Sterling had told him he was 'tired'. But Rangers will have a special incentive not to kick Sterling too hard. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Raheem Sterling dazzling while at QPR .

That money would be especially welcome for owner Tony Fernandes who faces a £40m fine if the club are relegated to The Championship in breach of FPP rules.

"We have all said things that we’ve immediately and eternally regretted. For Paul McCartney it’s a thoughtless, inexplicable quip made when he was 14 and had just been told his mother had died. ‘What will we do without her money?’ the teenage Paul blurted, not knowing how to handle his shock and grief. Words of wisdom: Paul McCartney, left, with his mother Mary and brother Michael during a family trip to Wales . Then he went to bed and cried all night, clasping his hands in prayer, promising God he would be good if only his mother could come back. So, it comes as little surprise to learn this week that McCartney, now 70, has told a Brazilian fan that if he had a time machine he would like to ‘go back and spend time with my mum’. To lose a mother at any age inevitably leaves a well of regret. To lose her at 14 can be devastating, and it’s quite possible the death of Mary McCartney in 1956 from an embolism after an operation for breast cancer, affected Paul’s life for ever. His brother Michael, who was then aged 12, would later say how, just after their mother’s death, Paul’s growing interest in the guitar turned into an obsession. Eight months later, in the summer of 1957, Paul was to meet John Lennon, who was also soon to lose his mother in a road accident. Paul believes their shared sense of loss helped bond them, cementing their early friendship. Decades ago, when I was at a Beatles recording session at London’s Abbey Road, Paul took me into an empty studio, sat at a piano and played me a song he was writing. It sounded to me like a hymn and, though at that point, he didn’t have many lyrics, one phrase he repeatedly sang that night stayed in my head for more than a year until the record was released. It was: ‘Mother Mary comes to me, speaking words of wisdom . . .’ Bereaved: McCartney told a Brazilian fan this week that he would see his mother if he had a time machine . The song, of course, was Let It Be. Paul would later say it came about as a result of a dream he’d had in 1968, when, though The Beatles were at the height of their fame and creativity, fissures had begun appearing in the camaraderie of the band. John Lennon had recently become attached to Yoko Ono, and the future looked uncertain for The Beatles, which devastated Paul. Suddenly, in the middle of the turmoil, he found himself dreaming about his mother. ‘There was her face, completely clear, particularly her eyes,’ he would recall. ‘And she said to me very gently, very reassuringly: “Let it be.” ‘It was lovely. I woke up with a great feeling. It was really as if she’d visited me at this very difficult moment in my life and had given me this message: “Be gentle, don’t fight things, just try and go with the flow and it will work out.” ’ We are all products of our upbringings — McCartney no less than anyone else. So what kind of parents did he have, and what was she like, the mother who, at 47, died so young and so suddenly? Like many of their generation, Jim and Mary McCartney were, when they married in 1941, already in their 30s, an aspirant lower-middle-class couple in the largely working-class city of Liverpool. Jim, who worked as a firefighter during the Blitz, was a cotton salesman, and Mary was a midwife. In fact, having been in charge of the maternity ward at Walton Hospital, Liverpool, she was awarded the privilege of giving birth to Paul in a private ward. Her ambition for her elder son was that he would become a doctor. Jim McCartney, a lovely man, had a little jazz band before he married, so there was music in the family. Though the cotton industry was to go into decline after the war, meaning Jim never earned much, his wife’s wages and ambition saw the family eventually move to a pleasant estate in the green Liverpool suburb of Allerton. From there, Paul and Michael passed the 11-plus to go to the best grammar school in Liverpool, the Institute. Paul was clever and always industrious, but he admits he could be a handful, too. Family portrait: Michael (left), mother Mary, father Jim and Paul (right) When Mary would correct his strong . Liverpool brogue, he would imitate her deliberately posher accent, and . then be upset when she was, understandably, hurt. And . when, one washing day, she found a cartoon of a naked woman he’d drawn . to amuse the boys at school in his shirt pocket, she sternly demanded an . explanation. He was mortified with shame. By . the mid-Fifties, the McCartneys were doing well and, for Mary, life . must have seemed splendid, until in 1956 she began to complain of pains . in her chest. She put it down to the menopause, and her GP agreed. But then the pains got worse, and when 12-year-old Michael one day came home from school and found her crying, she went to see a specialist. Breast cancer was diagnosed and she was told she would need an immediate operation to remove the tumour. Despite instructions to rest, the day before she went into hospital she cleaned the house and washed and pressed her sons’ clothes. She wanted, she told her sister, to leave everything ready, ‘in case I don’t come back’. The following day, Paul and Michael went to see their mother after the operation. There was blood on the white sheets. ‘It was terrible,’ Paul would remember. Mary’s condition quickly deteriorated and just an hour after they left, she received the last rites. Her strength ebbing away, she turned to her sister and said: ‘I would have liked to see the boys growing up.’ Jim McCartney was devastated. Seeing him crying was the worst thing for Paul. ‘You expect to see women crying . . . but when it’s your dad, it shakes your faith in everything,’ he said. Somehow Jim struggled on, caring for his teenage sons. Mary and Jim had wanted Paul to go to university, but soon music filled his world. As with all those who lose a parent when young, thoughts of his mother never left Paul McCartney. Nine years after her death he would, without the help of any of the other Beatles, write and record his most famous song, Yesterday. Loves of his life: Paul with first wife Linda McCartney, right, and on his wedding day to wife Nancy Shevell, left . Once again it was a melody that came to him in, he believes, a dream. The lyrics, however, might be telling. ‘I . said something wrong, now I long for yesterday,’ he sings. Was that a . veiled reference to the words he wished he’d never said on hearing the . news of his mother’s death? On that night in 1968, when he played me Let It Be for the first time, my impromptu private audience was cut short when a young, fair-haired American woman in a raincoat turned up at the studio along with her small daughter. Her name was Linda Eastman, and she and Paul were to marry, in the face of much opposition from the group’s fans, a few months later. ‘It was as if my mum had sent me her,’ he would say. From all the traumas and trials of The Beatles relationship break-ups, theirs was to become a spectacularly happy marriage, with Linda a rock at his side, helping create the close family life that had been cut short in his teenage years. Their first daughter was named Mary, after his mother, and when, following the birth of Stella, a son was born, he was called James, after Paul’s father. For 30 years Paul and Linda were inseparable, so when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in the early Nineties it must have seemed that a terrible blight of history was repeating itself. Tribute: Two of McCartney's most famous songs, Let It Be and Yesterday, were about his mother . By that time, Paul was vastly rich, but still managing to live as normal a family life as possible for a man who had once been a Beatle and who still toured the world. Linda was the centre of the family, and when she died in 1998 Paul was, for a long time, inconsolable. No doubt his grief for Linda brought back the loss of his mother. For Paul to wish he could go back in time and get to know his own mother better is entirely in character for a man whose childhood was, in many ways, cut short by her early death. Youth is inevitably a selfish time, and it’s only as we get older that we begin to see the world from the perspective of those who’ve gone before us and to understand the struggles they made on our behalf. By sending her sons to a prestigious grammar, Mary was helping endow Paul with ambition. She didn’t live to see how he used it, but one suspects she’d have been proud when, with his backing, that school was refounded as the Liverpool Institute Of Performing Arts. John Lennon, George Harrison, Ringo Starr and many others helped make Paul McCartney the man he became, but Jim and Mary McCartney shaped him first. n THE Ray Connolly Beatles Archive is available as an eBook on Amazon.","Paul McCartney penned Let It Be and Yesterday in tribute to his mother .

"Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo will each have an Anfield jinx to overcome when they return there for a Champions League tie on Wednesday night. Bale failed to win a game at Anfield in five attempts for Tottenham before his world-record £86million move to the Spanish capital. And while Ronaldo did taste success at Anfield with Manchester United, he has never scored a goal there in five visits – unusual by his prolific standards. Jordan Henderson is looking forward to Liverpool's clash with Real Madrid at Anfield on Wednesday . Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring against Levante on Saturday . Gareth Bale failed to win at Anfield in five attempts for Tottenham before moving to Real Madrid . Liverpool’s vice-captain Jordan Henderson can’t wait to face the current Champions League holders on what is likely to be a tremendous European night at Anfield. ‘I was pleased when the draw was made because you want to be playing against best teams. Real Madrid were the best team in Europe and have the best players too. Facing the likes of Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo can only make you improve and help your own game. ‘It is a big game for us and a big test. But we’ll go into it and play without any fear.’ Two years ago, the prospect of Henderson feeling confident about taking on the world’s best would have been laughable. Bale (left), James Rodriguez (centre) and Ronaldo (right) in training for Real Madrid at Valdebebas . But the 24-year-old’s progress under Brendan Rodgers has been astonishing and he is now an automatic pick for both Liverpool and England. His famed stamina and athleticism has led Rodgers to declare he is the only player in the country who can dominate games without the ball. The club are currently trying to extend his current contract, which has 18 months left. ‘To be honest, I’ve always had that ability to move well about the pitch. It’s the way I’ve played since I was very little - with passion. I love playing football and give everything I’ve got every time I play,’ he said. ‘Being made Steven Gerrard’s vice-captain at Liverpool is a huge honour for me personally and shows how far I’ve come in a couple of years. I’m really enjoying that role and grateful for the manager to give me that level of responsibility. Henderson (left) has been named vice-captain to Steven Gerrard at Liverpool . Liverpool beat Real Madrid 4-0 in the Champions League in 2009 in their only previous meeting at Anfield . ‘I tend not to listen too much to any praise I’m getting too much because you don’t want to get carried away. I just have to focus on football and learn from people around me. That’s all I can do.’ While Madrid’s front-four of Bale, Ronaldo, James Rodriguez and Karim Benzema are known throughout the world, Liverpool will be disappointed their main striker Daniel Sturridge misses on the big stage again following calf and thigh injuries. ‘Daniel is a massive player for club and country, a fantastic talent,’ acknowledged Henderson. ‘I played in my first Champions League game against Ludogorets this season and now we’ve got a really big European night ahead. ‘Anfield is always a brilliant stadium and the fans are fantastic. Last season it went up another level. Hopefully they can continue that and in sure they will be even more brilliant against Real Madrid.’ There are seven survivors from the last time Liverpool’s met Real Madrid in the 2009 Champions League – Iker Casillas, Marcelo, Pepe and Sergio Ramos for the Spaniards, and Martin Skrtel, Lucas and Steven Gerrard for Liverpool.","Liverpool face Real Madrid in Champions League on Wednesday .

Liverpool’s Ryan Babel once put a picture of him in a United shirt on Twitter. But he was the top referee and they were the top team, so they earned more decisions. He’s a big fan of Rotherham United, of course. He often made light of the criticism at functions he would speak at. ‘When pictures show me in a Man United shirt, my wife Kay and I get very upset,’ he would say. ‘And our kids, Rio and Wayne.’ Now he has nothing left to prove and can spend more time with his family. Yet he is held in high regard by the FA and FIFA, and no doubt both bodies will want him to perform a role for them in future.

"Bob Hoskins doesn’t spring to mind as one of life’s philosophers. The late actor didn’t have the looks or voice for it. But what he did have was common sense. His fittingly individual approach was distilled in the ‘Eleven Lessons In Life’ he wrote for his daughter Rosa and which she revealed this week after his death from pneumonia on Tuesday. As a list, it may not quite rank alongside the Ten Commandments or the Seven Beatitudes as a guide on how to live our lives. But as a rough guide on  muddling through with good intentions, it’s hard to beat. Late actor Bob Hoskins with daughter Rosa who he lovingly wrote the 'Eleven Lessons in Life' list for . I have a daughter, too. Her name is Louise, and if she were to one day make a record of the life lessons that she (and her brothers) inherited from me, the list wouldn’t be that far from Bob’s. Obviously, laughter would be top of my list, too. Whether it’s quietly joking at the eccentricities and unreasonable demands of those who believe they know better or owning up to our own little vanities and absurdities, humour gets us all through the day. Let’s face it, the human condition is often little more than small-scale tragi-comedy, to which we all know the inevitable end. ‘Laugh long and loud and make other people laugh,’ Bob recommended, offering a recipe long known for relieving pain, burning up calories, lowering the risk of heart disease and sending feel-good oxytocin hormones charging through the bloodstream. Whatever we do, we mustn’t take ourselves too seriously. We should approach our work with all seriousness, certainly, but no one likes a boring, pompous, self-loving, mirror-watching prig — unless as a figure of fun to be secretly laughed at. Being an actor and therefore an extrovert, Bob’s advice was to be flamboyant, eccentric, unique. ‘Don’t try to adapt yourself to someone else’s view of normal’; ‘Don’t worry about other people’s opinions.’ Much-loved British actor Bob Hoskins had four children and lived in East Sussex with second wife Linda Banwell for more than a decade . He must have had the armour of an armadillo. Most of us aren’t as  thick-skinned. He assumed that if someone doesn’t like you they must be ‘stupid’, ‘blind’ or have ‘bad taste’. That may have worked for him. But in the more tortured, lonely writing profession, it strikes me that if one is evidently disliked, then a few ruminations as to why that might be the case could be called for. I must be honest. ‘Have I behaved like a complete prat?’ has, on occasion, been a question that has troubled me into the small hours. And, sadly, sometimes I recognise that I have. Must try harder next time, I think, and go to sleep. And talking of rest, I’d like to add to Bob’s list that if we’ve fallen out with someone we love — partner, child, parent or best friend — we should always try to make up before the lights go out. Never dwell on silent, bubbling bitterness. It’ll taste worse the  next day. And never, ever, as I have sometimes done, rattle off an email or letter in a rage late at night, no matter how justified it might seem at the time. Sleep on it. Things may not always look better in the morning, but they nearly always look different. As the years have gone by, it has become clear to me — and, apparently, did to Bob, too — that whatever we do we should do it to the best of our ability. Bob Hoskins' individual approach was distilled in the 'Eleven Lessons In Life', above, he wrote for his daughter Rosa and which she revealed this week after his death from pneumonia on Tuesday . We shouldn’t be afraid of disappointment and use fear of failure as an excuse for not trying. To miss out on any opportunity through timidity or because we feel  it’s time to stop chasing  rainbows is like getting off the ride before it’s finished and then watching from the side. So whatever happens, never give in. Of course, success can’t be assured and, like most people, I’ve proved that now and again. But, once we stop trying, one thing is absolutely certain. We’re going to fail. Ray Connolly with his daughter Louise . There’s something else, too. We all like winning prizes, be it a school cup or something that takes us all  the way to Buckingham Palace and a smile from the Queen. But the real fun is rarely in the achievement and the recognition. It’s in the doing. And I’m all for Bob’s advice to appreciate beauty. I wish I’d learned this sooner. I sometimes think that when I was young I had a sight defect. Because when I went to Paris and Florence as a young man, though I could see perfectly well, I was hardly aware of the beauty that surrounded me unless it was  wearing a dress or a blouse. Now the entire world dazzles me. Like Bob, I take photographs all the time, snapping the changing seasons in the garden, recently so heavy with wisteria, the growing grandchildren and London’s  elegant Georgian squares where once I lived, seemingly with my eyes closed. Whatever we do in life we should try to catch, enjoy and preserve the moment. I spent years interviewing famous people on a tape recorder. I still have many of the recordings. But not a single one of my late mother. It never occurred to me until it was too late. Family is, of course, everything. As Bob told his daughter Rosa: ‘Home isn’t houses. And it isn’t country. It’s family.’ He was right. Home is where you make it, where the family gathers, where the children know they can always come back to — though it might be in a quite different building from the one in which they grew up. Home is family. I used to joke that one way to a happy life was to marry your best friend, which is what I did when I married Plum. What I hadn’t realised was that one day our children would become our — joint — closest friends. They have. And nothing could make me happier.","Hoskins' individual approach was distilled in 'Eleven Lessons for Life' list .

"Howard Webb tipped Nicola Rizzoli to be appointed as the final referee two weeks ago. The camp has been affected by politics all tournament and being connected to the right people helps.

"Lionel Messi is the best player I’ve ever seen in the flesh and he has helped drag this Argentina team to the final. But it’s still difficult to watch the player he is now, compared to the one he was three or four years ago. I don’t buy the theory that he is better because he’s evolving. Go and watch highlights of his peak years at Barcelona and he was absolutely electric. That pace and speed off the mark have gone. But for all that, he is still the main man and if Argentina are to win this World Cup, you have to look at Messi. On his back: Lionel Messi may not be the player he was but he's carried Argentina to the World Cup final . Easing the burden: Sergio Aguero should play if he's fit - he's an asset to Lionel Messi . Coach Alejandro Sabella has a decision to make over Sergio Aguero. If he has had no injury reaction, he should play because he makes Messi a better player. In Miroslav Klose, the Germans have an arch predator, and Thomas Muller is such a good all-round player. I don’t expect them to change their line-up. MANUEL THE MARVEL . Germany have a huge advantage here. Sergio Romero may have been the semi-final shootout hero but Manuel Neuer could go down as one of the best goalkeepers we’ve ever seen. He’s a great shot-stopper, commands his area better than anybody and is fantastic on the ball. You could see how angry he was about conceding against Brazil and that tells you everything about him. Romero has been solid, but Neuer’s the real deal. Real deal: Germany keeper Manuel Neuer has been outstanding throughout the tournament . Hero: Sergio Romero may have starred for Argentina in their shootout win over Holland but lacks Neuer's class . WILL ROJO GO LOCO? Neither side is magnificent at the back, though Argentina have improved as the tournament has gone on. I was not a Martin Demichelis fan, but he did very well to marshal Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie. Partner Ezequiel Garay is a real warrior and Pablo Zabaleta is excellent at right back, though there are question marks over Marcelo Rojo. The Germans are slightly better and I would not be surprised to see Mats Hummels in the Premier League soon. Top class: Argentina right-back Pablo Zabaleta is excellent but there are question marks over Marcelo Rojo . Steady: Germany fare slightly better at the back, while Mats Hummels could excel in the Premier League . Jerome Boateng too often looks like a last-ditch defender, something you can’t say about Philipp Lahm. Benedikt Howedes has done well, too, and overall the Germans have a better unit. ARGENTINA’S WEAK LINK . This is the weakest area of the  Argentina side. Javier Mascherano is  trying to do everything: tackling, passing, creating. He’s a fine player but a destroyer, not a playmaker. The lack of creativity in the middle is one of the reasons we haven’t seen Lionel Messi at his peak. He’s been good but at Barcelona, with quick passes from Xavi and Iniesta, he’s even better. Too much: Argentina's hard man Javier Mascherano is trying to be their playmaker to his team's detriment . What he does best: Mascherano blocks Holland star Arjen Robben's shot late in the semi-final . Argentina will have to pass the ball quickly or Germany will swarm all over them. Germany have so many midfield options. Sami Khedira was excellent against Brazil and, though his inclusion over Mario Gotze is not one for the purists, he has improved the balance.","Messi is the world's best but not as good as he was three or four years ago .

"On Wednesday I'm heading to Anfield to watch Liverpool versus Sunderland after an invite from Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers. I got the invite out of the blue when I wasn't working. It includes watching training and stay over. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers, Jose Mourinho and Chris Hughton .

Brendan Rodgers' side are flying high in second place following the 6-3 destruction of Cardiff . SAS: Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge (R) are the Premier League's most potent partnership . Nice gesture: Brendan Rodgers and Alex Ferguson (R) share humility and generosity as traits of a champion . At the time I guess it was to keep me busy whilst I was, as they say, 'between jobs.' I think it shows great humility thinking of others like that, especially with his team flying high, with all the media demands and people no doubt requesting interviews and appearances left, right and centre. That sort of gesture reminds me of a few years ago at Brentford when I did a bike ride to raise money to help pay the players' wages. I personally wrote to all the Premier League managers asking them to sponsor the 30-mile journey from my house to the ground in west London. A week after I had sent the letter I got a hand-written card in the post with a cheque inside for £500 from 'Alex and Cathy' wishing me the best of luck. The name on the bottom of the cheque was Alex Ferguson. He went on to win the league with Manchester United that season.

For Arsene Wenger his magnificent 1,000th game turned into a living nightmare – especially to see his team capitulate in that manner. His Invincible side of a decade ago not only played great football but they had warriors who performed with steel and gritty determination in every position on the pitch. When it comes to technique, Arsenal are better than the rest, but when it comes to the crunch, they cannot beat the best. Invincibles: Arsenal's current side are a pale shadow of the team that went through an entire season unbeaten . What a shock. What a surprise.

No wonder. It must be the maddest decision in the history of football to stage a World Cup there. To have football matches played in 120 degree heat, in the middle of June, to discuss playing in air-conditioned stadiums or moving it to the winter in a country when there is hardly anyone there in the first place. A massive stewards enquiry is needed to sort this mess out. There is surely no-way the competition can possibly go ahead there now. FIFA must do something about it before we have what will be the worst World Cup there has ever been. Take action!

There is no getting away from the fact his forward signings have not quite worked out this season. But Chris continues to carry himself with dignity and calm. He is controlled and measured whenever he is on TV or in front of reporters. It's no surprise, when a manager acts in that manner, that his players are now finding wins that will see them escape relegation and finish comfortably in mid-table. What a huge result against relegation rivals Sunderland where his side dominated against a team who should have been fighting for their lives. Then they had the composure to see the game out in the second half. Come rain or shine he always gives a confident interview and the man has got class. You could not wish to meet a nicer guy. I'm sure the Canaries will be singing cheerily come the end of the season. True gent: Norwich boss Chris Hughton is one of the nicest managers in the Premier League . Screamer: Alex Tettey sealed a 2-0 victory over Sunderland with a contender for goal of the season . Canaries singing: Norwich players celebrate a win that brings them closer to survival this season . Late on Tuesday night I watched the last episode of Breaking Bad. I've never watched anything like that online before, but being out of work and having plenty of time on my hands gave me a chance to watch the entire five series. When it finally finished late that night I took a deep breath and thought: 'That's a shame I really enjoyed that.' Box set: Having time on his hands has given Martin Allen a chance to watch all five series of Breaking Bad . I started wondering what I was going to do afterwards. Not again! Martin Allen's dog Monty is getting tired of constant walks . I woke up on Wednesday morning wondering how to pass the time that day, which had so often been filled with episodes of Breaking Bad during recent weeks and taking poor Monty, my dog, for a walk. Most dogs will jump up and down with excitement when they hear they're going for a walk, but now he flashes me a look as if to say: 'Please not again.' But then, out of the blue, I got a call at 3pm that afternoon and was offered a contract at Barnet until the end of the season. It all happened in a flash. I went in to the training ground the next morning to chat with the players, took training on Friday and had a game on Saturday. It was that quick. It's like with any walk of life, you want to work. When you get sacked it's a horrible feeling and you get very isolated and lonely. You have to move house and leave a large part of your life behind. The amount I've moved about it feels like I've been living in a caravan for the past five years. Barnet had just lost four games in a . row but the players did very well in windy and difficult conditions and . we beat Hereford two-nil. Back in the fray: Martin Allen (C) has returned as manager of Barnet until the end of the season . All you have to do is give the players some clarification in what they're doing and some self-belief. It was easy. Promotion might be a stretch this season, but we've got a very exciting chance to get into the play-offs and achieve some dreams.","Rodgers has asked me to visit Anfield, despite Liverpool's busy schedule .

"USA captain Tom Watson has taken full responsibility for any mistakes made in the Ryder Cup defeat to Europe. The 65-year-old was openly criticised by Phil Mickelson, just two hours after the contest ended in a 16.5 points to 11.5 victory for the hosts at Gleneagles. It was Europe's eighth win in the last 10 biennial contests and Mickelson made his feelings known in public soon after. VIDEO Scroll down to hear exactly what Phil Mickelson said about USA captain Tom Watson . USA captain Tom Watson (right) has taken full responsibility for any mistakes made in the Ryder Cup defeat . Watson (left) was openly criticised by Phil Mickelson (right) just two hours after the 2014 Ryder Cup ended . With Watson sitting just a few feet away, Mickelson - left out of a full day's play on Saturday for the first time in 10 Ryder Cup appearances - stated his support for the methods of Paul Azinger, who captained the side to their last win at Valhalla in 2008. Watson responded on Saturday, saying in an open letter: 'I take complete and full responsibility for my communication, and I regret that my words may have made the players feel that I didn't appreciate their commitment and dedication to winning the Ryder Cup. 'My intentions throughout my term as captain were both to inspire and to be honest. As for Phil's comments, I completely understand his reaction in the moment. 'Earlier this week I had an open and candid conversation with him and it ended with a better understanding of each other's perspectives.

On the performance of his team, Watson added: 'The guys gave everything. They played their hearts out. I was proud to get to know each and every one of them. I know they are all going to win tournaments, be on future Ryder Cup teams and have wonderful careers. 'Our team certainly showed guts when it took it to the other team early in Sunday's singles matches. We were indeed tied with them as the scoreboard turned wonderfully 'red'.

"Workers are to be offered tax-free shares to surrender employment rights, George Osborne revealed  yesterday. Under the Chancellor's plan, employees will receive as little as £2,000 when they agree not to sue their employers if they are mistreated or unfairly dismissed. Workers will also be required to give up their right to time off for training purposes, give longer notice if they intend to return to their jobs after parental leave and lose their redundancy protections. Scroll down for video . George Osborne (centre)  delivered his speech to the Tory conference yesterday before travelling to an EU finance ministers meeting where today he met French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici, left, and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble . Compromise: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne offered a bargain to workers in his speech in Birmingham . A week after Labour attempted to . hijack the Tories’ ‘one nation’ philosophy, Mr Osborne jokingly used the . Marxist slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite’. Business leaders hailed the proposal . as a key step towards a more dynamic and flexible workforce, and the . Chancellor’s aides predicted hundreds of thousands of employees would . take up the offer. But it infuriated union leaders, who . accused the Government of chiselling away at employment rights and . insisted few workers would be interested. Under the scheme, ‘employee-owners’ will be given between £2,000 and £50,000 of shares by their firms that . will be exempt from capital gains tax when sold. In return, they will agree to give up . their right to claim unfair dismissal, redundancy pay, the right to . request flexible working or time off for training and will have to give . twice as much notice of intent to return from parental leave. Legislation to bring in the new . optional contract will be introduced later this year and be put into law . in time for companies to use it from April next year. Announcing the policy to the Tory . conference in Birmingham, Mr Osborne said it would appeal to new . businesses starting up and small and medium-sized firms who need . flexible labour and highly-motivated staff. In a sombre speech, the Chancellor . insisted he would not be diverted from his plans to cut the deficit, . despite the double dip recession. Mr Osborne was joined by his wife Francis to walk back over the bridge to the Hyatt Hotel after his speech . Former minister: Tory grandee Edwina Currie at the Conservative Party Conference . The share option plan unveiled yesterday . combines Tory demands for less business red tape and a Lib Dem policy to . encourage more employee-ownership. Staff would be offered £2,000 to £50,000 of which would be exempt from any capital gains tax. They would then give up their rights to claim unfair . dismissal, statutory redundancy pay, requesting flexible working and . asking for longer parental leave. Employee-owner shares would be optional for existing staff but it could be compulsory for new hires or start-up firms. Legislation will be fast-tracked so the changes can come into force from April 2013. The scheme could cost £100m in 2017-18. Government sources said they expected take up to be highest among fast-growing small and mid-sized businesses. Mr . Osborne said: 'Get shares and become owners of the company you work . for. Owners, workers, and the taxman, all in it together.' He insisted he would not repeat the . mistakes of Edward Heath in 1972, who ‘two years into office was faced . with economic problems and over powerful unions buckled and gave up’. He attempted to woo the ‘strivers’ who handed Margaret Thatcher three election victories, saying the party . represented ‘all those who aspire, all who work, save and hope, all who . feel a responsibility to put in, not just take out’. ‘Whether it’s the owner of the corner . shop staying open until midnight to support their family, or the . teacher prepared to defy her union and stay late to take the . after-school club,’ the Chancellor added. Or the commuter who leaves home before . the children are up, and comes back long after they have gone to bed, . because they want a better life for them. Or the pensioner, who has . saved all their life, and doesn’t want to spend it all as they want to . pass something on to their children. ‘Or the entrepreneur who doesn’t cash out and pack up, but devotes their flair and energy to building the next success story. ‘They are all part of one nation – one nation working together to get on. That is the nation we represent.’ Mr Osborne won big cheers as he flatly . rejected Liberal Democrat demands for a ‘mansion tax’ on expensive . properties – warning that ‘once the tax inspector had his foot in the . door you’d soon find most homes in the country labelled a “mansion”, . homes people have worked hard to afford and already paid taxes on’. ‘It’s not a mansion tax, it’s homes tax and this party of home ownership will have no truck with it,’ he declared. But he said those at the ‘very top’ would have to pay more towards the deficit reduction programme, as long . as it could be done without ‘damaging the enterprise economy’. He told delegates ‘the economy is . healing’ but warned that ‘healing is taking longer than we hoped because . the damage was greater than we feared’. The Chancellor announced that as . austerity measures continue into the next Parliament, he will continue . the current split of 80 per cent of the effort coming from reduced . spending and 20 per cent from taxes. Prime Minister David Cameron applauds as Chancellor George Osborne addresses the Tory party conference . The Chancellor's speech was well-received in Symphony Hall in Birmingham . He confirmed plans to slash a further . £10billion from the welfare budget – proposing removing housing benefit . from the young unemployed and limits on handouts to jobless parents who . insist on having more children, without being able to afford them. George Osborne suffered a setback . last night as the International Monetary Fund said it now expects the UK . economy to shrink by 0.4 per cent this year – far worse than the growth . of 0.2 per cent it predicted in July. It also downgraded its 2013 growth . forecast from 1.4 per cent to 1.1 per cent – little more than half the 2 . per cent expected by the Treasury in another blow to the Chancellor. But there was better news from the . Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development which said the . British economy is picking up even as the eurozone plunges deeper into . crisis. Mr Osborne also suggested that some of . the cuts would come from freezing benefits. He said: ‘How can we . justify the incomes of those out-of-work rising faster than the incomes . of those in work?’ Attacking Labour’s demands for more . debt-fuelled public spending, he said: ‘Our critics gamble everything: . our credibility, our financial stability, our low interest rates, the . cost of our debt – they would risk everything on the dubious idea that a . few billion more of spending would dramatically improve the fortunes of . a trillion and a half-pound British economy.’ Unveiling his employee-ownership . scheme, he described it as a ‘three way deal’. ‘You the company: give . your employees shares in the business. You the employee: replace your old rights of unfair dismissal and redundancy with new rights of ownership,’ he said. ‘And what will the Government do? We’ll charge no capital gains tax at all on the profit you make on your . shares. Zero per cent capital gains tax for these new employee-owners. ‘Get shares and become owners of the . company you work for. Owners, workers, and the taxman, all in it . together. Workers of the world, unite.’ The Chancellor waved briefly at the end of his speech before quickly leaving the stage .

"Without Papiss Cisse, Newcastle would be bottom of the Premier League. Without Papiss Cisse, Alan Pardew probably wouldn’t be in a job. And this, don’t forget, is the same Papiss Cisse with whom the management team had become disillusioned during his season-long struggle for form and fitness last time around. They kept faith and, now, the future of Pardew and the club rests with their No 9. Papiss Cisse (centre) beats Ashley Williams to ball to score Newcastle's first goal against Swansea . Papiss Cisse (right) scores his and Newcastle's second goal to rescue a point against Swansea . Swansea keeper Lukasz Fabianksi is left helpless as Papiss Cisse celebrates scoring his second goal . Indeed, in scoring four goals from three matches already this season, he has doubled his league tally from the entirety of last term. His point-saving braces – against Hull and now Swansea – mean Pardew will remain in charge until they face Leicester at St James’ Park a week on Saturday and almost certainly beyond. United remain in the bottom three and without a win in seven, equalling their worst run from the outset of a Premier League campaign. But Cisse has given his under-fire boss a timely lift. For no matter his declarations of ‘strength’ and ‘resilience’, the strain was beginning to show. ‘You need that player who can score under pressure and when you need one desperately – he did that twice,’ said Pardew, reflecting on Cisse’s close-range hook from an impossible angle and his poached finish to salvage a draw. ‘He gives us a real cutting edge. His first goal is top drawer, trust me. To score from that angle is very difficult. The second goal again was very good technique. To have him back and scoring goals is huge for us. Papiss Cisse gestures to manager alan Pardew after scoring his first goal . Alan Pardew congratulates Papiss Cisse on his two goals as the striker is substituted . Some Newcastle fans continued to call for Alan Pardew to be sacked before the match . Alan Pardew was relieved to get a point against Swansea after another troubled week at Newcastle . ‘I can now hopefully look to the next game. It’s a massive chance to get a win and we’ve got to try and take that.’ Cisse’s goals cancelled out Wilfried Bony’s 17th-minute opener and former Magpie Wayne Routledge’s second-half dink which restored Swansea’s lead, and sent them momentarily to joint second. Newcastle’s Senegal striker also netted twice during a 2-0 win at the Liberty Stadium in April, 2012 and that was in the midst of a run which included 11 in eight games. But Cisse was making his first start on Saturday since breaking his kneecap in April, and insists he’s still some way off his free-scoring best. ‘For me I’m not “back, back”,’ he said. ‘I’m not on fire! I’m just working hard at the moment. I got an opportunity and I scored, I’m just doing my job. Wilfried Bony edges out Paul Dummett before scoring Swansea's first goal . Wayne Routledge chips the ball over Newcastle keeper Tim Krul to score Swansea's second goal . ‘But I need to do a lot more for this team, I need to get better. Two years ago I was like fire, scoring goals, but last year it wasn’t that way. That’s football. I need to keep going.’ Owner Mike Ashley was there to witness United’s comeback, but still there were calls for him and Pardew to go. One cutting protest banner read: ‘ LLWDLLLWWLWLLLLLLLLWLLDDLD’ – Not a Welsh Town, Our Form in 2014′. And Cisse admitted: ‘It’s a very difficult time for the team. It’s three points we need. It’s not easy, it’s very hard at the moment. ‘The fans are not happy. The players need to believe in themselves and work hard, and it will come good. The Premier League is not easy. It’s not finished yet. We’re only a few games into the season, maybe it will turn. ‘This moment is not easy for the manager, and it’s not easy for the players too. It’s about belief and working hard and one day maybe we will come good.’ Cisse is certainly coming good for Pardew right now.","Striker scored twice as Newcastle drew 2-2 with Swansea on Saturday .

"Found: Police sergeant Neale Coy lives in the Goole area of East Yorkshire . A police sergeant who sparked a missing person appeal after he failed to turn up for work has been found safe and well, Humberside Police said today. Neale Coy, 50, who lives in the Goole area of East Yorkshire and failed to attend for his shift last night, was found in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire. Earlier today, colleagues said the disappearance was 'totally out of character' for the officer, who has more than 27 years of service. Sergeant Coy had failed to turn up for his shift last night and had not been seen by friends or family since. A Humberside Police spokesman said: 'Mr Coy came forward at Scunthorpe General Hospital today and will now be supported by the force.' Police launched an appeal to trace their colleague earlier today, saying they were 'worried about his welfare'. A concerned Rich Kerman, a senior Humberside Police officer who works with Sgt Coy, had said: 'I have known Neale for over 20 years and it is totally out of character for him to simply not show up for a shift. 'Neale, if you are watching this on the news, hear it on the radio or see it either online or in a newspaper, please get in touch either with your family or by calling in and speaking to the force duty officer to let us know you are OK and look at coming to meet you. 'If something is troubling you then you shouldn't be looking to face it alone and we can help.' Officers raised the alarm after Mr Coy, who has more than 27 years of service, did not show up for work, Humberside Police said. Police refused to comment any further.","Family described his disappearance as 'totally out of character'

"Ched Evans was paid £20,000-a-week for more than three months in prison and was visited by Sheffield United's boss and co-owner... but will they welcome him back? Sheffield United co-chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps have issued a statement denying reports that they have offered Ched Evans a new contract following his release from prison. Evans, 25, left Wymott Prison on Friday having served half of a five-year sentence for rape. The Sun  reported that the Welsh striker was to be offered a new deal by United, but the League One club have denied those allegations. However, they say that they are continuing to 'deliberate on a new deal.' Sheffield United have denied they have offered Ched Evans a new contract following his release from prison . The Welsh footballer was pictured leaving Wymott Prison in the early hours of Friday morning . The statement, published on the club website, reads: 'Sheffield United has become aware of speculative media coverage concerning the immediate future of its former player Ched Evans. 'An article in The Sun today (Saturday 18th October) that Sheffield United has offered a contract to former player Ched Evans is false and damaging to the Club. 'We have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long term decision about Ched Evans.' Sheffield United boss Nigel Clough (left) and co-owner Kevin McCabe (right) both visited Evans in prison . Family and friends arrived at Evans' mother's house in North Wales following his release on Friday . It was alleged that the two-year contract offered would have been worth £500,000 for the Wales international. Evans was convicted of raping a 19-year-old girl in his home town of Rhyl in 2011, but was visited in prison by McCabe and manager Nigel Clough. He maintained his fitness in the facility in the north west, and seems to be keen to return to football with the Blades, though it is still unclear whether they will welcome him back. Sheffield United were still paying Evans' 20,000-a-week wages, Matt Lawton reports, for more than three months while he was in prison, but the chairmen refused to comment on that fact. Publicly, the League One club say they are still wrestling with the moral dilemma of having a convicted rapist in their team. Phipps, has said they are 'puzzling' through the problem and will not necessarily reach a decision any time soon. Lee Hughes (left) and Marlon King (right) both served time in prison before returning to football . Many Blades fans have called for Evans to be rehabilitated but almost 150,000 people have signed an online petition urging the Bramall Lane club not to welcome him back. Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. The footballer denied the offence but was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court. He admitted having sex with her but the woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident. The prosecution said the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was too drunk to consent to sexual intercourse. Evans (left), who made 13 appearances for Wales prior to his conviction, may return to the international scene . Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald also admitted having sex with the victim but was found not guilty of the same charge. An appeal against Evans' conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His girlfriend, Natasha Massey, has led a campaign to have the conviction overturned. Evans' case is due to be reviewed by the Criminal Case Review Commission in the coming weeks. Sheffield United have steadfastly refused to comment on whether they will allow Evans to play again. Earlier this week manager Nigel Clough said the matter had been discussed by the club's hierarchy. He said the decision was not his to make but would be made by the club 'in good time'. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said on Thursday that the owners of Sheffield United should 'think really long and hard' before deciding whether to allow Evans back. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ched Evans was released from Wymott Prison early on Friday morning .

"Ched Evans was released from jail in the early hours of Friday armed with some new skills that might come in handy should football decide against giving him a second chance. In the two and a half years the former Sheffield United striker has spent in Wymott Prison, a Category C facility for sex offenders in Lancashire, he has performed various jobs. He was a painter and decorator for a while, and also worked in the prison gymnasium — a role that enabled him to stay fit and be as ready as he possibly can for a return to professional sport. Ched Evans, who played for Sheffield United before his conviction,  was released from prison on Friday . The Welsh footballer, who last played for Sheffield United, was pictured leaving Wymott Prison . Family and friends arrived at Evans' mother's house in North Wales following his release on Friday . That, of course, is the intention of the 25-year-old Wales striker and it seems to be the intention of Sheffield United to facilitate that return. Publicly, the League One club say they are still wrestling with the moral dilemma of having a convicted rapist in their team. Their co-chairman, Jim Phipps, has said they are ‘puzzling’ through the problem and will not necessarily reach a decision any time soon. Nigel Clough, their manager, said this week that he would leave the decision to his employers. The club spokesman offers no comment, neither do members of the official supporters’ club on an issue that divides the fanbase. This newspaper called two members of the supporters’ club on Friday, one of whom was a woman. Both refused to comment and hung up. These, of course, are innocent people. They did not rape a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room near Rhyl in May 2011. But they might be interested to know that there is a desire among the hierarchy at Bramall Lane to see Evans return to the club. It might not be an opinion held by everyone but it is one shared by certain individuals in positions of power. Indeed, officials have even been heard to echo the view being expressed by Evans’s family and his supporters that he was wrongly convicted by a jury in Caernarfon Crown Court on April 20, 2012. Of course, nobody will admit to that at the moment. Earlier this week a club spokesman refused to comment on the fact they continued to pay Evans’s £20,000-a-week wages for more than three months after he was jailed. They might have released him at the end of a contract that expired on June 30, but they chose not to sack him even though a criminal conviction surely amounted to gross misconduct. The evidence suggests the club have far from deserted a 25-year-old who has scored 48 goals in 113 games for them, including 35 in 42 games during the 2011-12 campaign that was suddenly brought to a premature end. This is a player, remember, who has been capped 13 times by Wales and cost £3million when the Blades bought him from Manchester City in July 2009. There is the fact that Clough and co-owner Kevin McCabe visited Evans in jail in April, reportedly to invite him back to training on his release. Evans (left), who made 13 appearances for Wales prior to his conviction, may return to the international scene . Sheffield United boss Nigel Clough (left) and co-owner Kevin McCabe (right) both visited Evans in prison . And there is a suggestion dialogue has continued throughout his imprisonment between Evans’s family and his representatives and the club. Despite numerous attempts to contact him, McCabe has been unavailable for comment this week. This would explain why no effort appears to have been made to secure Evans employment elsewhere. His name has not been touted around to clubs in desperate need of a decent striker. Presumably this is because his family are as confident of seeing him return to Bramall Lane as they appear to be of having his conviction overturned. His case was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in London in November 2012, but now Evans, who plans to issue a video statement next week, will take his case to the Criminal Cases Review Conviction with a legal team employed by his girlfriend’s millionaire father. Beyond the 150,000 people who have put their names to a petition opposed to seeing Evans return to professional football, plenty have had their say. While leading voices within the game believe in the basic principle of giving anyone who has served their sentence a second chance — with PFA boss Gordon Taylor chief among those voices — senior politicians have expressed what is probably a wider-held view. PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor insists Evans should be allowed to return after serving his time . Former Minister for Sport and Sheffield United fan Richard Caborn does not want Evans back at the club . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, a Sheffield MP, has warned the football club against re-employing a convicted rapist and Richard Caborn added his voice to the debate. Standing outside Bramall Lane, the former Minister for Sport and Sheffield MP said it would be a ‘sad day for football’ if the player was taken back. ‘It’s a very sad episode, but Ched Evans is a convicted rapist,’ said Caborn, a lifelong Blades fan. ‘I wouldn’t want to see him in a Sheffield United shirt, or that of any other club, until he acknowledges what he did was wrong and indeed shows remorse for his actions. I believe that will give him his pathway back to professional football.’ Right now Sheffield United seem to have adopted a tactic often employed by politicians: gauging the reaction before committing one way or the other. Curtis Woodhouse, the Sheffield United player turned professional boxer, said: ‘If you pride yourself on being a family club like we do, you can’t have a convicted rapist as your star striker. I don’t want to see Ched Evans back at Sheffield United. Morals over goals.’ Former Sheffield United footballer Curtis Woodhouse has said he would not welcome Evans back . On the official Ched Evans website, his supporters insist he is a role model who will ‘make a personal and profound statement by video’ next week. They also continue with their campaign to discredit the victim in that hotel room that night. In December 2012, Evans’s cousin, Gemma Thomas, was one of nine people ordered to pay the woman £624 for revealing her identity. Thomas called the victim a ‘money-grabbing slut’ and accused her of ‘ruining lives’. The FA has vowed to crack down on any chants ridiculing Evans’s victim and ‘celebrating’ his crime — if and when his career resumes. Sport, indeed society, does lack consistency in dealing with these cases. Lee Hughes remains a professional footballer after two serious convictions. He spent three years in jail after causing death by dangerous driving in 2003 and was found guilty of common assault, with a charge of sexual assault dropped, in May 2012. The former West Bromwich Albion striker now plays for Forest Green in the Vanarama Conference. Lee Hughes (left) and Marlon King (right) both served time in prison before returning to football . An incident in December 2008 saw Marlon King sentenced to 18 months in jail after being convicted of sexual assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. For an incident that involved a 20-year-old female student, he was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register for seven years. At the time, Wigan cancelled his contract and King’s appeal against the conviction was unsuccessful. But football clubs had King back, as did the Jamaica national team, with Sheffield United the last club he represented. When video evidence emerged last month of American football star Ray Rice assaulting his wife in a lift, he was sacked by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL. But Mike Tyson, like Evans a convicted rapist, has been rehabilitated to such an extent that he has even appeared in a major Hollywood movie. In 2011, almost two decades after his conviction, Tyson was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Last year, however, the authorities would not grant him access to the UK to promote his autobiography because of his conviction. When it comes to Evans, the next move rests with Sheffield United.

"Nile Ranger has offered his support to convicted rapist Ched Evans following the former Sheffield United striker's release from prison on Friday morning. Evans served  half of his five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales  in 2011. Whether the 25-year-old should be allowed to return to football has been heavily debated during recent weeks, and former Newcastle forward Ranger went on Twitter to offer his opinion. Ched Evans, who played for Sheffield United before his conviction,  was released from prison on Friday . Former Newcastle striker Nile Ranger was cleared of rape earlier this year . He tweeted: 'Ched Evans top player... I hope he gets to play again!' Ranger was himself cleared of rape earlier this year after a seven-day trial at Newcastle Crown Court. The striker was alleged to have raped a woman in a hotel room in Newcastle but was cleared after the jury quickly reached a not-guilty verdict. Ranger, who now plays for Blackpool in the Championship, was also convicted of two counts of assault by beating against two police officers in 2012.

"Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough says bringing jailed striker Ched Evans back to Bramall Lane should be a decision taken by the owner and not at football level. Evans is due to be released two-and-a-half years into a five-year prison sentence for rape on Friday and has been heavily linked with a return to the Blades - the club he was at when convicted in 2012. The South Yorkshire outfit have faced a backlash over potentially re-signing the former Wales international, with more than 90,000 people signing a petition against his possible re-employment. Ched Evans was at Sheffield United when he was convicted of rape and sent to prison . But they are continuing to discuss the matter, with Clough only having a small say in the decision. 'We have had one or two discussions, we are awaiting a decision and the owners will make that in good time.' Clough said. 'I have been involved in decisions, but it is very much a decision for the owners and when the time is right to say something as a club we will do that. 'It is that sort of decision - it's above football level. 'It's my decision whether to put him in the team if he comes back, it's not my decision whether he comes back in the first place - that's theirs. 'Until the decision is made there is no point talking about it. Nigel Clough says any decision to bring Evans back to Bramall Lane will be 'above' football . 'It's not been distraction within the camp. First of all he's not out yet and secondly the club haven't made a decision and until those two things happen it is irrelevant.' Evans scored 48 goals in 113 games for the Blades prior to his imprisonment, including 35 in 42 games during the 2011-12 campaign which was cut short due to his trial and conviction. A jury at Caernarfon Crown Court found Evans guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in April 2012. Evans admitted having sex with the woman on May 30 2011, but said it was consensual.","Ched Evans due to be released two-and-a-half years into jail sentence .

"Boris Johnson last night launched a crowd-pleasing demand for a return to grammar schools. The London Mayor sought to boost his standing with the Tory faithful by announcing his ‘strong belief in competitive education’ and selective admissions. It is the first time in more than a decade that a Conservative heavyweight has advocated a return to selection. There was a scrum of TV crews, photographers, reporters and fans waiting for Boris Johnson at Birmingham New Street Station . The London Mayor's taxi was surrounded by photographers in scenes usually reserved for popstars and A list celebrities . Mr Johnson, who does not control the . capital’s schools, again hinted at his  prime ministerial ambitions by . saying he was not able to shape party policy in  education ‘yet’. He was given a rock star reception at the Birmingham conference. A crowd chanting ‘Boris, Boris, Boris’ gathered at New Street station when he arrived by train and he faced a scrum of delegates and media at the conference hotel. At a rally in his honour attended by around 1,000 grassroots Tories, Mr Johnson said: ‘I’m a strong believer in competitive education. What was the Olympics? It was a pageant of competition. We should be allowing children to compete academically. ‘I personally have no objections to selective admissions at some stage.’ He said ‘some people object’ to the 11 plus, which divides pupils at that age, but he said it should be possible to select at later ages. And in a clear hint that he wants a wider national role, Mr Johnson concluded: ‘As far as party policy is concerned I’m not in a position to do this – yet.’ Mr Johnson tonight received a standing ovation from hundreds of activists at a ConservativeHome fringe meeting . The Boris Johnson circus threatened to overshadow the main keynote speech today from Chancellor George Osborne . He also said he would continue to . speak out in favour of a new hub airport, an idea the Coalition has . punted into the long grass. His provocative intervention on . education may not please David Cameron, who decided against reopening . the grammar school debate back in 2007. Conference: Boris Johnson takes centre stage . But not everyone has been swept up in Boris-mania. Veteran minister Ken Clarke today said Mr Johnson had to grow up. 'If he really wants to be a . prime minister for serious reasons and not just getting his picture in . the paper more often, he really does have to settle down and demonstrate . he can seriously deliver on some complicated subjects,' he told a meeting hosted by . Channel 4 on the fringe of the conference. He added it would be 'disastrous' if Mr Johnson could not get the 'fashionable' speculation under control. Health minister Anna Soubry also played . down the idea that the public was gripped by Borismania: 'Not one person . in my constiuency ever has said anything to me about Boris.' But the Boris Johnson circus still threatened to overshadow the main keynote speech today from Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Johnson refused to say . if Mr Cameron was a better Prime Minister than he would be, insisting . the claim was ‘unverifiable’. And  the London Mayor used his . newspaper column to claim the government had left the 'struggling . middle' feeling 'utterly ignored. Last night he addressed hundreds of supporters at a rally organised by the ConservativeHome website under the triumphal banner 'Re-elected and Olympotastic'. He was careful to praise Mr Cameron, and said he was one of the first Tory MPs to back him as party leader. Boris Johnson battled through crowds and a media scrum to arrive at The Hyatt Hotel . Mr Johnson had to battle through camera crews at Birmingham New Street station (left) before being confronted by more cameras when he passed through security at the conference venue (right) The London Mayor said the Conservative party had to remain squarely on the centre ground and claim back the One Nation mantra from Ed Miliband. But he refused to rule out publicly challenging policy drawn up by the coalition. Mr Johnson said: ’Of course I am going to fight what I think might be ill-conceived Lib Dem plans for a mansion tax when I read about it. 'Of course I am I going to continue to lobby for a long overdue solution to our aviation capacity problems. The rise and rise of his old friend has given David Cameron plenty to think about while in the conference hall earlier today . 'No-one, as a result of that, should have any cause to doubt my admiration of David Cameron. 'He, George Osborne and the government are doing exactly what is needed to clean up the country and the mess Labour left.' But . in a direct challenge to Mr Cameron he warned against thinking a third . runway at Heathrow would solve Britain's aviation capacity crisis. 'I say to my friends who secretly think a third runway:you need to move away from that idea. 'None of these solutions is easy but we can't do is turn a blind eye to what is happening in other European countries.' And he raised the prospect of a return to grammar schools, an issue which threatened to destabilise Mr Cameron's leadership in 2007. 'I am a strong believer in competitive education,' Mr Johnson said. 'We should be able to allow children to compete academically in my view in that way. 'I personally have no objection to selective admissions at some stage in a child's development.' The success of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games on his watch has boosted Mr Johnson's popularity just as Mr Cameron's has waned. Mr Johnson joked: 'I sometimes think after the great success of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is we need more things like it. What's next? The Politicians Olympics.' 'Jeremy Hunt would be wanging the bell end. Me for the zip wire, Seb Coe for the 800m, William Hague for the judo. 'And Ed Miliband for the high jump.' The remarkable scenes as Mr Johnson arrived in Birmingham contrast with the . low key arrival of Mr Cameron at the conference centre on Saturday and . confirm Mr Johnson's reputation as political box office. Asked if he was in Birmingham to make trouble for Prime Minister, Mr Johnson replied: 'I'm here to support the party.' He ignored further questions as he was chased through the hotel. Then today he will make a more traditional speech from the main conference stage. Mr . Cameron has been repeatedly forced to answer questions about the threat . to his leadership posed by his old schoolfriend from Eton. This week the PM said he 'was relaxed . about having the blond haired mop sounding off from time to time' after . Mr Johnson challenged him over Europe, aviation policy and tax. On . Sunday a a survey by pollsters Opinium for The Observer gave Mr Johnson . him a net +30 rating among voters, compared to -21 for the Prime . Minister. Asked if he was planning to make trouble for David Cameron, the London Mayor replied: 'I'm here to support the party.' The extraordinary scenes confirm Mr Johnson's reputation as the Tory party's biggest star .","Rail passengers chant mob the London Mayor as he arrives at Birmingham New Street rail station .

"All he wanted was a phone call. According to Rio Ferdinand, the most toxic scandal in the history of the Premier League era could have been avoided if John Terry had just picked up the telephone and apologised. Yet isn’t that the nub of it? The reason Terry’s foul exchange with Rio’s brother Anton continues to resonate almost three years later is because civil resolution was impossible once the wheels of the modern race scandal began turning. Rio’s recollection of that time is shaming for British society. Smashed windows, bullets in the post, abuse in the street. His mother was hospitalised with stress. And his family were the victims. Understandably, he feels bitter that Terry appeared without remorse through this turbulent period. Yet it was not as simple as that. The FA ruled that Anton Ferdinand (left) was called a 'f****** black c***' by John Terry (right) in October 2011 . Rio Ferdinand has revealed that if John Terry (left) had phoned then the race row could have been solved . Rio Ferdinand (left) says he no longer speaks to his former England team-mate John Terry (right) The moment a member of the public complained about what Terry is alleged to have shouted down the pitch on October 23, 2011, communication became impossible. That is the nature of this beast. Other disputes can be resolved with clear-eyed honesty, but the instantaneously sensitive process around race cases ends all hope of a swift or constructive outcome. In an ideal world, Terry learns, the Ferdinand family receives its apology, examples are set, progress is made. This is not to brush racial politics under the carpet. The two sides could have been reconciled in the glare of publicity, maybe appeared side by side, taking questions from the floor. It would have been awkward but was the alternative much better? Court cases and FA hearings, resignations and sackings and, at the end, what? John Terry quit England after the FA’s charge, despite being cleared in court of racial abuse . Anton Ferdinand (right) leaves Westminster Magistrates Court following John Terry's criminal case in 2012 . If the incident was repeated at a match next weekend, would English football be any further forward? It would have some nice, statutory punishment procedures in place, but little more. Education, contrition and growth should be the aim: qualities a little more useful than a 10-game ban. Everyone has, at some point, spoken in the heat of a moment. Everyone has said something they instantly regret. Nothing as incendiary as the words Terry is accused of uttering. Not racist, but worthy of apology. And that apology can be made, whether immediately or on reflection, in the hope of advancement. We resolve and move on. That is human nature. Rio Ferdinand (right) says the race row involving his brother Anton (left) could have been sorted with a call . John Terry (right) was banned by FA for alleged language used against Anton Ferdinand (left) in October 2011 . Yet that was not the case on October 23. Within hours, under pressure, Terry had his alibi and was sticking to it. Equally, social media had begun driving a news agenda that screamed for action. The authorities responded with intent to prosecute. And that was the point of no return. Reflecting on the days that followed in his autobiography, Ferdinand is insightful on race issues. ‘The matter should have been sorted quickly in a way that would have allowed everyone, including John Terry, to emerge with dignity,’ he says. Of course, he is right. That would have been considerably healthier than the saga played out across courtrooms and in the offices of the national association, a scandal that cost the job of the England manager and its captain, and the careers of several footballers. Rio did not play for England again, Terry retired in haste and Anton has not been the same player. Rio Ferdinand (left to right), Ashley Cole and John Terry were all team-mates for England for several years . Rio Ferdinand (right) and John Terry (left) have not spoken since the QPR-Chelsea match in October 2011 . Yet, just as Ferdinand admits in his autobiography that he was under legal instruction not to talk publicly about the case, so Terry would have been under pressure. He would have received legal counsel, and possibly advice from his club, and they would have been of one voice. Say sorry, they would have told him, and you might as well admit guilt. He was never going to pick up the phone and make that call, once the external clamour began. Ferdinand apparently sought reconciliation, a chance to talk frankly and to receive honesty in return. Instead, the last direct conversation Terry had with a member of the Ferdinand family took place that fateful Sunday; any other contact was deemed too complex, just at a time when openness, intimacy and sincerity was urgently required. ‘Everyone please just respect each other,’ is Ferdinand’s message now. He almost echoes Rodney King’s plaintive plea during the LA riots. ‘Can we all get along?’ King asked. And we can, mostly. Yet the fall-out from English football’s most poisonous exchange is scant evidence of it. The processes put in place failed miserably and have left English football no further advanced. There is still no legacy beyond bitter recrimination. Nobody learns, nobody grows and nobody says sorry any more.

"Saido Berahino is the only top flight Englishman to match Harry Kane’s tally of 10 goals for club and country this season. One is being tipped for an England call-up, the other curiously isn’t. But after a hat-trick on Thursday night in Tottenham’s thumping 5-1 win over Asteras Tripolis, Kane has set his sights on Roy Hodgson’s squad. With England’s European Championship qualifying group looking tediously straightforward, Hodgson could surprise a few with his selection process over the next year. If he needs a centre forward, West Brom frontman Berahino shouldn’t be the only one on his radar. Harry Kane wheels away en route to scoring a hat-trick in Tottenham's 5-1 demolition of Asteras Tripolis . The Spurs forward was forced to play in goal after Hugo Lloris (R) was sent off in the Europa League clash . Kane, whose fantastic performance was nearly outshone by a stunning ‘rabona’ strike from Erik Lamela on Thursday, has one target. But the 21-year-old is still typically grounded. ‘[England] is obviously where I want to get to, that’s the aim, the senior squad,’ he said. ‘But I’ve just got to keep concentrating on my club football and trying to score, and if I do well in time I’ll get the chance.’ But just seven Premier League starts under his belt and 24 in all competitions makes him a raw yet inexperienced talent. Kane has notched up 10 goals for club and country this season as he chases an England call up . Tottenham winger Erik Lamela (C) outshone all of his teammates with his stunning 'rabona' goal . But he only has to look across the Spurs dressing room at Andros Townsend for an example of England taking a chance on inexperience. The winger had played 23 times in the Premier League before he was picked in Hodgson’s squad last October, scoring on his debut. Kane is desperate to replicate Townsend’s path. ‘He did very well, he got his games, played well, and got his reward. Hopefully if I keep doing what I’m doing, that can be the future. ‘But I think Under 21 football is important, especially international. We’ve done great with that, I’m looking forward to Euro 2015.’ Saido Berahino, the only other Englishman to net 10 goals this season, scores against Manchester United . Kane is hoping to follow teammate Andros Townsend's (C) route to success with England . The next big step for Kane is becoming a regular starter in the top flight under Mauricio Pochettino. There have been none this season, the Argentine instead preferring Emmanuel Adebayor or Roberto Soldado. Kane, who can play as a lead striker, second striker or on the wing, is aware the top flight is where his name will be made. He’ll be wondering what else he needs to do if he doesn’t start against Newcastle at White Hart Lane on Saturday. ‘Obviously the Premier League is the top league in the world and that’s what everyone is watching and that’s where you want to hit your goals. ‘But every time I get the chance I have to do what I can, as many goals as I can.’","Harry Kane scored hat-trick against Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League .

"Protest: Douglas Alexander, shadow secretary of state for international development, says England players should walk off if they are racially abused . England players should walk off in protest and abandon the match if any of them are racially abused during the Euro 2012 football competition, Labour said last night. The unprecedented call for a pitch protest by Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander came amid a growing political row over the   tournament in Poland and Ukraine. And the view received strong support in a snap poll, which suggested six out of ten backing players who walk off. Mr Alexander said that if, as many fear, black England players are abused when the team plays Ukraine on Tuesday week, the match should be stopped – with the points awarded to England. Ukraine and Poland should face similar sanctions to the sporting boycott of South Africa in apartheid days, Labour added. Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, Mr Alexander argues: ‘I support referees taking the strongest possible action in the face of racist abuse from the terraces. They have the power to stop the game should any racist incidents occur – they should use it and be backed by the governing body. ‘However, if a referee ignored blatant racist abuse, and the England players or their management felt they were justified in walking off, they should be supported in their action. ‘If either host country’s fans misbehave, the teams could be taken off by the referee with the home team forfeiting the points. Hopefully something like that might encourage players to challenge their supporters.’ Mr Alexander also called on David Cameron and the soccer authorities to back Labour’s tough stance: ‘The British Government should send a clear signal to Uefa that it wants racism to be dealt with swiftly and robustly.’ He was backed by fellow Labour front bencher Jim Murphy who said that as well as calling off matches, all Ukrainian and Polish players should start the next game with yellow cards to punish racist chants by fans. And they should be made to play behind closed doors. Labour’s stance is in stark contrast to that of Michel Platini, president of UEFA, European soccer’s ruling body, who said players who walk off should be booked. The England team are training at a ground in Krakow ahead of the Euro 2012 championship . Pressed on the race row last week, he . brushed it aside saying: ‘I don’t think there’s any more racism in . Poland and Ukraine than in France or anywhere else, or even in England. It’s not a footballing problem. It’s a problem for society.’ Mr . Alexander also accused Mr Cameron of ‘dithering and delay’ over his . response to the jailing of Ukraine’s opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko. British . Ministers are to boycott England matches in Ukraine in the group stages . of the tournament, but have not ruled out attending if the team . qualifies for the latter stages. Members of the England squad this week visited the factory in Poland where Oksar Schindler helped save thousands of Jews . ‘If England go all the way, Ukraine’s President Viktor Yanukovych should be left to stand and clap in the VIP section alone and not with David Cameron joking and cheering beside him,’ Mr Alexander said. The snap poll which supported Labour’s view also found that only one in five opposed players walking off. Similarly, half of voters said Ministers should boycott all games in Ukraine. Fewer than one in four disagree. The . Survation survey yesterday of 499 people is unweighted, and the figures . do not necessarily reflect the views of the population as a whole. Racism fears: The . families of England players Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, left, and Theo . Walcott, right, have decided not to travel to Poland and Ukraine . Shadow Defence Secretary Mr Murphy compared the pitch protest plan to the sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era. He said: ‘There are some who still claim that sport and politics don’t mix, but they always have done and always will. We should celebrate the power of sport to influence societies.’ Downing Street last night refused to back Labour’s call  for players walking off, insisting it was up to football authorities to decide. A spokesman also said there was no change in the ruling  on Ministers attending matches in Ukraine. Violence marred the opening of Euro 2012 after Russian hooligans attacked stewards at half-time during Friday’s match between Russia and the Czech Republic.

"With her eyes tightly shut and her face covered with paint, sequins and paper flowers, Bulgarian bride Fatme Inus followed centuries of tradition in her village when she married her groom yesterday. The practice of painting the bride's . face white and decorating it with sequins and coloured paint is called . 'gelena' in Bulgarian and is unique to Fatme's home, the remote town of Ribnovo. Ribnovo, set on a snowy mountainside in southwest Bulgaria, has kept its traditional winter marriage ceremony alive despite decades of Communist persecution, followed by poverty that forced many men to seek work abroad. Here comes the bride: Fatme Inus, her face painted white and decorated with sequins, emerges to present herself to villagers . Fatme Inus married her groom yesterday at the end of the a two-day wedding celebration in in Ribnovo, Bulgaria . The practice of painting the bride's face white and decorating it with sequins and coloured paint is called 'gelena' in Bulgarian, is unique to Ribnovo and is a tradition going back centuries . A young man urges away an inconvenient herd of sheep passing in front of bride Fatme Inus, her face painted white and decorated with sequins, as she holds a mirror and stands on a chair with her groom Mustafa Sirakov outside her home . The occasions are so important young men return from abroad to the crisp mountain snows, just for the winter weddings. People in Ribnovo identify themselves more by their religion, as Muslims, than by their ethnicity or nationality, and the wedding ceremony is an expression of their piety. The village has 10 clerics and two mosques for 3,500 inhabitants. A bride's family will laboriously pile up her dowry since she was born  - mostly handmade knit-work, quilts, coverlets, sheets, aprons, socks, carpets and rugs. On the morning of the wedding they hang the items on a wooden scaffolding, 50 metres long and three meters high, erected specially for the occasion. Mustafa Sirakov adjusts tinsel hanging from his bride during their wedding celebrations . The bride smiles after her groom Mustafa Sirakov carried her into his bedroom at his home where guests await on the last day of their wedding . Fatme Inus's husband Mustafa removes sequins from the white-painted face of his bride after taking her to his home . Nearly everyone in the village comes . to inspect the offerings: the tiny homeyards in the village are like a . showroom for the furniture and household appliances the bride has to . provide for her new household. The . girl and her husband-to-be will then lead a traditional horo dance on . the central square, joined by most of the village's youth. But the highlight of the ceremony, the painting of the bride's face, comes at the end of the second day. In . a private rite open only to female in-laws, her face is covered in . thick, chalky white paint and decorated with colourful sequins. A long, red veil covers her hair, her head is framed with tinsel, her painted face veiled with silvery filaments. Villagers take part in a group dance on the first day of two-day wedding celebrations in the village . Ethnographers say it is hard to date the bridal painting ritual, as the communist regime did not encourage studies into minority ethnic and religious groups . Mustafa Sirakov walks with his bride Fatme Inus across the main square where hundreds of villagers had gathered to dance and celebrate . Clad . in baggy pants and bodice shimmering in all the colors of the rainbow, . the bride is presented by her future husband, her mother and her . grandmother to the waiting crowd. The bride is not permitted to open her eyes wide until a Muslim priest blesses the young couple. Alcohol is forbidden at the wedding receptions and sex before marriage is taboo. Ethnographers . say it is hard to date the bridal painting ritual, as the communist . regime did not encourage studies into minority ethnic and religious . groups. 'It is very . likely that it is an invented tradition. It's their way to express who . they are,' said Margarita Karamihova, an associate professor at the . Ethnography Institute of the Bulgarian Academy of Science. Experts . say Pomaks had identity problems and faced more challenges than the . majority of Muslims in Bulgaria, who are ethnic Turks. 'In . the 1960s they would ban Islamic music at weddings, then they would not . allow traditional clothes, and in the 1980s, the whole traditional . Pomak wedding was banned,' said municipality mayor, Ahmed Bashev, born . in Ribnovo. Ribnovo's . inhabitants used to make a living from tobacco and agriculture, but low . incomes in the poorest EU country forced men to start seeking jobs in . cities in Bulgaria or in western Europe -- not least to raise money for a . wedding. Outside influences have been slow to reach Ribnovo and young people rarely marry an outsider. The newlyweds take part in a dance as the village joins in with their wedding celebrations .

"World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo is displaying without permission replicas of the FA Cup and Premier League trophies he won with Manchester United. The Real Madrid forward’s CR7 Museum in his home town of Funchal houses all his individual trophies as well as copies of the silverware from team successes throughout his stellar career. These include three replicas from his Premier League victories with United in 2007, 2008 and 2009, the FA Cup from 2004, the Champions League from 2008 and the FIFA Club World Cup, also from 2008. Cristiano Ronaldo (with Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2004) is displaying an FA Cup replica without permission . Ronaldo won a number of trophies while at Manchester United - including three Premier League titles . An FA licence is required to copy the FA Cup and making replicas of the Premier League trophy needs PL approval. All are on display without the application process being started by the superstar’s representatives. Neither English football body intends pursuing Ronaldo for breaching trophy regulations. Roy Hodgson has told England’s stars of tomorrow to start dreaming of winning Euro 2020 at Wembley. UEFA announced that the stadium will play host to the final and both semi-finals of a tournament being staged across 13 cities. England manager Hodgson said: ‘Young players have got to be thinking this is a great opportunity, not only to be part of a wonderful tournament but there at the end when the prizes are dished out.’ Yorkshire's strong support for captain Andrew Gale, who faces an ECB charge for using racist and abusive language against Lancashire batsman Ashwell Prince, is being interpreted as signalling the start of a battle between Giles Clarke and Yorkshire’s Colin Graves for the ECB chairmanship. It was Clarke who felt it inappropriate that Gale should receive the County Championship trophy when serving an ECB ban, with further charges pending, much to Yorkshire’s upset. Graves has the backing of many counties, making it a strong possibility he will lead domestic cricket while Clarke concentrates on the international game. Yorkshire have backed their captain Andrew Gale after he abused Lancashire's Ashwell Prince . The FA look likely to be dragged into a messy legal fight following Edward Lord’s removal from their Inclusion Advisory Board for speaking out over the governing body’s lack of action on discrimination. Lord regards the FA statement about his sacking as defamatory and the eyebrows raised among the swimming fraternity over the chairman of the Amateur Swimming Association being dismissed by the FA in such a fashion makes it necessary for Lord to take measures to defend his reputation. With discrimination issues now so prevalent across football, the picture gallery in UEFA headquarters in Nyon of the 17 white faces that comprise the executive committee of European football’s ruling body sends out all the wrong messages. Sign of the times for Dyke . After the Watchgate hoo-ha of FA chairman Greg Dyke having to return his £16,400 Parmigiani watch given to him by the Brazilian federation, it wasn’t lost on the FA party arriving in Geneva for the Euro 2020 venue verdict that the one brand of Swiss watch being heavily advertised was… Parmigiani. Dyke, who had intended to donate the gift to charity, was wearing a £70 Sekonda. But two other members of the FA group love expensive watches. General secretary Alex Horne had a Frank Muller on his wrist while England manager Roy Hodgson is an ambassador for Hublot, who brought out a special World Cup edition watch for him. FIFA Congress delegates have been given £200 Longines watches, which also seem to fall outside items of ‘trivial or symbolic value’ allowed by FIFA’s ethics committee. UEFA chief Michel Platini says he doesn’t return gifts but will donate the value of his Parmigiani to charity. Greg Dyke had to return his £16,400 Parmigiani watch given to him by the Brazilian federation . There is understandable concern at BT Sport that their company logo remains prominent on convicted killer Oscar Pistorius’s profile picture on Twitter. BT are expected to approach the South African athlete’s representatives to have it changed before his sentencing next month. BT said: ‘Pistorius’s contract as a BT ambassador ended last year.’ The Footballer of the Year awards night in May is being moved from the London Lancaster hotel to The Landmark. This follows last year’s rumpus when organisers the Football Writers’ Association were moved from their traditional banqueting hall, where pictures of all previous winners adorned the walls, to a cramped suite below stairs because of a double booking with the British Sandwich Association.","Manchester United won three Premier League titles with Cristiano Ronaldo .

"A primetime show on Britain's BBC Channel 4 in which drunken comedians made obscene jokes about the Queen has drawn ire from viewers across the pond. The Big Fat Quiz Of 2012, which is modeled after bar trivia, featured countless vile sexual jokes, was broadcast on Sunday. The pre-recorded show, presented by controversial comedian Jimmy Carr, also featured puerile remarks about sprinter Usain Bolt, President Barack Obama, and singer Susan Boyle. Scroll down for video . No comment: Channel 4 bosses refused to break their silence over the furore surrounding Big Fat Quiz Of The Year 2012. Featured guests included  Richard Ayoade, Russell Howard, Jonathan Ross, Jimmy Carr, Jack Whitehall,  James Cordon and Gabby Logan . Most of the crass humour came from Gavin And Stacey star James Corden, 34, and comedian Jack Whitehall, 24, who were seen to drink a bottle of wine each on screen. They were egged on by Jonathan Ross – who lost his job with the BBC after making an abusive phone call to the veteran actor Andrew Sachs during a radio show. Within minutes of the annual quiz show starting guests began to make infantile jokes about the Queen and the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Marlborough-educated Whitehall said he ‘had a theory’ about why the Queen had stood up throughout the jubilee pageant on the Thames. He then made a crude joke linking it to the fact that Prince Philip was taken ill with a bladder infection soon afterwards. Not spared: The British comedians railed into President Obama, saying crass things about what he did in the Oval Office . Inappropriate: Clouds roil over the White House in Washington on Sunday morning; the White House has not responded to the comedians' jabs . He justified his offensive remarks by saying: ‘I’m just saying what everyone’s thinking.’ Soon afterwards he said Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt could ‘rake it in’ by going to stud like the retired racehorse Frankel. His vulgar language appeared to draw gasps from the audience, but the remarks were eagerly followed up with a disgusting comment by 52-year-old Ross. Halfway through the two-hour show Corden took a bottle of red wine and two glasses from beneath his desk and poured himself and Whitehall a drink, then started eating pizza. The pair were soon visibly drunk and Corden was slurring his words. He then started to make crude comments about Britain’s Got Talent star Susan Boyle after he was asked what slogan was used to promote her album on Twitter. His answer was: ‘Subo loves it in the a***.’ He then laughed as he said: ‘This is where I do myself in and I forget we are recording this and this is going to be on TV’, before repeating: ‘She clearly loves it in the a***.’ Corden and Whitehall continued to get more drunk and host Carr later pointed out that the pair had drunk a bottle of wine each. Afterwards Whitehall told his Twitter followers: ‘We got so drunk.’ Viewers took to Twitter and television forums to vent their dismay even as the programme was being broadcast. Targets: The comics made crude jokes about gold medal sprinter Usain Bolt, left, and singer Susan Boyle, right . Bad taste: Comedian Jack Whitehall made rude comments about the Queen, left, and the recent illness of her husband Prince Philip, right . One wrote on the Digital Spy entertainment website: ‘Forgive me for not laughing at people being immature idiots. But how is that comedy? It’s just inane, immature stupidity. I haven’t laughed once.’ Another added: ‘Glad Jimmy is seeing the funny side of things – as I ain’t.’ A third wrote: ‘A lot of canned laughter overlaid over the (probably) barely laughing audience. It’s a chore watching this.’ As the programme approached its conclusion Corden and Whitehall made crass jokes about Mr Obama. Asked what the President did in the Oval Office when he was pretending to work, they responded by writing down: ‘Put a condom on and had a posh w***.’ Fellow guests sports presenter Gabby Logan, 39, and actor Richard Ayoade, 35, looked increasingly awkward as the jokes continued. On Twitter, viewers were commenting on how drunk Whitehall and Corden were. And on the Mumsnet website one user wrote: ‘Jack and James were really annoying me with their drunken childishness. When Jonathan Ross seems like the most grown-up person there you know it’s time to edit them out.’ Ofcom, an independent communications regulator in the U.K., had received five complaints by last night, but that number could quickly grow – in Sachsgate, an initial two complaints rose to nearly 45,000. Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe said: ‘Nothing Jimmy Carr does surprises me. This programme is in extremely poor taste and I’m amazed it was ever broadcast. ‘Most people would consider it to be in very bad taste to poke fun at someone in their eighties who’s served the country devotedly for  60 years.’ A spokesman for Susan Boyle would not comment, but a source close to the singer said: ‘Their comments were inappropriate.’ A spokesman for Corden said: ‘James would never want to offend anyone and is sorry if his comments have been taken out of the context they were made in.’ A Channel 4 spokesman told the Mail: ‘Big Fat Quiz Of The Year is a well-established comedic and satirical review of the year’s events with well-known guests and is broadcast after the watershed with appropriate warnings.’ Channel 4 has often been at the centre of controversy. In 2007 tens of thousands complained that Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty was the victim of racist bullying on Celebrity Big brother. Viewers also protested about a ‘dramatized documentary’ about Prince Harry in 2010 in which an actor playing the prince was shown being subjected to a mock execution in Afghanistan. Also in 2010 the broadcaster showed comedian Frankie Boyle making ‘highly offensive’ jokes about the disabled son of model Katie Price.","Big Fat Quiz of 2012 featured countless vile sexual jokes just after 9pm .

"When it comes to their loved ones, most people are content to wear their hearts on their sleeves. But one Spanish artist has taken the expression a step further by stitching portraits of his family, friends and girlfriend into the palms of his hands. Artist David Cata, 21, uses his body as a canvas for his project Overexposed Emotions which illustrates how much the members of his family, including his girlfriend, Tamara, are woven into his life. Scroll down for videos . Spanish artist David Cata stitched portraits of his loved ones into the palms of his hands for an art project . The designs are supposed to show how each person we meet is woven into our lives, such as his Grandfather . Each picture, like this one of David's aunt, takes up to four hours to produce using a needle and thread . David takes care to ensure that only the top layer of skin is pierced. This picture shows his brother . Each eye-watering artwork takes about four hours to complete, after which David, a music student and artist, films himself picking the stitches out of his hands. Using a needle he very carefully pierces the top layer of his skin before drawing the thread through to create a stitch. He then repeats the process with different coloured thread for up to four hours to create surprisingly detailed pictures of people who have influenced him. Scarred: The palms of David's hands are now permanently scarred with partial outlines of the portraits . David has so far created around 20 of the artworks featuring family members including his brother Javier (pictured) After completing each picture David picks the needlework out of his hand before starting on the next one .

"A 52-year-old man with a history of domestic violence charges has killed his wife and himself in front of their teenage daughter. Police said Robert Seeber shot dead 45-year-old Lisa Seeber, his wife of 20 years, with a 12-gauge shotgun in their Ohio home on Saturday afternoon, before turning the gun on himself. Their terrified daughter, 18-year-old Martina Seeber, said she tried to stop the couple from fighting before her father pulled the trigger. 'My dad and mom were getting in a fight ... I tried . to stop them,' she told the 911 dispatcher. 'I tried ... he came out and shot her.' She said her 16-year-old brother was also home. Both children were physically unharmed. Tragic: Robert Seeber (pictured) shot dead his wife of 20 years in their Ohio home on Saturday afternoon, before turning the gun on himself . Tragic loss: Lisa Seeber, 45 (pictured left and right), was described by friends as a talented artist and loving mother-of-three .

Horrific: Martina Seeber, 18 (pictured left and right) watched her father kill her mother, then himself . About three weeks before the tragic murder-suicide, Robert Seeber had reportedly completed a court-ordered anger management class from his most recent of three domestic violence charges. The Seebers stopped divorce proceedings and he moved back into their Long St, Murray City home. David Valkinburg, chief deputy of the Hocking County sheriff’s office, said Robert Seeber snapped on Saturday after a long period of abusing his wife and Martina Seeber, one of the couple's three teenage children. 'It was a tragic pattern,' Valkinburg said. History of domestic violence charges: Robert Seeber, 52 (pictured left and right) shot dead his wife of 20 years before turning the gun on himself on Saturday . Guns: Robert Seeber posted a picture of this gun to his Facebook page, but it is not clear if it belonged to him . Police are investigating what led to the shooting which left the couple, who married in 1994, dead on the living-room couch. Neighbor Shirley Cook, who had known Lisa Seeber for about 40 years, said her friend was a talented artist and loving mother who gave her husband too many chances. 'She was a wonderful person. I mean, she would give you the shirt off her back,' Cook told NBC4i.com. 'She always kept her heart open, hoping to make things better with him, and make her marriage work.' In the past: Relatives said Robert Seeber was a war veteran who suffered from PTSD (left), while his daughter Martina Seeber posted an old photo of her and her dad to Facebook reminiscing about 'the good times' Martina Seeber has not commented on the horrific deaths, but posted a publicly-available picture on Facebook of her, her father and two siblings in happier times. She captioned the old photo: 'I'll always remember the good times'. Relative Susann Seeber said that Robert Seeber was a war veteran who suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. 'For Rob and all the other veterans that didn't get the help promised them and lost all hope and the fight to carry on,' she wrote on Facebook. Scene: : Robert Seeber killed himself and his wife inside their home on Long Street in Murray City, Ohio (pictured) Devastated: Neighbor Shirley Cook said her good friend Lisa Seeber was a talented artist and loving mother who gave her husband too many chances . The Columbus Dispatch reported that deputies had been called to the house at least . three times last year over complaints of violence. In February 2013, Robert Seeber was accused of hitting Martina after he picked her up from school. He was convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence in that case and sentenced to 30 days in jail and two years of probation. He was also ordered to stay away from his daughter and wife, and to surrender any weapons and not get any more. In August, while the couple was . separated, Lisa Seeber awoke in the middle of the night to find her . estranged husband in her bedroom. Valkinburg said Robert Seeber . threatened to burn down the house if she didn't leave within two weeks. A month later, Robert Seeber threatened his daughter Martina Seeber with a pistol. Court . records show that, on March 3, Robert Seeber pleaded guilty in Hocking . County Municipal Court to domestic violence from that last case. He was . ordered to spend two days in jail, attend anger-management counseling . and stay away from Martina Seeber. NBC4i reported the Hocking County prosecutor said Lisa Seeber had a temporary protection order against her husband, but it was lifted after the last case was resolved and he moved back into the house.","Robert Seeber, 52, killed his wife of 20 years Lisa Seeber, 45, and himself in their Murray City, Ohio home on Saturday .

"Hate preacher Abu Qatada has lodged an appeal against his deportation to Jordan in Europe's highest appeal court - in a move which could keep him in Britain for months. Home Secretary Theresa May ordered his . arrest yesterday after she secured a landmark deal which she hopes will see him . sent to Jordan to face terror charges. But his lawyers lodged a last ditch appeal in the European Court of Human Rights last night in an attempt to halt his deportation. Scroll down to watch video . Abu Qatada is driven from a Special Immigration Appeals Commission hearing in central London yesterday . Border Agency staff arrive to collect Abu Qatada - one of whom appears to have his possessions in a black bin liner - before he is escorted out of the house in north west London and taken away in a car . A spokeswoman for the court said the . deadline for the appeal was midnight - and it was made after 11pm last . night. She said: 'It was literally last minute.' As the situation descended into deeper farce, it emerged that the Home Secretary spent last night as a guest of celebrity agent Jonathan Shalit was was celebrating his 50th birthday. Qatada's legal team claims that . judges at the European Court of Human Rights were wrong three months ago . when they ruled that he would not be at risk of torture if returned to . Jordan, a court spokeswoman said. The court's Grand Chamber will decide . whether to hear his appeal, but the radical cleric, once described by a . judge as Osama bin Laden's right hand man in Europe, cannot be deported . until the court has reached a decision. A panel of five will now meet to decide if the case can go before a Grand Chamber of 17 judges. The spokeswoman could not give any indication the whole process would take. The move comes as the 47 member nations of the Council of Europe prepare to meet in Brighton tomorrow for talks aimed at reforming the court and the types of cases it hears. Home Secretary: Theresa May spebnt yesterday evening at celebrity agent Jonathan Shalit's 50th birthday . Mrs May admitted yesterday it could be ‘many months’ before the fanatic is put on a plane to his home country. Abu . Qatada was given three months to appeal the European Court of Human . Rights' decision when they handed down their judgment on January 17. His . appeal was received just after 11pm last night - April 17. However, the . Home Office claim that the deadline expired at midnight on April 16. A . Home Office spokesman said: 'Qatada has no right to refer the case to . the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights, since the . three-month deadline to do so lapsed at midnight on Monday night. 'His case should be heard in British . courts, as the Home Secretary outlined to Parliament yesterday. In the . meantime, he remains in custody.' Yesterday within hours of his detention, . Qatada’s lawyers were demanding he be let out again on bail and making . it clear that they would do everything possible to thwart deportation. That could mean a string of further . appeal hearings, adding to the £1.5million bill in legal costs and . benefits already run up by Qatada, who has links to convicted Al Qaeda . terrorists. Mrs May was forced to seek the deal . with Jordan following January’s ruling by the European Court of Human . Rights that he would not face a fair trial if sent home. The ruling also . led to Qatada’s release on bail in February. Since then he has been at his family . home in Wembley, north-west London, under strict bail conditions. The . £1,900-a-month rent on the house is paid through benefits, and a . surveillance operation to monitor his every move cost British taxpayers . £100,000 a week. Just after midday yesterday, smirking Qatada was led . from his home by immigration officers and taken to a hearing of the . Special Immigration Appeals Commission, in Central London, which rules . on terror immigration cases. The hearing was delayed when Qatada demanded a translator, although he has lived here since 1993. The judge, Mr Justice Mitting, said he . still posed a risk of absconding and denied bail. He indicated a full . hearing could be delayed until October. It is likely a further . application for bail will take place within days, but last night Qatada, . whose real name is Omar Othman, was in Belmarsh high security prison. Next year will mark two decades since . he first cheated his way into Britain on a fake passport, and nearly a . decade since efforts began to remove him. Yesterday’s hearing was told that the . Jordanian government had agreed to ‘bend over backwards’ to ensure . Qatada received a fair trial. Five smartly dressed officers were in the house for around 15 minutes before emerging with Qatada, who left the house and was not handcuffed . The European Court of Human Rights found that sending Qatada, 51, back without assurances that torture evidence won't be used would be a 'flagrant denial of justice' Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called for Mrs May to explain the steps she was taking to deport the cleric . The deal means that if returned . Qatada’s earlier conviction in Jordan, handed down in his absence, will . be quashed. His new trial on terror charges will be heard in public with . civilian judges, he will have full access to lawyers and will be able . to summon defence witnesses. Following the Strasbourg ruling, which . said torture evidence might be used against Qatada at trial, Mrs May . and other ministers embarked on a frenetic diplomatic effort to secure . the deal that would make deportation possible. Mrs May insisted it would be . impossible simply to put Qatada on a plane at once as his lawyers would . obtain a court order preventing deportation. Robin Simcox, counter-terrorism expert . from the Henry Jackson Society, said: ‘Theresa May deserves praise for . her persistence and determination to expel Abu Qatada from the UK. He is . a senior jihadist ideologue and his presence is clearly not welcome in . this country. Furthermore, the UK Government must, as a basic principle, . be allowed the legal freedom to deport national security threats.’ Ministers insisted last night that Britain is on track to get a deal this week to curb Strasbourg’s human rights judges. Despite suggestions that key proposals . had been watered down or ditched, sources said Justice Secretary . Kenneth Clarke expected to secure wins on measures to protect the . importance of decisions made by national courts, to make the court more . efficient and consider fewer cases, and on the nomination process for . judges.

"As an international striker who starred for both Manchester teams, won the Treble with United ... and whose son, Devante, has been on City’s books since he was seven, Andy Cole is uniquely qualified to talk about the different philosophies at the two clubs. Yet Cole feels strongly that it is ‘a nonsense’ to compare City’s policy of buying the best players aged between 16 and 18 from around the world to United’s long tradition of developing local youngsters, from the celebrated Class of 92 all the way through to today’s first-teamer Tyler Blackett. But Cole is no City-basher. He scored 10 goals in 23 games for the club in 2005-06 having enjoyed spectacular success at United. He entrusted City with 19-year-old Devante’s footballing education because he felt ‘comfortable’ there. Manchester United youth team coach Eric Harrison and the Class of '92 . But while Cole Snr learned about the United way from the likes of Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Wes Brown and the Neville brothers — all born and raised in Greater Manchester and brought through the ranks at Old Trafford — he cannot see how City’s £100million investment in the Etihad Academy can produce the same impact without enough young players from the local area who really know and care about the club. Premier League rules state that a ‘homegrown’ player is someone who has spent three years at the club up to age 21. It means you can be signed by a club at 18 and still then be classified as ‘homegrown’. Laughably, Wayne Rooney is categorised as a United homegrown player even though his formative years were spent at Everton and he was already an England player when Sir Alex Ferguson signed him for £27million in 2004. Andy Cole's son Devante is currently on loan at League One Barnsley after 12 years at Manchester City . City have stockpiled the best young talent from Austria, Spain, Portugal, France and Holland from their mid-teens. Players like Marcos Lopes and Karim Rekik were signed at 17 and both are tipped for the top. They are currently on loan to top European clubs while Cole, who has been at the club for 12 years, is on loan at League One Barnsley having failed to make a first-team appearance for City. Unsurprisingly, Cole Snr feels that despite the public emphasis from City on the importance of developing players, there is a marked difference between them and United. ‘Are you talking about real homegrown players, or players bought and called homegrown? It is a totally different entity,’ he says. ‘What I would call homegrown are kids who are born in Manchester or the UK, have gone to United or City as young kids and come through the system. ‘The rules say a homegrown player can be when you buy someone in and he’s there for three years. That means homegrown? It is a nonsense.’ Striker Cole enjoyed spectacular success during six seasons at Manchester United . Cole scored 121 goals in six seasons at United from 1995 to 2001 during Ferguson’s heyday. He is now a club ambassador and puts a lot of what he has achieved down to being helped by the group who had come through the youth ranks. ‘Signing players from abroad at 16 or 17 is not the same as the Class of 92 that United had,’ he says fervently. ‘I played with those guys, they knew what it was to grow with United, they wanted to play for them and appreciated everything about the club. That’s homegrown — you don’t buy in homegrown talent.’ There have been fears United might reduce their priority on local players after a £158m spending spree on world stars like Angel Di Maria, which looked like an attempt to copy City rather than re-establish their own identity. Cole hopes that won’t be the case. ‘They should care about it (homegrown players) at United. If you look at the history, look at the number of local boys who have come through — that is the ethos of Manchester United,’ he argues. Cole spent a season at Manchester City and his son joined the club's youth academy aged seven . ‘If you look at the Treble winners or legends, look at the number of homegrown players they’ve had. Without people like Giggs, Butt, Scholes and Gary Neville, I wouldn’t be sitting here talking to you. It has to be possible to carry on. ‘Manchester is one of the biggest cities in England, if you can’t get talent from here, where can you get it from? Maybe I’m old-fashioned but that’s the way I look at it.’ Cole had no qualms, however, about letting Devante choose City. ‘He is a young boy who wants to make his way in football. He has been at City since he was a kid and if he makes it there, as a father I’m going to be happy,’ he says. ‘That is what he wants to do. He knows how tough it is to become a professional and if he makes a career at City, I’ll support him. But if he plays for Hotshot Hamish XI, I’m still going to support him, he’s my son. ‘The most important thing for a father is that your son is comfortable. He has been at City since he was seven and it wasn’t for me to take him out of that system when he was comfortable.’ Tyler Blackett is latest local boy to graduate from the academy to first team at Manchester United . The bond that exists between a group of players that grow up together carries on long after retirement, according to Cole. It’s why he thinks Roy Keane’s recent barbs in his autobiography were aimed at Ferguson and his cronies, rather than his team-mates, who welcome Keane back to play in United old boys games. ‘I know Roy well, I have never had a problem with him and I could never see myself ever having a problem,’ said Cole. ‘We got on very well when we were playing and he took me to Sunderland when he was a manager. We all have opinions but I think if you look at what he said or the articles, I don’t think he mentioned any of the boys he actually played with. ‘When we catch up, we all have a laugh and a joke and that is the beauty of it, whatever someone has said. ‘We played one in Munich recently, that was a good one. I don’t think Roy has got an axe to grind.’ Andy Cole was speaking at the unveiling of the ‘Treble Collection’ and customised First Team squad watches by Bulova, Manchester United’s Official Timekeeping partner.","Andy Cole hails United's long tradition of developing local youngsters .

"A Sudanese woman who was recently spared the death penalty for converting to Christianity said she fears the baby she gave birth to while in chains may not be able to walk properly. Mariam Yahya Ibrahim, 27, gave birth to daughter Maya with her legs shackled and now doctors say she may need support to walk when she’s older. Ibrahim, who was freed after an international outcry, said that ‘something has happened to the baby’. Fears: Mariam Yahya Ibrahim says the baby she gave birth to in prison in Sudan may never walk properly. Pictured on the left is her 18-month-old boy Martin . She told CNN: ‘I was really scared of giving birth in prison. I gave birth chained. Not cuffs but chains on my legs. I couldn’t open my legs so the women had to lift me off the table. I wasn’t lying on the table. ‘Something has happened to the baby. I don’t know in the future whether she’ll need support to walk or not.’ Sudanese authorities and U.S. officials in Khartoum are currently negotiating to allow Ibrahim to leave Sudan. She was detained at Khartoum airport last week, one day after an appeals court overturned a death sentence imposed on her for having converted from Islam to Christianity in order to marry her Christian American husband, Daniel Wani. Her lawyer Mohaned Mostafa said Ibrahim, her husband and two children had all been staying at the U.S. embassy in Khartoum since her release, which was granted on the condition that Ibrahim remains in Sudan. Severe treatment: Ibrahim was on death row for marrying a Christian and refusing to convert back to Islam . 'There are talks going on currently between Sudanese and American officials to try to find a way for Mariam and her family to leave the country,' a source close to the case said, asking not to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media. Ibrahim was detained on last Tuesday for trying to use documents issued by the embassy of South Sudan to fly out of Khartoum with her American-South Sudanese husband and their two children. Despite lifting her death sentence after huge international pressure, Sudan still does not acknowledge Ibrahim's new identity as a Christian South Sudanese because it does not recognise her marriage. Muslim women are not permitted to marry Christian men under the Islamic laws that Sudan applies. 'The talks now are aiming to get her out of Sudan on a Sudanese passport,' the source said. Ibrahim's husband Daniel Wani told Reuters that it was a 'misunderstanding' and error when Sudanese authorities said her travel documents were invalid, adding that his wife should have the right to adopt his South Sudanese nationality. 'There is diplomatic work going on and the Sudanese government offers help and cooperates in this matter,' Wani said in a phone conversation with Reuters. 'We will leave this time in a smooth manner and with travel documents that the Sudanese authorities accept.' South Sudan, which has a majority Christian population, became independent from the mostly Muslim north after a referendum in 2011 that ended years of civil war. Loving couple: Ibrahim and her husband, American citizen Daniel Wani, were both detained at Khartoum airport last week, along with their children, as they tried to leave for the US . Ibrahim's case has been closely monitored by Washington and London, which last month summoned the Sudanese charge d'affaires to protest against Ibrahim's initial death sentence and urged Sudan to uphold its international obligations on freedom of religion and belief. A U.S. spokeswoman said on Thursday before Ibrahim's release that Ibrahim had all the documents she needed to travel to the United States. The United States has imposed economic sanctions on Sudan since 1997 over alleged human rights violations. It intensified sanctions in 2006 over Khartoum's actions in its conflict with rebels in the western region of Darfur. Ms Ibrahim, born in eastern Sudan's Gedaref state on November 3, 1987, is the daughter of a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian mother, according to a statement from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum obtained by AFP. Her father abandoned the family when she was five, and she was raised according to her mother's faith, it says. 'She has never been a Muslim in her life,' said the statement signed by Father Mussa Timothy Kacho, episcopal vicar for Khartoum. Miss Ibrahim joined the Catholic church shortly before she married Mr Wani in December 2011, the vicar said. Mr Wani was born in Khartoum but is now a U.S. citizen, the U.S. embassy confirmed to AFP last Tuesday. The case against Ms Ibrahim dates from 2013 when 'a group of men who claim to be Mariam's relatives' filed an initial legal action, the vicar's statement said. In fact, she had never seen those men before, the statement added, in comments confirmed by her lawyer, Mohanad Mustafa. Ms Ibrahim, who is a trained doctor, and her husband own a barber shop, a mini-mart and an agricultural project in Gedaref, the vicar said. Mr Mustafa did not know if there is a link between the businesses and the case against Ms Ibrahim, but he told AFP: 'Surely there is something behind this'. Sudan introduced Islamic Shariah law in the early 1980s under the rule of autocrat Jaafar Nimeiri, contributing to the resumption of an insurgency in the mostly animist and Christian south of Sudan. The south seceded in 2011 to become the world's newest nation, South Sudan. Sudanese President Omar Bashir, an Islamist who seized power in a 1989 military coup, has said his country will implement Islam more strictly now that the non-Muslim south is gone. A number of Sudanese have been convicted of apostasy in recent years, but they all escaped execution by recanting their new faith.","Sudanese mum Mariam Ibrahim was sentenced to death for being Christian .

"A Ukrainian man made bomb threats before trying to hijack a plane and divert it to Sochi, where the 2014 Winter Olympics are opening. The man claimed there was an explosive aboard the Pegasus Airlines aircraft, a Boeing 737 which was travelling from Ukraine to Turkey. He tried to force his way into the cockpit while armed with a device described as a detonator - but the pilot sounded the alarm and a military jet escorted the aircraft to an airport in Turkey. The man, whom some reports say was extremely drunk at the time, was assured the plane was headed to Sochi, while in fact the aircraft, accompanied by a Turkish F-16 fighter jet, landed in Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen airport. Scroll down for video . Hijack attempt: The man attempted to divert the plane, pictured in Turkey tonight, to Sochi . Inside: This scene, broadcast by CNN, shows the inside of the plane . Security forces: Police officers can be seen gathering outside the airport . State television reported that the man has now been captured and taken away for questioning. Unconfirmed reports have said that the man was drunk while making the threats. The Interfax news agency said sources in the Ukrainian Special Services described him as being severely drunk. Earlier an official at the Sabiha Gokcen airport described how a translator was recruited to 'calm down' the suspect. The source said: 'People are still inside but the pilot called security and gave them a signal that they can enter the plane. There is a translator - a Turkish man near the Ukrainian to calm him down'. An official from the Turkish government confirmed that the plane from Kharkov, Ukraine, landed safely at Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen airport. Habib Soluk, the country's Transport Ministry undersecretary, had earlier given a television interview confirming the facts of the incident, and that officials were trying to convince the hijacker to turn himself in. Watchful: A guard stands outside the runway at Sabiha Gokcen airport . Response: The Turkish military scrambled an F-16 fighter jet to escort the plane to Istanbul . Rerouted: The plane was escorted to Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul by an F-16 fighter jet . Detained: Turkish state television reported that the suspect had been detained (file photo) Mr Soluk said the man rose from his seat, shouted that there was bomb on board and tried to enter the locked cockpit. The pilot signaled that there was a hijack attempt and the airport was placed on high alert. He said that the suspect was tricked into thinking the plane was headed to Sochi as it was taken to Turkey. Mr Soluk said: 'The man was made to believe the plane was heading to Sochi. We are hoping that the passengers are evacuated without even a nose-bleed.' Pegasus Airlines confirmed in a brief statement that there was a 'bomb threat' aboard their flight from Kharkov. Russia had pledged that the Sochi games will be 'the safest Olympics in history' and has deployed around 100,000 police, security agents and soldiers in a massive security operation. Host city: There have been several attacks in Russia ahead of the Winter Olympics, which open today . 'Target': The man reportedly tried to divert the plane towards Sochi, host city of the 2014 Winter Olympics . But fears of a terror attack, fuelled by recent suicide bombings in Russia, have left guests at Sochi concerned about potential threats. Security experts have warned that Islamic militants in the Caucasus, who have threatened to derail the games, which run from today until February 23, could achieve their goal by choosing soft targets away from the Olympic sites. The back-to-back December suicide bombings of a railway station and a bus in Volgograd, 400 miles east of Sochi, killed 34 people. A jihadist group in Dagestan, part of the Russian Federation, claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings and has threatened to strike Sochi.","Man claimed there was a bomb aboard Pegasus Airlines plane carrying 110 .

"Vajazzles are behind a huge rise in hospital admissions for embarrassing injuries to private parts. Admissions of A&E patients with cuts and infections to their genitals jumped 50 per cent over the past five years. Many of the women seeking medical help did so after a botched DIY vajazzle - body art popularised by The Only Way Is Essex beautican Amy Childs. The Only Way Is A&E: Vajazzles are behind a rise in hospital admissions . Other grooming procedures such as Brazilians are also behind the rise, with women needing treatment for misplaced sequins and cuts from razors, among other injuries. Women in their late 30s are most likely to end up in casualty, but there have also been increases for females in their early 20s and late 40s. But the Department for Health's NHS figures for genitourinary injuries - involving the genitals, urinary tract and kidneys - show men are still responsible for seven out of ten admissions. The most common injuries for men are caused by being hit by a cricket ball or falling over while getting out of the bath. Shadow public health minister, Dianne Abbott, told The Sun: 'It's up to young men playing sport and young women having grooming procedures done, like vajazzles, to make their own decisions about their health. 'It's their business. But I think it's a real shame if people's health and lives are being damaged by not taking enough care or having the right kit.' The figures follow a report by the University of California showing 16,000 people a year are admitted to hospital with genital injuries in the US - where the vajazzle craze began.

"Detectives believe they have finally unravelled the identity of 'The Man who fell to Earth' onto a suburban street near Heathrow Airport, thanks to a British woman in Switzerland. It was three months ago the man, an African in his 20s or 30s, plummeted 2,500ft to his death from the undercarriage of what is believed to have been a British Airways plane landing from Luanda, Angola. He hit the ground in Portman Avenue, East Sheen, a wealthy street beneath the flightpath, with only some rudimentary possessions, small change and, crucially, a mobile SIM card in his pockets. Stowaway from Mozambique (right) worked for Brit in South Africa (1) before heading home (2). He was found with money in pockets from Botswana (3) and also headed through Zambia (4) before catching a plane in Angola (5) and falling near East Sheen . Grim: The stowaway's body landed in a suburban street near Heathrow Airport . His identity had been a mystery but . after a pain-staking trawl for information that led them to the woman in . Switzerland, police now believe they know who he is, according to The . Independent. Key: Police made breakthrough after tracing a woman who used to employ the man as a housekeeper. She recognised this tattoo which says ZG, the initials of his nickname . They are not . yet releasing his name publicly but say the victim - referred to as The . Man who fell to Earth in a poem left at the spot where he died - was . from Mozambique. The . breakthrough came when they trailed information found on the SIM, which . opened them up to a world of information about his life. Among . the several Botswanan and Zambian numbers on his Angolan-registered . phone was that of the British-Swiss woman, who had sent him a message . saying: 'I need a favour.' After . several failed attempts at contacting her, the intrigued woman . responded to detectives' messages and told them their description . matched that of the man she had employed as a housekeeper in South . Africa in 2010. Unprompted, she then described a tattoo on his arm bearing the initials ZG, which was his nickname. After 2010 it is thought the man had . travelled across Africa, through Botswana and Zambia in search of work, . before crossing the border into Angola and making the decision that . would ultimately cause his death - to move to England. When detectives . arrived at the scene on September 9, they initially thought they were . dealing with a violent crime. But the man's injuries and a witness's report of a thump at 7.42am changed the course of the investigation. It was at precisely that time that BA flight 76 from Luanda had passed overhead. It . is thought the man managed to clamber aboard the aircraft by evading . security at Luanda Airport under the cover of darkness, and then . escaping the attention of pilots during pre-flight checks. British Airways maintain there is 'no direct evidence' he was on their flight but police are certain this was the case. It . is almost certain the man would have been dead by the time he fell to . earth - temperatures would have fallen to as low as -60C during the . 4,000-mile flight.","Detectives identify man who plunged to earth .

"Click here to see more of our brilliant Match Zone, including Mario Balotelli's heat map . Yes, it was him again. Mario Balotelli, given a shot at redemption by Brendan Rodgers after his shirt-swapping shame against Real Madrid, was booked for using an elbow and then missed an injury-time sitter as Liverpool’s post-Luis Suarez problems in front of goal continued. Both managers offered encouraging words for Balotelli afterwards, citing his willingness and work-rate, but that is surely the bare minimum for a £16million striker. He will know deep down it was another disastrous day at the office, one of a growing number since he swapped the San Siro for Anfield. Suarez also had his share of controversial moments but at least he banged in the goals, 31 in the Premier League last season. Balotelli is still looking for his first league goal and Liverpool are suffering as a result, particularly with Daniel Sturridge injured. Mario Balotelli missed a gilt-edged chance with the last kick of the game for Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday . Balotelli's afternoon for Liverpool was torrid once more, culminating in a three-yard miss with the final kick of the game . The Italian smirks as referee Neil Swarbrick brandishes him a yellow card following a foul on Hull's Alex Bruce .

Booked: Huddlestone 40, Ben Arfa 50 . Referee: Neil Swarbrick . Attendance: 44,591 . *Ratings by JOE BERNSTEIN at Anfield . You couldn’t stop them scoring last season. This time around, they have netted only five times at Anfield in five league games and they won’t be returning to the Champions League if it continues. Rodgers tried to show faith in the Italian who was fined for swapping shirts with Pepe when Liverpool were 3-0 down at half-time on Wednesday night. The 24-year-old was applauded every time he closed down a Hull defender but that’s not meant to be the sum total of a world-class striker. In the second half, he led with an elbow as he challenged Hull’s Alex Bruce, son of their manager Steve, for a header on the halfway line and caught him in the face. Naively, he then checked his own elbow for any damage. Neil Swarbrick gave Balotelli a yellow card because he didn’t think it was intentional but other referees would not have been as lenient. Manager Bruce, to his credit, didn’t want to be part of a witch-hunt afterwards. ‘From where I was looking, they were both going for the ball,’ he said. ‘I thought Balotelli was their most effective player. He is a character, a maverick. And you have to treat him as such.’ Rodgers will have been more concerned that his supposed chief goal threat, having had an early shot saved by Hull’s third-choice goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic, fluffed his lines right at the end. Substitute Philippe Coutinho found him six yards from goal but the striker, lacking confidence, allowed the ball to run past him without getting a touch. Any contact would have resulted in a goal. ‘It was a big chance,’ admitted Rodgers. ‘He had a couple of them in the game. With that one, it was a great run by Coutinho and I think he just opened up his foot to try and get it in, and it’s run across. ‘At the moment he is doing his best, unfortunately he is maybe missing that little bit of confidence. He kept getting into the areas, but goalscorers get their energy by seeing the ball hit the back of the net.’ Bruce picked a 3-5-2 formation and, although Ahmed Elmohamady headed off the line from Dejan Lovren and Jakupovic denied Balotelli from Raheem Sterling’s pass, Hull were the better team in the first half.

Liverpool                                  109.1   67.8 . Raheem Sterling           90          10.7     6.6 . Steven Gerrard             90          10.6     6.6 .

Tom Huddlestone          90          10.6      6.6 . Robbie Brady                90            9.8      6.1 . Jake Livermore had a shot saved by Simon Mignolet and then Tom Huddlestone was unlucky to see a 25-yard drive deflected wide. The energetic Mohamed Diame was their stand-out performer. Huddlestone was also booked for a late challenge on Emre Can that set the tone for a tetchy second period. Hatem Ben Arfa barged into Steven Gerrard and got booked. A frustrated Sterling caught Robbie Brady on the shin with a high foot. Then, most controversially, Balotelli left Bruce poleaxed. He was looking at the ball rather than the player but it must have been painful. The pair clashed again later, leaving Swarbrick to urge Balotelli, who had four red cards in his Manchester City career, to calm down. When the Italian fell looking for a penalty after Bruce’s challenge late on, it was a desperate attempt to claim a penalty. Rodgers sent on Rickie Lambert and Coutinho for the last half-hour and Liverpool gradually gained control and created chances. Jakupovic was kept fairly busy but as Bruce pointed out: ‘He didn’t have to make any saves I wouldn’t have expected him to.’ Jordan Henderson, another sub, incurred Diame’s wrath after going over too easily and at the death Balotelli was unable to write his own fairytale ending, appearing to lose focus as Coutinho’s cross fell to him. His only Liverpool goal remains against Bulgaria’s Ludogorets in the Champions League. Rodgers is playing a shrewd game with Balotelli. He will give him chances to turn things around but if it’s not happened for him by January, don’t be surprised to see Mario being asked to wave ‘arrivederci’. For now, he’s not going to throw Balotelli to the dogs. ‘I have only been working with him for a short period of a time. From what I can gauge on the training field, I don’t think there is any danger of him losing faith. Some players might have a day when they don’t train when things aren’t going well. But he is in every day, wanting to improve, wanting to get better. ‘It is not quite happening for him in terms of the ball hitting the back of the net but he knows he needs to run and press here. The reaction from the team after Madrid was good.’ The Liverpool manager was correct in asserting that at least his players didn’t buckle again after being taught a lesson by Real Madrid in midweek. Then again, they were up against Jake Livermore and Robbie Brady on Saturday, not Cristiano Ronaldo.

"Bob Dylan's 'secret' daughter has married her lesbian partner - but her famous father was a no show at the wedding. Desiree Dennis-Dylan married her partner Kayla Sampson in June in an 'intimate' ceremony in Long Beach, California. The wedding took place during a six-week gap in Dylan's Never Ending Tour Schedule, but sadly Dylan, a prophet of equality and social change in the 1960's, didn't make Desi's nuptials. Scroll down for video . The Bride: Desiree Dennis-Dylan, 28, is the child of folk idol Bob Dylan and his second wife. a former backup singer for Ray Charles as well as Dylan himself . ..and bride: Kayla Sampson said her I do's in an intimate ceremony in Long Beach, California . Folk icon:  If Dylan had showed up at the wedding, he would have been surrounded by fans, said one guest . Wedding belles: Bob Dylan's gay 'secret'  daughter was planning to marry in August, but pushed it up to June . However her mother Carolyn Dennis - Dylan's ex-wife and former backup singer and a professional gospel/rock vocalist- did attend and performed Amazing Grace at the ceremony. A guest told MailOnline: 'No, he was not there. I didn't see him, maybe he had a hat and glasses on but I didn't see anyone that looked like him. 'I would think that people would have surrounded him if he had.' The wedding was held in a chapel in Long Beach, California, with a reception at a local seaside restaurant on the weekend of June 6. Describing it the guest said: 'I would say there were probably 100 people, it was a pretty big wedding. It was in a chapel and then the reception was in a restaurant, in Long Beach by the water. 'The wedding was really pretty, very intimate. 'There was a lady who sang who was Desi's mom I believe. I think it was Amazing Grace. 'She sang and they had a friend of theirs sing a song. That was really nice.' Bob Dylan was not mentioned during proceedings. The guest said: 'The reception was outside and we sat around tables. Times are a'changing: Little Desiree, with her mom Carolyn was kept a secret by the singer and his wife Carolyn Dennis  to protect her, they said . Celebrate:  Desiree was surrounded by friends and loved ones for her May nuptials. Cut a rug:  Pop didn't play at Desiree's wedding, but the couple hired a great DJ. Dylan's name wasn't mentioned, said a guest . Pre-party: Kayla (in white) had a bachelorette party with her pals in Las Vegas . 'The father of the bride danced with his daughter Kayla and Desi danced with her mom. 'They did not mention him (Bob Dylan) at the wedding or the reception. It was a really really nice wedding. They had a DJ.' Desi does not discuss her famous father and the guest didn't even know until afterwards that she was Dylan's daughter. They said: 'I didn't know until later (Desi was Dylan's daughter) I was surprised. But Desi's a sweetheart. 'I've not talked to them about the wedding but it was very nice. 'I don't recall a speech, they just said thank you for coming. They had a fabulous day.' Another family friend, who didn't attend the wedding, told MailOnline: 'He was supposed to be there but I don't know if he ever did show up.' Desi was born on January 31, 1986 and is now 28. Her mother Carolyn Dennis, a gospel rock vocalist, was Dylan's second wife and once a backup singer for the star. They married in a secret ceremony five months after Desi was born but they quietly divorced six years later in 1992. The singer managed to keep both his second marriage and the existence of a daughter a closely guarded secret for 15 years, setting them up in a Los Angeles suburb and visiting discreetly. But in 2001 the secret was exposed by writer Howard Sounes in his Dylan biography: Down The Highway. Dyanamic duo: Backup singer Carolyn Dennis (left) and her daughter perform together. Carolyn married Dylan in 1986,  five months after Desiree was born. But the existence of the baby girl wouldn't be revealed until fifteen years later . Carolyn subsequently released a statement saying they both decided to keep their marriage private to give Desi a normal childhood. They agreed that their daughter could choose to take her father's last name when she became mature enough to make a decision and she did – opting for the double-barreled Dennis-Dylan. Musically talented herself, Desi sings and has traveled the globe as a 'performer, master teacher and featured musician' for the performing arts group The Young Americans, according to an online biography for Educators of America. Her bio also says: 'She has had the privilege of sharing the stage with such artists as Jessica Simpson, Kelli O'Hara. Hugh Panaro, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Michael Crawford, Chaka Khan and Dick Van Dyke to name a few'. Desi met Kayla while performing in the Young Americans. Last year Kayla's mother Jolene Sampson said the family wouldn't know if Dylan was attending until the day, she said: ''Of course he's invited but he's just not going to go. He didn't say that but that's what we are assuming.' Asked why she assumed he wouldn't attend, she said: 'He's very famous', but she quickly added that Dylan is supportive, saying: 'It would be sad but he is really supportive and happy for her.' She later added, via an email: 'Some misinformation is about Bob attending the wedding. I have never met or spoken to him and have no idea of his opinion or ideas. We will only know the day of the wedding whether he will come or not, and that is not at all our focus for this celebration. Any opinion I had about his attending was pure speculation based on my own understanding of celebrity.' MailOnline could not reach Desi or Kayla for comment. Kayla's father Bruce Sampson just said: 'No comment, take care.' A spokesman for the Young American's group at their office in Corona, California, said they had been asked not to comment.","Desiree Dennis-Dylan and her partner Kayla Sampson tied the knot in Long Beach,California in June .

Angeles Police Department . Role model: Leonardo DiCaprio, pictured here in 1997 with Adam Farrar, was inspired to go into acting after seeing his step-brother build a career in film and TV . Farrar's girlfriend Charity Moore, . 38, was also arrested nearly a week before him on a slew of charges, . including two counts of possession of a dangerous drug, theft and a . misdemeanor involving a parent contributing to the child's failure to . attend school, according to her Collin County Jail arrest record. The pair had been hiding in Texas with the little girl away from the reach of the LA County Department of Children and Family Service, who have long been involved in their case because of their criminal pasts. But today a spokesman for the department told RadarOnline: 'I am happy to confirm that this child has in fact been found. It's great news. Beyond that, I can't really say more'. In an interview with MailOnline yesterday, Rachell Costin, a younger sister of Charity, had said the family knew where the girl was, but refused to reveal her whereabouts. Asked if the Normadie was with a relative, Rachell, 28, from Garland, Texas, said: 'I can't tell anyone that information, I wish I could, but I definitely want to let you know she is safe, so that way you don't report maybe she's still missing and report wrong information. Have you seen this child? Authorities were searching for missing Normadie Farrar, pictured . Rachell, who has an eight-month-old son herself, claimed her sister was a good mom. She said: 'Charity loves her daughter so much.

I'm sure she does (know Normadie is in a safe place), I haven't talked to her though about that.' Asked about the drug allegations against her sister, Rachell said: 'I know nothing about Charity and her alleged drug use, I know nothing about that. 'I don't want to even comment on the drug use, I've just known her to be the same Charity my whole life, I don't want to say whether yes or no. She really loves, her daughter, She's a good mum to her daughter.' She added that as far as she was aware Normadie was not subject to a missing person search. Rachell said: 'As far as I know, police here are not and police in LA shouldn't be either. I guess when they first got arrested maybe they were then, but I can let you know now she's safe. It's nobody else's business about what's going on with her.' Trouble with the law: Farrar's girlfriend Charity Moore was also arrested nearly a week before him on a number of charges.

Los Angeles and was attended by wife Katie. His business partner and . close friend David Abelson spoke. An . orthodox rabbi from Columbus, Ohio, the state Stern was from, was . flown in to officiate the Jewish service held at Sinai Memorial Park, in . Simi Valley on the outskirts of Los Angeles.

The cemetery said about 50 to 60 people attended, made up of Andrew's friends and family. On Wednesday, Stern's family issued a statement remembering their beloved son. The family said: 'Andrew was an adored son, cherished . friend, successful businessman, adventurous athlete, passionate animal . rights activist & humanitarian. 'No one is without flaws, but Andrew . was a giving and generous spirit who touched so many lives in a . positive way. 'For those of us who loved him, there will never be an . answer to ""why?""

Stern was buried at Sinai Memorial Park in Simi Valley, just outside Los Angeles . Lost love: Andrew was devastated over the break up of his marriage to Katie. She attended his funeral on Tuesday . The . source thinks the balance of his medication may have been harmed when . he came off testosterone and Human Growth Hormone (HGH) a few months . ago. The . source said: 'I think he had OCD and battled with depression. He was on . medication. I think he's been on medication a long time. He started . taking testosterone and HGH. I think he was working out a lot, a lot of . guys take testosterone when they work out but it messes with the balance . of everything too. He came off it within the last few months but he was . never irritable around me, he was always cool. 'Then I think when his wife left him it fuelled gasoline to the fire.'

'I . think he really was heartbroken, I don't know why she left him but I . think he wanted to try to figure out how to make it work. He was so . upset over it, he just could not get over it, he could not mentally move . on.' Another . friend has told MailOnline that he was already on a dark descent when . he realized he couldn't hold on to his 'dream girl'. 'Andrew . changed at the beginning of the year,' the source told MailOnline. 'He . worked more and socialized less. He began investing even more money and . more time into his charity and fundraising work... He got sad. Sadder.' The . friend explained that something was 'broken' in him and no matter how . he tried to fight it - with eating well, exercise or counseling . sessions - he couldn't shake it. His . struggling marriage to Cleary was not to blame for his apparent suicide but just . added to his pain because of the fantasy he had about their life . together, the friend said. They've met before: Katie and Leo were together at the Santa Barbara Film Festival last February . Cleary's . father, Thomas, who lives just outside Chicago in Illinois, has told . MailOnline that his daughter was devastated by her husband's death. 'This . is a terrible loss for my daughter Katie and obviously she is . devastated,' he said. 'We are all grieving for her and for my . son-in-law.'

Cleary's rep has told TMZ the . couple broke up eight months ago and that the pictures of Cleary getting close to DiCaprio and Entourage star Adrian Grenier were harmless. The rep explained that Cleary and Grenier had been . friends for sometime, while Cleary and Dicaprico had only . met the night they were photographed - but the rep insisted they were innocently . discussing animal conservation and nothing else. On Tuesday it emerged that two other men had taken their lives at the same shooting range in the past five years. Katie, who . is from Glenview, Illinois, appeared on the first series of America's . Next Top Model while she was still a college student, before landing the . role of 'briefcase beauty' on popular game show Deal Or No Deal.

"Leonardo DiCaprio's niece who was 'abducted' by her criminal parents is now in the care of her grandfather, the actor's father George DiCaprio, after being found in Texas last Thursday. Six-year-old Normandie Farrar is the daughter of DiCaprio's older step-brother Adam Farrar, 43, who was arrested on January 24 in Collin County, Texas on drug charges. Farrar's girlfriend Charity Moore, 38, was arrested just a week before on similar charges. Because of their criminal histories, daughter Normandie was a dependent of the court in California and should not have been taken outside the state by her parents when they moved to Texas this summer. Following his arrest, the Los Angeles Police Department accused Farrar of 'concealing' Normandie out of state.

Despite the bolt action rifle being made safe, the photo which was shared online with the Woodbridge gun store caused a furious reaction in the community still raw from the deaths of 20 children and six teachers in December of 2012. Scroll Down for Video . Offending picture: This is the image that Christopher Duffy uploaded to Facebook of his six-month-old daughter Genevieve at Woodbridge Firearms Trading where he photographed her holding a rifle . Indeed, so great was the backlash in Connecticut that Woodbridge Firearms, which previously said it was proud to post the picture online, deleted the image from its Facebook account. 'After everything that happened in Connecticut with Sandy Hook and everything that’s going on with the gun laws, why would you have your baby holding a gun – a big gun?' said local resident Bryanna Wingate to WTNH. However, the child's unrepentant father said that he had no regrets and would do it again. 'Other people being upset about it? I don’t force their kids to do anything. I don’t force them to do anything,' said Duffy. 'My hand was on it, the bolt was open, it was safety checked. I’m not sure how wide the picture is. She’s clearly in her seat just sitting up, one hand on the scope, one hand on the barrel.' No problem: Christopher Duffy with his baby girl Genevieve told news crews in Connecticut that the gun was totally safe and his baby was in danger at all . Daddy's girl: Little Genevieve was in no danger her father Christopher Duffy said when quizzed on why he let her hold a rifle at Woodbridge Firearms Trading store in Connecticut . Duffy claimed that the picture came about by accident when he was at the store searching for a new rifle. 'The little one actually latched onto it when I first picked it up to see how heavy it was. It’s actually very light, to test the weight, so I just decided to take the picture,' said Duffy to WTNH. Some members of the public were simply baffled. 'She can’t even speak yet and she has a gun in her hand and it’s bizarre,' said Alexa Grose, Seymour. In a state which is enacting stringent controls on assault rifles in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre, some felt that the criticism went too far. 'It’s nothing, I don’t know why that would bother people to be honest with you,' said Tom Wayland, who was browsing in Woodbridge Firearms. Controversial: This is the frontage of Woodbridge Firearms in Connecticut - just 20 miles from the scene of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre which occurred in December 2012 . The store’s owner initially said he had no problem with it before he bowed to public pressure. 'If someone wants to share something with the rest of the community, I have no problem posting it on the page,' said Mike Majewski, Co-owner. Indeed, Majewski was probably mindful of the experience of Riverview Gun Sales shop in Wast Windsor, Connecticut. It was the store which sold the semi-automatic weapon that Sandy Hook shooter, Adam Lanza, used to kill 26 people at the elementary school. In April, it was announced that the store had lost its license to sell guns and now is able to only deal in survival equipment and provisions.","Shock as father pictures his 6-month-old baby girl holding a rifle in her stroller at Connecticut gun store .

"A player went down to the ice with a six-inch gash in his leg during a minor league hockey game, forcing medical staff to improvise with the materials on hand to save his life. Huntsville Havoc center Justin Cseter went down to the ice during the second period with blood spurting from a gash on his leg, causing the entire Peoria arena to fall silent. The Peoria Star Journal reports that Rivermen forward Dennis Sicard had accidentally fallen on Cseter, slicing six inches of unprotected skin with his skate and leaving a one-and-a-half inch deep wound. Stuck: Medics fashioned a tourniquet from a hockey stick to keep Huntsville Havor center Justin Cseter from bleeding out during a game in Peoria . Almost immediately, trainers from both Huntsville and Peoria were shuffling across the ice, trying to reach Cseter and keep him from losing too much blood. Rivermen goaltender Eric Levine rushed over with towels to press to the wound to staunch the bleeding as Havoc winger Corey Bellamy knelt over Cseter and talked to him to keep him alert. A doctor at Cseter's side asked a player to break a hockey stick in half before using it to wrap a tourniquet around his thigh as an EMT brought over an IV. 'Cseter was pretty calm, really,' Levine said. 'He was asking a lot of questions, wanted to know what was happening to him, he said ""Let's all be on the same page here guys.""' The skate had cut into muscle, but missed the artery. A fan collapsed during the commotion and the blood was still thick on the ice when doctors finally wheeled Cseter off a half hour later. The head coaches of both teams convened a conference call with the president of the Southern Professional Hockey League, Jim Combs, who gave the okay to suspend the game. Trouble: Cseter collapsed on the ice after struggling to skate as blood pooled next to him from the cut on his leg . Family: According to the Star Journal, Cseter's father (left) and mother (right), along with his grandparents, had to watch their son fight for his life . Alert: Cseter raised his hand to the crowd as he was being wheeled off to show them he was alright after he was treated . 'You realize what things are important when something like this happens,' Huntsville coach Glenn Detulleo said. 'We were all pretty shaken up about it. It was horrible.' 'I've seen wrists slashed. But this is only the second time I've ever seen something this bad with my own eyes,' said Peoria coach Jean-Guy Trudel. 'I don't think it would have been fair to put players in the position of having to go back out there after what happened.' The team reported that Cseter was released later from the hospital and boarded a bus for the nine-hour trip back to Huntsville.","Huntsville Havoc center Justin Cseter went down in the second period after being slashed accidentally by Peoria Rivermen forward Dennis Sicard's skate .

"The family of James DiMaggio, who kidnapped Hannah Anderson after killing her mother and brother, are asking for a DNA test because they believe he is her biological father. A spokesman for James DiMaggio's family made the request after it was revealed he left $112,000 to Hannah's grandmother, who he named as the sole beneficiary of his life insurance policy. DiMaggio, who was like an uncle to the . Anderson children and their father's best friend, died in a shootout . with FBI agents on August 10 in the Idaho wilderness six days after he set fire to his home. Hannah . was rescued and returned to Southern California. Her eight-year-old brother Ethan and mother Christina died from blunt force trauma. Father? James Lee DiMaggio, left, kidnapped 16-year-old .

Police now say that Christina (left) and Ethan (right) were . tortured and killed before the fire . Andrew Spanswick told 10News.com: 'He expected the grandmother to take care of the two children with the . money. He stated he did not want it to go to their parents because they . were having marital problems and he didn't trust them with the money on . their own . 'We are requesting DNA samples from .

We think it's strange he left them so much money with no explanation.' He also described Hannah's behavior as suspicious saying: 'Some things that Hannah is saying on her Facebook doesn't add up so far; her latest posts are disturbing.' It is unclear what these Facebook posts are. Stacy Hess, a spokesperson for Brett Anderson, said in a statement: 'Brett and Tina Anderson did not meet Mr DiMaggio until the sixth month of Tina’s pregnancy with Hannah. 'Brett Anderson’s DNA was used to identify the body of his dead son Ethan Anderson.' When four horseback riders came across the . 16-year-old in the Idaho wilderness with DiMaggio they said she did not . seem to be under duress. She later claimed it was all an act as she did not want to endanger them. They later tipped off police, leading to the rescue of the teen and the shooting death of DiMaggio. Search warrants unsealed last week said Hannah was picked up from a cheerleading practice at 4pm on August 4, but Caldwell said the practice was a day earlier. Firefighters found the body of Christina Anderson, 44, when they extinguished flames at DiMaggio's home in Boulevard, a tiny town about 65 miles east of San Diego on the U.S.-Mexico border.

The manner of death is listed as homicide. Investigators found eight-year-old Ethan Anderson's body as they sifted through rubble. Authorities identified his remains several days later by extracting DNA from his bone marrow. The medical examiner's office said on Tuesday the cause and manner of the boy's death remained under investigation. Hannah Anderson says she didn't learn her mother and brother died until after she was rescued. She said on a social media site last week that she was 'on the road to Idaho' when the fire ignited. 'He had set to wear (sic) it would catch on fire at a certain time,' she wrote.

"Three-year-old Tommy Morrissey is driving a wedge between golfers at his local club - because he can hit the ball further than half of them, despite only having one arm. The pint-sized prodigy, from Florida, has a swing so strong that he can single-handedly smash a golf ball more than 100 yards. He is so dedicated to his sport, in fact, that he even takes his clubs to bed with him at night. 'Most kids have stuffed animals in their cribs,' his mother, Marcia told Golf.com.

"Passionate: Jackie Kennedy, painted in 1960, enjoyed a number of liaisons in the years that followed Jack's death . Jackie Kennedy had secret romances with both of JFK’s married brothers after his 1963 assassination, according to an explosive new book. While it has been widely reported that Jackie had a passionate fling with Bobby Kennedy, the book alleges for the first time that she also had trysts with his younger brother Teddy. In Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: A Life Beyond Her Wildest Dreams, published to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the former first lady’s death, the authors also claim Hollywood stars Gregory Peck and Paul Newman were among her lovers. Other leading men who reportedly shared her bed include Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty, William Holden and Frank Sinatra. But it is the claim of an affair with Teddy – thought previously to be simply a trusted confidante – that will be most shocking to followers of America’s most famous political dynasty. Both brothers were married – Bobby to Ethel in 1950 and Teddy to Joan in 1958 – but were drawn closer to heartbroken Jackie in the wake of her husband’s shooting in Dallas. Then after Bobby’s assassination in Los Angeles in June 1968, Jackie’s reliance on Teddy turned to romance, authors Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince claim. ‘Teddy stood by Jackie through one crisis after another, becoming the one man in her life she could depend on,’ they write. ‘I’ve always been in love with Jackie, right from the beginning,’ Teddy was quoted as telling David Powers, special assistant to JFK. ‘When Jack died, I knew she was seeing Bobby too but that didn’t stop me. Bobby couldn’t always be with her.’ He even told Powers that he married wife Joan ‘because she had some of Jackie’s qualities’. Jackie wed John F Kennedy in 1953, with Bobby and Teddy in the front row. ‘Call it Brotherly Love. Three handsome Irish-American brothers were destined to fall in love with Jackie. In very different ways, she would love all three of them,’ Porter and Prince write. Steamy: Jackie's affair with brother-in-law Ted Kennedy began while she was still seeing Bobby, say the authors. They shared many intimate moments together in the 1960s and 1970s from Washington to New York . One night stand: Jackie asked Paul Newman to meet at the Hotel Carlyle to persuade him to support Bobby's run for the Democrat presidential nomination. He was convinced of her sexual charms but not her politics . It was reportedly well-known in society circles that the Kennedy brothers passed women on to each other. ‘Bobby had taken over the affair with Marilyn Monroe after Jack broke it off. Even their father Joseph Kennedy passed women on to his sons,’ a source added. After Bobby announced his candidacy for president in 1968, Jackie reportedly told writer Truman Capote: ‘I’m in love with two men at the same time, both Bobby and Teddy.’ Jackie and Teddy were said to have shared many intimate moments in the 1960s and 1970s. But Jackie realised that Teddy – dubbed the ‘Lion’ of the US Senate who died in 2009 aged 77 – was also a womaniser and she began dating Aristotle Onassis in secret while still seeing Teddy. She married the Greek shipping magnate in October 1968. According to the book, the Kennedy brothers were by no means Jackie’s only high-profile conquests. Jackie, who died at the age of 64 in May 1994 after battling cancer, allegedly had a one-night stand with actor Paul Newman at New York’s Carlyle Hotel. Bobby and me: After her husband Jack was assassinated in 1963, Jackie fell into Bobby's consoling arms . Quickies: Jackie confided to a friend that Jack wasn't a great lover. 'He wanted a quickie and then he was back on the phone talking with some silly politician. When we did have sex, he would turn over and go to sleep' The actor reputedly had one of the strongest marriages in Hollywood, staying with actress Joanne Woodward for 50 years. But the authors claim he was seduced . after Jackie set up a meeting in 1968 to urge him to shift his political . allegiance to Bobby in his doomed race for the White House. Newman gave Jackie a porcelain rose . and she reportedly told him that she had never been  able to satisfy her . husband sexually. The couple are said to have parted the following . morning with Newman’s allegiances unchanged. Sparks also flew with William Holden, . who was also married.  He reportedly invited Jackie to go horse riding . after they met at a dinner party, and the couple embarked on a week-long . affair. According to Jackie’s close friend, . artist Bill Walton, the fling was ‘primarily driven by Jackie’s desire . to seek revenge on Jack’ for his cheating. JFK allegedly had affairs . with actresses including Sophia Loren and Jean Simmons, as well as . Marilyn Monroe. The book also suggests that Jackie was remarkably . forward in her seductions. Strangers in the night: Frank Sinatra long had a thing for Jackie but they didn't get together until 1975 when they went to his suite at the Waldorf Asotia Hotel. 'I can't believe this thing between me and Jackie,' Frank said . ‘She kept waiting for me to try to get her into bed,’ Brando once said of their affair. ‘When I failed to make a move, she took matters into her own hands and popped the magic question, “Would you like to spend the night?” I said, “I thought you’d never ask.” ’ Earlier this year another book penned by Darwin Porter claimed Jackie Kennedy had an affair with ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev while she was still in the White House. And to add to the intrigue, it said Nureyev, who was nine years younger than the first lady, was also once spotted with Bobby ‘kissing each other passionately in a phone box’. In The Pink Triangle, Porter describes how Jackie flew Nureyev to Washington in 1963 and they ‘plunged into a secret love affair that lasted years’. He wrote: ‘Jackie first fell for Rudi the day she invited him and his legendary dance partner Margot Fonteyn to perform at the White House.’","First Lady had affairs with both of her late husband's married brothers .

"Ukraine's president has promised to introduce a bill as early as next week that would offer greater autonomy to rebellious regions in the pro-Russia east, where separatists have been battling government troops for almost five months. But president Petro Poroshenko said the regions would remain part of Ukraine and rejected the idea of federalisation, something both Russia and the Russian-backed separatists are still pushing for even after a ceasefire that began on Friday. The ceasefire agreement, reached in Belarus, 'envisages the restoration and preservation of Ukrainian sovereignty over the entire territory of Donbas, including the part that is temporarily under control of the rebels', Mr Poroshenko said during a televised cabinet meeting. 'Ukraine has made no concessions with regards to its territorial integrity.' Scroll down for video . Petro Poroshenko said the regions would remain part of Ukraine and rejected the idea of federalisation, something both Russia and the Russian-backed separatists are still pushing for . Ukraine and the West have repeatedly accused Russia of fuelling the separatists with arms, expertise and even its own troops, something Russia denies. In late August, Nato estimated that more than 1,000 Russian troops were operating on Ukrainian soil, helping to turn the tide of the war in the rebels' favour. Mr Poroshenko has struggled to paint the Minsk ceasefire agreement - reached as the rebels waged a major counter-offensive that pushed back the Ukrainian troops who had encircled them - as a victory rather than a defeat. Mr Poroshenko says since the agreement, 70 per cent of the Russian troops in Ukraine had been withdrawn. He also said 700 Ukrainian prisoners had been freed from rebel captivity and expressed hope that another 500 would be freed by the end of the week. It was unclear, however, how many of those freed were soldiers rather than civilians. Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists on Wednesday that only 20 servicemen had returned home so far. In Donetsk, a rebel spokesman said a planned exchange of 36 soldiers from each side had been put off until Thursday, blaming the government for the delay. In late August, Nato estimated that more than 1,000 Russian troops were operating on Ukrainian soil, helping to turn the tide of the war in the rebels' (pictured) favour . The president admitted that 'implementing the ceasefire is very difficult' and accused separatists of 'provoking' the Ukrainian troops. The ceasefire has been violated numerous times. Ukraine says five servicemen have been killed and 33 injured since Friday. A volley of rocket fire could be heard in Donetsk late on Tuesday, although the city council did not report any casualties overnight. Mr Poroshenko was vague on the specifics of his bill. But a previous peace plan laid out in June envisaged protection for the Russian language, joint patrols of federal and local police and letting local representatives give their approval for governors, who are appointed by the central government in Kiev. Members of the Ukrainian national guard patrol a checkpoint near the town of Slavyanoserbsk, in Lugansk . All of those concessions are minor in comparison to what the separatists want. At various times, they have demanded full independence from Kiev or union with Russia, something that Russian president Vladimir Putin has ignored. But even their concessions to having Ukraine become federalised would require local control over security forces and elections for governors. Mr Poroshenko may have difficulty crafting a bill that is palatable to both the separatists and his parliament, which is gearing up for a parliamentary election on October 26. The Ukrainian public has been largely supportive of the war in the east against the separatists.","Petro Poroshenko said the regions would remain part of Ukraine .

"British taxpayers are donating thousands of pounds to pay Kenyan graffiti artists to spray murals. Around £8,000 of public money is funding the Mtaani Initiative - part of a £6.7million aid project called Making All Voices Count. Many of the artworks criticising politicians ahead of elections in Nairobi were sprayed over by officials in a matter of hours. Spraying money away: The Government funds are supporting graffiti in Nairobi, Kenya (file photo) Organisers of the project claim the scheme aims to ‘engage with artists to spread data-based information in slums in order to empower citizens to make data-driven arguments’. Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘This is an utter waste of cash. ‘Foreign aid is supposed to help the world’s poorest - not subsidise graffiti artists. It’s unbelievalbe that the Government thinks hard pressed Brits should foot the bill for these ridiculous projects.’ A committee of MPs recently found that Britain spent £3.75billion of aid in the last two months of 2013 in a bid to meet spending targets. The government has pledged to spend 0.7 perc cent of national income on aid - and will spend £12.6billion on aid this year. 'Ethiopian Spice Girls': The Mail has previously highlighted girl band Yegna, pictured, who are ridiculed in Ethiopia . The Department for International Development defended the graffiti scheme and the project, Making All Voices Count, which covers other projects including tackling police corruption in Liberia and improving maternity care in Nigeria. It said the scheme helps ‘young people living in slums hold their government to account and have a say in the future of aid.’ The Mail has highlighted previous controversial aid projects, including the government funding a version of the Spice Girls in Ethiopia.","The Mtaani Inititative is part of a £6.7million aid project in Africa .

"Testimony: Saajid Badat, who spent six years in jail for terror offences, gave evidence via video-link . A Briton has told the trial of Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law that he wore a shoe bomb on a flight to the UK. Saajid Badat, who gave evidence in the New York trial via video link from Britain, said yesterday he wore the bomb on at least one flight between Holland and the UK in December 2001. But he said he didn’t detonate it because he was saving it for an attack over America. Badat, 34, revealed details of the plot as he testified at the trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, bin Laden’s son-in-law and Al Qaeda’s spokesman after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Badat, who was born in Malawi but grew up in Gloucester, was  convicted in the UK of plotting to bring down an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami with explosives hidden in his shoes. He was released six years into a 13-year sentence after he gave  evidence against the terror group. He agreed to give evidence via video link because he risks being charged again with the same crimes if he sets foot in the U.S. Badat said he had only one shoe bomb because he gave his other one to several Malaysian men who wanted to blow open a plane’s cockpit door and carry out a 9/11-style hijacking of their own. While wearing the shoe bomb, Badat said he flew from Pakistan to Holland and then on to the UK. Prosecutors are using Badat’s testimony to show Abu Ghaith played a pivotal role with Al Qaeda when he warned Americans ‘the storm of aircrafts will not stop’ on videotapes widely distributed after the September 11 attacks. Abu Ghaith, 48, faces life in prison if he is convicted of conspiring to kill Americans and providing material support to Al Qaeda. Bin  Laden’s son-in-law is the highest-ranking Al Qaeda figure to face trial on US soil since 9/11. Badat, who said he spent time with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, described enthusiasm among recruits to the terror group after the September 11 attacks. At one point during cross-examination, he was asked about a moment after September 11 when he and others laughed as mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed crossed the World Trade Center’s twin towers off a list of the world’s tallest buildings. 'Laughed': Badat told how he and fellow terrorists took pleasure in the destruction of the World Trade Center's twin towers (pictured) 'Three thousand-plus Americans dead was humorous to you?’ defence attorney Stanley Cohen asked. ‘Unfortunately, yes,’ Badat said with a sheepish expression. Badat said he decided not to go ahead with a suicide mission after he visited his parents in Gloucester in December 2001 and they asked what he had done in Afghanistan. Badat, wearing a grey suit with a narrow black tie, told the court he recalled being asked in late September or October 2001 whether he would be willing to carry out a  suicide attack. He said Osama bin Laden met with him soon afterwards, and told him that if he carried out an attack, he could bring down the American economy. Badat said he saw bin Laden between 30 and 50 times in Al Qaeda training camps. ‘Blowing up airplanes was part of your responsibility?’ Mr Cohen asked. 'It was gradual, but yes,’ Badat said. Mr Cohen also questioned him about experiments on rabbits and dogs involving poisons. Badat said his instructor at an Al Qaeda camp called out references to American presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and former Israel prime minister Ariel Sharon as the animals were being killed. Earlier, he had testified that faces of the presidents and Sharon were used as targets during Al Qaeda weapons training exercises. ‘This is Clinton! This is Bush! This is Sharon!’ he recalled the poison instructor shouting. Badat testified that he believed violent acts were an obligation for him, ‘just like prayer, fasting or doing charity’. He admitted that after he decided not to go through with the suicide attack that bin Laden had asked him to do, he had kept the explosives that had been hidden in his shoe, until he was arrested in 2003. Asked why, he said: ‘I hadn’t really switched my views. ‘Maybe there would be a time I would need it again.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Saajid Badat, 34, gave evidence via video link in trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith .

"Syrian forces are starving civilians to death, it was claimed yesterday, with residents forced to eat cats and dogs to survive. ‘Rampant malnutrition’ has claimed at least 128 residents of the under-siege Yarmouk district of the capital Damascus since last July a new report by Amnesty International says.  Some have been poisoned after eating cats or dogs or inedible plants. The 40-page report - Squeezing the life out of Yarmouk: War crimes against besieged civilians, published ahead of the third anniversary of the Syria uprising (15 March) - highlights the deaths of nearly 200 people in Yarmouk between last July and 22 February this year. Scale of suffering: Desperate people queue for food in the besieged Palestinian camp of Yarmouk, in Damascus, where some have resorted to eating cats and dogs . According to Amnesty’s research, 128 people of these starved to death in what has turned into a catastrophic humanitarian crisis for the estimated 17,000-20,000 people still trapped in Yarmouk. Last July, an existing government forces siege of Yarmouk was tightened still further, and access to food and medical supplies was completely cut off. The report says residents told Amnesty that they have not eaten fruit or vegetables for months, and local prices have increased enormously, with a kilo of rice costing up to £60. For months residents have been forced to forage for food in the streets or fields - risking being killed by Syrian army snipers as they scour for anything that might be edible, including cactus and dandelion leaves, Amnesty said. Despite the UN’s intermittent delivery of limited food supplies earlier this year, outside aid has been inadequate, with aid workers calling deliveries 'a drop in the ocean'. Struggle to survive: Amnesty International says that at least 128 people have died of malnutrition in Yarmouk between last July and February this year . Renewed shelling of the area in recent days has cut off deliveries once more. The report also highlights how government forces and their allies have repeatedly carried out deadly attacks - including air raids and shelling with heavy weapons - on Yarmouk’s civilian buildings, with schools, hospitals and a mosque attacked. Some of the targeted areas were sheltering people who had already been forced to flee from conflict in other parts of Syria. Meanwhile, at least 150 people have been arrested under the siege since April 2011, with more than 80 still in detention as of last week. Amnesty is calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all those detained solely for their political opinions or identity. Amnesty International Middle East and North Africa Director Philip Luther said: 'Syrian forces are committing war crimes by using starvation of civilians as a weapon of war.' The harrowing accounts of families having to resort to eating cats and dogs, and civilians attacked by snipers as they forage for food, have become all too familiar details of the horror story that has materialised in Yarmouk. Drop in the ocean: Access to food and medical supplies is also very difficult with families facing terrible living conditions .","At least 128 have died of malnutrition in Damascus district of Yarmouk .

"The Polish military dictator who led the crackdown on the Solidarity movement in the 1980s has been threatened with divorce after allegedly having sex with his nurse. General Wojciech Jaruzelski, 90, was caught by his wife Barbara, 84, in a ‘compromising position’ with his carer under his blanket. Mrs Jaruzelska claimed her husband had been seduced by the woman, named only as ‘Dorota W.’ in the Polish media for legal reasons, after she brought him delicacies and put on high heels. 'Seduced': General Wojciech Jaruzelski, pictured in 2005, was allegedly manipulated by his nurse, who bought him presents and wore high heels . ‘I prepared all the paperwork with my lawyer four months ago,’ Mrs Jaruzelska said. ‘If my husband does not get rid of that woman, I will go to court to file for divorce.’ She added: ‘He accused me of having lost my mind, which is absolutely not the case.’ In an interview with Polish newspaper Super Express, Mrs Jaruzelska said Dorota W., who is in her 50s, has been employed by the Jaruzelskis for five years at a rate of 15 zloty (£3) per hour, and visited on an almost daily basis. Mrs Jaruzelska described Dorota W. as ‘disgusting’ and a ‘schemer’ who exaggerated her poverty, leading the ‘gullible’ general to share his pension with her. On one occasion, a security guard said Dorota W. should leave because she had vomited in the house after a drinking binge, leading Mrs Jaruzelska to brand her an alcoholic. 'Compromising position': The general's wife says she caught Dorota W. (pictured) in bed with her husband . The carer allegedly manipulated the family into having rows, and burst into a fit of tears when threatened with the sack. ‘She would wait for me to leave, and then immediately run to my husband’s room and put her head under his blanket,’ Mrs Jaruzelska said. ‘I don’t know if I don’t love him, I am in grief that he allowed her to be in our house,’ she said. Jaruzelski is already viewed as a traitor by many of his compatriots, because of his role in the imposition of army rule in the 1980s that led to the bloody crackdown of the anti-communist Solidarity movement of Lech Walesa. The general has defended the decision as a way of averting an imminent Soviet invasion. Some historians say it was one of the most dangerous episodes of the Cold War, which could eventually have led to the use of nuclear weapons in Europe. In 1989, Jaruzelski finally gave in to Solidarity, which prompted democratic elections in Poland and a domino effect across Europe, as the other communist regimes fell. Jaruzelski has been receiving chemotherapy in hospital for three years after being diagnosed with cancer of the lymphatic system.

"Two Britons are among 20 journalists arrested in Egypt while working for TV news channel Al Jazeera, the authorities have claimed. Egypt’s prosecutor’s office said yesterday an Australian, a Dutch citizen and the two from the UK are accused of helping to promote false news benefiting the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood, which was in power until Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi was forced from power by the army last year, has since been declared a terrorist group. Mohammed Badr, a cameraman for Al-Jazeera, appears at a court in Cairo, Egypt, on charges of joining or assisting a terrorist group and spreading false news that endangers national security . Prosecutors also claim that 16 Egyptian Al Jazeera workers are accused of joining the group. Al Jazeera said it was only aware of five employees who have been arrested. The Foreign Office said it was aware of the reports and investigating, but was unable to confirm the arrest of Britons. Among those previously known to have been arrested is Australian Peter Greste who was detained a month ago. Demonstrators hold placards outside the Egypt embassy, London, with pictures of Al-Jazeera Arabic network journalist Abdullah Al Shami who along with cameraman Mohamed Badr remain in custody in Egypt . The parents of Australian journalist Peter Greste, Loise, left, and Juris Greste discuss their son's plight today . Others are Al Jazeera Cairo bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy, who is Egyptian-Canadian, and Egyptian producer Baher Mohamed. The Britons who are said to have been arrested have not been identified. If found guilty at a trial, those arrested could face sentences ranging from three years for spreading false news to 15 for belonging to a terrorist group. Prosecutors allege that the 20 journalists set up a media center for the Brotherhood in two suites in a luxury hotel. Analysts said the move showed the government was expanding its crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood but was also designed to send a message to countries hostile to the current regime. Al Jazeera is controlled by the Emir of Qatar’s cousin. Qatar has stated its unhappiness at the methods used by Egypt to crush dissent, having previously backed Islamist movements across the Middle East.","Foreign Office is aware of reports and has launched an investigation .

"Gunmen have murdered a man with suspected links to the secretive Camorra Mafia syndicate at the wheel of his car in broad daylight. The shocking killing comes a week after Italy's escalating gang wars claimed their most poignant victim - a three-year-old boy whose grandfather failed to repay a drug debt. Police in Naples, Italy, said the car belonging to 46-year-old victim Antonio Errichiello was flanked by another from which several shots were fired. Killed: The victim, named in Italian media as Antonio Errichiello, was gunned down in broad daylight . Murdered: The shaven-headed victim, said to have Mafia links, was seen with blood on his face and shirt . Crime-hit: The Secondigliano neighbourhood where he was shot is home to a fierce turf war over drugs . Deadly trade: Police estimate illegal drugs in just two Naples districts are worth £79 million a year . Italian media reported the victim, who was driving at the time, was already known to law enforcement officers and had been linked to the Licciardi clan, one of several in the Camorra. 'A man died in Naples in an ambush, L'Unita reported. 'The man was approached by two people in the car who fired . several shots at him.' The newspaper claimed the man, nicknamed 'O Cinese, had been released from prison in May last year and had a lengthy criminal record. The Secondigliano neighbourhood where . he was shot is home to one of Italy's fiercest turf wars over the . hotly-contested drug empire in the region. Police estimate the illegal drugs trade in the area and nearby Scampia is worth £79 million a year, with dozens of killings in the battle for domination. Onlookers can be seen gathering close to the scene as the victim, shaven-headed and wearing a black puffer jacket, lies dead in the driver's seat with blood trickling down his temples. Mafia: The man was reportedly ambushed by what could be members of a rival clan in Naples, Italy . Police later hid the scene from view with a sheet. The Camorra are engaged in fierce, bloody in-fighting . Italian media reported the victim, who was driving at the time, was already known to law enforcement officers and had been linked to the Licciardi clan, one of several in the Camorra which is at war with other families . Shock: Crowds of onlookers gathered at the scene in one of Italy's most crime-ridden city neighbourhoods . Common event: The brazen killing was a shock to those in the neighbourhood, but not much of a surprise . The Italian Mafia syndicate, which dates back hundreds of years, is said to control everything from the drug industry to waste collection in the south of the country . It is made up of family-based clans which have worked together in the past but also fight brutal wars against each other, with bloody results. Last week the body of toddler Nicola Campolongo was found in a burnt-out car in Cosenza, Calabria. Police believed both the killers and the victims, which also included the three-year-old's Salvatore Iannicelli, 52, and his girlfriend Ibtissa Touss, 27, hailed from the equally war-torn Ndrangheta Mafia syndicate. On top of the car was a single unmarked 50 cent piece, apparently a symbol that the grandfather had not paid his debt.","Italian media name victim as Antonio Errichiello, 46, with Camorra links .

"British Hollywood stars Emma Thompson and Colin Firth have called on the Prime Minister to offer a safe haven to refugees fleeing the bloodshed in Syria. Monty Python star Michael Palin and fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood have also signed a letter backing the Refugee Council’s plea for the UK to open its doors in response to an international effort to provide shelter for 30,000 of the most vulnerable Syrians fleeing the civil war. The celebrities, including Firth’s wife Livia, artist Grayson Perry and actress Juliet Stevenson, say they are 'ashamed' that the UK has not pledged any resettlement places. Actors Colin Firth and Emma Thompson are among the British stars calling on David Cameron to provide safe havens to Syrian refugees . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has urged Western countries to take in 30,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the year. As well as backing the UNHCR plan, the letter calls on David Cameron to make it possible for Syrians with a connection to the UK to be assisted to enter the country to join their families and communities. The letter says: 'International consensus is growing that we need to do more to help people fleeing the violence reach safety. 'UNHCR have called for western countries to take 30,000 of the most vulnerable and so far 18 countries have responded by pledging resettlement places for Syrian refugees. “We’re ashamed that Britain isn’t one of them, especially because the world is a long way off reaching the 30,000 minimum target set by UNHCR. Designer Vivienne Westwood and Michael Palin have also signed a letter calling on Britain to open its doors in aid of thousands of refugees . 'Now is the time to step forward and play . our part in delivering a global solution so that those who are most . vulnerable find safety outside of the region: women at risk of sexual . violence; children who have been orphaned; people who simply will not . survive in the conditions in the camps on Syria’s borders. 'We’ve done it before, offering temporary . resettlement places to Kosovan, Bosnian and Vietnamese people in their . hour of greatest need. 'As the largest refugee group in the world and . with winter approaching, this is the Syrian people’s hour of need. 'On behalf of Syrians in the UK desperately anxious about the safety of their loved ones, we are asking you to help, as a father, as a humanitarian and as a world leader. 'Money is no longer enough. We must provide a safe haven to the most vulnerable.' Refugee Council chief executive Maurice Wren said: 'The UK has a proud tradition of protecting refugees and offering safety to people in their hour of greatest need. 'For people fleeing Syria, that time is now. We simply must respond by providing safe haven to the most vulnerable people or they may not survive the bitter winter conditions. The Refugee Council has launched a campaign pleading for thousands to be allowed entry to the UK . 'Syria and its surrounding countries face a human catastrophe of colossal proportions. If Syria’s neighbours close their borders, the consequences will be disastrous. 'Western countries have a moral imperative to show solidarity with the countries bordering Syria by sharing the responsibility for protecting the most vulnerable people fleeing the violence. 'People’s lives and the stability of the region could depend on it.' Foreign Secretary William Hague told MPs that between January and September last year the UK accepted 1,100 Syrian refugees for asylum 'treating them on their individual merits, as we do people from other nations'. He stressed that the UK was providing aid to support vulnerable refugees in Syria and its neighbours, including 250,000 medical consultations within Syria and tens of thousands outside it. Mr Hague said: 'I hope that no one will say anything other than that the United Kingdom is among the most generous and big-hearted nations on earth on this. 'We are by some distance the second largest donor country in the world, helping hundreds of thousands of people with medical consultations in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.' Mr Palin said Britain had taken sides in the conflict and must 'be open to as many as possible' refugees entering the country. He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme: 'We have become involved in the conflict in Syria, we backed one of the sides, we are not separate from what’s going on there and therefore I think with that comes responsibility. 'I think if you have a tradition of at least understanding the importance of sheltering refugees in time of conflict we can’t limit that. That’s not just something we can just say ‘well we’ll take a few from some areas and not others. 'We have to, in principle, be open to as many as possible. We can negotiate numbers and all that sort of thing but we are talking about people who are victims of a conflict, as I say, in which we have some part.'","Stars have signed Refugee Council letter pleading for refugees' entry .

"Nearly a quarter of those killed by US drone strikes in Pakistan could have been civilians, a report claims. With Washington and London facing growing pressure to cut drone programmes, the figures are certain to inflame relationships with Pakistan. The study released yesterday by the Council on Foreign Relations concludes, after scrutinising estimates from three monitoring groups, that of the 3,520 killed by US drones in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia over the last 12 years, 457 – or 11 per cent – were civilians. (File picture) Figures showing one in four U.S. drone deaths in Pakistan are civilian are certain to inflame relationships with Pakistan . But one monitoring organisation, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, thinks the deadliest attacks were in Pakistan, and claims 3,091 were killed since 2004, with 22 per cent of deaths – just over 680 – those of civilians. America has sought to play down the ‘collateral damage' of the drone strikes in Pakistan's regions bordering Afghanistan where Al Qaeda terrorists have sought refuge. Pakistani officials say innocent civilians were killed daily. The issue has put human rights groups and pro-Taliban forces on the same page as they use the civilian deaths to denounce the drones. Pakistan has tempered its claims recently, but insists the attacks violate its sovereignty regardless of who they kill. Official casualty figures for the deaths are unavailable as they are classified. Tensions: Pakistani demonstrators shout slogans beside a burning U.S. flag during a protest in Multan . But according to details in the new report, President Obama's mid-year decision to wind down drone strikes resulted in fewer strikes last year. There were around 55 strikes in 2013, a drop from the estimated 92 the previous year. The data comes from estimates compiled by the New America Foundation, the Long War Journal and the TBIJ.","Figures are certain to inflame relationships with Pakistan .

"A man has been charged with kidnapping a 12-year-old southwest Missouri girl who remained missing more than 24 hours after she was seen getting into a vehicle. Bobby D. Bourne Jr., 34, of Lockwood, was charged with kidnapping and booked into a jail Tuesday night in Barton County on $1million bond. Bourne was taken into custody Monday evening after being found in a vehicle that witnesses said had picked up Adriaunna Horton at a Golden City park about 90 minutes earlier. Gone girl: Bobby Bourne (left) has been charged with kidnapping 12-year-old Adriaunna Horton (right), the daughter of a friend, who remains missing . Scene of the abduction: Adriaunna, her sisters and two friends were playing in Hazel's Park in Golden City after school when they were approached by Bobby Bourne . Officers from than a dozen agencies were searching for Adriaunna. The girl's father, Golden City resident James Horton, said Bourne had once worked for him and that their children played together. Adriaunna's mother, Wendi Jackson, traveled to Golden City from her home in Overland Park, Kansas, and said she feels ‘lost.’ ‘You always want your baby to be in your arms, to know she's safe and at home and not lost and cold,’ Jackson tearfully said. The station KSPR reported that Adriaunna, her 8-year-old sister, Lydia, and two friends went to Hazel’s Park next to their home Monday afternoon after the first day of school. According to the missing girl's sister, Bobby Bourne drove up to the girls three times while they were playing in the park. Wendi Jackson, Adriaunna's mother, said that the 34-year-old man asked to girls for help with finding his own daughters. Family plea: Adriaunna's father, James Horton (left), her grandmother, Velma Horton (center), and the girl's mother, Wendi Jackson (far right), have appealed for the 12-year-old's safe return . Mother's agony: Wendi Jackson said she was feeling 'lost' after receiving the tragic news of her daughter's abduction . 'Adriaunna told the other girls to stay away and she went to see what was up,' Miss Jackson told The Kansas City Star. When Adriaunna's sister, turned around, the 12-year-old was gone. At around 5pm Monday, the girls' father, James Horton, called 911 to report his daughter missing. About two hours later, at around 6.30pm, Bobby Bourne was found in his truck by police on the other side of town. The man was alone in the vehicle. Velma Horton, Adriaunna's grandmother, told the press that Bourne and her son had done home repairs together, and at one time the 34-year-old was their neighbor. The grandmother added that she did not believe her granddaughter would have willingly gotten into Bourne's car. Heartbreaking: Adriaunna's 8-year-old sister, Lydia, poses with the girl's photo as she begs for the 12-year-old's return . ‘She wouldn’t get into a car with anyone,’ Velma Horton told Joplin Globe. ‘She would say she had to go ask her father, or me or her grandfather, first.’ Records show that Bourne has been on probation after getting a suspended sentence for assault and domestic assault in 2012. On Monday night, more than a dozen law enforcing agencies and search and rescue groups sent out hundreds of people to look for the missing girl. Volunteers scoured the area surrounding Hazel’s Park on horseback, in all-terrain vehicles, and using helicopters and dogs, while officers spent Tuesday canvassing the entirety of Golden city - a town of fewer than 800 people. ‘We are going to stay at this as long as it takes,’ said Barton County Sheriff Mitchell Shaw. Massive search: Hundreds of law enforcement agents and volunteers fanned out on horseback and ATVs to look for the missing girl . Meanwhile, Adriaunna’s 8-year-old sister, Lydia Horton, has made an emotional plea for her sibling’s safe return. ‘Please help find my sister,’ Lydia said, holding a photo of the missing seventh-grader, according to OzarksFirst.com. Adriaunna, the oldest of four children, is described as 4-feet-5 and weighing 70lbs. She has short brown hair, brown eyes and a fair complexion.","Adriaunna Horton, 12, missing since Monday evening after being snatched from Hazel's Park in Golden City, Missouri .

"A Ryanair steward allegedly launched an obscene tirade at a passenger who turned down some food during a flight because it was so expensive. Nadir Morris, 45, politely returned the snack, made up of two crackers and a piece of cheese, when the flight attendant told him it would cost £4.20. In response, the steward allegedly told him: ‘**** you’, adding:  ‘This money helps pay for your cheap flights.’ A male flight attendant repeatedly screamed 'F*** you' at passenger Nadir Morris after he politely refused a 'rip off' snack. File picture . Once the flight, from Stansted to . Pisa, had touched down in Italy, Mr Morris demanded to know the . steward’s name so he could make a complaint. The steward refused and tried to push him off the plane, Mr Morris claimed. Mr . Morris, a father of two from Rome, told the attendant he was recording . the encounter on his mobile phone – allegedly prompting another . expletive-filled rant. According . to Mr Morris, he said: ‘**** you, **** you, **** you.  You happy now? Record again, **** you.’ Mr Morris said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. His . reaction was totally unacceptable.’ The steward is understood to have quit his job. It is by no means the first time Ryanair has been accused of treating customers badly. A . recent Which? survey found that the airline was distinguished by its . ‘rude and unpleasant’ staff and an ‘aggressive and hostile’ attitude . towards customers, who ranked it at the bottom of 100 brands in terms of . customer service. Ryanair scored poorly for baggage allowance, boarding . process, leg room – plus the quality as well as the price of its food. At . the firm’s annual meeting in September, shareholders were told the firm . should try to ‘eliminate things that unnecessarily p*** people off.’ A spokesman for Ryanair said the reports of the incident were 'disturbing', adding that the airline 'unreservedly' apologise to Mr Morris . Mr Morris was shocked when the air steward asked for £4.20 in payment . for a packet of two crackers and a piece of cheese on board the flight . from London Stansted to Pisa in Italy . According . to notoriously outspoken chief executive Michael O’Leary, that includes . him. Last month he announced he was trying to stay out of the public . eye, again to ‘stop unnecessarily p****** people off’, adding: ‘I’m . getting in the way.’ He has . previously caused controversy by referring to a passenger who complained . about being charged to print out a new boarding pass as ‘stupid’, and . calling overweight passengers ‘fat bastards on board’. In October he . agreed to host a question-and-answer session with customers on Twitter – . and found himself bombarded by critical comments. Many . customers told Mr O’Leary what an ‘a***hole’ they thought he was – and . he agreed, admitting: ‘I’m an a***hole. But they still love me.’ 'I'm getting in the way': Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has decided to remove himself from the public eye . The . firm has recently launched a charm offensive in an attempt to win over . its unhappy customers. It announced plans to improve its website, . revamp its customer service and introduce ‘quiet flights’, which have . minimal public announcements and dimmed lights so  passengers can sleep, . between 9pm and 8am. Speaking . about the latest incident with the steward, Ryanair spokesman Robin . Kiely told The Sun: ‘We were disturbed by this report of such totally . unacceptable behaviour.

"Hollywood royalty Michael Douglas delivered a congratulatory message to victorious Swansea City from the Oscars last night - as the secret motivation behind yesterday's stunning Wembley triumph emerged. Douglas, who is married to Swansea-born actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, was clearly enjoying himself and revelling in the Swans' famous win. He said: 'Swansea won. Very happy about that.' The City of Swansea today unveiled plans for a parade tomorrow to showcase the club's first major trophy, which was won after first-team coach Alan Curtis showed the squad an inspirational video. Scroll down for audio... Famous fans: Swansea supporters Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones arrives at the 85th Annual Academy Awards at Dolby Theatre in Hollywood cheered by the news of their team's triumph . The parade will start at 4.30pm outside . the Dragon Hotel, before weaving its way through the city to a civic . reception at the Guildhall. Defeated fourth-tier Bradford, however, have asked their city council to put their plans for a parade on hold until the end of the season. Curtis revealed how a video montage of great moments from the club's 101-year . history helped inspire the Welsh side to their 5-0 thumping of Bradford, thanks to goals from man of the match Nathan Dyer (two), Jonathan de Guzman (two) and . Michu. Curtis, 58, is better placed than most . to judge the significance of the club's first major honour, having . scored 96 goals in 364 league appearances for the Swans during three . spells at the club as a player. The former striker is now part of . Michael Laudrup's backroom staff, and helped put together a short video . of key figures from Swansea's past, which the squad watched on the . morning of the final. Curtis said: 'I felt it was important we . showed the players it was not just about the cup final, but about a club . with a century of history behind it. 'We wanted them to be aware of the great players and the great teams who have pulled on the white shirt before them. 'There was footage of players like (record scorer) Ivor Allchurch, Robbie James and James Thomas and other people like that. 'We also included footage of key moments . in our cup run this season, we just wanted to give them a feel for the . history of the club and what they could achieve.'

Getting the message: Chico Flores (left) with tributes on his vest to Spanish footballers who are no longer with us, while Alan Curtis (right) revealed details of the Swansea video montage which inspired their 5-0 victory . Curtis played for the Swans during their . previous spell in the top flight back in the early 1980s under the . guidance of John Toshack, but then had to watch the club slide . perilously close to the precipice on and off the field. But, under the guidance of chairman Huw . Jenkins, the club have been on a constant upward trajectory over the . last decade, and Curtis believes success at Wembley even tops the . achievement of becoming a Premier League club. 'This is the club's greatest achievement without a doubt,' he said. 'To get to the Premier League has given . us a platform. But when you consider we had never won a major trophy, it . is by some distance the best thing the club has done. 'It is fantastic. All credit to Bradford . for what they have done but this was vitally important for us and to do . it in the club's centenary season as well is just incredible.' Party time (from left): Roland Lamah, Ben Davies, Ki Sung-yeung, Ashley Williams and Chico Flores, with Michel Vorm and Angel Rangel (front row) pose with the cup in the Wembley dressing room . Magic moment: Swansea's players celebrate with the Capital One Cup on the pitch at Wembley after demolishing Bradford 5-0 . Announcing details of the League Cup winners' parade, Lord Mayor of Swansea, Councillor Dennis James, said: 'This is a fantastic moment for the Swans and for Swansea as a whole. 'After their promotion to the Premier . League, Sunday's events open a new chapter in a remarkable success story . for our city's football team. 'I'm sure thousands of fans will want to line the route and be part of an event that will be remembered for years to come.' The parade will start at 4.30pm outside . the Dragon Hotel, before weaving its way through the city to a civic . reception at the Guildhall. What a lift: Ashley Williams and Garry Monk hold the Capital One Cup trophy . Rolling road closures will be in place so that routes can be reopened as soon as the parade passes through. Leader of Swansea Council, Councillor . David Phillips, said: 'This is an exciting achievement and we have . pulled out all the stops to get the victory parade organised as quickly . as possible and we're sure it's going to be a tremendous success. 'We hope everyone who comes along has a . great time, but the safety of the participants and the public is . paramount. For this reason, we would ask all spectators to stay behind . the safety barriers and follow any instructions that they may get from . the safety stewards.' Bradford, meanwhile, have asked the . city council to put celebrations marking their historic Capital One Cup . run on hold until the end of the season. Back-room team: Swansea staff enjoy their moment after victory at the home of football yesterday . Bradford Lord Mayor Dale Smith said the city will expect nothing less than an open-top bus parade and civic reception. But the Bantams must now quickly focus all their attentions on Wednesday's League Two game against Dagenham at Valley Parade in a bid to keep their promotion hopes alive. 'Any celebration is on hold at the moment at the club's request until they've got the next challenge out of the way,"" Councillor Smith told Press Association Sport. 'They've got two very important league matches coming up this week and we think we're going to hold it, with the club's agreement, at the end of the season so that Phil and his side can concentrate on the league. 'There are plans afoot. The city will expect a celebration certainly. What the club have achieved throughout the season has been nothing short of sensational and the council will extend a full civic celebration. Poignant: Bradford fans remember the 56 people who died in the fire at Valley Parade in 1985 . 'They have had some amazing results in the Capital One Cup and while the fans were disappointed at the outcome, Swansea are clearly a very talented Premier League side and played better than us on the day. 'But the spirit of Bradford's fans was a real feature. The bigger the challenge became, the more they cheered and waved their flags. 'I was proud to be among them. It was wonderful. I would expect an open-top bus parade would be a fitting way to mark their incredible achievements. We're just waiting for the season to end, hopefully on a high, and for the sunshine to come and we'll start waving those flags again.'

"Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber has hit back at United States coach Jurgen Klinsmann for claiming that his star players could suffer a drop in form by playing in the North American league . While MLS has trumpeted the return of leading US players such as Clint Dempsey and Michael Bradley as a sign of the league's rise, Klinsmann said this week that players returning from Europe risked a drop in form. 'Jurgen's comments are very, very detrimental to the league, to the sport of soccer in North America ... they are wrong,' Garber said. United States coach Jurgen Klinsmann has voiced his concerns about standard of the MLS . An animated Garber said Klinsmann's words, which were made on Monday, undermined the work that MLS and the US Soccer Federation were doing to develop the game. 'I believe it sends the wrong message to other young American players that we collectively - the league and federation - want to have in Major League Soccer so that we can develop the game and the league,' he said. Garber said he sent a 'very strong letter' to US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati and that MLS club owners had done the same independently. US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati (left), Landon Donovan and MLS chief Don Garber (right) Klinsmann had expressed concerns that Bradley, who moved from Roma to Toronto, and Dempsey, who left Tottenham for Seattle Sounders, could suffer a drop in form. 'There's nothing I can do about it. I made it clear with Clint's move back and Michael's move back that it's going to be very difficult to keep the same level that they experienced at the places where they were,' said Klinsmann. 'It's just reality. It's just being honest.' Garber also criticised the coach for not taking Landon Donovan to the World Cup. Donovan, 32, the all-time top scorer for the national team and MLS, was dropped by Klinsmann in May and denied a trip to a fourth World Cup. Klinsmann expressed disappointment that Michael Bradley (left) left Roma to join MLS side Toronto . 'I believe that Landon should have been in Brazil, not because he earned it or deserved it, but because his performance dictated it,' Garber said. 'And if anybody disagrees with that, and some of you might - clearly Jurgen does - then I believe that his treatment was inexcusable.' Klinsmann, a World Cup winner with West Germany in 1990 and coach of the German team that reached the 2006 semi-finals, was hired in July 2011 to replace Bob Bradley. He guided the United States to the title at the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup and the last 16 of the World Cup in Brazil, where the US lost 2-1 to Belgium in extra time.","Jurgen Klinsmann wants his star players playing in Europe .

"Cristiano Ronaldo scored a dramatic added-time header to give Portugal a 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win over Denmark. Ronaldo rose to meet Ricardo Quaresma's cross and bury the ball past Kasper Schmeichel to claim all three points in the 95th minute. The goal lifts Portugal off the bottom of the table and into third in the five-team group on three points. Denmark remain second, level on four points with leaders Albania. Cristiano Ronaldo rises highest above Simon Kjaer and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel to seal all three points for Portugal in Denmark .

Referee: Felix Brych (Germany) Attendance: 36,562. Portugal coach Fernando Santos praised his captain after his late goal, saying: 'Cristiano is Cristiano. He is a winner, and there are no adjectives to describe him.' Ronaldo announced his presence as early as the seventh minute with a thumping shot on target before teeing up Danny six minutes later. Both efforts were saved, however, by Schmeichel in the Danish goal. Denmark lost defender Nicolai Boilesen 10 minutes into the second half when the left back was stretchered off having been knocked out cold by a thundering clearance from Daniel Agger. The Danes enjoyed plenty of possession after that, passing well on the slick, rain-soaked Parken pitch. Their best chance of the match came when Pierre Hojbjerg muscled his way through and fed Christian Eriksen, who teed up Michael Krohn-Dehli to fire in a shot that came back off the far post. Despite being roared on by a sell-out crowd of 36,562 they rarely threatened the Portuguese goal and were eventually punished. 'We knew that Denmark were very strong,' Santos told reporters. 'I think they saw the match against France and changed from their normal tactics, from a 4-3-3 to 4-4-2 trying to control the match. With time running out, Ronaldo took centre stage, first enduring the jeers of the crowd as he was yellow-carded in the final minute for a tackle on Hojbjerg, before scoring the game's decisive goal a few minutes later.

"Brazilian driver Felipe Massa says Pirelli's choice of tyres for his home Grand Prix next month is 'very dangerous'. The Italian company announced last week it would be taking its two hardest compounds to Interlagos - the hard and medium tyres - due to the high energy demands of the anti-clockwise Sao Paulo circuit. 'Dangerous, very dangerous,' Massa told reporters when asked at the Russian Grand Prix for his opinion on the choice. Felipe Massa described Pirelli's choice of tyres for his home Grand Prix as 'very dangerous' 'I have no idea why they chose medium and hard and it's completely unacceptable.' Formula One's only current Brazilian driver said the conditions at the circuit could be wet and cold and a hard tyre might not provide enough grip in circumstances where drivers needed to take a gamble on dry tyres. Massa, whose concerns about safety have been heightened by the horrific accident suffered by friend and fellow driver Jules Bianchi in Japan this month, also said the track had been resurfaced, which might cause additional problems. 'I already spoke to most of the drivers, I spoke to the FIA, I spoke to everybody, so more than what I did I think is difficult,' said the Brazilian. 'We wait and see.' The Brazilian driver said it could rain at Interlagos, meaning the lack of soft tyres could be dangerous . Pirelli's motorsport head Paul Hembery was puzzled by Massa's comments, pointing out the hard tyre had been raced previously at Interlagos, which hosts the penultimate race of the season. 'It's one of the more aggressive circuits we have on the calendar and has the risk of creating blistering problems. We know that the soft tyre under extreme loads has the potential to blister,' he said. Hembery agreed however that the new asphalt could be a factor and said the company would double check that before the next meeting of the sport's tyre working group. 'If there's unanimous agreement, we can reconsider,' he added, although any change would be based solely on the technical data. Heavy rain at the Japanese Grand Prix contributed to the catastrophic crash of Jules Bianchi .","Pirelli have chosen medium and hard tyres for the Brazilian Grand Prix .

"Paris Saint-Germain may have been unbeaten in nine games and were fully expected to advance but their Champions League clash against Barcelona on Tuesday was already billed as an early season make-or-break encounter. The French champions had been accused of lacking a cutting edge after drawing six of their first nine matches in all competitions and a Group F defeat against Barca at the Parc des Princes would have piled the pressure on coach Laurent Blanc. Although they were deprived of the talismanic Zlatan Ibrahimovic, ruled out with a heel injury, big-spending PSG were back to their exuberant best as they romped to a 3-2 win on an electric Parisian night. PSG manager Laurent Blanc celebrates at the end of his side's win against Barcelona on Tuesday . Former Chelsea defender David Luiz scored just 10 minutes into PSG's European match in the French capital . 'It's true that the Champions League gives the players extra motivation,' Blanc admitted as his side's early aggression was rewarded with David Luiz's opener in the 10th minute. Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi also found the back of the net while Barca, who had not conceded a goal all season, scored twice through Lionel Messi and Neymar. 'The difference with the other games is that we were more aggressive,' goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu said. It was about time, according to Blanc, who also had to contend with the absence of the injured Thiago Silva and Ezequiel Lavezzi. PSG managed to defeat Barcelona without key duo Zlatan Ibrahimovic (left) and Ezequiel Lavezzi (right) 'We were going through a rough patch even if we had not lost a game,' the former Barca centre back said. 'We needed a high collective performance. We needed a game like this. After such a night, either you have the solution or you find yourself at the bottom of the hole. 'We eventually discovered a nice team.' PSG lead Group F on four points from two games with Barca second on three. Ajax Amsterdam are third on two points after drawing 1-1 at APOEL, who have one point. 'It is going to give us confidence,' full back Maxwell added. 'It is true that we went through a difficult time and we needed that confidence boost,' said club president Nasser al-Khelaifi, who went as far as describing the win as his 'best victory with PSG'. 'I think it's the start of our season. I hope we are going to continue like this.' On Sunday, PSG will have an opportunity to show the victory was not just a flash in the pan when they host last year's Ligue 1 runners-up Monaco in a another high-profile game at the Parc des Princes. 'I hope we will be able to show the same intensity in other games,' Sirigu added.

'Both organisations would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the vision of one man who, in 1977, recommended to the President of the PGA of America and our President of the British PGA to consider widening the British and Ireland team to all of Europe,' O'Grady added. 'You have seen what the match has become now, with nine nationalities represented this week. To recognise this on a course designed by Jack Nicklaus couldn't be a more fitting occasion.'

"Quarterback Russell Wilson had a career high rushing night to help lead the NFL champions Seattle Seahawks to a 27-17 away win over the Washington Redskins on Monday. The Seahawks overcame three nullified touchdowns via penalties and weathered a Washington comeback to improve to 3-1 and join the Arizona Cardinals at the top of the NFC West. Wilson rushed for 122 yards, including a touchdown, and added 201 yards and two touchdowns from his arm to send the Redskins to 1-4 where they occupy last place in the NFC East. Russell Wilson rushed for 122 yards, a career high for the Seahawks quarterback, during the 27-17 win . Wilson eases in for a second quarter touchdown which put the Seahawks 17-0 ahead at FedExField . Seahawks receiver Percy Harvin, who officially only had four catches for 27 yards, had touchdowns nullified on three occasions. One was called back for a false start by Harvin himself but offensive guard James Carpenter was the man to blame on the other two occasions, getting flagged for holding and unnecessary roughness much to Harvin's disbelief. Seattle jumped to a 17-0 lead after Wilson connected with Jermaine Kearse from 15 yards in the opening quarter and then ran over himself from nine yards late in the second quarter.

Kai Forbath dug into the lead with a 27-yard field goal in the third quarter but when Marshawn Lynch took a pass from Wilson and went over from nine yards the Seahawks looked solid at 24-10. Refusing to die the home side quickly marched down the field and Cousins connected with Andre Roberts from six yards to once again pull the home side within a touchdown at 24-17 with just over three and a half minutes left.

"All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has inadvertently created a storm of debate in rugby-mad New Zealand after declaring that winger Julian Savea is 'probably better' than former great Jonah Lomu. The 24-year-old Savea has previously tried to play down such comparisons, but Hansen's comments before the Rugby Championship clash with South Africa on Saturday have reignited the debate. Lomu, who burst onto the scene at the 1995 World Cup and arguably became rugby's first globally recognised player, was considered a freak because of his size and speed that created problems for opposition wingers. Steve Hansen created a storm in New Zealand by claiming Julian Savea is better than Jonah Lomu . Savea is marginally shorter -- he stands 1.92m tall to Lomu's 1.96m -- and lighter (107kg to 119kg), but it is the way in which they challenge defences and score tries that has been seen as the biggest similarity. Savea's strike rate, 27 tries in 27 tests is among the best in the world, while Lomu scored 37 tries in 63 tests. Lomu had scored 16 tries in his first 27 tests. Neither have scored a try against South Africa. Hansen, however, felt that Savea has a wider skill set than the barnstorming Lomu, who was afflicted with a kidney disease that greatly affected his career and forced him into a premature retirement. Julian Savea, pictured in action against Argentina in La Plata, has scored 27 tries in 27 tests for New Zealand . 'I think he's probably better (than Lomu)' Hansen told reporters in South Africa ahead of the match at Johannesburg's Ellis Park. 'He can do more things than Jonah. 'Jonah was a great player, but I think Julian has got more to his game to be honest and that's saying something. I genuinely believe that. 'He's very good going back, under the high ball, with the ball on the ground, as well as being a greater carrier so I think he's right up there.' New Zealand's Herald on Sunday rugby reporter Gregor Paul agreed with Hansen's assessment on Friday, listing several reasons why Savea was a better player than Lomu, mostly relating to his workrate and defensive capabilities. Jonah Lomu in action at the 1995 Rugby World Cup against Wales in South Africa . 'Savea has more game than Lomu. As devastating as Lomu was with the ball in hand, he did carry a liability factor on defence where he wasn't the quickest on the turn,' Paul wrote. 'Savea is a brutal head-on defender, he lines men up and smacks them down. He knows when to come off his wing looking to shut down attacks and he's agile enough to ensure he doesn't get beaten on the outside. 'Savea was prone to being a little lazy earlier in his career. But not now. He's good at getting off his wing and looking for work and injecting himself into the game. 'Lomu was good at that, too, especially at blasting into the midfield. But he wasn't as good or as eager to track back on defence and help out the other wing and fullback. 'Not in the way Savea does.'","Hansen creates storm in New Zealand with comments about Savea .

"The parents of Reeva Steenkamp will not pursue a civil claim against Oscar Pistorius for killing their daughter and will pay back around £6,300 that the athlete gave them in monthly instalments to help with living expenses. Lawyer Dup de Bruyn said in a statement on Wednesday he had also advised Barry and June Steenkamp to remain 'neutral' with regard to Pistorius' sentence for negligently killing Reeva Steenkamp. Relatives of victims sometimes testify to their suffering in sentencing hearings, but de Bruyn suggested Steenkamp's parents would not. However, de Bruyn said the parents were 'quite surprised' that Pistorius' lawyers had raised the issue of payments when the athlete had asked the Steenkamps that they be kept confidential. Oscar Pistorius covers his face as he cries in the dock while a cousin of Reeva Steenkamp gives evidence . Pistorius takes notes on day three of sentencing procedures at the High Court in Pretoria . The parents of Reeva Steenkamp, June and Barry, attend the sentencing hearing on Wednesday . Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide Pistorius' punishment after finding him guilty last month of culpable homicide. She has wide latitude with the sentence and could send the double-amputee Olympic runner to prison for as many as 15 years, or order a fine and a suspended sentence. House arrest is also an option, and has been suggested by two social workers during this week's hearing. Pistorius shot Steenkamp multiple times in his home on February 14, 2013 and was convicted of acting negligently in her death   but acquitted of murder. De Bruyn released the statement on behalf of the Steenkamps ahead of the third day of the sentencing hearing on Wednesday, saying they had accepted monthly payments of £345 ($550) from Pistorius from March 2013 until last month. Pistorius claimed he thought Steenkamp was an intruder when he shot her . Law graduate-turned-model Steenkamp was 29 years old at the time of her death last year . 'After Miss Steenkamp (the deceased) was killed... the parents were in financial difficulties,' the statement said. 'We were contacted soon afterwards by Mr Pistorius' lawyers with an offer that Mr Pistorius would contribute an amount... towards the parents' rental and living expenses.' Revelations over payments to the Steenkamps by Pistorius were made in court on Tuesday, when the chief prosecutor said the Steenkamps had refused a separate offer of £21,000 from Pistorius - considering it 'blood money.' 'When the parents were made aware of this offer, they considered it carefully but decided, for various reasons, that they did not want any payment from Mr Pistorius,' the statement continued. 'This is also why we were instructed to advise that no civil claim would be instituted.' De Bruyn said he had approached Pistorius' legal team over a possible civil settlement. Pistorius apparently then made the £21,000 offer after selling what he said was his last asset, a car. The parents considered it and turned it down. The world-famous athlete has had to sell many of his assets, including the house where he killed Steenkamp, to pay his high-powered defence team during a lengthy murder trial.

VIDEO Steenkamp family to return Pistorius 'blood money' Oscar Pistorius's siblings, Carl and Aimee, . Meanwhile, Steenkamp's cousin broke down in court on Wednesday as she recalled the moment she heard the model had been shot dead by Pistorius. In heart-wrenching testimony, Kim Martin said she heard on the radio that the athlete had shot his girlfriend, but desperately hoped it wasn't her. She told the court: 'I jumped up in my seat and froze. I remember saying, ""I hope to God he's cheating"".' She said the shooting had 'ruined our whole family'. 'We were all like, ""why, why, why Reeva?"",' she told the court. 'It was the worst worst experience I have ever been through'. As she broke down in tears, prompting the judge to briefly adjourn her evidence, her husband, Dion, rushed to her side. In the dock, Pistorius buried his head in his hands and sobbed quietly. The green bucket, into which he frequently wretched during his trial, has remained at his side, but not been needed since he gave evidence in the witness box. Mr Steenkamp took deep breaths and blinked back tears as his wife June, 67, retained her composure, occasionally shaking her head and glancing at her daughter’s killer to see how he was reacting to the moving testimony. In front of the Steenkamps, Samantha Taylor, Pistorius's ex-girlfriend, cautiously wiped tears from beneath her eyes with the corner of a tissue, her mother Trish - rumoured to be one of the next witnesses to be called - had tears streaming down her face. Behind Pistorius, his sister Aimee also succumbed to tears and his uncle, Arnold, appeared visibly shaken by the dramatic testimony the court was hearing. Pistorius has competed in the both the Olympic and Paralympic Games for South Africa . Pistorius in action during the men's 4x400m relay at the London 2012 Olympics . Earlier, the prosecutor warned that Pistorius could be at risk of vigilante attacks if he is not sent to prison. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel denounced as 'shockingly inappropriate' the recommendation by two social workers that the athlete be made to carry out community service for killing his girlfriend. He told the court incredulously: 'If the court sentence is too light and society loses trust in the court, they will take the law into their own hands. That's what the court has to guard against.' He also hammered defence witness and probation officer Annette Vergeer on her apparent slap-dash report on the state of South Africa's prisons. Vergeer had warned that the 27-year-old double amputee Paralympian could be gang-raped if sent to jail over the shooting on Valentine's Day last year. But Mr Nel criticised her use of nine-year-old data and being unfamiliar with the correction services act that outlines care for disabled people. A water bottle with stickers bearing the face of Reeva Steenkamp in the courtroom on day three of sentencing . State prosecutor Gerrie Nel questions a defence witness in court on Wednesday . It came as the families of Pistorius and Steenkamp staged a dramatic reconciliation in court just as details of the secret payments by the killer athlete threatened to inject fresh bitterness between the two camps. A war of words erupted after the shock revelation that Pistorius had offered £21,000 in 'blood money' and monthly payments totalling £6,300 to the model's parents. But grieving father Mr Steenkamp was pulled into a hug by the runner's uncle, Arnold, during a private meeting in court. They were joined by the lawyer for the Steenkamps, prompting speculation that both sides were keen to draw a line under the payment controversy once and for all. Mr Steenkamp, 69, who suffered a stroke as a result of his grief at the sudden loss of his daughter, was the first to leave court, followed by Mr Pistorius, who is the head of the killer athlete's large family, when the court adjourned for a tea break. The two men first shook hands before Mr Pistorius reached out his hand to draw Mr Steenkamp into a hug, a wide smile on his face. Pistorius passes a piece of paper to his lawyers in the dock on the third day of his sentencing hearing . Miss Steenkamp's father did not resist the gesture and returned the smile, flanked by his lawyer, Dup de Bruyn. Aimee Pistorius, the sister of the double amputee, observed the meeting, but did not take part in discussions. Mr Nel continued to cross-examine the athlete's probation officer Annette Vergeer, who on Tuesay said 'nothing' could be achieved by locking him up. She said his disability would leave him vulnerable to the 'violence, sodomy, gun crime and drugs' in South African jails. As Ms Vergeer was grilled by Mr Nel about her portrayal of South Africa's overcrowded prisons, the athlete's uncle, Arnold, was seen surfing various web pages about standards in jail on his smartphone. Pistorius spent much of his probation officer's cross examination writing in a notebook. He looked up briefly as Mr Nel reminded Ms Vergeer that even though she had portrayed the athlete as posing no danger to society and claimed the fatal shooting was his first offence, Pistorius had in fact fired a gun in a crowded restaurant only a month before he killed his girlfriend. He noted that he was convicted of negligently handling a firearm as a result. Taylor has described Pistorius as a 'possessive' lover who was rarely seen without a gun. The hearing continues.

'It's kind of empowering to be able to be part of something so significant as a woman, and a Wanderers fan. 'My mum is freaking out a bit. She isn't so comfortable about travelling to a strange country but this is going to be an adventure.' The Wanderers were hoping for a contingent of about 200 of their supporters to spur them on against Al-Hilal on Sunday morning (AEDT). But a club spokesperson said a strict and complex process for obtaining Saudi Arabia visas, along with the travel cost, had reduced the touring party leaving from Sydney to 13 men and one woman. Under conservative Saudi law, single women must be in the company of their husband or a male family member to be able to obtain a visa. Ms Durnell, who will be accompanied by her dad Richard, had to receive a formal invite from Saudi Arabia, get permission from the Asian Champions League and obtain a strict visa in order to watch the match.

Tamu Massif sits 1,000 miles east of Japan, along the Shatsky Rise plate, its tip is 6,500 feet below the ocean surface and it stretches around 400 miles wide. After studying rock samples, scientists from the University of Houston believe the behemoth is the volcano that caused the underwater Shatsky Rise mountain range to form between 130 and 145 million years ago and may be the largest volcano in the solar system - even wider than the giant Olympus Mons volcano on Mars. The Tamu Massif volcano sits under the Pacific along the Shatsky Rise plate. Scientists from the University of Houston made the discovery, which remained hidden because Tamu Massif sits 6,500 feet below the surface. Scientists used core samples, radars and scans, pictured, to map the volcano's size . Tamu Massif is the largest feature of the Shatsky Rise mountain range, marked by A on this map, situated around 1,000 miles east of Japan. The range was formed following the eruption of the Tamu Massif volcano between 130 and 145 million years ago . Tamu Massif covers an area of about . 120,000 square miles - an area roughly equivalent to the British Isles. It is 400 miles wide and its tip sits 6,500 feet below the ocean's surface. Tamu Massif is also thought to sit in water around four miles deep. The . largest volcano on Earth is Hawaii’s Mauna Loa that covers . approximately 2,000 square miles - just two per cent of the size of Tamu . Massif. The Olympus . Mons volcano on Mars isn't as wide as Tamu Massif -  stretching 370 . miles across -  but it's overall mass is approximately 25 per cent . larger than Tamu Massif. Tamu Massif is around 145 million years old but 'became inactive . within a few million years after it was formed'. William Sager, a professor in the . Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the university, began studying . the volcano 20 years ago. Tamu Massif is the largest feature of the Shatsky Rise, which was formed following the eruption of . several underwater volcanoes. Until now, scientists were unsure whether Tamu . Massif was a single volcano, or was made up of multiple eruption points. The team of researchers studied core samples, radars and . data collected from the region to confirm that the huge mass of basalt that makes up the volcano erupted from a single source near the centre. Sager said: 'Tamu Massif is . the biggest single shield volcano ever discovered on Earth. 'There may be larger volcanoes, because there are bigger igneous . features out there such as the Ontong Java Plateau, but we don't know if . these features are one volcano or complexes of volcanoes.' Sager continued that Tamu Massif stands out among . underwater volcanoes not only because of its size, but also its unusual shape. This chart shows the Tamu Massif's location along the Shatsky Rise - a mountain range beneath the Pacific. A single eruption from the volcano is thought to have caused the range to form between 130 and 145 million years ago. The chart also shows Tamu Massif's relative size to Mars' Olympus Mons volcano . It is said to be 'low and broad', which suggests the erupted lava flows would have travelled longer distances compared to other volcanoes known about on Earth. Other underwater volcanoes are predominantly small and steep. 'It’s not high, but very wide, so the . flank slopes are very gradual,' said Sager. 'In fact, if you were . standing on its flank, you would have trouble telling which way is . downhill. 'We know that it is a single immense volcano constructed from . massive lava flows that emanated from the center of the volcano to form a . broad, shield-like shape. The Olympus Mons volcano on Mars, pictured, is thought to be the largest in the solar system. It is around three miles narrower than the Tamu Massif but has an overall mass thought to be 25 per cent bigger . The next largest volcano on Earth is Hawaii's Mauna Loa, pictured. It covers 2,000 square miles - around two per cent of the size of Tamu Massif . Before now, we didn't know this because . oceanic plateaus are huge features hidden beneath the sea. 'They have . found a good place to hide.' Tamu Massif covers an area of about . 120,000 square miles - an area roughly equivalent to the British Isles. The largest volcano on Earth is Hawaii’s Mauna Loa that covers approximately 2,000 square miles - just two per cent of the size of Tamu Massif. The Olympus Mons volcano on Mars isn't as wide as Tamu Massif -  stretching 370 miles across -  but it's overall mass is said to be approximately 25 per cent larger than Tamu Massif. Sager added that Tamu Massif is around 145 million years old but 'became inactive . within a few million years after it was formed'. The . project was funded by the National Science Foundation and the findings appear in the Nature Geoscience journal.","The 400-mile wide Tamu Massif volcano sits 1,000 miles east of Japan .

"Reeva Steenkamp's parents rejected £21,000 of 'blood money' from Oscar Pistorius after he shot dead their daughter, a court heard on Tuesday. Barry and June Steenkamp also vowed to return 'every cent' of monthly payments - totalling £6,000 - that Pistorius has been depositing into an account since Steenkamp's death. A probation officer hired by Pistorius's legal team had earlier told the court the athlete's financial gesture was an indication of his grave remorse for taking Steenkamp's life. Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius leaves the High Court in Pretoria at the end of the second day of his sentencing hearing .

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said the lump sum payment, raised by the sale of the runner's car, had been immediately rejected by the family, with Mrs Steenkamp insisting she did not want ‘blood money’. Mr Nel said the couple would also not proceed with any civil action against the track star. Dup de Bruyn, a lawyer for the Steenkamps, later claimed his clients had received R6,000 (£341) a month for the last 18 months. He said the payments had now stopped and the money would be repaid. Mr De Bruyn said he approached the athlete's legal team in the weeks after the model's death to explain that her family were struggling financially because Miss Steenkamp regularly sent money to her cash-strapped parents. 'I conveyed this to Oscar Pistorius's lawyers,' Mr De Bruyn told journalists, adding that the track star began providing monthly support - a fact he was keen to keep private. The lawyer said Mr and Mrs Steenkamp were now in a position to repay the money - a total of £6,200. 'The Steenkamps don’t want any money and there will be no civil case, they want closure,' Mr De Bruyn said. Pistorius's defence team said Mr De Bruyn's version was not accurate and they would give a statement on Wednesday. Pistorius' sentence hearing is expected to finish this week. He could face up to 15 years in jail if given the maximum sentence for culpable homicide. Pistorius shot dead Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year.

"Brave: Private Gregg Stone was killed by insurgent gunfire during a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman . A heroic young soldier killed in Afghanistan while rescuing a kidnapped police chief was due to become a father for the first time. Private Gregg Stone, 20, was shot dead as he took part in a daring mission to rescue a policeman kidnapped by extremists in the Nar-e-Seraj district of Helmand province. The young soldier, who had been in Afghanistan for less than a month, had been told in the last few days that his wife Samantha was pregnant with his first child. He was shot dead on Sunday night as his task force successfully saved policeman Abdul Walid from insurgents who captured him at a checkpoint. Today tributes were pouring in for Pte Stone, who was from Hull, who was only deployed to the war-torn country on May 13 as part of 6 Platoon, Burma Company. Major Rob Singleton, Officer Commanding Burma Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, said: 'Only a few days ago he told me how excited he was at the prospect of becoming a father for the first time. 'He will be sorely missed by everyone in Burma Company and he will never be forgotten. 'The thoughts and prayers of every member of Burma Company are with Gregg’s wife and his loving family.' Army chiefs said he was looking forward to attending the Junior Non-Commissioned Officers course upon return from Afghanistan, 'which he was sure to pass'. His widow celebrated his life, saying: 'Gregg and I were childhood sweethearts and we met at school - he was my soulmate. 'He was a brilliant husband and a family man who loved his family. He was always the one to want to make us laugh - he always cheered everyone up. 'He was proud to be a soldier and for what he had achieved in his work. He would also want me to mention his dog Benji, who he loved to bits.' The soldier’s mother, Angela, father, Robert, brothers, Kallum, Jamie and Graeme, and sisters, Rosie and Jennie, also celebrated his life. In a statement they said: 'He will always be a true hero in all our hearts. 'Anyone who was blessed enough to have known him will know how much of a credit to his friends and family he was. Words cannot begin to describe this great loss, and we are exceptionally proud of Gregg for everything he was and still is. Ongoing conflict: A soldier from the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, has become the 417th member of the British forces to have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001 . 'Gregg was the kindest, funniest, friendliest, most popular lad that you could wish to meet. This is the saddest loss of our laughing boy.' Private Stone became the 417th member of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001. Officials said Mr Walid, a deputy . chief, was kidnapped at a police checkpoint in Payan village on Sunday night. British troops with colleagues from . ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) laid siege to the area . and recovered Mr Walid after a fierce battle with the Taliban. Private . Stone was killed by small arms fire during the attack, which left . another British serviceman injured. The insurgents escaped from the area but ISAF forces captured one mobile phone, some of their documents and explosives. Corporal Michael Thacker, from 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh, was shot dead in Afghanistan on Friday . Gulab Mangal, governor of Helmand province, applauded the British forces for their bravery. His officials issued a statement . saying: 'Helmand governor praises the sacrifices and bravery of the . British forces that they rescued an Afghan police officer and sacrificed . own selves. 'Helmand governor and the local . residents of Helmand will never forget such a sacrifices of the British . forces and offer own sympathy to the British Government for the death . and injury of the British soldiers.' Lieutenant Colonel John Kerner, . spokesman for British Forces Helmand, said the Private Stone’s death . would be felt acutely in the war zone. He said: 'His loss will be felt by . everyone across Task Force Helmand and our thoughts are with his family . and friends at this difficult time.' The soldier died two days after another British serviceman, from 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh, was killed in the same region. Corporal Michael John Thacker was . manning an observation post in the Nahr-e Saraj District when his patrol . came under attack from small arms fire. The 27-year-old father-of-one received . immediate medical attention and was evacuated from the scene by . helicopter but died of his injuries. Corporal Thacker, who was born in . Swindon, Wiltshire, had also served in Northern Ireland and Iraq and had . completed two previous tours of Afghanistan. He was described as a 'soldier's soldier' and 'natural leader' by his comrades. His wife Catherine, who he lived with . in Coventry, said: 'Michael was the love of my life. He was an amazing . husband and father who will always be remembered as a funny, loving and . kind man. 'Everyone who met Mike instantly liked him and through time came to love him.' Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Webb MC, .

"An artist from Wales has become the latest face of the ‘NHS refugees’ forced to flee to England to get decent healthcare. Mariana Robinson, 60, has a life-threatening pancreatic condition and needs a biopsy before it can be diagnosed and the correct treatment given. But the Labour-run Health Service in Wales has left her waiting for months before she can even see a consultant. Mariana Robinson, 60, from Wales, has a life-threatening pancreatic condition and is demanding the right to be treated on the NHS in England . In desperation she has been forced to borrow from friends to afford the fees to see a private doctor in Bristol, and now she is demanding the right to be treated on the NHS in England. The Mail revealed two weeks ago that longer waiting times and poorer access to drugs mean thousands of Welsh patients are now flocking across the border to be treated in English hospitals. The number of Welsh cancer patients doing so has quadrupled from just 3,471 a decade ago to 15,450 last year. Mrs Robinson has now written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who runs the NHS in England, to plead for his help. She wrote: ‘Without timely NHS consultation, hundreds if not thousands of Welsh patients, particularly those on the borders, are either paying privately, changing their addresses, moving house or dying before they even get on a waiting list.’ The scandal was brought up in the Commons yesterday by Tory MP David Davies, who described his constituent Mrs Robinson as an ‘NHS refugee’. The artist has a condition where only 10 per cent of her pancreas remains which, if it further deteriorates, could leave her with type 1 diabetes. She lives in Llandogo in Monmouthshire, south-east Wales - just a couple of miles from the English border. Almost 50 per cent of Welsh cancer patients must wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests compared with a 1 per cent figure in England (file picture) A private consultant in Bristol her that he would only be able to diagnose her condition after a biopsy - but her local NHS organisation, Aneurin Bevan health board, said it would not pay for the procedure in an English hospital. She has been waiting since last October to even be given a date to see a consultant in Wales. ‘It has cost me £3,000 so far and I have had to borrow money from friends,’ she told the Mail. ‘I need regular tests and I am having to pay for them. I need a biopsy. ‘I am not well and I could do without all this hassle. The longer it takes, the more worried I am. I still have not seen a consultant.’ Mrs Robinson, who also has severe bowel problems, said she would only have to wait five or six weeks in England. ‘I blame the Labour-run assembly and the way it has squandered money on other projects and now have no money left,’ she said. ‘It looks as if the Welsh NHS is bankrupt, which is why they’re stalling people. ‘I live right on the border and Bristol is my nearest hospital and has the speciality I require. But they won’t pay for my treatment there - it’s monstrous. ‘There is absolutely no choice in Wales - you don’t know who you’re going to see, when or where.’ During Prime Minister’s questions yesterday, Mr Davies said: ‘My constituent Mariana Robinson is seeking the right to be treated by the English-run NHS. During Prime Minister's questions yesterday, David Cameron accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of 'laughing' at the failings of the Welsh NHS . ‘Would you investigate what can be done to help her and other NHS refugees who are seeking the higher standards and lower waiting times which are being delivered by this Government?’ Amid raucous scenes in the Commons, David Cameron accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of ‘laughing’ at the failings of the Welsh NHS. ‘Frankly what is happening to our NHS in Wales is a scandal and it is a scandal that is entirely the responsibility of the Labour Party who are running the Welsh Assembly government,’ he said. ‘They made the decision to cut NHS spending by 8 per cent in Wales. As a result they have not met an A&E target since 2009. I don’t know why Mr Miliband is laughing - it’s not funny, the state of the NHS in Wales. ‘If he had any gumption, if he had any backbone, he would get hold of the First Minister in Wales and he would tell him to start investing in the NHS in Wales.’ The Welsh NHS is worse than that in England because, unlike the Coalition which protected health spending in England, the devolved Labour-run government decided to cut it. During Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron said: 'What is happening to our NHS in Wales is a scandal and it is a scandal that is entirely the responsibility of the Labour Party who are running the Welsh Assembly government' In addition, Welsh Labour health ministers rejected Tony Blair’s target regime and the introduction of private sector provision, both of which are credited with bringing down waiting times. Almost 50 per cent of Welsh cancer patients must wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests compared with a 1 per cent figure in England. The exodus to England is also fuelled by a lack of access to the National Cancer Drugs Fund, which funds treatments rejected by the NHS or awaiting approval. Last night Mr Davies said: ‘Mariana Robinson is one of a large number of patients contacting me, not satisfied with the standard of treatment on the NHS in Wales, and want the right to be treated by the Coalition-run NHS in England. ‘That’s not a reflection on doctors and nurses in Wales, it’s a reflection of the fact that Labour have failed to run the Health Service properly, with longer waiting times, and less access to cancer drugs. People are desperate to leave and be treated in England.’","Mariana Robinson, 60, needs biopsy before correct treatment can be given .

"Her creations became a hit with . A-listers, including Victoria Beckham and Princess Diana, and in 1998 a . pair made their way into the script of Sex And The City - turning Jimmy . Choo into a household name overnight. However, it was Mr Choo who went on to gain global recognition for the A-list favourite footwear label, not his business partner Tamara Mellon. But after leaving the luxury label that she founded and managed between 1996 and 2011 - she sold her shares for £82.5 million - Ms Mellon has unveiled her very own collection of totes, ready-to-wear and, of course, shoes. Debut shoe: Tamara Mellon, who left Jimmy Choo in 2011, has unveiled her £1,595 leather legging boots - appropriately named Sweet Revenge . The legging boots are being sold on high-end fashion site, Net-a-porter . The star of her range is undoubtedly the . £1,595 leather legging boots - appropriately named Sweet Revenge - which are a far cry from a dainty pair of Choos. Mellon describes her leather creation as 'a thigh boot that pulls right up into a legging. You can wear a sweater over it or a big man's shirt and there's no gap.' Net-a-porter, who are selling the shoe, write: 'Designed for a flawless, all-in-one silhouette, each size of this unique style is constructed with either a XS/S or M/L pant - wear yours with a fitted tunic for the slickest take.' The capsule collection also includes a £725 leather tote, £550 stretch-wool piqué straight-leg pants and £830 fringed wrap-effect leather skirt. Daring: Mellon (L) describes her leather creation (R), which is a far cry from a dainty Choo, as 'a thigh boot that pulls right up into a legging' Her debut range comes soon after Mellon told how her business . partner did not design a single shoe for the multi-million . dollar brand named after him. During an interview this morning on the Today . show, the 46-year-old revealed that she never received a sketch from . him during the years they worked together; 'Not one', she clarified. Unaware . of Mr Choo's lack of design nous when they joined forces, she said that . she had to quickly hone her skills and use experience from her fashion . writing days as accessories editor at Vogue to guide her. Noting her increasing bitterness about the situation, she writes in her memoirs: 'By the end of 2000, Jimmy Choo was turning a profit of around £3 million a year. 'We had our own London boutique and were represented at 450 more stores, including Harrods and Selfridges. 'To top it off, we'd won a British Fashion Council Award, which Jimmy insisted on accepting on our behalf, even though his design contribution had been nil' Work the look: Net-a-porter, who are selling the shoe, write: 'Designed for a flawless, all-in-one silhouette - wear yours with a fitted tunic for the slickest take' Not a design man: Ms Mellon said that Mr Choo, seen with a fashion student, was a skilled cobbler but lacked creative spark . Design process: Ms Mellon said that she would . come up with ideas and Mr Choo's niece, Ms Choi would sketch them out . and the two of them would go to vintage stores to look for inspiration . Ms Mellon said from . there her relationship with Mr Choo deteriorated to the point that any . conversation was 'out of the question'. In my shoes: Ms Mellon offers a glimpse into her eventful life in her new memoir . Eventually, after much confrontation, Mr Choo sold his share in the company in 2001. Ms . Mellon, who remained with the firm until 2011, said the years that . followed were tough as she dealt with the death of her father in 2004 . and a divorce from her 'playboy' husband in 2005. While . it might have been more sensible for Ms Mellon to have gone into . business alone, she admits that she met Mr Choo after going through a . rough period in her life. 'One glass of wine for me turned into 6 o’clock in the morning and calling the coke dealer and then realizing, ""Oh my God, I've got to be at work in three hours,'"" she recalled. After losing her job at Vogue at the age 27, Ms Mellon entered rehab. The experience marked a turning point for her. She emerged determined to pursue her dream of starting her own shoe business. That’s when she reached out to Mr Choo, a cobbler from London’s East End whom she knew from her Vogue days. Today, armed with a wealth of business experience, she has finally unveiled her own namesake label. She concluded on the Today show: 'If I have a bit of equanimity now, and I'm better at standing my ground, it's only because I've fought my way through the rites of passage. 'I can't believe that it's actually happened...I had the dream and the vision. And now it's a reality.' In her memoir, she attributes her success and determination to a childhood that revolved around a difficult relationship with her mother and unwavering support from her father.

"David Cameron will today come under pressure to bring in laws to force Google and other web companies to crack down on child pornography. Labour will trigger a Commons vote to demand legislation to force the hand of internet companies who have failed to act. Days ago, the Prime Minister called for search engines such as Google and internet service providers to hunt down and banish child porn from the web. Labour is piling pressure on David Cameron to bring in laws to banish child porn from the internet . Ed Miliband said the 'whole of Britain is united in demanding action' But Ed Miliband will today demand Mr Cameron enshrines his demands in law. Labour will use an opposition day debate in the Commons to urge the creation of measures to tackle internet child porn. It will call for the Government to ‘set a timetable for the introduction of safe search as a default’ setting for internet search engines, meaning that anyone who wanted to access pornographic material would have to change the settings. They also want effective age verification checks on pornographic sites, in the same way as they are used on gambling sites, forcing people to register credit cards and personal details in order to gain access. Labour’s motion will also demand ‘splash page warnings’, which will flash a warning that a web surfer is about to visit a child porn site. ‘The recent convictions of Mark Bridger and Stuart Hazell for the brutal murders of April Jones and Tia Sharp shocked the country,’ Mr Miliband told the Mail. ‘There are significant concerns over the lack of support available to the police to tackle the problem of child abuse online. ‘The whole of Britain is united in demanding action. That is why Labour has called a Parliamentary vote.’ The Prime Minister has summoned major web firms to a summit next week to explain how they can ‘do more to root out these disgusting images’. Details of Labour’s ambush came as Claire Perry, the Prime Minister’s adviser on families, said it was wrong that just 5 per cent of reports to the Internet Watch Foundation – which removes illegal sites – came from the industry, with 95 per cent ‘depending on you and I stumbling across child porn and reporting it’. At an event hosted by the think tank Policy Exchange, she said: ‘It’s as if we were finding the bags of drugs on the street and reporting them. It’s completely unacceptable.’ Miliband said the murders of April Jones, left, and Tia Sharp, right, had galvanised support for new measures . A No 10 source said: ‘The Prime Minister has been very clear that child sexual abuse is a sickening crime that we must eradicate both on and offline.’ Scott Rubin, of Google, said: ‘Google has a zero-tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content. We are members and joint funders of the Internet Watch Foundation – an independent body that searches the web for child abuse imagery and then sends us links, which we remove from our search index. ‘Whenever we discover child abuse imagery through our own systems or other channels, we respond quickly to remove and report it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.’","Ed Miliband said the 'whole of Britain is united in demanding action'

"JK Rowling has revealed that the OCD-afflicted lead character in her new book was inspired by her personal experience with the disorder. In the first ever interview about new adult novel The Casual Vacancy, she describes how her own battles with anxiety and depression helped shape her protagonist. Ms Rowling, 47, told Good Morning America: 'We have an adult character in the book . who has obsessive compulsive disorder.' In the hot seat: In an interview about her adult novel JK Rowling told how the OCD-afflicted protagonist was inspired by her personal experience with the disorder . She then admitted: 'These are . things I know from the inside... When I was in my teens I had issues . with OCD.' Describing how the condition manifested itself she told presenter Cynthia McFadden that she became increasingly irrational. She said that as a teenager she constantly made lists and could not stop 'checking, double checking, triple checking' things. In her latest novel The . Casual Vacancy, which hits bookstores tomorrow, the teenage female lead . gets mixed up with prostitution, heroin addiction and teen sexuality. The . book appears to be grounded in contemporary culture - indeed the . Rihanna track, Umbrella, featuring Jay Z, plays a very prominent role in . the story. 'The . song's just perfect for the book because of the rap at the beginning,' Ms Rowling tells GMA. Compulsive: Ms Rowling (pictured with GMA presenter Cynthia McFadden) said that she couldn't stop checking things over and over again as a teenager as she battled OCD . 'There's this rap that Jay Z does at the beginning of the song and it's . actually a very celebratory rap. 'It's saying, ""I'm . shockproof.. I'm famous, I have money, let the Dow Jones fall, I'm OK,"" and it's said in the book by a girl who doesn't really understand the . words and who is not OK. Strictly for grown-ups: The Casual Vacancy addresses adult topics with descriptions of porn, a rape and the anxiety disorder OCD . 'It's very poignant to me that this girl doesn't . understand.' As for her struggles with depression, which she has discussed in the past, Ms Rowling says it . has not been part of her life for 'more than a decade,' attributing part . of that to the success of Harry Potter. 'It cheered me up a lot... Forget the money. Harry Potter gave me back self respect. Harry gave me a . job to do that I loved more than anything else,' she said. 'So forget . the money. Let's just say it had made just enough to justify continuing . to write. It would've still cheered me up a huge amount... It was an . amazing thing that happened.' While the The Casual Vacancy has been pegged as a 'black comedy', Ms Rowling says she would describe it a little differently. 'When I read the blurb that said it's a 'black comedy,' I thought - that's not maybe how I would've described it. I would've maybe said it's a comic tragedy,' she added. Ms Rowling will be heavily promoting the book in the U.S. and Britain, following its release tomorrow. And though she admits that the publicity tour will be fun, she is excited for it all to be over and to spend time with her family. 'I am really looking forward to us getting home because we have a . new dog...' she said. 'So my reward is to get home and look after a new puppy while . writing on the kitchen table.'","The Casual Vacancy is released across the globe tomorrow .

"A judge has warned of the dangers of informal surrogacy agreements after a woman found she had no parental rights to the baby she had asked her friend to conceive with her husband. The ‘do it yourself’-style surrogate pregnancy ended in the High Court after the boy, now three, was effectively left with two mothers. Unable to have children of her own, a woman asked a close friend to be artificially inseminated at home with her husband’s sperm. A surrogate pregnancy ended in bitter recrimination and a three-year-old boy effectively having two mothers (stock picture) But when the woman’s marriage broke . down months after the birth of the child, she found she had no parental . rights because she was not the boy’s legal or biological mother. Yesterday, . she was granted a residency order to care for the child, but the judge . warned against anyone considering an informal surrogacy agreement, . rather than through a professional agency. Describing . the case as a ‘cautionary tale’, Mrs Justice Eleanor King underlined . the ‘real dangers’ of private surrogacy agreements and urged couples to . use licensed and regulated fertility clinics. Even . then, surrogacy contracts are not enforceable and a gestational mother . can always change her mind about handing the child to the couple. The father and surrogate mother were named on the toddler’s birth certificate and, in the eyes of the law, they are his parents. The . judge said medics had spotted something was amiss when the surrogate . mother booked herself in at the Leicester Royal Infirmary to give birth. Doctors insisted on seeing a formal surrogacy agreement and the couple went to a firm of solicitors, who drafted an agreement. Mrs . Justice King said the solicitors unwittingly committed a crime when . they drafted it, because they charged for the preparation of the . agreement, which is in breach of the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985. The . couple’s relationship broke down soon after the birth and they have . since divorced. The court heard they made a second legal error when they . failed to seek court recognition of the woman’s parenthood within six . months of the birth. The judge said the time limit was mandatory and making a parental order in the woman’s favour was ‘not an option’. Legal chaos ensued after the couple's relationship broke down within months of the little boy's birth, London's High Court heard . Allowing her to formally adopt the child was also not an option and the woman was left with no legal rights over the boy. The . judge said social workers and lawyers had worked hard to find a . solution. After several years of ‘bitter recriminations’ the couple set . aside their grievances and put in place practical shared care . arrangements, the court heard. While . the woman could never become the boy’s legal mother, Mrs Justice King . said steps could be taken to ‘provide her with security and recognition . of her status’. The surrogate mother, who remains a close family friend, technically has parental responsibility for the boy. But . the judge directed that he should remain a ward of court indefinitely . and made a shared residence order in favour of the former couple, . effectively granting the woman parental responsibility for the child. The surrogate mother was banned from exercising her parental rights without permission from the court.","Unable to have children of her own, a woman had done a deal with a close friend who was 'artificially inseminated at home' with her husband's sperm .

Socialised with Roger Federer's wife after watching him lose in the semi-finals . Pippa Middleton celebrated her 29th birthday in style last night, by cheering Andy Murray to victory in the US Open quarter-final. The Duchess of Cambridge's sister donned a vibrant lacy yellow dress, nude wedges and carried a Wicker Delavan Terrace Bag in white at the match.

Pippa Middleton and Spencer Vegosen watched Andy Murray play in the men's quarter finals . Avid tennis fan Pippa looked like she was enjoying the game, it was her second day at the tennis . Pippa wore a lacy yellow dress and had her hair in loose curls as she took her seat next to Harvard graduate Spencer . It is not the first time that Pippa . has taken a seat next to Mr Vegosen, they both cheered Roger Federer to . glory just a day ago on day nine of the competition. Mr Vegosen, who now resides in New York but is originally from Illinois, Chicago  is a familiar face on the sporting scene and he was . once one of the top junior tennis players in the U.S, winning 11 . sportsmanship awards. His father Jon is also president of the U.S.Tennis . Association. It is believed Mr Vegosen . received a BA in East Asian studies and mathematics from Harvard . University and spent last summer working in Hong Kong as an analyst for . Goldman Sachs. However it is not known where he currently works. The pair laughed and joked together at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre in Flushing, Queens, New York. Pippa smiled as she watched Murray play and was joined by a brunette friend . Pippa was also joined by a brunette . friend and the two seemed in high spirits as they clapped and cheered on . the Scottish player who, from . the dire straits of 6-3, 5-1 down when he could barely get the ball in . the court, fought back to win 3-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-0 in three hours . to keep his Grand Slam dream alive. After finishing he was able to relax . and see who his next opponent would be in his second straight semi-final . at Flushing Meadows — whether it would be a rematch of his epic two . clashes with Roger Federer at Wimbledon this year or a less expected . contest with Czech powerhouse Tomas Berdych. In . the end Berdych shocked Federer in four sets and Murray now has two . days to compose himself after making what was an awkward assignment . against the 6ft 6in Croat look exactly that. Avid tennis fan Pippa also attended the match between Tomas Berdych and Roger Federer, as his guest of honour in his box. Pippa, who turns 29 today, watches the men's singles quarterfinal match between Roger Federer of Switzerland and Tomas Berdych of Czech Republic . Pippa Middleton attended the US open quarter final and took her seat in Roger Federer's private box and cheered on the Swiss player . Roger Federer cut a disconsolate . figure as he tried to come to terms with his shock quarter-final exit . against an inspired Tomas Berdych at the US Open. Not . since 2003 had Federer lost before the semi-final stage at Flushing . Meadows, winning five titles in that time, and he went into the . tournament on a high after a stellar summer. Pippa was spotted after the match bonding with Federer's wife Miroslava Vavrinec Federer as they left the stadium. Since landing in the metropolis on Saturday to attend meetings about her . upcoming book, Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Families and . Friends, Pippa has been snapped with a number of men while sampling some . of New York's finer delights. Pippa wore a bright yellow dress with nude wedges and carried a straw handbag as she left the match . Pippa was seen socialising with Roger Federer's wife Miroslava Vavrinec Federer at the US Open Tennis Center in New York City after the game . In an opulent welcome hotelier Andre Balazs, who is reportedly worth . more than $450 million, flew her by seaplane - a trip that costs $525 . for a single journey - to his resort, Sunset Beach, on Shelter Island on . Sunday. And later that evening the New York Daily News reported that she was . spotted at the Electric Room at Dream Downtown in the Meatpacking . district with former New York Ranger Sean Avery. 'She was only there for a short time,' a source told the paper, adding . they were there with Mazdack Rassi, owner of photography company Milk . Studios.

Her trip, during which she is apparently courting the perks of fame, come despite her demands to remain out of the public gaze. Pippa scored a style ace the day before when she watched Samantha Stosur of Australia play Victoria Azarenka of Belarus during the quarterfinals match . While newspapers have respected her request to be recognised as a . private citizen, she still very much seems to be enjoying the . high-flying life of a socialite. Despite her request, U.S. news sites chose to publish photographs of her . playing table tennis with Balazs over the weekend, but MailOnline has . respected her wishes. Pippa, who turns 29 today, is in town for meetings over her new . book, which is out on October 30.

"Banks are to be investigated for charging some current account customers more for their overdrafts than it would cost to take out a payday loan. Customers who go into the red are hit with ‘very high, complex and opaque charges’, the Financial Conduct Authority warned yesterday. Despite efforts by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to control excessive charges, the FCA said many customers ‘may still be paying too much’. The Office of Fair Trading regulator of competitive trading and consumer protection - who have been attempting to control the excessive charges . It said lenders were making huge amounts from ‘consumers’ lack of understanding, confusion and limited attention’. Customers owe £8billion in overdrafts to banks and building societies, and 15 per cent of those with an overdraft are permanently or usually overdrawn. The consumer group Which? said Halifax and Santander were among the main culprits. Customers using the Halifax Reward current account and the Santander Everyday Account pay £100 in charges for going £100 into an unauthorised overdraft for a month, equal to an annual percentage rate of 1,200 per cent. But it would cost £37 to borrow £100 from payday lender Wonga over the same period. Which? also found that customers borrowing £100 over a month with Halifax within an agreed overdraft would pay £30 for the period, giving an effective APR of 356 per cent. Following an investigation by the OFT, banks have changed overdraft levies from a more traditional interest rate to a daily fee, typically of £1 a day or more, saying it is easier to understand. Despite those who believe they are acting responsibly with their banking, they can sometimes still be hit by large penalties for small overdrafts . But the FCA, which took over regulation of consumer credit from the OFT this month, is concerned that the simpler fees ‘may be a mechanism by which providers are increasing revenue from authorised overdrafts’. It will investigate fees for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, as well as how banks set overdraft limits and how they reduce and increase them for customers. Banks could be fined if the FCA finds any wrongdoing, and could be forced to introduce measures to protect customers, such as texts to those near their limit. Christopher Woolard, of the FCA, said: ‘Just about everybody who banks can have access to some sort of overdraft, whether they’ve signed up for it or not. 'This market is huge, and with overdrafts bolted on to over 30million current accounts, we want to make sure it is working well for consumers.’ Overdrafts are lucrative for banks, which claim they need the fees to provide so-called free current accounts to customers who remain in credit. The OFT says banks are squeezing nearly £2billion a year from customers with unauthorised overdrafts. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said the FCA investigation was a ‘welcome first step towards putting people back in control of their credit’. He added: ‘We have long called for regulators to clamp down on excessive charges that hit hardest people struggling with their finances. 'With some unauthorised overdrafts as costly as payday loans, we want charges made clearer so people can compare borrowing options more easily.’ The FCA probe follows a series of banking scandals, including the mis-selling of payment protection insurance and complaints over fee-charging packaged accounts offering ‘perks’ that some customers cannot use. Eric Leenders, of the British Bankers’ Association, said: ‘Millions of people find overdrafts an easy way to borrow money, more flexible and convenient than a loan. Overdraft charges have plummeted in recent years.’","Customers hit with very large charges for going into the red .

Scroll down for video . A masked Egyptian policeman checks the identity of a bus passenger at a checkpoint outside of Cairo University . The increased police presence and use of checkpoints is the police's reaction to both the recent bomb attack at Cairo University and the escalation of violence in pro-Morsi protests around the country . The attack came after fresh violence has been hitting the country, as many people engage in protests and demonstrations. Much of the protests have been carried out by students loyal to the ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, who was deposed by a military backed coup at the end of the Arab Spring last year. Daily battles on university campuses are now a common occurrence, thanks to the increased levels of violence and protests. Because of this, the Egyptian forces have had to up their security measures, and have begun tavelling in armoured cars more regularly, dressing in full riot gear, and setting up checkpoints in key areas. Daily battles and protests on university campuses are common, and have contributed to the increased levels of violence . Egyptian police deploy outside of Cairo University, the day after a series of three bombs went off, killing a police general and wounding seven people in Giza . There were two bombs that exploded outside Cairo University's main campus in a coordinated attack that killed two people, including a senior police officer - a brigadier general, and a civilian. The two bombs were planted by the roadside near the faculty of engineering, and went off seconds apart.

"An outspoken Labour MP has admitted going on ecstasy-fuelled nights out when he was younger - and smoking cannabis twice a week. Simon Danczuk said he had decided to tell the truth after his ex-wife went public about his drug-taking past. Mr Danczuk, who has risen to prominence in the Commons with outspoken attacks on Labour's record on welfare, admitted he had taken ecstasy ‘many, many years ago’. Labour's Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk and his wife Karen have become one of the most high profile couples in Parliament. Mr Danczuk wrote a bombshell expose on the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith and the abuse of young boys at Knowl View School . He added and that he used to smoke marijuana ‘a couple of times a week’ - but rejected claims he smoked every day after work. The Labour MP also insisted that he did not use any drugs between 2007 and 2010, in the run up to the general election, when he won his Rochdale seat with a wafer thin majority. Mr Danczuk told the Sun on Sunday: 'I am not proud of this story but once confronted by The Sun newspaper about my past I decided to be honest. 'It’s worth noting there are some inaccuracies in the story and it does not tell the true story.' Mr Danczuk’s first wife Sonia Milewski, 37, claims they used to have ecstasy-fuelled nights out in Manchester before they were married. Ms Milewski, who has two children by the Rochdale MP, alleges that he took drugs while a councillor for Blackburn and Darwen and a mature sociology student at Lancaster University. She told the paper: 'We’d go out and do pills a couple of time a week. I think because he was a mature student, it was his way of catching up.'

The 31-year-old mother of two runs a cafe in Rochdale, Danczuk's Deli, and is also a Labour councillor . Mr Danczuk admitted smoking cannabis with his first wife and said he may have taken ecstasy ‘once or twice’ as a teenager. He added he had never used cocaine. Tha Labour MP divorced from Ms Milewski in 2010 and later married Karen Burke, a Labour political activist in Rochdale who is now a councillor in Rochdale's Kingsway ward. Karen Danczuk has also been in the headlines in the past week for posting selfies of her cleavage on Twitter. The 31-year-old denied being an attention-seeker while her husband showed his support, saying he was proud of her ‘beauty and brains’. Mrs Danczuk has claimed the 'cleavage selfies' are accidental. She said: ‘Because I’m taking them myself, yes, they come out on a bit of an angle. ‘But they’re not supposed to be sexy. I’m not an attention seeker. I don’t roll out of clubs drunk. I’m not silly. I’m not a crazy party animal. I’m not a girly girl and I rarely wear make-up. In fact, I’m quite a tomboy. ‘I don’t tweet them because I think I look nice. The selfies were just: “Oh, it’s hot today — I’m going out.” I like cycling!’ Simon Danczuk's first marriage did not end amicably and he has insisted that her claims about his drug fuelled past were exagerated . Mrs Danczuk posted this image of an 'easier to eat bacon sarnie' which was available at her Rochdale Deli. It came after the Labour Party leader sparked widespread internet mockery after struggling with a breakfast roll at a campaign stop ahead of the European and council elections last month . Labour leader Ed Miliband was pictured in a series of unflattering shots after ordering a bacon sandwich at a campaign stop ahead of last month's European and local elections . But the pictures have boosted the number of people who follow her tweets from 400 to over 3,500. Mrs Danczuk has also attacked claims from women in politics that she was damaging women's reputation in politics. She said: ‘They’re insinuating I’m taking women in politics back 20 years. ‘But if a few selfies can take us back to where we were 40 years ago, then as women we ought to be ashamed of ourselves. And perhaps if women weren’t so horrible to each other and always bitching, there’d be more women on top. ‘Why don’t women help each other out more? It’d be nice if a fellow politician said, “Well done, Karen, for being a councillor and a businesswoman and a mum and getting some attention for Rochdale”.’ Mr Danczuk has become one of Labour’s highest-profile backbenchers, thanks in part to his book on Cyril Smith and the abuse of young boys at Knowl View School. The book, Smile for the Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith, prompted Rochdale Council to launch an inquiry into a potential cover-up at the school, while Greater Manchester Police is also investigating.","Rochdale MP admits drug past after ex wife goes public with claims .

"Sick: German satire magazine Titanic has printed a picture of Austrian Formula One Legend Niki Lauda, joking that it's the latest picture of comatose Michael Schumacher . A German satire magazine has been condemned after printing a picture of badly-scarred Austrian Formula One Legend Niki Lauda with the title: 'Exclusive - First Photo After The Accident - This is how badly it affected Schumi'. 'Titanic' jokes that Michael Schumacher, who is in a coma after a skiing accident, now looks like Lauda - the Austrian former champion who was seriously injured in a crash at the 1976 German Grand Prix at the Nurburgring. During the crash, his Ferrari burst into flames and he came close to death after inhaling hot toxic fumes and suffering severe burns leaving him with extensive facial scars. Lauda said of the Titanic cover: 'It is an absolute barefaced cheek and is completely impious. I ask myself, ""who would print such a load of rubbish""?' The article then goes on to explain to parents how they can explain Schumacher's accident with 'Fun and Games', such as a puzzle of . seriously injured Schumacher in a helmet and a maze where taking the wrong route down the mountain puts the reader in 'hospital'. It is not the first time the magazine has been criticised for tasteless jokes. A double page spread once suggested missing girl Maddie McCann's parents sell her pics for advertising products, like a bleach brand that was 'guaranteed to wipe away DNA evidence'. Lauda said he is considering legal steps but he may not get far. When told that Maddie's parents were planning legal action over the use of their daughter's image, Titanic welcomed the move, saying it would give the publication great publicity - and help to raise sales. The ad features numerous products with Maddie's face on them, each offered at half price. German Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher poses with his wife Corinna.

She is the best known face in the world, if not in the entire universe,' the fake ad claimed. 'You will find her image on selected products in our store. If you find her, simply take her - and pay only half price.'

"Nazi chief Hermann Goering plotted to attack New York in a bizarre plot involving a manned space rocket dropping a dirty bomb over the Manhattan skyline. Vying for Hitler's attention, the head of the German air-force, Hermann Goering, set up a lab and a team of leading scientists to explore the possibility of the radioactive attack on American soil. Goering read the work of maverick Austrian engineer, Eugen Saenger and particularly his belief that a space plane could be built. New York: The Nazis wanted to attack the U.S. but they lacked long-range bombers capable of covering the distance. They explored a rocked-propelled spacecraft as a way to reach and bomb New York (pictured) The head of the Luftwaffe commissioned him and other leading physicists to explore the plane, which he then wanted to arm with a radioactive bomb capable of doing untold damage to America's most populous city. Leading historians told the Daily Express that Goering may have been gullible for believing the far-fetched plan would work, but much of the research which went into the project paved the way for modern space travel research and the space shuttle program. 'Saenger would greatly influence post-war thinking about space travel in the United States,' Dr David Baker, a space historian, told the British newspaper. 'A whole series of highly classified space-plane concepts were developed based on his theories.' Silverbird: Eugen Saenger (left) devised plans for the aircraft known as the Silverbird (right) that could reach America via space. Goering wanted the craft to be capable of dropping a 'dirty bomb' on New York . 'His work certainly had an influence on aspects of the Space Shuttle programme.' Goering believed the rocket plan would enable the Third Reich to overcome the issue of flying across the Atlantic and ultimately avenge America's entry into the war. Saenger completed a 900-page plan and called the craft the Silverbird. He believed it would be able to clear the lower reaches of space after being fired with rocket engines. Anti-American: The Nazis sought a way to punish the U.S. for entering World War Two. One of the schemes they looked at was a plane which would reach America via space in order to bomb New York . It was expected to reach 13,000 miles . per hour, would have a 100-tonne thrust motor and would reach more than . 80 miles above earth. 'The plan was to wrap the bomb with radioactive sand and have it explode . high above New York casting a radioactive cloud over the city,” aviation historian David Myhra . says. 'It was a kind of prototype dirty bomb.' Losing control: Goering was particularly keen to promote his airforce and saw the plot to bomb New York as an ideal way to win Hitler's favor . 'The standard aircraft of the day could not fly from Europe to the US . because they could not carry enough fuel.' 'But by reaching sub-orbital altitude the Silverbird’s fuel life would be extended allowing it to bomb anywhere in the world.' 'It was wild science fiction' 'But Saenger had worked out all the mathematics. He was certain it would work.' 'Post-war analysis indicated that the space-plane would have burnt up during re-entry but this could have been overcome with thermal shielding. 'The underlying concept was sound but it was many years ahead of its time.' Goering finally dismissed the plan and the Nazis looked at other ways to bomb the U.S. but never succeeded. Saenger fled to France and was later sent for by Josef Stalin who was also interested in the Silverbird concept. He was never found by the Soviet Union and died in 1964. Dr Asif Siddiqi, an . assistant professor in space history at Fordham University said: 'Saenger was the first to look into the technicalities of building a . winged, reusable sub-orbital vehicle.' 'His work . was extremely far-sighted.' Failure to launch: The Silverbird, pictured, was devised by Austrian engineer Eugen Saenger so the Nazis could bomb New York. The ambitious space rocket design wasn't developed beyond planning stage .","Hermann Goering was tasked with overcoming long-range bombing problem .

"A tax could be put on fizzy drinks and biscuits could be emblazoned with health warnings in a new strategy to slash the nation’s sugar intake. A report commissioned by a Government agency says that targeting soft drinks would be an easy option in the war on sugar. It estimates that a 20 per cent tax on fizzy drinks – which would raise the price of a can from 70p to 84p – would cut the number of overweight Britons by more than a quarter of a million. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is under pressure to hike fizzy drinks' cost to tackle the growing obesity crisis . The leaked paper, which was written by heart doctors and health researchers, comes just weeks after the Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies warned that a ‘sugar tax’ may be necessary to tackle the country’s obesity epidemic. Figures show that British girls are the fattest in Europe, with almost a third overweight or obese. Around two thirds of adults are overweight or obese. The ‘options for action’ document, which was prepared for Public Health England, identifies six possible ways of reducing sugar intake: a tax on sugary drinks; foods being reformulated to contain less sugar; a cut in portion sizes; advertising rules being tightened; health warnings on  sugary products; and encouraging farmers to grow fruit and vegetables instead of sugar beet. The draft report describes sugary soft drinks as ‘low-hanging fruit’ – or an easy target – and says a 20 per cent sugar  tax would reduce obesity rates by 1.3  per cent. It argues that the move would have public support, ‘especially when health benefits are emphasised’. The paper, obtained by The Grocer magazine, is expected to form the basis of a report to be published on June 26. Public Health England said the Government had asked for its advice but any decision would lie with ministers. The Department of Health said it currently had no plans for a sugar tax. Coca-Cola Life (left), is a new naturally-sweetened drink with a third less sugar and calories than regular fizzy drinks  and will be launched in the new year. But health campaigners say people need to learn how to enjoy drinks that do not taste sweet - whether loaded with sugar or sweeteners - because at the moment we are 'drinking spoonfuls of sugar', as the shock image on the right represents . A . can of Coca Cola or Pepsi contains nine teaspoons of sugar - or 35g. This is almost half of the maximum recommended daily intake of sugar . Our diets could be improved by listening to the right kind of music, scientists claim. Researchers from Oxford University claim high-pitched tones trick the brain into thinking a food is sweeter than it really is, while low notes enhance bitter tastes. They said a dish could be made to taste up to 10 per cent sweeter through ‘sonic seasoning’, meaning less sugar was needed.","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told to introduce 20% 'fizzy drinks tax'

"The number of Britons  paying inheritance tax is expected to rise by more than a third this year as house prices soar – and it will double in five years. At 40 per cent on the value of any estate above £325,000, Britain has one of the highest rates of inheritance tax. It will be paid by one in ten people by 2018, compared with just under one in 20 today, Treasury forecasts claim. Married couples are entitled to double the allowance, passing on assets of up to £650,000 to their children or other relatives free of tax. As shadow chancellor George Osborne announced a dramatic pledge to increase the inheritance tax threshold to £1million . The tax was intended for the rich, but ministers have refused to raise the threshold in line with rising property values, which have gone up by 10 per cent a year in some areas. London and the South have been particularly badly affected, with the average property in the capital worth £450,000. Figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility show 26,337 deaths led to estates being charged inheritance tax in the last financial year. This will rise by 35 per cent to 35,600 this year, and 43,800 in 2015-16. It is predicted to double by 2019. Chancellor George Osborne has frozen the levy for the next three years, but tax experts and a growing number of Tory MPs have called for it to rise. In 2007, the then shadow chancellor vowed to increase the threshold for the so-called death duty to £1million. Senior backbench Tory Graham Brady said inheritance tax was hitting an 'increasing number of middle-income families' The tax currently brings in £3.1billion a year, which will rise to £5.8billion by 2019. Critics say it is unfair because it taxes assets such as homes bought with income that was already taxed. In most other developed countries it affects only the super-rich. The threshold in the United States is £3.2million. Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, said: ‘These figures show that inheritance tax is now hitting an increasing number of middle-income families, people it was never intended to target. ‘Given that most of the assets that are being taxed have been built up from people’s earned incomes, on which they have already paid tax once, there is an obvious case to be made that it would be fair to look at this again.’ Earlier this year David Cameron acknowledged that too many families were paying the levy and said this would be addressed in next year’s election manifesto. But the Treasury froze the threshold until 2017-18 to help pay for the new cap on the cost of social care for the elderly. Housing accounts for about 50 per cent of the value of estates that attract inheritance tax. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘While we are having to pay off Labour’s deficit couples can still leave £650,000 tax free and, importantly, freezing the inheritance tax threshold means we can pay to end the scandal of people having to sell their homes to pay for social care, meaning they often had no home to leave to their children and grandchildren in the first place.’","Osborne froze level for death duties at £325,000 for the next three years .

"A 350-million-year-old scorpion fossil is thought be the oldest known land-living animal in the Southern Hemisphere supercontinent, Gondwana. Gondwana was a giant ancient continent made up of the land masses now known as South America, Australia, Antarctica, Madagascar and India. The specimen was discovered in rocks from the Devonian Witteberg Group near Grahamstown, South Africa by Dr Robert Gess, from the Evolutionary Studies Institute at Wits University. The fossil discovery, which included this pictured sting of the scorpion, represent  the earliest record of a land living animal in Gondwana. Gondwana was a giant ancient continent made up of the land masses now known as South America, Australia, Antarctica, Madagascar and India . Gondwana was a giant ancient . continent made up of the land masses now known as South America, . Australia, Antarctica, Madagascar and India. The first stage of its breakup began in the early Jurassic Period, about 180 million years ago. The name Gondwanaland was coined by the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess in reference to Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic formations in the Gondwana region of central India. The fossil has been identified as a new species of scorpion called Gondwanascorpio emzantsiensis. Dr Gess claims that this 350-million-year-old fossil will allow scientists to confirm some long-held ideas about early life. Scientist know that Laurasia -the single northern landmass then comprising what is today North America and Asia - was inhabited by diverse invertebrates 420 million years ago. But this supercontinent was at the time separated from the southerly positioned Gondwana by a deep ocean. ‘Evidence on the earliest colonisation of land animals has up till now come only from the northern hemisphere continent of Laurasia, and there has been no evidence that Gondwana was inhabited by land living invertebrate animals at that time,’ explained Dr Gess. These pincers of a 350 million-year-old scorpion was discovered in rocks from the Devonian Witteberg Group near Grahamstown, South Africa . ‘For the first time we know for certain that not just scorpions, but whatever they were preying on were already present in the Devonian [which occurred around 416 million years ago] . ‘We now know that by the end the Devonian period Gondwana also, like Laurasia, had a complex terrestrial ecosystem, comprising invertebrates and plants which had all the elements to sustain terrestrial vertebrate life that emerged around this time or slightly later,’ he said. Dr Gess explained that early life was initially confined to the sea and the process of moving life to land began during the Silurian Period about 420 million years ago. The first wave of life to move out from water onto land consisted of plants, which gradually increased in size and complexity throughout the Devonian Period. Dr Robert Gess (pictured) claims that this 350-million-year-old fossil will allow scientists to confirm some long-held ideas about early life . This initial colonisation of land was followed by plant and debris-eating invertebrate animals such as primitive insects and millipedes. By the end of the Silurian period about 416 million years ago, predatory invertebrates such as scorpions and spiders were feeding on the earlier colonists of land. In 2007 scientists discovered a 390 million year-old fossilised claw of an ancient sea scorpion that showed these creatures are larger than previously thought. The fossils indicated that the scorpion weighed an estimated 400lb and was armed with savage 18-inch claws. At the time of the discovery, Dr Simon Braddy, of the Department of Earth Sciences at Bristol University, said it proved that ancient spiders, insects and crabs would have been giants. ‘We have known for some time that the fossil record yields monster millipedes, scorpions, cockroaches, and dragonflies but we never realised, until now, just how big some of these ancient creepycrawlies were,’ he said.","Gondwana was the more southerly of two supercontinents that existed between approximately 510 to 180 million years ago .

"They were the unseen heroes of the Second World War – the men who risked their lives to help others escape from German prisoner of  war  camps. And none did it for longer than Alfie ‘Bill’ Fripp, an RAF navigator shot down in the first weeks of battle to become a veteran of 12 different camps across Nazi-occupied Europe. His job was to make sure secret consignments of equipment vital for escape were smuggled in under the noses of German guards. Squadron Leader Alfie Fripp, seen at the Zagan camp in 2009, helped 76 PoWs escape . from Stalag Luft III in March 1944. Pictured right, in 1944, Mr Fripp was tasked with collecting Red Cross parcels for the prisoners from a depot in the nearby town, where he ‘liberated’ numerous items to help the tunnelers . 'Always cheerful': Alfie Fripp, pictured second left with fellow PoWs (l-r) Andrew Wiseman, Frank Stone and Reg Clever on a visit to Stalag Luft III camp in Poland in 2009, has died aged 98 . Thus, you could often find Alfie . starting a heated argument or engineering some administrative . catastrophe to create the distraction necessary to secure and hide a . code-marked Red Cross parcel. In nearly six years behind barbed wire . – through starvation, disease and Hitler’s programme of mass murder – . his efforts helped countless others to escape and get back into the war. He was one of the backroom boys . involved in preparations for the Great Escape, the mass break-out from . Stalag Luft III portrayed in the 1963 film starring Steve McQueen. But yesterday Squadron Leader Alfred . George Fripp, longest serving and oldest surviving British PoW and last . of the so-called ‘39ers’, finally gave up the fight. He died peacefully . in his sleep at the age of 98. Enlarge . Alfie Fripp, far right, with fellow Prisoners of War. 50 RAF officers were executed by the Gestapo following their escape in 1944 . Pat Jackson, a family friend whose father, Charles Hancock, was held with Sqn Ldr Fripp at Stalag Luft III, described him as one of the 'unsung heroes of the war'. Above, Mr Fripp and Ms Jackson at the Cenotaph last November during the Remembrance Sunday ceremony . Alfie became a ‘39er’ when his . Blenheim bomber was shot down in October 1939. He and surviving crew . members, including pilot Mike Casey, were taken prisoner and shipped . around a series of camps. One of Alfie’s official jobs was to marshal Red Cross aid parcels, a lifeline for prisoners. His unofficial job was to filter out the parcels coded to identify secret contents such as valves for radios or maps. He was relocated from Stalag Luft III . less than two months before the Great Escape, but equipment from those . parcels almost certainly contributed to the operation. To his eternal regret, however, his . friend Mike Casey would be among 50 escapees slaughtered on Hitler’s . orders when they were eventually recaptured. Alfie was shot down over Belgium by the Luftwaffe during a reconnaissance mission. Above, on a return trip to the Zagan PoW camp four years ago . Sqn Ldr Fripp (pictured left in 2011) was transferred out of Stalag Luft III a few months before the mass break-out. He later endured the Long March of 1945, when thousands of PoWs were forced to march in winter from a camp in Zagan in Poland to Spremberg in Germany . He vividly recalled the German guards . telling him the escaped prisoners had been executed and will never . forget the moment they read out Casey’s name from the list. ‘We were determined not to show our anger so we just gave them three cheers,’ he said. Three years ago Alfie, from Bournemouth, returned to the camp for the first time to pay his respects. ‘The most important thing is saying . goodbye to those who died,’ he said at the time. ‘The huts have all gone . but the ghosts of all those boys are here.’ Among the horrors he witnessed were . friends dying slowly of starvation or disease, a prisoner being shot . simply for wandering outside his hut before a dawn curfew was lifted, . and another being machine-gunned to death as he tried to scale a . perimeter fence. Allied airmen sailing model boats in the resevoir at Stalag Luft III  in Zagan . Alfie, who was sent away to train as a . 12-year-old Royal Navy electrical apprentice, failed to graduate . because, at 4ft 10in tall, he was too short by four inches to qualify. Instead, he joined the RAF, which had . no height requirement and where – in every sense – the sky was the . limit. He married his sweetheart Vera Allen just three days after war . was declared on September 3, 1939.

"A man who arrived at Heathrow with a teenage boy was sent back to the US following concerns that he planned to sexually exploit the youngster to tourists during the Olympic Games. Jason Daniel Gandy, 35, arrived at the airport with the 15-year-old boy last Thursday but was immediately stopped by suspicious immigration guards. Following questioning, officials received conflicting statements from the boy, his mother and Gandy and the pair were sent back to the U.S. on separate planes. Horrific: Immigration officials at Heathrow Airport, pictured, sent a man travelling with a teenage boy back to the U.S. following concerns that he planned to sexually exploit the youngster during the Olympic Games . Gandy, a licensed massage therapist, was quizzed in his home city of . Houston and now faces charges of a criminal complaint for transportation . of a minor for a commercial sex act. According to The Baytown Sun, a court heard that Gandy intended to perform massages in London to take advantage of international travellers seeking a 'good time'. Detectives heard the boy had previously performed massages in the nude and masturbated Gandy's clients in Houston. The case follows previous concerns from a number of children's charities about child exploitation during the Olympics. During questioning by detectives in Houston, Gandy told agents that he met the teenager through a mutual friend on Facebook. He said he was aware of how old he was. Worrying: Concerns about child exploitation during the Olympic Games have previously been raised by children's charities . According to court documents, the boy would spend the night with Gandy at least once a week. He also gave him massages during which Gandy would masturbate in the youngster's presence. According to chron.com, the two also masturbated in front of each other on a number of occasions. Gandy runs his own massage parlor from his home and the boy told detectives that he was often asked to help Gandy with massaging his clients - sometimes in the nude. The boy said he was asked to masturbate the clients and they were also allowed to 'fondle' him. Gandy was refused bail and is now being held in jail. Barnardo's previously warned that whenever there is a major event such as the Games, child sexual exploitation can occur. Speaking to The Northern Echo, Anne Marie Carrie, Barnardo’s chief . executive, said: 'We know from the work we do on the ground with children that . the risk of boys and girls being trafficked and sexually exploited . during major events is a very real threat.'

The Financial Ombudsman, which deals with disputes between the public and finance firms, has said it may ask an insurer to pay the claim for a cancelled holiday as long as the policyholder had 'done all they reasonably could to chase the passport application' and had 'put in their passport application in far in advance of the deadlines laid down by the passport office'. In a statement last week it said: 'If they (the holidaymaker) were still unable to travel due to the delays, then we would be looking for the insurer to act in the spirit of the insurance policy.' The development came after the Home Secretary Theresa May announced a raft of measures on Thursday designed to clear the application backlog. She said passport applications would be fast-tracked for free for those who need to travel abroad urgently. In an emergency Commons statement, Mrs May insisted the Government was doing all it could to deal with the backlog of more than 30,000 applications which had not been dealt with within the normal three-week deadline. But there are growing fears that Mrs May's decision to draft in emergency staff to clear the backlog could leave the passport service open to risk. It emerged today that 1,000 passports could be issued to ‘suspect’ overseas applicants because staff are not carrying out standard checks due to the huge backlog at the Passport Office. These documents could be issued within the next fortnight, sources within Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO) claim, despite Home Secretary Theresa May’s vow that security would not be compromised. The security loophole has been exposed after staff in the HMPO’s ‘Special Security Division’ were diverted to help clear up the chaos elsewhere. Shadow immigration minister has called on the Government to make sure that families who missed their holidays through no fault of their own are properly reimbursed . These highly trained officials are usually responsible for carrying out multiple fraud checks on documents sent in with overseas applications. The problem is being compounded by the drafting in of inexperienced staff who are unable to spot suspicious answers on applications and alert the Special Security Division. A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘All hands are being called to the pumps and the Security Division is now like one man and a dog for the rest of the month with the majority of staff transferred to other duties. ‘The Security Division estimates that within the next couple of weeks, because of this panic, there will be at least 1,000 “unsecure” passports issued to “suspect” persons.’ Last week, Theresa May confirmed that responsibility for dealing with applications for passports overseas had switched three months ago from British consulates abroad to an online system based in the UK monitored by HMPO. She said the change was made to provide better value for money and to ensure more ‘consistency’ of service. She stressed that security would not be compromised. But the HMPO source added: ‘At one of the major Passport Office hubs, in Glasgow, they’ve now been lumped with passport applications from every registry throughout the world, which have to be checked, double-checked and triple-checked. The Security Division handles the potentially fraudulent applications and subjects them to rigid scrutiny. ‘There is a template system in place to sift suspicious applications which Passport Office staff have been trained to recognise. ‘But the Government is drafting in inexperienced Border Agency staff to help. The problem is that they will not recognise certain key answers that would alert full-time staff.’ The Security Division was set up after it was discovered ‘bulk’ applications mainly by Eastern European gangsters were being made for British passports and a small number had been processed. Home Secretary Theresa May has vowed that security will not be comprised while the passport application backlog is tackled . As the Glasgow team picked up on the problem, it was decided to base the unit there. Last week, leaked documents from the HMPO revealed a plan to ‘relax’ checks on applications from overseas. The Home Office said it had been ‘unaware’ of the proposed change and ordered the guidelines to be withdrawn. An HMPO spokesman said: ‘Security is our priority and we will not issue a passport until all  necessary checks have been satisfactorily completed.’ Meanwhile, civil servants at HMPO received bonuses worth more than £1.8 million last year, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The bonuses were paid out to thousands of employees for ‘good performance’ at the service, which now has a backlog of 500,000 applications. More than 94 per cent received the ‘in-year’ bonus, supposed to be handed out to staff who have exceeded ‘key business targets’. Sarah Rapson, the former chief executive, received a bonus worth between £5,000 and £10,000 in 2012/13. On Tuesday the current chief executive, Paul Pugh, will go before the Home Affairs Select Committee to face questioning over the crisis. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the committee, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is unbelievable that bonuses have been paid to those who have presided over a service that is now a byword for incompetence.’","Labour call for ministers to force insurance companies to pay out .
