"The Southern Poverty Law Center offered an apology of sorts on Thursday to Dr. Ben Carson, a black potential Republican presidential candiidate, for lumping him in with neo-Nazis, skinheads, and Klansmen on its influential 'Extremist Watch' website. The iconic American civil rights group targeted Carson, a world-renowned retired pediatric neurosurgeon, because he is a Christian who opposes gay marriage. The SPLC has seen its mission creep from defendng the civil rights of African-Americans to embracing a broader target list that includes 'white nationalists, anti-gay zealots, black separatists, racist skinheads, neo-Confederates' and others. 'In October 2014, we posted an ""Extremist File"" of Dr. Ben Carson,' the SPLC wrote in a statement on Thursday. 'This week, as we've come under intense criticism for doing so, we've reviewed our profile and have concluded that it did not meet our standards, so we have taken it down and apologize to Dr. Carson for having posted it.' The mea culpa quickly took on a backhanded quality, however. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ben Carson, a possible 2016 presidential candidate, is making waves in Iowa (shown) and other early primary states – but his right-of-center views have attracted unusual critics including America's most iconic civil rights legal aid group . NO DIFFERENCE? Presidential hopeful Ben Carson appeared until Thursady on the same Southern Poverty Law Center's watch list that includes skinheads and neo-Nazis, because he is a Christian who opposes gay marriage . 'We've also come to the conclusion,' the group added, 'that the question of whether a better-researched profile of Dr. Carson should or should not be included in our ""Extremist Files"" is taking attention from the fact that Dr. Carson has, in fact, made a number of statements that express views that we believe most people would conclude are extreme,' the group added. The bulk of the published statement consisted of a list of those quotes. Carson's attack at the hands of the SPLC was a hot topic of discussion among American conservatives this week as Carson moves closer to announcing a White House run. 'I don't think the left can stand the idea that the next black president might be a Republican,' one U.S. Senate staffer said, requesting anonymity because he is not quthorized to speak to the press. 'And the SPLC is a left-wing group. Don't forget that.' The Southern Poverty Law Center did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier in the week Daily Mail Online asked Carson if he thought the SPLC was 'crooked' in its dealings with Republicans. 'Oh, definitely,' he replied. 'And I – certainly that's been the impression of everybody I've heard from.' 'I find it very ironic that they would castigate someone as a hater whose entire professional career was spent saving people's lives,' he said. Carson described a scholarship program he has endowed, and literacy projects he has set up 'specifically in poor areas, so that kids can learn the love of reading, which will have a profound impact on their academic performance.' 'But because I don't agree with them about traditional marriage, I'm a ""hater"",' he mused. 'And that's pretty interesting that someone could come away with that belief.' David Duke (left), founded the Louisiana Ku Klux Klan and later ran for governor of Louisiana; the SPLC lists him on its 'Extremist Watch' website . Carson first attracted national notice in 2013 when he chastized President Barack Obama from a few feet away at the speaker's podium during that year's National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C. 'Obamacare,' Carson said, 'is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.' 'In a way, it is slavery,' he added then. His political positions are wrapped tightly in his Christianity, including opposition to gay marriage and a preference for a flat income tax rate that would affect everyone equally. 'When I pick up by Bible, you know what I see?' he asked the prayer breakfast audience. 'I see the first individual in the universe, God, and he’s given us a system. It’s called a tithe.' Tithing is an institution that calls for Christians to donate a flat 10 per cent of their earnings to the church where they worship. But it's speaking against same-sex unions that has put him on the hot seat, and may endanger his chances of emerging as a serious presidential contender outside America's Bible belt. HORROR: Floyd Corkins entered the conservative Family Research Council's office in 2012 with a gun and shot a security guard, later saying he meant to kill as many people as he could; he got the idea from the SPLC's 'Extremist Watch' website . 'If we can redefine marriage as between two men or two women or any other way based on social pressures as opposed to between a man and a woman,' he wrote in his 2012 book America The Beautiful, 'we will continue to redefine it in any way that we wish, which is a slippery slope with a disastrous ending.' More dramatically, he said during a 2013 Fox News hannel interview that 'traditional' marriage is 'a well-established pillar of society and no group – be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality – it doesn’t matter what they are, they don’t get to change the definition.' NAMBLA, the North American Man/Boy Love Association, advocates for the normalization of pedophilia in society. The Southern Poverty Law Center had cited those examples as evidence that Carson belongs on the same list as white nationalists and antisemites. Days after the Fox interview, he admitted on CNN that his comments were 'somewhat insensitive, and I certainly apologize if I offended anyone.' 'I have always advocated equality for everyone,' Carson insisted. 'As a Christian, we have a duty to love everyone and to love them as ourselves. You know, I love gay people. I love straight people.' On Monday Carson told Daily Mail Online that 'when embracing traditional Christian values is equated to hatred, we are approaching the stage where wrong is called right and right is called wrong.' 'It is absolutely critical for us to once again advocate true tolerance in this world where freedom of speech is closely guarded. That means being respectful to all of those with whom we disagree, as well as allowing people to live according to their values without harassment.' BAD COMPANY: The Southern Poverty Law Center listed Ben Carson as an 'extremist' alongside former KKK National Imperial Wizard Jeff Berry (left) and White Aryan Resistance founder Tom Metzger (right) RACE POLITICS: Malik Zulu Shabazz (left), head of the New Black Panther Party, has attracted the SPLC's attention but is one of only a few African-Americans on the same 'extremist' list that featured Carson . 'It is nothing but projectionist and ignorant,' Carson said, 'when groups label certain people with whom they disagree as haters. Said behavior is truly uncouth and should be viewed as such.' Placing an individual or organization on a high-profile, credible list of extremists can have unintended consequences. In August 2012 a gunman namex Floyd Lee Corkins entered the Family Research Council's headquarters in Washington in an attempt – as he later explained – 'to kill as many people as possible' Corkins shot a security guard before he was disarmed. He chose his target from the SPLC's 'Hate Map' web page – a geographic guide to its extremist list. The Family Resarch Council, like Carson, landed on the site because it opposes gay marriage. Putting Carson on a list along with former Klan leader David Duke and skinhead Eric 'The Butcher' Fairburn wasn't the first time the organization dabbled in national electoral politics. In 2011 it included Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul on a list titled 'Electoral Extremism: 23 Candidates on the Radical Right,' listing 'Right-wing libertarian' as his 'EXTREMIST IDEOLOGY.' Cornell Law School professor William Jacobson, wrote Friday that 'the Southern Poverty Law Center ceased long ago to be a neutral source of information.' The SPLC did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The group's controversial spokesman Mark Potok did speak to the left-wing website Talking Points Memo, however. NO ARGUMENT: Holocaust denier Ernst Zuendel is on the SPLC's list for producing publications titled 'The Hitler We Loved and Why' and 'Did Six Million Really Die?' 'Our criticism of him was based in large part on his very extreme rhetoric about the evils of gay people,' Potok said. 'He says that any criticism he makes is always kind and never meant to destroy the person, but then he says that gay marriage will lead to the destruction of America much in the same way the Roman Empire collapsed.' In February 2014 Potok claimed on CNN that 'anti-black attitudes among American whites have gone up quite significantly between 2008 and 2012, to the point where now more than half of white Americans have these anti-black attitudes.' SPLC's latest nonprofit income tax return shows that its assets totaled more than $314 million at the end of October 2014. More than $3 million of its income between 1999 and 2008 came from the Picower Foundation, whose founder Jeffry Picower earned billions – and later had to forfeit the money – from convicted scammer Bernie Madoff's investment frauds.","SPLC started as a civil rights legal aid charity but has since placed conservatives of many stripes in its crosshairs .

"Director Kevin Smith has landed in hot water for sharing on social media a heart-breaking photo showing him cradling the body of his dying dog Mulder. The 44-year-old filmmaker and actor posted a message on Facebook Wednesday morning telling his fans that his faithful 17-year-old dog, Mulder, was sick and nearing the end. Hours later Smith posted the sad news that his Mulder, 'My Buddy-Man' had passed away, writing, 'Thank you for 17 years of sheer joy and affection. It took a dog like you to make me a better person.' Last goodbye: Director Kevin Smith shared this touching image of him embracing the body of his very sick dog, Mulder, on his social media accounts Wednesday . Target of criticism: The director of Clerks and Tusk was called out by some Reddit users for allegedly trying to draw attention to himself by sharing the photo . In an earlier post, Smith had outlined the deep love he had for his dog and how he took him everywhere with him after the 17-year-old pooch's health began to fail. ‘As I've spent the last year carrying him around like Hodor,’ Smith wrote, referring to a character from Game of Thrones, ‘I'm not taking this terribly well. 'They never tell you when you get a dog, but there is a price to pay for being the recipient of 17 years of unconditional love, loyalty and companionship: they take a huge chunk of your heart with them when they go.’ He then added: ‘Mulder was beyond worth it. F***, this hurts...’ At around 1pm on Wednesday, the director of cult film Clerks and the recent horror flick Tusk, posted an update announcing the passing of his four-legged companion. Clearing up any misconception that the earlier picture was taken after Mulder had passed away, Smith revealed in a later Facebook update that he was holding his dog in the picture to reduce his suffering as he reached the end. 'He was still fighting to stay above ground - which is why I'm holding him on his back (he couldn't breath laying on his sides or his stomach anymore). We didn't take any pics of him after he was gone,' wrote Smith on Wednesday. The moving tribute to the pet has been shared on Facebook more than 13,370 times as of Wednesday night, and counting. Smith also posted the image on his Twitter and Instagram accounts. More than 40,000 Facebook users left comments on Smith’s wall expressing their condolences on his loss, many of them sharing photos of the pets they had lost. Family man: Smith, pictured here with his daughter (left) and wife, actress Jennifer Schwalbach Smith (right), explained on social media that he decided to share the image because he was grieving and wanted to unload his emotional burden . Loyal friend: Mulder, named after a character in the show X-Files, died at age 17. Smith said he had spend the last year carrying him around . Menagerie: The filmmaker also has a Dachshund named Shecky and a brown lab named Louis . Military veteran Jason Ray wrote: ‘I'm very sorry sir. My military working dog passed away recently. I understand what you're going through. I know I'm just some dude on Facebook but if there is anything I can do to help just say the word. His name is Doki. I'm not trying to take away from your post at all. Just offering my support.’ Another user Jamie Blanche said: ‘I know exactly what you're going through. I had to put my Sam down last September. He was my best pal for 14 years and he died of cancer of the bladder.’ Not everyone, however, was on board with Kevin Smith’s decision to share his grief with the world. In a later post on his account, the Los Angeles-based filmmaker, who is married with a grown daughter, explained that someone posted his photo with Mulder on Reddit ‘without the relevant text,’ prompting some users to call him out for being an ‘attention-whore.’ The director, who is known for keeping in touch with his fan base, responded to the accusation by saying that he took to social media to announce the death of his dog in part to unload the emotional burden. Outpouring of support: The moving tribute to the pet has been shared on Facebook more than 13,370 times as of Wednesday night and has drawn tens of thousands of comments from users expressing their sympathies . ‘This wasn't about look at ME - this was about look at HIM. And based on the amount of likes and comments the posting drew, I don't think the image came across to the intended audience as in poor taste. The grieving dog owner went on to say that he can see how someone could misconstrue his post as a cry for attention, but he insisted that it was not his intent. ‘I was in pain and I just wanted to hear from people who knew that distinct pain of losing a dog. And I'm glad I did, because I got to read some amazing stories people posted about the lives and deaths of their pets. ‘It was therapeutic for me. We don't really do wakes and funerals for our pets, so we usually miss that important step of the grieving process: grieving with others, sharing stories about the departed.’ Smith, the creator of the fictional characters Jay and Silent Bob, also has a Dachshund named Shecky and a large brown lab named Louis. Mulder’s companion Scully, a yellow Labrador, passed away at age 14 in 2012.","Kevin Smith shared image of him embracing the body of his dying dog, Mulder, on his social media accounts Wednesday .

"Thousands of mourners today gathered to say farewell to the three young students gunned down near the University of North Carolina. Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his new wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were allegedly shot execution-style by a neighbor at the couple's apartment in Chapel Hill on Tuesday afternoon. On Thursday, mourners embraced each other as they gathered on athletic fields across from the Islamic Association of Raleigh, one of the city's largest mosques. Funeral services had been planned at the mosque, where the families have been longtime members, but were moved to the fields after crowds of 5,000 were expected. The fields are owned by North Carolina State University, from where two of the victims had graduated and one was a student. Scroll down for video .

Friends and family paid tribute to the trio at a candle-lit vigil on Wednesday, and earlier on Thursday, relatives viewed the victims' bodies in a small building apart from the mosque. The service began after midday Muslim prayers. A man facing east sang an opening prayer. Mohammad Abu-Salha, the father of Yusor and Razan, walked to the field with Deah's sobbing father, Namee Barakat, before delivering the funeral prayer. As Dr Abu-Salha addressed the crowd, he asked for a federal investigation into the shooting. 'I call upon the President of the United States, Barack Obama... please involve the FBI. Please investigate,' he pleaded. 'This has hate crime written all over it.' He went on: 'We're not sad. We have peace inside. We are not seeking petty revenge. Our children are much more valuable than any revenge. We care about acknowledging this the way it is.' At the service's conclusion, about a dozen people carried each of the three caskets away to hearses, which headed to the Islamic Association of Raleigh's Muslim cemetery in Wendell, where they will be buried.

Police rushed to the condos in Chapel Hill on Tuesday afternoon after neighbors called 911 to report the sounds of gunshots followed by screams and more gunshots - then silence. A few hours later, 46-year-old Craig Hicks - a married paralegal student and a former car parts salesman - turned himself in to authorities. He has now been transferred from a county jail in Durham, to the state prison in Raleigh because of security concerns, prison authorities said. He is being held without bail. The killings are fueling outrage among people who blame anti-Muslim rhetoric for hate crimes. Hicks made regular posts on social media slamming religion and its followers, and referring to himself as an 'anti-theist'. On Wednesday, neighbors said he always seemed angry and confrontational, while his ex-wife said he showed 'no compassion at all' for other people. But his wife Karen Hicks insisted that the deaths came after a long-standing parking dispute and said he often championed equality for others. The women's father, Mohammad Abu-Salha, said police told him each was shot in the head in the couple's apartment and that he's convinced it was a hate crime. Victims: From left, Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were all found with bullet wounds to their heads inside the Chapel Hill apartment on Tuesday . 'The media here bombards the American citizen with Islamic, Islamic, Islamic terrorism and makes people here scared of us and hate us and want us out. So if somebody has any conflict with you, and they already hate you, you get a bullet in the head,' said Abu-Salha, a psychiatrist. A Muslim advocacy organization also pressed authorities to investigate possible religious bias. Many posted social media updates with the hashtag #MuslimLivesMatter. 'We understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated, and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case,' Chapel Hill police Chief Chris Blue said in an email. Chapel Hill Police asked the FBI for help in their probe, and Ripley Rand, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, said his office was monitoring the investigation. Police said that the young couple's neighbor Craig Hicks, a self-proclaimed 'anti-theist', carried out the killings after a long-standing parking dispute but the victims' families believe it was a hate crime.

"The tiniest flaws in software can enable cyber criminals to hack your bank account or take control of your phone or computer. Now Google has issued an ultimatum to its rivals - including Microsoft and Apple - telling them to patch their software vulnerabilities, or it will make them public within 90 days. The search giant’s move has ruffled feathers, but Google claims it is designed to protect consumers from fast-moving cyber criminals and President Obama is calling for a collaborative response. Google has issued an ultimatum to its rivals, telling them to patch their software vulnerabilities, or it will make them public within 90 days, it has been reported. The company's logo is shown . The Palo-Alto based company assembled a crack team of hackers and programmers called Project Zero in July to trawl its own – and its competitors – software for security flaws and give companies a deadline to fix them, Financial Post reported. But some critics claim that’s a job for a neutral body. For example, John Dickson, a principal with software security company Denim Group Ltd. in San Antonio said: ‘I’m not sure who made Google the official referee of the marketplace for vulnerability notification. He added that pressuring companies to fix flaws is a good idea, but ‘what noble motives they [Google] had in mind could be called into question given the fact that they essentially outed vulnerabilities for two of their biggest rivals.’ Tomorrow, President Obama will visit Google to call on companies to work together and share information to thwart cyber crooks. Google's Project Zero team's intention is to protect consumers from fast-moving cyber criminals (illustrated witha  stock image) by pressuring software providers to fix flaws quickly . Google’s crack team of hackers and researchers were assembled in July after the Heartbleed bug hit the headlines. A blog post announcing the team, says: ‘You should be able to use the Web without fear that a criminal or state-sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer, steal secrets or monitor your communications. ‘Our objective is to significantly reduce the number of people harmed by targeted attacks.’ Analysis suggests that the project so far has identified 39 vulnerabilities in Apple software and 20 in Microsoft software as well as 37 in Adobe products. Last year, it took firms an average of 205 days to learn hackers had infiltrated their networks, cybersecurity firm FireEye said. Craig Young, a senior security researcher with Tripwire, said that it may be hard for large companies to create a fix within 90 days, but sometimes a flaw is neglected for years. He said that so far, flaws published by Project Zero have not been serious. But many experts are wondering how an industry-wide programme could work, given that the major players are struggling to work together. MailOnline has approached Microsoft and Apple for comment, with Microsoft pointing towards a blog post written in January for its response. Opponents of Google’s Project Zero say it could damage online security by pointing out flaws before they are fixed, effectively drawing cyber criminals' attention to code to exploit. An anonymous source told Financial Post that Apple begged Google not to publicise three flaws in the Mac OS X operating system in January. The search giant reportedly went ahead, despite knowing a fix was on its way from Apple. Similarly, Microsoft revealed it asked for two extra days to fix a Windows flaw, but Google publicised the bug. Chris Betz, senior director of Microsoft’s Security Response Centre, wrote in a blog post in January: ‘The decision feels less like principles and more like a “gotcha,” with customers the ones who may suffer as a result.’ ‘What’s right for Google is not always right for customers. We urge Google to make protection of customers our collective primary goal. ‘ . Microsoft argues that it’s best for researchers to privately tell software providers about software flaws so a fix can be developed before the problem is widely known about. Mr Betz wrote: ‘Those in favour of full, public disclosure believe that this method pushes software vendors to fix vulnerabilities more quickly and makes customers develop and take actions to protect themselves. We disagree. ‘Releasing information absent context or a stated path to further protections, unduly pressures an already complicated technical environment. Microsoft revealed it asked for two extra days to fix a Windows flaw, but Google publicised the bug. A stock image of the operating system is shown. Chris Betz, of Microsoft wrote in a blog post: ‘The decision feels less like principles and more like a “gotcha,” with customers the ones who may suffer as a result’ ‘It is necessary to fully assess the potential vulnerability, design and evaluate against the broader threat landscape, and issue a “fix” before it is disclosed to the public, including those who would use the vulnerability to orchestrate an attack. We are in this latter camp.’ Mr Betz said that Microsoft believes in coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD). ‘This is a time for security researchers and software companies to come together and not stand divided over important protection strategies, such as the disclosure of vulnerabilities and the remediation of them.,’ he said. ‘Policies and approaches that limit or ignore that partnership do not benefit the researchers, the software vendors, or our customers. It is a zero sum game where all parties end up injured.’ Google’s supporters say its approach could lead to fixes being developed more quickly and Tom Gorup, a manager with Rook Security in Indianapolis says it’s good for the industry. ‘If we have huge companies like Microsoft, Apple and Google going at each other and pushing for better security, it’s a win across the board,’ he said.","Google claims its move is designed to protect consumers from criminals .

"Ukraine asked Britain for military support last night amid growing fears that Russia is set to launch a fresh land grab in Eastern Europe. The embattled nation’s security chief Andriy Parubiy called for joint military exercises with the United States and Britain to deter Russia from seizing the rest of Eastern Ukraine. He said Ukraine will hold manoeuvres with the two Western nations following the annexation of Crimea. Ukraine has said it will hold military manouevres with the U.S. and Britain. Pictured, a Ukranian officer (left) leaves the navy southern headquarters base in Novoozerne after it was taken by the Russian forces . The Ministry of Defence said Britain ‘routinely’ holds military exercises with Ukraine. Planning is going ahead for one exercise - codenamed Rapid Trident 14 - to be held near Lviv, close to the Polish border in western Ukraine, in July. An MoD insider said: ‘This is nothing to do with the current situation in Ukraine and it is not an exercise in, “Right, let’s go and practice battering the Russians"".' The news of the joint exercises emerged as Ukraine announced it was drawing up plans to withdraw its soldiers and their families from Crimea following the storming of its naval bases by pro-Russian froces. Mr Parubiy said he wanted to move them ‘quickly and effciently’ to mainland Ukraine. Immediately after the Sevastopol base was seized heavily-armed men wearing unmarked uniforms began guarding it. Alexsandr Vitko, commander of Moscow’s Black Sea fleet, later strode in to cheers from the crowd. Ukraine demanded the release of Admiral Serhiy Hayduk, its navy chief, who was reported to have been detained in the incident. ‘There was nothing we could do,’ said a Ukrainian officer. ‘Everything happened spontaneously.’ As Ukrainian troops started leaving in civilian clothing a self-appointed spokesman for the pro-Russian militia, Igor Yeskin, said raids on other military bases would continue because ‘the Ukrainian military is on the territory of the Russian Federation’. At least one other base was seized as Russia tightened the noose following President Putin’s annexation of Crimea. A few hours earlier a confrontation between Ukrainian soldiers and pro-Russian militia left two dead in the Crimean capital Simferopol – the first military blood spilt in the three-week conflict. Ukrainian (left) and Russian (right) officers shake hands in front of the Ukrainian base in Perevalnoe prior to negotiations . Any involvement in military activities now will be seen as sucking Britain deeper into the crisis. The Mail understands defence chiefs have also put a squadron of ground troops on standby for operations in the Baltic States as tensions escalate. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond revealed this week the UK had offered RAF Typhoon fighter jets to support NATO air policing over Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The RAF’s has put 120 troops serving with the RAF Regiment’s 2 Squadron on high readiness to deploy with the Typhoons to provide ‘airfield protection’ on foreign airfields. Russia yesterday threatened to retaliate with sanctions of its own after the EU and US slapped travel bans and asset freezes on senior Russian politicians and military figures involved in the seizure of Crimea. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said: ‘We are looking at a broad range of responsive measures. Ukrainian Coast Guard vessels are docked in the Black Sea port of Odessa March 19, 2014. Ukraine's border guard service announced that all its vessels have left Crimea, and Crimea's naval ports are now under the control of Russian forces, according to local media . 'There is also the possibility of passing asymmetrical measures, that means steps which, let’s say won’t go unnoticed in Washington.’ David Cameron said Britain would lead calls for tougher sanctions when he attends a Brussels summit of the 28 European Union leaders on Thursday. The Prime Minister told the Commons the Crimean referendum had been 'spatchcocked' together in the space of 10 days 'at the point of a Russian Kalashnikov' - and called for Russia to be kicked out of the G8 group of nations. He added: 'I also think we should be responding to the fact of this annexation. We said that if there was further action to destabilise the Ukraine, and this annexation is that action, further consequences need to follow.’ On Friday, Mr Cameron will call on fellow EU leaders to draw up plans for greater energy security in Europe. Britain has circulated a document in Brussels calling for greater diversity of supply to ‘reduce the dependency on Russian energy’. On the home front, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned the Ukraine crisis could harm the UK economy if the situation deteriorated, with the potential for commodity price increases affecting industry and increasing inflation. Russia's Constitutional Court ruled unanimously on March 19 that Russia's President Vladimir Putin acted legally by signing a treaty to make Crimea part of Russia . The Treasury’s Budget Red Book said the crisis was a 'significant new risk' to the economic recovery and 'any further deterioration is likely to have some impact on the UK'. In documents released alongside the Budget, the OBR said: ‘If the situation escalates or continues for a prolonged period, there is a risk of higher commodity prices affecting inflation and output growth.’ Last night the Prime Minister spoke on the telephone to German Chancellor Angela Merkel to agree a strategy for the summit today. A No 10 spokesman said: ‘They reiterated that Sunday’s referendum in Crimea and Russia’s subsequent actions to annex Crimea are both illegal and agreed that the EU should impose further consequences on Russia, building on the travel bans and asset freezes agreed by European foreign ministers on Monday.’ But Whitehall sources suggested that the EU response will stop short of the swingeing economic sanctions that might hit the Putin regime in its pockets. Withdrawal: Ukrainian soldiers fold the Ukrainian flag, which was removed by a Crimean pro- Russian self-defense force at the Ukrainian Navy headquarters in Sevastopol, Crimea . With fears that Russia could grab more territory, US vice president Joe Biden sought to reassure the three ex-Soviet Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia that the US will defend any NATO member against aggression. 'We’re in this with you, together,' he said in Vilnius, amid jitters in three countries overrun by Stalin during the Second World War which only won their freedom with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Accusing Russia of a ‘land grab’, Mr Biden said Russia was on a 'dark path' to isolation. 'We stand resolutely with our Baltic allies in support of the Ukrainian people and against Russian aggression,' he added. But Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite warned him Vladimir Putin’s annexing of Crimea showed 'the use of brute force to redraw the map of Europe', adding: 'This situation is a direct threat to our regional security.' Kiev inhabitants pass an improvised monument dedicated to the victims of the Maidan movement, near Independence Square . This came amid reports of FSB secret services agents flooding into Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Moscow region of ex-Soviet state Moldova which shares a border with Ukraine. In recent days the leadership of the region - where Russian troops are believed to be on the ground - has signaled their wish to be integrated into Russia, like Crimea. The Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov, meanwhile, openly urged the Kremlin to go deeper into Ukraine to 'protect' ethnic Russians. 'The surge in patriotism we are witnessing in Crimea and Russia, which has united everyone irrespective of political views, convictions and political parties, shall spread farther, into southeastern Ukraine,' he said. Russians in these areas 'have fixed their eyes on us, they are hopeful and they expect our support and assistance. People truly need this,' he insisted. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he was 'deeply concerned' over the spiraling crisis and urged all sides to 'take all possible steps to avoid further escalation', while Nikolai Petrov, professor at the Higher Economic School in Moscow, forecast 'a new Cold War'.","Security chief Andriy Parubiy says nations will work together to deter Russia .

"A 17st teenager is desperate for a gastric band operation on the NHS because cruel taunts about he weight mean she has 'no social life'. Brooke Walker, 15, gained weight after eating a diet of junk food as a child, and has now lost her confidence after years of being bullied at school. Despite trying to eat healthily in her teenage years, she claims she simply cannot shed the pounds. She says a gastric band operation would allow her to 'live a normal life', as her obesity has meant she has missed out on being a teenager. Battle: Brooke Walker, 15, gained weight after eating a diet of junk food as a child and now weighs 17st. She is desperate for a gastric band operation which she claims would allow her to 'live a normal life' Appearing on ITV's This Morning, she said: 'I spent all my childhood and teenage years being fat - and it's probably going to go on into my twenties. 'My size is stopping me from living a normal life. 'People care about your appearance. You walk into a room, they look at you and they judge you. 'They don't want to get to know you for your personality.' Brooke's story comes after a U.S. report out today argued obesity should be regarded as a chronic disease with biological causes, that can't be cured through diet and exercise. Previously, experts have argued that weight loss surgery should be offered to more people as it would save the NHS money in the long term, at a time when obesity-related costs are spiralling. Brooke said she began gaining weight at seven years old, when she didn't understand concepts like calories and healthy eating. She said: 'When I was younger I would eat chips, pizza, fast food stuff. Curry cheesy chips, I would have them a lot. 'I wasn't going out and burning off the food I ate. Calorie intake wasn't explained to me. I was seven, I was a child. 'Now, it's completely different. I have breakfast lunch and dinner - and small portions. 'Now I would have cereal for breakfast, lunch, a soup or sandwich - it depends each day.' Plight: Appearing on ITV's This Morning, she said: 'I spent all my childhood and teenage years being fat - and it's probably going to go on into my twenties' Brooke has since moved in with her grandmother, who encouraged healthy eating, exercise and smaller portion sizes. After this change in lifestyle she was losing weight and enjoyed the feeling, so started skipping entire meals to see a quicker result. She said: 'I noticed the weight coming off me. I started lose more weight when I missed meals. 'I stopped eating breakfast. I stopped eating lunch at school because I didn't like eating in front of people. I was worried about what people were saying.' Brooke says she was bullied at school, and told presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley she had 'no social life'. Her grandmother, Pat, said the bullying affects the whole family. She said: 'It does put a big impact on the family life when Brooke is being bullied, because obviously Brooke takes it out on the ones closest to her. 'So Brooke could be fine, very happy, then she gets a remark off social media, and the whole house could be flipped upside down because Brooke is upset, go off to her room, be withdrawn. 'She finds it hard to talk about what's being said.' After years of embarrassment, gastric band operation would allow her to live normally and enjoy her twenties. She said: 'If I get a gastric band, it's not a quick fix. 'It'll be beneficial in the long run, because the weight is coming off you so you can watch what you're eating. 'Also, soon I'll start to like the way I look and I'll feel confident enough so I'll start feel comfortable going out in public by myself and make friends.' Brooke's story comes after scientists today argued in a new report that exercise and diet are not enough to lose weight when people are obese. The mantra 'eat less and move more' might help obese people shed pounds in the short term, but most put the weight straight back on, they warn. Doctors need to regard obesity as a chronic disease with largely biological causes that cannot be cured through diet and exercise alone, the US specialists added. Sharing: Despite trying to eat healthily in her teenage years, Brooke claims she simply can't shed the pounds . Dieting triggers several biological systems that drive us to eat high-calorie foods and gain weight – a hangover from when humans needed to store fat to survive in times of scarcity. And according to the four experts, writing in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology journal, these biological reasons are why obese people often fail to maintain long-term weight loss. Lead author Dr Christopher Ochner, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said lifestyle changes do not appear capable of overriding this fat-loss defence in most patients. ‘Although lifestyle modifications may result in lasting weight loss in overweight individuals, in those with chronic obesity bodyweight seems to become biologically defended,’ he said. ‘Therefore, the current advice to eat less and exercise more may be no more effective for most obese individuals than a recommendation to avoid sharp objects for someone bleeding profusely.’ Tam Fry, chair of the National Obesity Forum, broadly agreed with the report's findings. Losing battle: Brooke's story comes after scientists today argued in a new report that exercise and diet are not enough to lose weight when people are obese . He told This Morning: 'He's been too blunt to say you shouldn't eat well and exercise. 'Even for those people who have the fat gene, they still need to watch what they're eating and start exercising. 'He is correct that you get to such a size that perhaps that's not the whole story so they need to go off on to something else.' He said he agreed Brooke should be given the gastric band operation on the NHS, saying it could be 'the game changer' for her. Option: Some experts, such as Dr Christian Jessen, say more people should be given NHS gastric band surgery  because 'it makes economic sense' He said: 'The operation should be the last resort. You should go through the healthy lifestyle steps first. But for people like Brooke, who have been through that, it's got to be the operation by choice. 'The NICE guidelines are too stringent. They demand you should be a certain size, and particularly for children. We should be thinking carefully about what we offer children.' He added that after having the surgery, Brooke would have to stick to a diet and exercise plan, and should be offered psychiatric help to guide her through the drastic change in eating habits. His comments echo those of other experts, who argue more people should be given gastric band surgery on the NHS because 'it makes economic sense'. Dr Christian Jessen, presenter of Channel 4's Weighing Up The Enemy, estimates treating obesity and the associated health problems costs the NHS around £6 billion every year. Experts appearing on the programme argued offering gastric band surgery to more patients could save the health service money. The cost of the initial bariatric surgery would be recouped by the savings in medications, carers, and the cost of treating obesity-related conditions, they said. The NHS Choices website reveals gastric band operations cost between £5,000 and £8,000 at private clinics. And gastric bypass surgery costs the NHS between £9,500 to £15,000. Last year 8,000 overweight patients were given weight loss surgery on the NHS. But that is less than one per cent of those people who could benefit, they said. However, they warned bariatric surgery is not without risks. Complications include internal bleeding, respiratory problems and post-operative infections.","Brooke Walker gained weight after eating a diet of junk food as a child .

"Bob Karlstrand, who is battling colon cancer and terminal lung disease, is giving away all his possessions before he dies . Veteran Bob Karlstrand has only months to live. The 65-year-old is battling colon cancer and terminal lung disease and fears he won’t make it to his next birthday. But the former staff sergeant, from Maple Grove, Minnesota, has one final mission before he dies: to give away everything he owns, including his home of 38 years. His only stipulation is that his home goes to a fellow veteran. Mr Karlstrand, who retired from an insurance firm, never married or had children and is an only child. So he has already given most of his belongings, including his furniture, photographs and letters he wrote to his mother – and has given his $1million retirement fund to the nursing school at his alma mater, the University of Minnesota. He says he had people come into his home and take whatever they wanted. ‘In the end, it’s only material things,’ he told TV station KARE 11. ‘I’ve had a good life so I can’t complain at all,’ he said. He has given the responsibility of finding new occupants for his home to Habitat for Humanity. When Mr Karlstrand dies, they will refurbish the property, then find and help a veteran and his family move in. He has already given most of his belongings away and donated his $1million retirement fund to the nursing school at the University of Minnesota . 'I wanted to give back to the veterans if I could,' he added. Mr Karlstrand enlisted at the age of 17 in 1967 and worked as an administrative specialist for the Field Maintenance Squadron at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia. He was then deployed to Thailand in July 1969 and spent a year supporting B-52s in missions over Vietnam. He took part in the Air Force’s back-to-school program and was released from service early to attend the University of Minnesota’s business school, graduating in 1973. ‘I have no family so everything I own would have to go somewhere,’ he told Military Times. ‘Like they say, ""You can't take it with you."" I was hoping that I could do all of this a little later, but it is not going to work that way.’ The 65-year-old, who never married and has no children, wants his home of 38 years to go to a fellow veteran .","Bob Karlstrand is battling colon cancer and terminal lung disease .

"Expedia announced on Thursday that it is is buying rival online travel site Orbitz - for approximately $1.33 billion. The hefty purchase adds to the stable of brands that Expedia has snapped up recently in order to extend its reach and keep pace in the fiercely competitive travel-booking industry. Expedia's acquisition of Orbitz is its second major deal in the past month as the industry continues to consolidate. The company announced the $280 million acquisition of another rival, Travelocity, in late January - and also follows Expedia's July announcement that it was buying Wotif.com for $658 million. By bringing Orbitz into the fold, Expedia gains access to the Orbitz namesake brand, as well as brands like CheapTickets and HotelClub. Expedia's portfolio already consists of nearly a dozen brands, such as Hotels.com and Hotwire. Big purchase: Expedia announced on Thursday, Feb. 12, 2015, that it is buying rival online travel site Orbitz for approximately $1.33 billion. The deal comes less than a month after Expedia announced the $280 million acquisition of another rival, Travelocity. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) Speculation swirled last month that Orbitz may be bought, when a media report said that the company was considering selling itself. An Orbitz spokesman declined to comment at the time. Expedia, based in Bellevue, Washington, said Thursday that it will pay $12 per share, a 25 percent premium to Orbitz' closing price of $9.62 Wednesday. Shares of Orbitz Worldwide Inc., based in Chicago, soared $2.05, or 21.3 percent, to $11.67 in morning trading. Expedia's stock surged $9.23, or 11.8 percent, to $87.45. Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said during a conference call that Orbitz was an attractive acquisition option in part because of its highly recognized brands and loyal customers. Expedia also likes Orbitz' loyalty program, with plans to invest in it and grow it further. Khosrowshahi, along with Chief Financial Officer Mark Okerstrom, said that the deal will help Expedia better compete for customers in a sector that is constantly seeing new players emerge. 'We believe Orbitz can add to scale and add to our ability to run a more efficient machine,' Khosrowshahi said. Okerstrom said that these types of acquisitions are important, as it provides a way to avoid being overtaken by rivals like Google and TripAdvisor. The Expedia executives said that they are very optimistic they won't run into any major resistance from regulators on the Orbitz deal, with Khosrowshahi noting that consolidation is natural in a highly fragmented marketplace. Rival no more: The boards of both Expedia and Orbitz have approved the deal, but it still requires a nod from the majority of Orbitz shareholders . In a joint statement published on both companies' websites, Khosrowshahi said 'We are attracted to the Orbitz Worldwide business because of its strong brands and impressive team. This acquisition will allow us to deliver best-in-class experiences to an even wider set of travelers all over the world. 'From the flagship Orbitz.com brand, to other well-known consumer brands such as CheapTickets, ebookers and HotelClub and the business-to-business brands Orbitz Partner Network and Orbitz for Business, the Orbitz Worldwide team has built a devoted customer base and we look forward to welcoming them to the Expedia, Inc. family.' Orbitz CEO Barney Harford, meanwhile, said in the statement 'Our mission at Orbitz Worldwide has been to build our brands to be the world's most rewarding places to plan and purchase travel. 'We're excited for Orbitz Worldwide to join the Expedia, Inc. family and for our teams to work together to further enhance the offerings we provide to our customers and partners.' Expedia is also up against competitors like Priceline Group, which owns sites like Priceline, Booking.com, Kayak and OpenTable. And there are new pressures from sites like airfare search Hipmunk and last-minute deal site HotelTonight. The boards of both companies have approved the deal, but it still requires a nod from the majority of Orbitz shareholders. Expedia, which anticipates $75 million in savings from the buyout, said it is currently unable to project when the transaction will close.","Expedia announced on Thursday that it is is buying rival online travel site Orbitz - for approximately $1.33 billion .

"Kent's police and crime commissioner Ann Barnes, who started her £85,000-a-year post in November 2012, spent thousands on PR consultants . Kent's gaffe-prone police and crime commissioner who had to apologise after making a 'toe-curling' appearance on a 'disaster' TV documentary has used £16,000 of taxpayers' money to pay for media training, it has emerged. Ann Barnes, who started her £85,000-a-year post in November 2012, spent thousands on PR consultants who were hired to give the force communications advice to improve its 'brand'. It has also emerged that £2,400 was spent providing media training for youth commissioner Kerry Boyd, who was twice suspended after admitting having an affair with a Tory councillor more than twice her age. The revelation is the latest embarrassment for the embattled crime tsar after a string of controversies under her watch. This year, she was forced to apologise after being filmed saying she had 'no idea' what her taxpayer-funded job entailed - a storm which culminated in a rented plane flying over Maidstone, where she works, dragging a banner reading '#annbarnesout - resign'. Her tenure has also included the resignation of her foul-mouthed youth commissioner - the first appointed in Britain - Paris Brown, who had to stand down after sending a series of controversial tweets about her sex life, violence, drinking binges and drugs. According to the Kent Messenger, invoices published by the commissioner’s office under transparency regulations show one company was paid nearly £14,000 to provide recommendations on how to improve the force's 'brand' so it was better engaged with the public. It says PR firm Finn Communications was paid £11,590 for work in June 2014, having previously been paid £2,146 in January last year for 'briefing and recommendations on communications consultancy project'. The commissioner also paid £2,228 to consumer research company The Buzzz for work in October 2014. A further £1,450 was paid to a company called DWP for 'media advice' while £3,370 was spent on providing staff with Freedom of Information advice. But Mrs Barnes was quick to defend the bill, saying it was important 'to get an independent view on the communications being provided by Kent police'. In a statement, she said: 'I am committed to providing value for money for services that the public pay for. 'I believe it was important to get an independent view on the communications being provided by Kent Police and I was pleased to see recognition for the wealth of information being issued through various channels.' The amount of money spent on media training is the latest embarrassment for the embattled crime tsar (pictured) after a string of controversies under her watch since she took the post in November 2012 . Last year, the commissioner was forced to make a public apology in the aftermath of a fly-on-the-wall Channel 4 documentary broadcast last May, which was branded a 'disaster from start to finish'. In Channel 4's Meet The Police Commissioner, she was compared to David Brent and accused of making Kent Police a 'laughing stock'. The next month, she was forced to appear before the Kent and Medway Police Panel, who scrutinise her role, where she admitted what an embarrassment the show had been - but refused to resign. The documentary had showed Mrs Barnes travelling in a van she dubs 'Ann Force 1' and bringing her dogs into the office. In one clip Mrs Barnes was seen drawing an onion in an attempt to explain what types of crime Kent Police prioritises. But when asked what the rings meant she said: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.' She was then asked: 'So what would be an example of the kind of crime on the outside of that ring?', to which she replies that she had 'no idea'. The controversial crime tsar spent more than £2,000 on media training for Kent's youth commissioner Kerry Boyd (right), who was suspended twice after admitting having an affair with a Tory councillor twice her age . Mrs Barnes, who is paid £85,000 per year, with Britain's first youth crime commissioner Paris Brown, then 17 . She was also asked: 'What is a police commissioner?' to which she replied: 'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner.' She later said: 'It's a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no actual job description.' She was also filmed painting her 'flaky' nails and compared the force to a tin of paint that she wanted to 'prise' open. Mrs Barnes was also criticised for spending nearly £200,000 on moving her office when her force was trying to make cuts of £20million a year . The other huge scandal to have marked her tenure was the resignation of youth commissioner Paris Brown, who was investigated by the force after posting controversial comments about her sex life, violence, drinking binges and drugs. The teenager, who had been appointed to the £15,000-a-year taxpayer-funded position just one week earlier, was forced to resign following a tearful apology about her behaviour. Brown's successor Kerry Boyd, 20, was then suspended twice after admitting having a relationship with a married former Tory councillor more than twice her age, Robert Burgess, 50. Mrs Barnes was also criticised for spending nearly £200,000 on moving her office less than two miles at a time when her force was trying to make cuts of £20million a year. She is also due to be quizzed over a car crash five months ago, amid claims she was uninsured and hindered the investigation. Ms Barnes crashed her Mercedes soft-top into another car before hitting a tree as she drove to a meeting and has been facing an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) inquiry. But she has still not been interviewed following the incident in September last year. Barnes was uninjured in the collision in Dartford, Kent, but on Twitter she admitted 'not feeling too bright' afterwards. An IPCC spokesman previously said: 'The IPCC is investigating whether the police and crime commissioner for Kent, Ann Barnes, may have committed a criminal offence by not having in place appropriate insurance to cover business use of her own car when she was involved in a road traffic accident on 16 September 2014. 'The investigation will also determine how long the relevant insurance was not in place, if that is the case, and how many miles the PCC travelled on business use while uninsured. 'The IPCC is also investigating whether a police constable was obstructed in the execution of their duty when initial inquiries into the PCC's insurance cover were being made by Kent Police.'","Controversial Ann Barnes hired PR consultants to improve her own 'brand'

"A social services department allowed a convicted paedophile unrestricted access to a five-year-old girl and failed to tell her mother about his past. The troubled social services department at Norfolk County Council has been accused of placing the child at risk as they allegedly knew the man was allowed to care for the girl alone but did not warn her mother about his history. The case came to light after MPs and foster carers called for an investigation into claims the department has wrongly removed dozens of children from their carers. The troubled social services department at Norfolk County Council (headquarters pictured) has been accused of placing a child at risk by failing to prevent the convicted paedophile from having access to the girl . Minutes from a meeting show the girl sat on the paedophile's lap in the presence of a social worker on April 10 last year - two weeks before police were forced to intervene after he disappeared with her. The allegation is the latest to hit Norfolk Children's Services after Ofsted raised concerns about child protection in the county. A senior Government social work adviser who worked on the Baby P case has been drafted in to help turn the department around. The girl's mother, who lived in Great Yarmouth at the time, said: 'They failed me, they put my daughter at risk and I want some kind of justice.' The paedophile - whose crimes were described as 'lamentable' by a judge at the time - was placed on the sex offenders register for life in 2008 for attacks on girls as young as seven over a period of two decades. He re-established contact with the girl's mother, who he was related to but had not seen for decades, in February last year. She insists she had no knowledge of his sex abuse past and says that he initially seemed to be playing a positive role in the family's life. North Norfolk MP Norman Lamb (pictured left) and West Norfolk MP Henry Bellingham (right) have said they have both been contacted by people in similar positions and suspect this incident is not an isolated case . But the woman alleges the man sexually assaulted her on April 25 before taking her daughter on a shopping trip alone. She phoned social services and was told to call the police immediately. Officers tracked him down after about an hour and established the girl had not been harmed. Two days after this incident social workers revealed his history of abuse to the girl's mother - she claims they told her she must have been aware. A council spokesman said that the girl was not subject to a child protection plan at the time, although documents show she was classed as a less serious 'child in need'. He added: 'It is disappointing that when he was present during a meeting at the mother's home, we didn't put two and two together and realise that he was a convicted paedophile. 'No concerns were raised about him by the mother or anyone else at that meeting, and it was not thought necessary to check the background of a visitor. 'Once the level of risk became clear we acted quickly to ensure the child's safety. Fortunately, we have no reason to believe that the girl was harmed during the time he was with the family.' The social worker involved has since left their job. The girl was initially taken into temporary care then never returned as social workers claim the mother should have known about the risk. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is seeking new legal representation to reopen the case. Police are investigating her claims of sexual assault. The girl's mother said: 'They all knew he was in our lives because I was over moon and telling everybody. 'They're supposed to check on anybody who comes into my life and has access to my daughter - at no point did they tell me he was a sex offender or warn me about him. 'When they intervened, it was too late and I feel very lucky my daughter wasn't harmed. 'I've lost my daughter and I don't want this to happen to other mothers.' In a separate case one of the department's team managers has been suspended over allegations he removed a child from a foster carer without evidence of deliberate harm. The Norfolk Foster Carers' Association (NFCA) said it had been contacted by dozens of parents and foster parents making similar claims. West Norfolk MP Henry Bellingham and North Norfolk MP Norman Lamb said they had been contacted by people in similar positions and suspected it was not an isolated case. Norfolk County Council said it was aware of concerns which are being 'investigated thoroughly and carefully'. In a further statement released late this afternoon, a Norfolk County Council spokesman said: 'In this instance the mother had invited a man back into her life in February 2014. 'He had previously been jailed for serious sexual offences against children. 'At the meeting in question, called to consider the child's behaviour and welfare, no concerns were raised by the mother. 'The agency social worker (who no longer works for Norfolk County Council) regrettably took that introduction at face value. 'Our current practice would expect a more proactive and diligent approach to be taken than occurred in this instance. 'It was not until two weeks later, when the mother lodged a serious complaint against the man that his background became clear. 'It became apparent that he had been on the scene for several weeks, and during that time there were instances that should have given cause for concern to the mother. 'This matter is now the subject of a police investigation and we are unable to comment further at this time.' The council last week announced that troubleshooter Mark Gurrey - who was parachuted into Haringey Council after the death of Baby P - had been appointed to work with existing managers and the Department of Education to help improve services.","Norfolk County Council's social workers knew the man was a paedophile .

"Her bizarre New Age views on topics such as reincarnation and UFOs have often left the public baffled. Now Shirley MacLaine has provoked widespread fury by claiming the victims of the Holocaust may have brought their fate upon themselves. The veteran Hollywood actress suggests the six million Jews and millions of others systematically murdered in Hitler’s death camps in the 1940s were ‘balancing their karma’ for crimes committed in past lives. She also suggests that cosmologist Professor Stephen Hawking may have subconsciously given himself his debilitating motor neurone disease. Really, Shirley? Actress Shirley MacLaine has been denounced by Jewish campaigners and other activists after suggesting that the millions of victims of Nazi death camps may have needed to balance their karma . Miss MacLaine’s comments, in a recently published book, were attacked last night by Jewish campaigners and other activists as offensive and wrong. In her memoir, the 80-year-old, who won an Oscar for Terms Of Endearment, writes: ‘What if most Holocaust victims were balancing their karma from ages before, when they were Roman soldiers putting Christians to death, the Crusaders who murdered millions in the name of Christianity, soldiers with Hannibal, or those who stormed across the Near East with Alexander? The energy of killing is endless and will be experienced by the killer and the killee.’ A spokesman for the Community Security Trust, which campaigns against anti-Semitism, said: ‘The first impressions are that these comments will offend and bemuse many Jews – and many other people too.’ In her book What If..., Miss MacLaine, who was raised a Baptist but is well known for her unconventional views on reincarnation and alien life, suggests Professor Hawking had subconsciously brought his crippling medical condition on himself. She says he may have created his illness in order to ‘free his mind’ from the needs of his body, so he could focus completely on his scientific research. 'Balancing their karma': Jewish women and children at Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. Miss MacLaine suggested they may have been Roman soldiers in their previous incarnations . Miss MacLaine, who has previously insisted that she lived on Atlantis in an earlier life, claims to be friends with the scientist, whose life inspired the award-winning film The Theory Of Everything, starring Eddie Redmayne. Her book – subtitled A Lifetime Of Questions, Speculations, Reasonable Guesses And A Few Things I Know For Sure – poses the question: ‘Did he “create” the disease that has crippled him in order to learn to be dependent on caregivers and the kindness of strangers so that he could free his entire mind to the pursuit of knowledge? ‘Did he “create” the disease that has crippled him?' asks Miss MacLaine of the disabled cosmologist Stephen Hawking, pictured with Eddie Redmayne . ‘What if he inadvertently chose to set an example of himself to show the rest of us that cosmic travel and universal understanding are available, regardless of one’s physical condition or circumstance? 'If Jesus chose to die in a state of martyrdom, then Stephen Hawking could just as readily have chosen to live in a dual state of being: visibly physical weakness and unseen knowledge and power. What if all reality is an illusion?’ Her views were branded ‘utterly ridiculous’ by disability charity Scope, while a spokesman for Disability Rights UK added: ‘She obviously has some very confused ideas that a lot of disabled people will be baffled by. 'It’s completely wrong to say people choose their disabilities, especially Professor Stephen Hawking, who has a genetic condition.’ Miss MacLaine, who played Lady Grantham’s American mother in Downton Abbey, writes that she is recognised more for her part in the ITV drama than for any of her film roles. She also suggests that she felt so at home on the set because she may have lived in the 1920s during a past life. Representatives for Miss MacLaine declined to comment last night.","She also suggests Stephen Hawking gave himself motor neurone disease .

"'Lovely character': Schoolboy Daniel Spargo-Mabbs was just 16 when he died after taking ecstasy at a warehouse rave . The heartbroken father of a teenager who died at a rave after taking a lethal dose of ecstasy today told an inquest of his ‘unspeakable’ loss. Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, 16, fell unconscious after taking a lethal dose of the Class A party drug with his friends at a warehouse party in Hayes, west London. The teenager and his friends had clubbed together to buy £80 worth of the drug, and were supplied by Nicqueel Pitrora on January 17 last year. Known as ‘Shampz’ to the schoolboys, Pitrora, 19, was a regular dealer to children and used their payments to supplement his benefits . On their way to the rave, Daniel and four friends  met a man on a bike who handed them three bags of white powder after the deal had been arranged with Pitrora. Four of the boys, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, dissolved the drug in 100ml bottles of water while using public transport to reach Silverdale Industrial Estate for the rave. But Daniel sprinkled around half a gramme of the crystalline powder into 500ml of water and drank it in one go once inside the warehouse. Shortly afterwards, the teenager took his shirt off, became animated about his girlfriend and started to dance. But by 4am, his temperature had soared and he collapsed to the ground. Daniel was rushed to nearby Hillingdon hospital by paramedics but nothing could be done to save him. His multi-organ failure became so severe that doctors considered lower limb amputation, but by the morning of January 20, doctors admitted their attempts at helping Daniel were becoming more and more futile. After consultation with Daniel’s family, a decision was made to turn off his life support machine and he was pronounced dead at 2.36pm at King’s College Hospital, where he had been transferred. His devastated father Tim today told West London Coroner’s Court that the Daniel Spargo-Mabbs Foundation had been set up in his memory to educate young people about the dangers of taking illegal drugs. Mr Spargo-Mabbs said: ‘We have seen the sort of hole a death like this leaves - we have lived it for a year. ‘And in response all we can find to do is offer ourselves in the service of the charitable foundation trying to prevent this happening to any other family.’ Mr Spargo-Mabbs said his son had led ‘such a good life’ and was a ‘lovely and outrageous character.’ He added: ‘He had a lot to teach me about how to live life well and take every opportunity, and to have a laugh in almost every situation. ‘There is no verbalising the loss we all feel and no end to the pain that his death leaves us with. ‘What there is, however, is the determination shared by his family, school, friends and church, to prevent this happening to anybody else, and that is the best we can pray for now.’ He added his ‘undying thanks’ to all those who had treated Daniel and supported the family. Popular: The teenager and four friends had taken the Class A drug on their way to the rave in Hayes, west London, but Daniel collapsed whilst dancing . Fun: Daniel's devastated father Tim said his son had taught him 'about how to live life well and take every opportunity, and to have a laugh in almost every situation' Popular Daniel was a member of Amnesty International and was known to run errands for pensioners on his paper round. Coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe recorded his death as multi-organ failure and MDMA toxicity, which was ‘wholly in keeping’ with taking the drug. She said: ‘The tragic facts are that this is a young man, a teenager, who has attended a rave on the 17/18 January 2014. ‘He has taken MDMA - we know that this was a dose that was fatal. ‘He was found in a semi-collapsed state and taken by ambulance first to the Hillingdon Hospital. ‘The doctors, the nurses, the healthcare professionals tried in order to pull out every single stop to save him.’ Supplier: Nicqueel Pitrora was jailed for five years for supplying class A drugs last August . Pitrora, of London Road, Croydon, was jailed for five years in August last year for supplying Class A drugs. Ms Ormond-Walshe went on to praise both hospitals and the police for all their work. She said a desperate last attempt was made to transfer him to Kings College to save him, and doctors used the ‘most aggressive therapy’ available. She added: ‘He just could not be saved - he was too ill. The amount of MDMA in his blood was a fatal level, and that was the problem. ‘He was a fit and well 16-year-old who collapsed at a rave in a warehouse at the back of an industrial estate after having taken MDMA. ‘I have been very, very impressed with not only how courageous and positive the family have been but how much dignity the family have had after Daniel’s death, and how they have turned it into positive thinking in these devastating circumstances. ‘I have also been very impressed by what they are doing in relation to the Daniel Spargo-Mabbs Foundation. ‘It is such an insightful and positive and realistic notion that the family are taking forward. ‘I am minded to write an open letter to the foundation setting out some of the facts of Daniel’s case and how much I support the education of teenagers in relation to illegal drugs.'","Daniel Spargo-Mabbs died after taking drug in January last year .

Ukrainian defence ministry officials later confirmed to Fox News that a second man had been shot. Earlier in the day, forces in the annexed Crimea region were in defiant mood, and had backed a lorry . against the entrance to stop advancing forces. The forces seemed unconcerned by the Russian troops surrounding the base earlier as they celebrated the nuptials of their young comrades. New bride, medic Galina Volosyanchik, could be seen holding a bouquet of flowers, and walked hand-in-hand through the compound with her husband Ivan Benera, a communications officer. Just hours later the gates would be forced open by an armoured vehicles, as soldiers flooded in and demanded surrender. There were scenes of panic and chaos . as people did not know whether soldiers were shooting at others or just . firing warning shots.

Armed men, believed to be Russian servicemen, gather on a hill near the military base . Ukrainian servicemen were also seen disembarking a third ship, the . Ternopil corvette.

Jay Beatty of Armagh had captured the hearts of football fans everywhere after he was plucked from the crowd by former Hoops striker Georgios Samaras to join in last year's title winning celebrations. And last month, the fan known as 'Wee Jay' was given a day he will never forget after he was invited to the Celtic's match against Hamilton at New Douglas Park on January 19. Jay had given his beloved team a pre-match team talk before scoring a half-time goal on the pitch to rapturous applause. Scroll down for video . 11-year-old Jay Beatty celebrates after scoring during a half-time penalty shootout challenge between his favourite team Celtics and Hamilton . Thousands have watched the incredible moment when the youngster steps up to take the kick and manages to get it past the keeper and hit the back of the net. The delighted Jay then celebrates with a victory lap as fans from both team went wild. The 11-year-old and his goal have now been entered into the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) Goal of the Month competition where he faces stiff competition from the likes of Celtic's Mikael Lustig, Aberdeen's David Goodwillie and Partick Thistle's Kris Doolan. Despite losing 2-0, Hamilton had the good grace to include Beatty's strike in their final score, announcing it as 3-0 to Celtic on Twitter. Since Samaras picked him out of the crowd during Celtic's title-winning celebrations, Jay has become a household name among football fans, and was even taken to the World Cup in Brazil last summer by the Greece national team after making friends with   his favourite striker. Known as 'Wee Jay', he strikes the ball during half-time of Celtic's 2-0 defeat of Hamilton on January 19 . The youngster, who has Down's syndrome, proudly shows off his medal while being held by his father . The Celtic superfan gives Samaras a hug as he joins in the title winning celebrations . Samaras, who has since left the club and currently plays for Saudi side Al Hilal on loan, said: 'This boy gives me so much strength, it's incredible.' 'There are no words. I feel his love so much. This love I feel is also felt by many people in Greece.' Last month he was invited to be a VIP guest at the Hamilton Accies v Celtic Premiership match where he scored a goal in front of thousands of fans. The Irish Independent reported that Hamilton later told Jay that his goal stood and the final scoreline was 3-0 to Celtic. Fans at the game reportedly began chanting 'We love you Jay, we do' and 'There's only one Jay Beatty' after his incredible goal. His father told the Scotsma:  'Today was something else and to have a whole stadium including the Hamilton fans chanting your son's name will live with me forever. 'Because of his love of the greatest club in the world, his life has become a dream come true. We thought 2014 was just amazing but today was something else.' The Celtic superfan is handed the ball by Hamilton's Vice-Chairman Ronnie MacDonald . The 11-year-old was given a rapturous welcome by both sets of supporters at the match . The Celtic fan received a trophy for 'Sports human feat' on behalf of Georgios Samaras at the Grand Gala of El Mundo Deportivo . And his fans have also been showing their support on social media. Gerry Glesga wrote on Twitter: 'Wee Jay is an inspiration to all Hoops fans, #TrueCelticSpirit' While Joanne Jenkinson added the youngster had 'definitely got to be the top contender' to win the Goal of the Month with Phil McDonough ‏adding 'this needs to happen.' On Facebook his football skills have received high praise with Lauren Burton writing: 'Awww, that's amazing! What a goal! What a bhoy!' Craig Douglas added: 'Stuff dreams are made of Martin Beatty, by the looks of it the wee fella will be adding a goal of the month gong to his collection of goodies.' And Joe Harty wrote: 'On you go jay Bhoy.' Celtic star Georgios Samaras (left) is put through his paces at training by young fan Jay Beatty .

"Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman told councillor Karen Danczuk she was 'far too pretty to be interested in politics' and should join a girl band instead. Miss Harman allegedly made the remarks after being introduced to Mrs Danczuk for the first time. It comes after the Labour shadow minister was accused of 'patronising' women after unveiling a bright pink women-only mini bus to attract female voters ahead of the election in May. Scroll down for video . Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman told MP's wife Karen Danczuk she was 'far too pretty to be interested in politics' and should join a girl band instead . Mrs Danczuk, whose husband is the Labour MP Simon Danczuk, said Miss Harman's pink battle bus exposed politicians' failure to listen seriously to voters' concerns. She said: 'What women voters want from politicians is their concerns heard in a serious manner. Not a patronising pink bus screaming drama queen!' Mrs Danczuk later added: 'When I first met Harriet Harman she said I was far too pretty to be interested in politics & should be in Girls Aloud.' She told MailOnline: 'It was at a conference in Manchester. I wanted a photo with her and she said ""you're far too pretty to be in politics"". I suppose I've proved her wrong - I did go on to be a councillor.' But Miss Harman this afternoon rejected the allegation. She said: 'I deny I ever said that and it’s inconceivable I would have ever said that. 'I have always believed it’s what you do in politics, not what you look like. I have never discouraged a woman from getting involved in politics on the basis of their looks.' The allegation sparked fresh accusations that Mrs Harman was belittling female voters. Labour's 'woman-to-woman' campaign tour got off to a rocky start in Stevenage yesterday when an angry voter told her it was 'patronising and wrong' to divide men and women. Asda shopper Bobby Smith demanded to know if Labour was planning to also have a blue man to appeal to male voters . Mrs Danczuk said Labour's pink battle van – which has been dubbed the Harriet's Barbie bus – exposed MPs' failure to listen seriously to voters' concerns . In a bizarre twist in gender politics, Ms Harman revealed the party had even held 'doctrinal discussions' about whether a man is allowed to drive the Woman to Woman bus as it tours marginal seats. Yesterday it had a woman driver. The minibus, funded by the Unite union, will tour 70 marginal seats in the run-up to the election on May 7, with female Labour MPs, councillors and trade unionists on board. Labour said it will visit school gates, shopping centres and high streets. Miss Harman's tour received a mixed response yesterday. Nicola Dinnage from Stevenage, said: 'I think it's silly and I think it's patronising.' Her sister, Kirsty Dinnage, added: 'Them using a pink bus wouldn't make me vote.' Beverley Gould from Knebworth said it is 'very patronising', adding that she does not think the pink bus will make any difference to female voting numbers. But other shoppers disagreed, with Beb Metcalfe, from Welwyn, saying the colour of the bus 'doesn't matter'. Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman yesterday unveiled the pink, 16-seat minibus in Stevenage ahead of its tour 70 marginal seats in the run-up to the election . Ms Harman posed in front of the van with Labour MPs including (left to right) Sharon Hodgson, Gloria de Piero, Caroline Flint and Lucy Powell . However, Miss Harman has spent the day denying it is patronising because it 'doesn't have big eyelashes on the front'. She told Sky News: 'It's not about a colour it's about something, it's about our democracy. It's a small bus but big issues.' The Labour bus has sparked a storm of criticism, and has been repeatedly likened to a Barbie vehicle . Ahead of the bus's official unveiling, Miss Harman said that 'ultimately' the colour choice was hers it had to be 'eye-catching' because there is a 'big hole in our democratic politics at the moment'. She insisted that the bus would help to address political disengagement amongst women. But critics said the pink obsession makes it look like something from an advert for women-only insurance firm Shelia's Wheels . Ms Harman chatted with shoppers in the Stevenage branch of Asda, but many felt the van was patronising . Twitter parody account mocked up Harriet Harmnan, Glora de Piero and Lucy Powell in a Shelia's Wheels ad . This mocked up photo refers to the child abuse scandal in Labour-run Rotherham where young girls were repeatedly groomed . The use of a pink van sparked comparisons to when Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry was accused of sneering after she tweeted a picture of a white van outside a house with England flags hanging from the women. Last week shadow education spokesman Tristram Hunt got into hot water after appearing to criticise nuns as teachers . After a difficult week of criticism from business leaders who used to back Labour, Ed Miliband might be glad to have the support of Barbie . Senior Labour MPs tried to defend the colour, insisting it was actually 'magenta' and had been used at party conferences in the past. A Labour source joked: 'We modelled it on the colour that David Cameron's face goes when he gets cross during Prime Minister's Question time.' But the Prime Minister mocked the bus in the Commons yesterday: 'What Britain's families need to get on most of all is the security of a good school place, and we are providing them, the security of a good job, and we are providing them, and the security of a safe community, and we are providing them. 'I have to say Labour's campaign - I would say the wheels are falling off the wagon but I think the wheels are falling off the bus. 'We now know it is not going to be driven by anyone on the front bench, surprise, surprise it is going to be driven by Unite.' Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman defended the party's women-only pink minibus, insisting it would be 'looking great . Ms Harman was challenged on ITV's Good Morning Britain about why everyone was talking about the colour of the bus and not important election issues . Given that Labour's official colour has long been red, it would have made sense – and caused less controversy – if the mini-bus had been red too. But Harriet Harman worried it might have ended up looking like a sandwich delivery firm., . She told journalists: 'We could have had red but that would look like all the other Labour vehicles and we wanted something different. 'Then we wanted a darker red but it looked like Pret a Manger. We wanted it to look conspicuous and therefore obviously a white van was not going to do the job. 'It is a very nice looking bus. It is the correct colour. This is a One Nation Labour colour.' Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Miss Harman said: 'We just wanted an eye catching colour. The reason why it has to be eye-catching is because there is a big hole in our democratic politics at the moment.' She claimed 9.1million women did not vote in the general election in 2010 'because they just don't think that politicians have got any interest in their lives or understand their lives or have got anything to offer to them'. She added: 'In this general election we think it's important that women do think that they have got a chance to have a say and this election is about their future and their daughters and their granddaughters' future.' Lib Dem deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said it was the wrong way to attract female voters. He told the Western Morning News: 'The Barbie bus? It's just a tiny bit condescending because it's bright and pink therefore women relate to it more. 'It's a bit like saying that political parties should drive around in macho red sports cars and blokes across the country will suddenly listen to them. 'It just a slightly patronising way to deal with voters it seems to me.' Tory Caroline Dineage: 'The wheels have come off the Labour bus. Getting Harriet Harman to drive around the country in a pink van to try and attract the female vote is as patronising as it gets. 'This is clearly just another divisive gimmick that the electorate will see through. The launch of Labour's Woman to Woman bus left internet bloggers tickled pink – as the web buzzed with a host of jokes and parodies. One mocked-up an image of deputy leader Harriet Harman, along with MPs Gloria De Piero and Lucy Powell, in a spoof advert for women's car insurer Sheilas' Wheels. The pink theme was also likened to the 2001 film Legally Blonde in a mock film poster declaring: 'Reese Witherspoon Votes Labour this summer.' But one less humorous posting referred to the child grooming scandal which has hit Labour-run Rotherham Council. It showed the back of the bus emblazoned with Miss Harman's face and the large slogan 'Labour looking after women'. Attached to an asterisk underneath, the caption adds: 'Like we did in Rotherham.' Critics also say the pink obsession makes it look like something from an advert for women-only insurance firm Shelia's Wheels .

'I have not in any hoarder situation seen rats running around like children on a playground,' wroker Rafael Buttaravoli told CBS 12. It's still uncertain what will become of the owner. Food is a common obsession of hoarders . Workers discovered the rats after an hour of cleaning food . Neighbors said they could hear the rats in the property . Neighbors said the man only left to buy more food . Sadly, neighbors said it was no surprise. Andrea Perle said: 'I get up early in the morning, I hear them on the roof.' And from Bob Durso: 'He goes out two or three times a day. To the Publix, or Walmart. He comes home with food.' Instead of eating that food he was hoarding all of it. West Palm Beach psychiatrist Dr. Mark Agresti called it a common hoarder practice, often symptomatic of survivalists. 'I don't think he'll be able to stay there,' Agresti said.

"A teenager who allegedly kidnapped and raped a Domino's pizza delivery driver at gunpoint was supposed to be under house arrest and wearing an ankle monitor at the time, authorities have said. Darrion Miles, 17, is facing life in prison after being arrested on eight felony charges including sodomy and robbery following the brutal attack on the female employee in Antioch, California, on Sunday. Police say he approached the 22-year-old with a gun as she drove up to a house in the quiet Blue Bell Circle and told her to get back in the car. He is then believed to have forced her to drive to an undisclosed location where he sexually assaulted her. Scroll down for video . Suspect: Darrion Miles, 17, is facing life in prison after being arrested on eight felony charges including sodomy and robbery charges following the brutal attack on the female employee in Antioch, California, on Sunday. He is being tried as an adult because of the 'serious nature' his crimes . Apprehended: The teenager was arrested a short time after the alleged victim called the police . Miles, who was wearing the GPS tracker for violating probation following a fight last summer, then made the victim drive him home half a mile away before she called the police. The teenager was arrested and booked into jail a short time after the incident, according to East County Today. Contra Costa County prosecutors are charging him as an adult because of the 'serious nature of his crimes' and he is currently being held on $6.4million bail. Authorities have said they will be able to pinpoint his exact location at the time of the attack using the ankle monitor. Darrion Earl Miles, the boy's father, insists his son is innocent. He told KRON News his son does not have a gun and believes there was consensual sex between the pair. He added the boy would not have had time to drive from his home and attack the woman in the time frame that has been reported. 'My son said he didn't do nothing and I'm going to believe him until they prove otherwise,' he said. Brutal: Police say he approached the 22-year-old with a gun and told her to get back in the car. He then demanded that she drive to an undisclosed location where he sexually assaulted her . Defending his family: Darrion Earl Miles, the boy's father, insists his son is innocent. He has disputed the time frame of the attack reported by police and insists the sex between the pair was consensual . In a separate interview with Bay Area News, the father admitted his son wasn't an angel and brushed off questions about gang-related messages posted on his Facebook page. He added: 'I'm not going to give up hope because we got the best lawyer in the world and His name is God. Until my son is proven guilty, I'm in his corner.' Miles made his first court appearance on Wednesday in a green prison jumpsuit. The judge postponed his arraignment until February 18. Domino's vice president of communications Tim McIntyre told the Daily Mail Online that in his 30 years at the company, he has never experienced a similar incident. In a statement he said: We are shocked and horrified by what happened. We couldn’t conceive of something like this happening, especially on a Sunday morning.

"A woman who installed a £120 covert camera to capture shocking footage of a nurse abusing her 92-year-old mother-in-law has today welcomed new health care guidance into surveillance in care homes. The video below reveals the horrific treatment Bridie Rees suffered at the hands of the person employed to care for her. The 92-year-old was poked, prodded, abused and taunted by staff nurse Faderera Bello. She was subsequently jailed for four months after admitting a count of neglect at Snaresbrook Crown Court in June last year. Mrs Rees's case makes a strong argument in favour of using surveillance cameras to keep a check on elderly relatives in care homes. And today the health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, has published new guidance - a step in the right direction, Mrs Rees's family told MailOnline. Bridie Rees was abused, taunted and poked by staff nurse Faderera Bello at her care home. After complaining to her family and suffering bruises, they installed a £120 covert camera in her room to check on her . Irene Rees, who is married to Bridie's son William, urged other family's to use CCTV to keep an eye on their relatives, adding the practice could also protect staff facing accusations. 'This is a step in the right direction,' Mrs Rees told MailOnline. 'But we need to see it taken a  step further. 'Care homes should be offering families the option of CCTV. I would urge all families to use CCTV. 'If we hadn't installed the camera in Bridie's room she would have continued to face that abuse. 'There is no other way to ensure are kept safe.' Today marks the first time the CQC has published guidance to families regarding the use of cameras in care homes and hospitals. It comes following several high profile incidents where secret devices have been used. 'Recording equipment can be used to monitor a place, a person, a group or an activity to gather information,' the 12-page document states. 'This can be done openly, or it can be done in secret, in which case the people being monitored are unlikely to know that they are being recorded. 'People may use video cameras to do this, but there are many other options available including hidden sound-recording equipment, or motion sensors.' The CQC's chief inspector of adult social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, said: 'We know [the highest care] does not always happen and the anxiety and distress this causes people, either for themselves or a loved one, is simply awful. What they discovered was shocking footage of Bello, who was jailed for four months last June after admitting a count of neglect, poking and slapping Mrs Rees, while also taunting and shouting at her . The family reported Bello and she was dismissed immediately. The video shows her telling Mrs Rees 'Shut up, shut up your mouth. Your children can't do nothing' 'For some, cameras or other forms of surveillance, whether openly used by services or hidden by families, are the answer.' Since staff nurse Bello, 54, from Romford, was jailed last June, Mrs Rees's family have spearheaded an 18,000-signature campaign calling for CCTV cameras in care homes. They went to the Metropolitan Police with their covertly-filmed footage taken at the Mary Seacole Nursing Home in Hoxton, London, in the autumn of 2013. Recording equipment can be used to monitor a place, a person, a group or an activity to gather information,' the 12-page document states. 'This can be done openly, or it can be done in secret, in which case the people being monitored are unlikely to know that they are being recorded. 'People may use video cameras to do this, but there are many other options available including hidden sound-recording equipment, or motion sensors.' The shocking footage showed Bello poking Mrs Rees in the face. She also called her a 'silly woman' and said: 'I can't do anything for you'. 'Bridie was wonderful,' her daughter-in-law Irene Rees, 61, married to her son William, said. 'What happened was terrible.' She told how Bridie, who she had known for 44 years, was 'a rascal' who loved her family, nights at the bingo and girly gossips. 'We got on so well. I felt more like a daughter than a daughter-in-law,' she said. 'She had six children, 30 grandchildren and 56 great-grandchildren. 'We called her ""The Queen"".' The pair spent a lot of time at Mrs Rees's home in Hackney, London, and the family were devastated when the widow suffered a heart attack in May 2012. Mrs Rees senior, died in May last year, at the age of 92. She had been moved to another care home in Stepney, Greater London following the discovery of what Bello was putting her through . Mrs Rees said she would like to all care homes offer families the option of using CCTV, as standard . 'But it wasn't unexpected,' the younger Mrs Rees said. 'She'd been poorly for a while. 'A few months later she suffered another heart attack.' She was treated at Homerton Hospital, Hackney, and the family - including her daughter Veronica Davies - decided upon her release to move her into a care home. They carefully read the CQC reports for homes in the area, settling on the Mary Seacole Home and Bridie moved in around September 2013. 'None of us wanted to move Bridie but she was becoming increasingly ill,' Mrs Rees said. 'She had started to develop dementia, was forgetting things.' The family visited her regularly and within days noticed she was upset and agitated. She was bruised and told her daughter, 'the nurse did it'. 'Bridie told Veronica, ""She punches me… the nurse punches me"",' Mrs Rees said. 'She was really weak at this point and we didn't want to stress her out. 'But we knew she wouldn't lie about being punched.' The family bought a camera off the internet, hid it in a clock and positioned it near her bed. They viewed it a few days later and were horrified by what they say. Mrs Rees said: 'A nurse poked her  in the face, slapped and shouted at Bridie as she cowered. 'I felt sick. ""'You silly woman. I can't do anything for you"", the nurse said. 'Prodding and shoving her, she manhandled poor, tiny Bridie while she screamed and sobbed. '""Shut up, shut up your mouth', the nurse spat. ""Your children can't do nothing"".' The family immediately took the footage to the care home manager and Bello was told to leave the home and subsequently dismissed. Mrs Rees, pictured with her son William. Mr Rees's wife, Irene, urged other families to use cameras to keep an eye on their loved ones in care homes, adding if they hadn't Mrs Rees would have endured her abuse for much longer without the family knowing . Mrs Rees was moved to another care home in Stepney, Greater London, where she was happy. But she died in May last year. Mrs Rees said: 'She was always happy-go-lucky but after what happened, her hair fell out and she was stressed.' She did not live to see Bello jailed. Detective Inspector Ian Fleming, from the Metropolitan Police, said: 'We are committed to safeguarding adults in our community.' Responding to today's guidance from the CQC, care minister Norman Lamb said: 'Cameras have helped to expose terrible cruelty and neglectful care. 'Decisions about using surveillance are extremely difficult - there is always a balance to be struck between protecting people and respecting their right to privacy - but this information will help families to the make the right choice for them. 'We are committed to preventing poor care from happening in the first place and have introduced tougher standards for inspecting care services as well as measures to shut down those that aren't up to scratch.'","Bridie Rees was shouted at and abused by nurse Faderera Bello .

"Last month she flashed an italic A for Abbott tattoo on her back and it seems there are more hidden adornments on the Prime Minister's daughter's body. Frances Abbott has cheekily admitting to having more than just one inking on her body telling Daily Mail Australia: 'I might [have more tattoos] but you won't be seeing them.' Speaking at the Myer Autumn/Winter show in Melbourne on Thursday, the fashion graduate defended her father Tony - who faced rebel backbenchers' bid to call a leadership spill - adding: 'Of course it affects you but he's still doing a great job, which is that of our father.' Daring: Frances Abbott, pictured at the Myer Autumn/Winter show, says she has more than the A tattoo on her back as she praises Australian Prime Minister Tony for 'doing the best job... as our father' Showing off her back art: Frances flashes a glimpse of the tattooed A on her upper back at the Australian Open . Tattoo alert: She was nineteen when she got the inking, on a night out with girls . She went on: 'It always effects you when people you love are slammed in the media, it's not fun, but it's the nature of the beast... It's happened before and will happen again. 'For him, it's how he gets back up from that that will be a measure of his character. We will always support him.' The middle of Mr Abbott's three daughters, Frances, who works as an assistant buyer for the children's department in Myer, revealed the moment she got the A tattoo. She said: 'I got it when I was nineteen, on a night out with friends, mum and dad weren't for it, I said it was going to be small and pretty. 'I know my family name won't be carried on as my father didn't have any sons, so I thought I'm going to get it permanent on my back.' The brunette was not accompanied by her boyfriend Lindsay Smith, who also works for Myer, revealing he was having supper with his family. Prime Minister Tony Abbott with his wife Margie Abbott (second left), and daughters Frances (left), Louise (second right) and Bridget (right) Frances said that just like any daughter she constantly worries about him, despite living in another city they are always in touch . In 2013 she spoke to Who Magazine about the tattoo, explaining her father wasn't too happy about it at first. 'I gave [mum and dad] a warning. I said, ""I am getting one,"" and Dad said, ""You are mutilating your body."" Then I went and got it done and they thought it was pretty.' Earlier this month the garrulous brunette spoke candidly about her relationship with her father, admitting that just like any daughter she constantly worries about him,  despite living in another city they are always in touch. She moved from Sydney to Melbourne to focus on her career and, of course,  her father is based in Canberra. ‘My standard text message is: “You’re doing an amazing job.”’ And he’ll reply: “Thanks angel,”’ she explained to Daily Mail Australia. She also added: ‘I’m always thinking about him, especially with everything that’s happened recently with terrorism.' ‘My standard text message is: “You’re doing an amazing job.”’ And he’ll reply: “Thanks angel,”’ she explained to Daily Mail Australia.

She accepted a 'chairman's scholarship' for her Bachelor of Design course from the Whitehouse Institute of Design, where Liberal supporter Les Taylor sits as chairman on the board of governors. The fashion student studied at the Sydney institute from 2011 to December 2013 and received the award as a result of her 'application and art portfolio', a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said. Mr Abbott had not declared the scholarship on his pecuniary interest register, despite previously declaring other matters relating to his children such as trips, accommodation and tickets to sporting events.

"Three of Britain's biggest aquariums have come under fire for serving fish and chips in their restaurants - despite promoting conservation of marine life. The National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth, The Deep in Hull and Blue Planet Aquarium, Cheshire, all received letters from animal rights charity, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). The letters condemn the popular attractions for serving seafood, comparing it to 'serving monkey nuggets at a zoo'. On the menu: One of the fish dishes advertised at the National Marine Aquarium, Plymouth, Devon - one of the popular attractions that received critical letters from animal rights charity PETA . Under fire: The letter to the National Marine Aquarium, pictured, written by PETA's specialist project manager Dawn Carr, urges the aquariums to switch to fish-free options . But the aquariums have hit back at PETA, claiming the food they serve is all responsibly sourced. The letter, written by PETA's specialist project manager Dawn Carr, urges the aquariums to switch to fish-free options. Writing to the National Marine Aquarium, she said: 'The National Marine Aquarium advertises itself as a place where people can cultivate an understanding of and admiration for sea animals. 'Yet after inviting people to look on these glorious, fascinating animals in awe, it's odd that your cafe then invites people to stick a fork in them. 'Serving fish in an aquarium is like serving monkey nuggets at a zoo.' Peta is calling for the aquarium to take fish off the menu - and suggests the attraction instead serves vegetarian options such as fish-free fish fingers, faux-fish cakes and vegetarian prawns. 'The fact remains that the seafood in your cafes is made from living sea animals who treasured life and were needlessly subjected to pain and fear,' it added. On the menu: The restaurant at The Deep in Hull, East Yorkshire, offers a number of seafood dishes including the 'catch of the day', 'chorizo and smoked cod croquettes' and 'crayfish, tomato, chilli and fetel cocktail' But the aquarium hit back claiming it is pro-sustainable fishing. Dr Gibson, managing director of the National Marine Aquarium, said serving fish doesn't compromise its position as a marine conservation charity. He said: 'We work to educate consumers and our visitors on the importance of eating fish and seafood that has been sourced in a sustainable way, to help nurture a sympathetic understanding of our oceans. 'All fish and seafood served in the aquarium cafe is ethically sourced and MSC compliant. 'We have a robust purchasing policy in place that is proactive in sustainable and seasonal fish, ensuring we maintain the highest levels of sustainable fish sourcing practices possible.' The animal rights charity also wrote to The Deep in Hull, East Yorkshire, who responded by saying it will not be changing its policy. Colin Brown, chief executive of The Deep, said: 'We will be replying to Peta respectfully. 'We don't believe eating fish is wrong but the fish must be from a sustainable source and we are very careful about that. 'Morally, how can you differentiate between selling fish or selling a burger or sausage? To be honest, it is a matter of opinion.' Bosses at Blue Planet Aquarium, in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, also received a letter from PETA. Mimi Bekhechi group director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, wrote: 'Blue Planet Aquarium advertises itself as a place where people can cultivate an understanding of and admiration for sea animals. 'Yet after inviting people to look on these glorious, fascinating animals in awe, it's odd that your restaurant then invites people to stick a fork in them.' Conservation: The shark tank at the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth, one of the country's biggest . She also drew attention to recent Cambridge University research suggesting fish have emotions, feel pain and live in complex social structures. 'Biologists have found that fish develop relationships with each other and grieve when their companions die,' she said. 'Some fish are capable of using tools, while others gather information by eavesdropping. 'These intelligent, sensitive animals are so good-natured that Dr Sylvia Earle, the world's leading marine biologist, has said 'I wouldn't deliberately eat a grouper any more than I'd eat a cocker spaniel'.' Blue Planet has hit back, saying that providing fish to eat is perfectly ethical, as long as they are sustainably sourced. A spokesman said: 'All our fish products are sustainably sourced and caught under the Marine Stewardship Council Licence. 'We have never advocated people not to eat fish. However, we do believe supplying only sustainably sourced fish products in our restaurants and cafés is an ethical approach.'","Aquariums in Plymouth, Hull and Cheshire all received letters from PETA .

"Experts advising ministers on obesity are being paid hundreds of thousands of pounds by the junk food industry, an investigation has found. Key scientists behind policies aimed at encouraging the public to eat a healthier diet have been given vast sums for their research by the likes of Coca Cola, Nestle and Mars. The revelations prompted concerns that ‘cosy deals’ are deterring ministers from enforcing tough limits on sugar and fat. Scandal: Key scientists behind policies aimed at encouraging the public to eat a healthier diet have been given vast sums for their research by the likes of Coca Cola, Nestle and Mars, it has emerged . At the same time, Britons are consuming more calories than ever – proof the Government’s obesity strategy is failing, the report concludes. The average household calorie consumption has risen by 12 per cent since 2006. Sugar rose by 11 per cent and fat by 12 per cent. One in four adults is considered dangerously overweight, and for children the figure is one in five. The Government’s flagship strategy hinges on arrangements with food and drinks firms to voluntarily cut levels of sugar and fat. But this Responsibility Deal policy, introduced in 2011, has been likened to ‘putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank’ by charities, while doctors argue obesity can only be properly tackled if firms are forced by law to make products healthier. The investigation by the BMJ found the scientist overseeing the strategy, Professor Susan Jebb, received £194,652 for a clinical trial by Coca-Cola between 2008 and 2010. The investigation by the BMJ found the scientist overseeing the strategy, Professor Susan Jebb (pictured) received £194,652 for a clinical trial by Coca-Cola between 2008 and 2010 . In total, she has been given £1.37million towards her research since 2004 from firms including Nestle cereals, Sainsbury’s and Unilever, whose brands include Ben & Jerry’s, Magnum and Walls ice cream. Professor Jebb was appointed the Government’s adviser on obesity in 2011 by former health secretary Andrew Lansley, who also disbanded the existing group of experts who had been very critical of the Responsibility Deal. The investigation also found scientists working for the Government’s Human Nutrition Research Unit, which aims to reduce obesity, received funding from the food industry averaging £250,000 a year. They include Dr Ravin Jugdaohsingh who was given £58,248 from Coca-Cola. Dr Aseem Malhotra, a consultant cardiologist and director of campaign group Action On Sugar, said: ‘The public would be appalled to learn that scientists advising them how much sugar to consume have financial ties to the sugar industry. The responsibility deal has been a complete failure.’ Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘It is legislation, not cosy deals, which we need to tackle this crisis.’ But other scientists insisted the food industry did not influence their research nor advice, even if it paid for it. Professor Jebb added: ‘Everything I do, whether in my research or as chair of the responsibility deal, is to try to improve public health.’","Some obesity experts' research received funding from junk food brands .

"A plus size model who once lost seven stone to be industry thin now makes it big as a swimwear model after deciding to put the pounds back on embrace her curves. Eva Believer, 34, who lives in London but is originally from Lithuania, once embarked on a health kick that saw her lose seven stone in eight months. But her resulting health problems made her confidence plummet until she put more than half of the weight back on and moved to the UK. Scroll down for video . Eva Believer, 34, after losing seven stone (left) and after putting half of it back on (right) Now she loves her curves and has entered a beauty pageant exclusively for larger ladies . Once here she signed to a modelling agency and she is now happy to show off her curves. She has even entered a beauty pageant exclusively for larger ladies. The professional pianist, actress and singing teacher - who's a celebrity in Lithuania - said: 'When I was smaller I looked in the mirror and what I saw looked gorgeous but inside I felt dead. 'I had health problems and if I could turn back time I would never lose weight in such an extreme way again. I would try to live healthier and stay more positive about my looks, even it was hard to do. 'Now I feel more confident about myself every day.' Having starred in Lithuania's  most popular daily TV sketch comedy show, Eva was a huge celebrity in her home country and was recognised everywhere she went. But Eva hated her size 24, 18-stone frame, which wasn't accepted in her country. Eva, who starred in a popular daily TV sketch comedy show and wass a huge celebrity in her home country, lost seven stone with free treatments in exchange for promoting an alternative health centre . Eva said: 'In Lithuania it is not acceptable to be that size. They don't even do clothes in sizes like 18 or 20, let alone anything bigger. 'I had to have my clothes made by a seamstress, which isn't always the best option. Not every seamstress knew the specifics of plus-size clothing making, sewing large size bags instead of dresses. 'My friends in Lithuania used to say people shouted abuse at them in the streets. I stopped getting it because I was famous, but I got a lot of abuse before my TV career. 'Most men wouldn't date me because of my weight. Even if he liked me a lot he'd still be ashamed to introduce me to his friends.' While on a TV talk show Eva was approached by a health consultant who offered her free treatments in exchange for promoting an alternative health centre on talk shows and in the press. Eva agreed and went on a strict healthy diet according to her blood group, and had a number of body cleanses and lipomassages. She started losing the weight in September 2004 and in less than a year she had slimmed down to 10st 13lb and a size 8. Eva put almost half of the weight back on, especially when she went on tour with her band . She said: 'In eight months I lost seven stone, but I had treatment on my skin to make sure it stayed taut. 'I looked wonderful and I went on all the shows to talk about my weight loss and I was published on many well-known magazine covers, but it affected my health badly, especially my gall bladder and bile ducts which literally stopped working. 'I had cramps down the right side of my body for 10 years, which made my singing career almost impossible. 'I was studying opera, but the muscle in my vocal cords was very low in tone and I couldn't hit the high notes. 'I was so embarrassed. I could see the reaction in everyone's eyes during my performance, thinking I couldn't sing but I just didn't have any power left and there was nothing I could do. 'Something went wrong, even walking took it out of me and I would have to stop for rests.' And the slim results were not to last. Eva started putting some weight back on in 2006, and finally stopped yo-yo-ing to plateau at her current weight of 15 stone, and she wears a size 18 to 20. When she started going to castings and signed her first contract she couldn't believe it . 'I'm very lucky to do modelling and I always want to work hard to achieve the best results,' she says . She put just over three stone back on - almost half of the weight she originally lost - thanks to her convenience food habits especially when she went on tour with her band. Shortly after, she moved to the UK, where she was shocked by people's positive attitudes. She said: 'In England people I didn't even know would come up to me and say I was gorgeous and pay me compliments, but my confidence was so low I didn't believe them. 'I even went to an audition and the producer took one look at me, twirled me around joking and told me I was beautiful. I told him to get lost because I thought he was laughing at me because my confidence was so low. Now I'm not surprised I didn't get the job. 'When some colleagues suggested I look into modelling I was very sceptical. When I started going to castings and signed my first contract I couldn't believe it. 'It took such a long time to start loving myself, but even now I am very demanding on myself and the people I work with, especially on photo-shoots. I'm very lucky to do modelling and I always want to work hard to achieve the best results I am able to.' Eva has now reached the final of Miss Plus Size International, a competition exclusively for larger ladies. She said: 'I already knew Linda, who runs the competition, from the previous shoots we have done, and I started following her page on Facebook. 'I didn't think I was going to enter and then I had a change of heart and sent off some head shots just before the closing date. 'I am very happy to be where I am now, but I will never stop working on myself as it's so far to go, achieving more and chasing my dreams. 'I can't wait for the Miss Plus Size International finals. It's every woman's dream to at least once wear an amazing evening gown and to get attention on the stage.'

"An emaciated one-year-old sea lion that was probably looking for food was rescued along a major San Francisco boulevard, more than 1,000 feet from the ocean. The young male had dragged himself uphill, through shrubbery and over the busy road before being discovered Wednesday by two motorists,The San Francisco Chronicle reported. A park ranger driving through the area stopped to help and took the animal to the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, where the ranger named him 'Percevero,' which mean perseverance in Latin. An emaciated young sea lion (pictured) that was probably looking for food was rescued along a major boulevard in San Francisco, more than 1,000 feet from the ocean . Officials say the sea lion weighs 28 pounds instead of a normal 80 pounds. Hundreds of sick and starving sea lion pups and yearlings are turning up on California beaches and 1,500 have washed up since 2013. But wildlife officials say it remains unclear what's separating the animals, who should be nursing, from their mothers. Spokesperson for the Marine Mammal Center, Yvette Koth, said:'These pups come in very underweight and malnourished. 'Just in the last 10 days we've gotten 100 pups in. Normally during this time of the year, we should see any lion pups at all because they should be nursing in the Channel Islands.' Some researchers believe this might be happening due to fish moving further from sea lion breeding grounds - causing mothers to abandon their offspring to look for food.","The sea lion weighed 28 pounds instead of a normal 80 pounds .

"A former escort and transsexual is hoping to find the man of her dreams this Valentine's Day having already bedded over 100 men in just two years on her search. Tiffany Davies, 23, was born male and says that despite her luck in the bedroom, she is struggling to bag a Valentine's date. Tiffany, from Birmingham, grew up as a boy called Niall. She says that she knew from the age of 12 that she was a transsexual after using the internet to search her symptoms. Tiffany Davies grew up as a boy called Niall (left) but knew from a young age she was transsexual, she has started taking female hormones and is due to have a full sex change and hopes this will help her find a man . Although Tiffany is yet to undergo a full sex change operation she has made progress on her journey thus far and says that she now receives plenty of male attention. Tiffany is an aspiring glamour model and feels that it is this self-confidence and appearance that has bagged her so many men in the past two years. However, despite proving popular with men Tiffany says that she will be spending February 14 alone. 'I'm desperate for a Valentine's date this year. I'll have a microwave ready meal for one but I want to be wined and dined like other women.' Tiffany added that she thinks she has a lot to offer a man as she puts a lot of effort into her appearance, she says unlike a lot of other women. 'I'm probably a lot more glamorous than most real women, I love doing my make-up, wearing fake eye lashes and curling my long brown hair. Tiffany has bedded over 100 men in the past two years but is on the hunt for a husband . Tiffany says she receives plenty of attention from men in bars and she says she thinks that this down to the fact that she makes a lot of effort with her appearance and is more glamorous than most women . Tiffany says that despite her success in the bedroom she will be spending Valentine's day alone this year . 'Jealous girls will sometimes laugh and stare at me in the street but I don't care, I know I look great and that's all that matters. 'I find men always shower me in compliments on nights out, they love my womanly frame and big bum.' Tiffany hopes that her by having a full sex change it will be easier for her to find a man . Tiffany is hoping to undergo a breast enlargement later this year, something she feels will help her bag a boyfriend. 'I can't wait to have big boobs, I feel that it will help me attract even more attention from men on nights out.' Tiffany says that her looks have become so convincing that a lot of the time men will approach her not realising she is transitioning. 'I love it when men don't realise I'm a transsexual, I do always tell them when they're chatting me up but often they won't even care that I still have all my male parts.' Tiffany has previously used her good looks to her advantage working as a professional escort which saw her take on many partners. 'I did escorting for a while and I have bedded around 100 men but I rarely do that any more.' Tiffany, who is currently unemployed, has high hopes of getting married one day and once her full gender transition is complete, she feels her luck in love will change. 'I want a husband who spoils me when I'm transitioned. 'I have no problem getting men into my bedroom but I find it hard holding down a relationship. 'The operation will be funded by the NHS but I have chosen to pay for my boob job myself when I save up enough money.' Her hormones have aided her transformation to become a woman, and as she watched her body change, she was over the moon to see her womanly shape appear. 'My frame is naturally small but instead of feeling like a nerdy boy with no shape, my bum has grown huge. 'I love my bum, especially when I'm out with friends, I always try and wear dresses that emphasise it. 'Men always compliment my figure, I'm so thankful to the hormone treatment as they make me feel so feminine.' Tiffany uses web cams to talk to men intimately online and says that she finds this a more convenient way to find possible dates. 'I often chat to men online as it's an easy way to meet new people and start new relationships. 'I'm hoping to meet the man of my dreams one day but I don't think I'll be going on a Valentine's Day date this year.'","Tiffany Davies, 23, was born a boy called Niall but is currently transitioning .

"Amanda Knox has become engaged to a 27-year-old musician who  wrote to her while she was in an Italian prison. The 27-year-old will reportedly marry Colin Sutherland, who Knox has known since middle school. But as their families celebrate in Washington, a legal back and forth continues in Italy as Knox and her co-defendant and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito fight back against their 2014 re-conviction by an Italian upper court for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher. Engaged! Amanda Knox (right) is reportedly engaged to her childhood friend, musician Colin Sutherland (left) The news of Knox's engagement was first reported in a Seattle Times column on Wednesday. Columnist Jonathan Martin writes that Knox confirmed the engagement to him via email buut said no more. The pair were engaged last week. No date has been set for the nuptials. Before her current love was revealed in September, Knox was known to be living in Seattle with her classical guitarist then-boyfriend James Terrano. A LinkedIn profile for Sutherland once listed his name as Thunderstrike after the Marvel comic-book character - says he studied French at Sarah Lawrence . Sutherland once lived in Brooklyn but has since moved back to Seattle, where he and Knox attended middle school. Sutherland once lived in Brooklyn but has since moved back to Seattle, where he and Knox attended middle school. Here, Knox is pictured with Sutherland in New York during a visit in July . Sealed with a kiss: Sutherland (again seen here with Knox during her visit to New York as they locked lips at Coney Island) and Knox reported were engaged last week . Childhood friend: Sutherland reportedly wrote to Knox as she sat in an Italian prison following her 2009 conviction. The pair have known each other since middle school . She was set to graduate from the University of Washington this past June with a degree in creative writing. She's now working at a Seattle bookstore and as a writer for the West Seattle Herald. Meanwhile, her case is headed back into the Italian courts once again following an initial conviction, an overturning of that conviction followed by her reconviction along with Sollecito. It seems unlikely Knox, who now lives in the U.S, will ever be returned to jail for the crime as she has repeatedly refused to return to Italy. If she is convicted again, Italy is likely to request to extradite her but her longstanding battle to prove her innocence has made her a cause célèbre in the U.S who may ignore political pressure to send her back. Sollecito and Knox were first found guilty of murder in November 2009. The previous man: Knox was last known before Sutherland to be dating classical guitarist James Terrano, who she reportedly lived with in Seattle, Washington . The killers' convictions were later quashed after experts said forensic evidence had been contaminated and they were released. Prosecutors then appealed that finding and the case was re-tried in March 2013. In January last year a court upheld the original verdict, but the pair remained at large as under Italy's legal system, any verdict reached after a second appeal but be ratified by the highest court. Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. He was ordered to remain there after being found near the Italian border with Slovenia and Austria hours after being found guilty for the second time. He has since completed a degree in information technology. Back then: Knox was accused along with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (both at left) of brutally murdering Knox's roommate in Perugia, Italy Meredith Kercher, 21 (right) in 2007 . Kercher, 21, was found dead on the floor of her bedroom. Some of her belongings were missing and Knox reported an apparent burglary to police. Detectives concluded the supposed break-in looked staged and Knox became the prime suspect. She then implicated Patrick Lumumba, a bar owner she worked for. The duo were arrested along with Sollecito. Mr Lumumba was later released when evidence pointed to Rudy Guede's involvement. Guede was then accused of committing the murder along with Sollecito and Knox. In October 2008 he was found guilty of sexually assaulting and murdering Kercher. Home for good: While it's highly unlikely that Knox would be extradited no matter what happens in court in March, her ex Raffaele Sollecito must face the music in his home country . Still at risk: Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. He was ordered to remain there after being found near the Italian border with Slovenia and Austria hours after being found guilty for the second time. He has since completed a degree in information technology .","Knox was engaged last week to musician Colin Sutherland, who she's known since middle school. No date has been set for the nuptials .

Miss Brewer walked in Miss Hammer's fashion show as a part of the designer's Role Models Not Runway Models campaign, which she first began after being asked to show her collection at New York Fashion Week last year. 'I called up my existing clients who were all incredible women and one of them happened to be a doctor and a sex therapist who happened to be in wheelchair,' Miss Hammer told the outlet. 'It was never intended to be this incredible statement.' After Dr Danielle Sheypuk became the first woman to 'walk' the runway in a wheelchair, hundreds of people reached out to Miss Hammer to thank her, including campaigner Katie Driscoll, who runs a nonprofit organization which advocates for the inclusion of people with disabilities in the media.

'Thank you for being the change that is long overdue,' she wrote to Miss Hammer. 'I could literally cry every time I read an article talking about your decision to include a model who just happens to have a disability! YOU are what this world needed!' Miss Driscoll also asked Miss Hammer to find a role model for Grace. Last September, Miss Hammer left a lasting impact on New York Fashion Week after she enlisted quadruple amputee Karen Crespo to model her spring 2015 designs. But she never forgot about Grace - or her mother's request. When Miss Hammer asked Miss Driscoll to suggest a model, she immediately chose Miss Brewer. The actress, who is best known for playing Addie in American Horror Story: Murder House, Nan in American Horror Story: Coven and Marjorie in American Horror Story: Freak Show, is also an activist for intellectual disabilities. Perfect model: Miss Brewer took to Twitter on Thursday to share a photo of herself getting her hair done before the runway show . Flawless face: The actress posed for a quick snapshot while getting her make-up done in preparation for her debut on the catwalk . Black magic: Miss Brewer played a clairvoyant witch named Nan in American Horror Story: Coven, in which she starred alongside Jessica Lange, Emma Roberts, Taissa Farmiga and Gabourey Sidibe . At 19, she was elected to the State of Texas ARC Board, where she served for four years. She was also asked to join the Governmental Affairs Committee for the State of Texas where she was the only person with a disability. During her two years of service, she worked with the committee and lawmakers to change the state’s wording to ‘intellectually disabled '. When creating an original design for the actress, Miss Hammer kept Miss Brewer's work on American Horror Story in mind. 'American Horror Story is dark, scary, bewitching so we had to go with black and Jamie has a beautiful body with a teeny waist and curves and we went with an A-line,' she explained. Miss Brewer, who was excited to make her runway debut, noted that Miss Hammer's design fits her personality.

"A serial burglar hung his head in shame as one of his victims was allowed to confront him in court. Great-grandmother Margaret Wallace, 64, forced the man who robbed her to make a grovelling apology as she bravely opted to appear in court to read out her victim impact statement. Miss Wallace, who was making use of a recent change in the law, told Martin Gilbert, 48, he needed to ‘sort himself out’ ahead of his sentencing for a string of raids on vulnerable victims. Martin Gilbert, right, carried out a series of raids on elderly people's homes. One of his victims was 64-year-old Margaret Wallace, left, who decided to confront him in court today . Miss Wallace, who walked to the dock at Newcastle Crown Court with the aid of a walking stick, told the criminal: ‘I just really don’t think you understand how you make people feel. ‘Just get yourself sorted out. Please, please get yourself sorted out.’ During her impassioned speech, the criminal repeatedly said ‘I’m sorry’ as he lowered his reddened face into his hands. The former hostel worker told the court that she had not slept in her bedroom since her home was broken into and is even afraid to open her windows, despite struggling with asthma. Looking directly at Gilbert, she said: ‘You’re only 48. You’re a young lad, you don’t need to be doing this. You really don’t. If you don’t mean you are sorry then don’t say it because people don’t want to hear it if you don’t mean it. ‘Please get yourself sorted out – you are upsetting a lot of elderly people and hurting them. ‘I am a compassionate person but to be honest, I could kill you, I really could.’ The court heard that Gilbert had stolen jewellery and other property from Miss Wallace’s home in Walker, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, as she was out celebrating her birthday. Judge Sean Morris told Gilbert: ‘You have completely ruined her [Miss Wallace’s] comfortable existence in her own home. Targeting elderly people’s homes is a disgrace and it makes you dangerous.’ Gilbert, of Walker, Newcastle, admitted six charges of burglary and was jailed for eight years. Telling Gilbert that he did not think the criminal would ever change his ways, the judge added: ‘‘It is not just property, it could be potentially life-threatening.’ Gilbert, who had been forcing his way into homes since he was a teenager, was jailed for eight years after admitting six counts of burglary. Speaking after the court hearing yesterday, Miss Wallace said she wanted to speak to the criminal face-to-face after her house was burgled twice in a year. She said: ‘I sat thinking about it all night on the evening that it happened and I thought if they catch him I want to speak to him. I want to be able to look him in the eye and tell him how he made me feel. I really feel like there has been a weight lifted off my shoulders now.’ Miss Wallace, who lives alone, was told by local police that she was the first victim they had known to read a statement in court. She rebuffed their attempts to dissuade from her doing it. She added: ‘I spoke from my heart. He doesn’t realise the effect he is having on people.’ Margaret Wallace, holding her witness statement, was out celebrating her birthday when her home was burgled . The court heard that Gilbert had carried out three raids in one day in November last year, including on the home of an 88-year-old Alzheimer’s sufferer. He also targeted an 85-year-old woman and was caught raiding the presbytery of a church that was home to an 81-year-old vicar. Miss Dowling said: 'Both were concerned and scared and stayed in the corridor until the police arrived.' He went on to carry out two further raids in December before he was arrested. Jamie Adams, defending, said Gilbert was deeply ashamed and embarrassed of his behaviour, and that he carried out the burglaries while on valium. A change in the law last year means that criminals can be forced to listen to victims describing the misery caused by crimes. As part of a victims’ code, those affected by crimes now given the right to read out a statement in court. If the victims choose to, they can read out a statement before sentencing, allowing judges to take into account what they say before setting a jail term. Miss Wallace is one of only a handful of victims who have chosen to appear in person. Miss Wallace asked Gilbert 'I wonder if you would like it if it happened to your mam?' in the witness box . I am  Margaret Wallace, I am 64 years old. I am living in sheltered accommodation, so I feel safe with living by myself. This is the second time I have been burgled in less than a year. Since the burglary I have never slept in my bed, I can’t sleep in my bed. I have always slept with the windows open because of my asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]. I can’t sleep with the window closed. I just can’t sleep in the bedroom at all. I daren’t keep the window open, even during the day. I don’t think Mr Gilbert knows the effect he’s had on people. I just really don’t think you understand how you make people feel. I always thought he was a really nice man. Unfortunately, I don’t think that now. I just wonder if you would like it if it happened to your mam if she lived by herself. I am sure you wouldn’t. Please, please get yourself sorted out. You’re only 48. You’re a young lad, you don’t need to be doing this. You really don’t. You were in the papers saying you were sorry. Sorry is a word anyone can say, but if you don’t mean it, don’t say it. People don’t want to hear it if you don’t mean it. Please get yourself sorted out. You are upsetting a lot of elderly people and hurting them. I am a compassionate person but to be honest I could kill you. I really could. I am sorry, Your Honour. You wouldn’t like it done to your mam and dad. I am now hoping to move because I just can’t stay there any longer. It has affected me so much, this one. The first one was bad enough. But for it to have happened again – I don’t even like being in during the day. I have written to my MP. I feel strongly, if you have done the crime, you should be in court. (Miss Wallace was referring to the fact Gilbert was originally due to be sentenced remotely via video link). I used to work for [a soup kitchen] in Newcastle for 16 and a half years. I have compassion, I would have done anything for them. I would help anybody but, you know, I always used to say, if I find out you have burgled anyone’s house, God help you.","Martin Gilbert targeted pensioners' homes in a series of raids in Newcastle .

"A new book features 250 children transformed into imaginative new scenes that took the creators 16 months to produce. The making of Konrad Wimmel Is In Town, published today, saw photographer Jan von Holleben, from Germany, take more than 5,000 photos to construct the final images. In a Where's Wally style, readers must locate Konrad and his friends in the pictures where they are on a wild chase after a thief who has pinched his grandmother's handbag. Jan von Holleben has created a spectacular new book using hundreds of children to create the scenes . Scenes include a zoo, complete with animals constructed from children, a traffic scene and an inventor's fair packed with wacky contraptions. Jan, 37, said  he wanted to create an inspirational series of images with the intent to show kids the infinite possibilities of life. His project is a 'search-and-find book with a story to tell, including hundreds of photos. 'There are seven worlds teeming with life which promise all the fun of searching and finding - and nothing is impossible. 'In the park you can fly; no machine is impossible for inventors to invent; on the road you turn yourself into a vehicle; and in the zoo you can become any animal you wish to be.' The book Konrad Wimmel Is In Town encourages readers to locate Konrad and his friends in the pictures . Over the course of 16 months, 250 children were enlisted to take part in the project . In order to make the children as involved as possible, Jan asked them to storyboard their own ideas . Jan has been a photographer for over 20 years and found that it was this style of birds-eye scenery that was most popular. He said: 'I started photographing in the Nineties and my success was boosted with my lying-on-the-floor-images, so I wanted to develop this technique further. 'Already at that time I started sketching scenarios with 50 to 60 kids in one single picture. 'During my first books for children and young readers, I worked very closely with the protagonists. 'It's almost like a movie director who has to give a lot of attention to his actors. 'At first, I found a school which liked the overall idea of the project and also wanted to participate.' The mad scientist scene is Jan's personal favourite, which he says is the central piece to the book . Jan has been a photographer for over 20 years and says that his scenery pictures are his most popular . Out of all of his projects, this was Jan's most time-consuming and easily the most expensive . Between 15 to 30 children were bought into Jan's studio each day to be photographed over 16 months . In order to keep his characters smiling and more importantly, cooperative, Jan made sure to give them an active role in the creation of the pictures. He said: 'For the following two to three weeks [after finding the school], my assistant and I started visiting different classes in order to win the kids over. 'Instead of preaching them about the idea, we used the chance to do workshops with them, getting them involved in the creative process right away. 'Beforehand, I had prepared seven sketched framework sceneries, which were later to become photographs: a school, a park, traffic, an inventor's fair, a sports field, a zoo and a grand party. 'These where designed to give the kids a visual outline for their own thoughts and ideas.' By the end of the project, Jan was left with 5000 images to whittle down . During the process, the team munched their way through 186 pizzas to keep them energised . And the children worked their way through 45kg of sweets . Jan is already planning his next book despite being left exhausted by his last project . He continued: 'I asked the kids about their craziest fantasies, for example, the ideal school, how their favourite car would look like, what kind of sport they always have wanted to play. 'We goofed around with what the most ingenious invention would be, what it could look like and lastly how the most fantastic party could be celebrated. 'Within this process they sketched hundreds of pictures and gave a million wonderful and creative answers. 'Finally, we had lively conversations about the results. 'Casually, the kids began developing and planning their own parts in the images - not just acting it. 'This way we started building the content of the book together. 'In the following weeks, I worked out seven photographic worlds in my sketchbook from the collection and was ready to start with the next phase: the production.' Jan (pictured) says that working with so many children required a lot of patience from not only his team but the children too . Once Jan's and the children's ideas were in place, he had to narrow down the ideas as well as sort through 5,000 images. He said: 'During four week of production, we invited 15 to 30 kids into our studio every day, made pictures like mad, dismissed some ideas, refined others and had many new ones, which we immediately put to practice. 'Following that, I assembled the outcome of over 5000 pictures to raw digital collages, which ultimately became the book's final images. 'At the creative level it often was like a wild funfair. 'Within the over 5000 single pictures, 100,000 possibilities and ideas and among 250 enthusiastic kids with their parents, my team, my publisher and the book, I often lost track about where I was currently standing. 'Gladly, my initial sense always guided me back on track and helped me maintain full emotional control about the project. 'Eventually, I began to value the order within the chaos - and learned controlling it. 'It was difficult, but also the greatest thing in the world to experience what such a little head on my shoulders can withstand.' Jan says that he hopes the book will show children you can be anything you wish to be . Jan says that the one unpredicted side effect was just how exhausting working with so many children would work out to be. He said: 'The one factor that we underestimated was the physical and psychological task of working with so many kids for four weeks in a row, from dawn till dusk. 'I personally tuned to maximum performance, running thousands of times a day from camera to kids on the floor - and vis á vis. 'Not to forget, it was also the beginning of winter and half of the kids had a cold and a running nose, generously sharing their state with the fellow children. 'The every day challenge was to keep them happy on the floor and maintain and strengthen the relationship to every single child.' 'Respecting the kids in their work (and play) is very important and essential for me in this kind of work. My team and the support of Katharina Ebinger, programme director of my publishing house Thienemann-Esslinger, was worth gold.' 5 weeks of daily photo shoots . 16 months of total production time . 45kg of sweets for everybody's nerves . 186 Pizzas for energy . 250 kids in various characters . 5,000 individual images . Out of the hundreds of intricate scenes that Jan and his team created, he says that he can easily pick his favourite. 'The inventor's fair is my personal favourite. You could regard this picture as the central piece of the book. Jan says that not only was this the largest scale project that he has ever done but easily the most expensive. 'Looking at the numeric facts of Konrad Wimmel, the production was actually completely unaffordable. All together, it quickly evolved into the biggest and most intense project I had ever done.' Despite all of the complications Jan says he is extremely proud of the book that he and his team have created. 'It went beyond all my and others' expectations. Furthermore it taught me a lot about my own creative process and my work as an artist. In the end, I was exhausted like never before and never wanted to do such a project again. I was empty. 'Now, seeing this book in front of me, everything is right in place - just like I dreamed of it. Honestly, at this point I now feel like I never want to stop making pictures like these. 'I already have many new ideas and it just makes a lot of fun to think about what you can do with this technique in the future. With all these people involved - it's infinite.'","Photographer Jan von Holleben took 16 months to complete his book .

"It's not the first thing most women think of when they go shopping for their smalls. But for Karen Danczuk it was just another chance for a photo opportunity. After browsing aisles bursting with barely-there outfits, the 31-year-old picked out a revealing red and black corset - then whipped out her phone to share the moment with her online fans. It took just a matter of hours for the councillor to post the fruits of her labour on Twitter - with a shameless plug for the lingerie store thrown in for good measure. Scroll down for video . Photo opportunity: Karen Danczuk went shopping for lingerie today - but used the outing as another bit of shameless self-promotion . Mrs Danczuk, the 31-year-old wife of Labour MP Simon Danczuk, doing a spot of lingerie shopping with her friend, believed to be Nicollette North . Selfie queen: The self-confessed 'Queen of the Selfies' (left and right) posed for a series of obligatory selfies, complete with saucy pouts, to add to her ever-expanding selfie gallery . Strike a pose: The mother-of-two couldn't resist stopping to take a few photos of herself in her new outfit . Slinky: She spent the morning trying on the slinky corset at bespoke lingerie shop Chantilly, in Rochdale . Red: She later posted these selfies on her Twitter saying: 'I'm Labour through and through! I even bought the underwear to prove it' She posted: 'I'm Labour through and through! I even bought the underwear to prove it. KD #imtellingthetruth'. She also linked her tweets twice to the shop, before also giving a shout out to her friend Nicollette North, who had watched on as Mrs Danczuk struck a number of pouting poses in her snug-fitting corset. It's hardly surprising that Mrs Danczuk chose to turn her latest shopping trip turned into yet another opportunity to add to her ever-expanding gallery of selfies. The mother-of-two shot to fame last year after posting dozens of risque pictures - mostly showcasing her generous cleavage - to her 35,000 followers on Twitter. Her pictures, which range from make-up free post gym scenarios to fully glammed-up nights out, have helped to propel her to the position of one of the most-famous women in public life. But along the way she has drawn her share of brickbats, including among critics who accuse her of cheapening British politics. On show: Some might ask whether the basque-like one-piece is becoming  for a  wife of one of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition . Snug fit: Mrs Danczuk asked Ms North, a mother-of-two, to make adjustments to her chosen corset . Adjusting to the new look: The councillor was out and about in Rotherham picking out her new attire . Be my Valentine? The images could cause a stir among hopefuls who are in the middle of furiously bidding to take the mother-of-two out on a date on Valentine's day this Saturday . Mrs Danczuk has previously been called 'the most embarrassing wife in Westminster' by former Conservative MP Louise Mensch - and these images will do nothing to help her cause. Ms Mensch also branded Mrs Danczuk a 'trowel' over the amount of make-up she uses. Some might also question whether the basque-like one-piece is becoming for a councillor and wife of a high-profile figure in Her Majesty’s Official Opposition. But Mrs Danczuk appears to be undeterred by the criticism, as these images show. In another bid for self-promotion, Mrs Danczuk this week announced she would take 'one lucky winner' on a date this Saturday for Valentine's day, depending on who bid the most for the privilege. In the pink: The mother-of-two picked up an eye-catching pink and black number while browsing . Which one? Mrs Danczuk (left and right) asks her friend for some advice over her raunchy underwear . Animal: The councillor also considered trying on an animal-print bra and brief combination . Winner: The councillor appeared to be most taken with the basque-like red and black corset . Before the undressing: Mrs Danczuk and her friend spent the morning shopping in Rochdale . Success: The MP's wife looked pleased as she left the shop carrying numerous bags of her new purchases . Her fans launched a furious bidding war, bringing the highest bid to £10,300. Today, Mrs Danczuk also today took a swipe at beleaguered Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman. Ms Harman had already come under fire this week for the party's use of an all-female pink battle bus to engage with women voters. In the wake of the outcry, Mrs Danczuk told MailOnline how Miss Harman allegedly told her she was 'far too pretty to be interested in politics' and should join a girl band instead - something the deputy Labour leader denies. Costume change: Mrs Danczuk was later seen in jeans and a denim shirt unbuttoned to her bosoms as she went out for lunch in Rochdale following her lingerie shopping trip . Mrs Danczuk, who has represented the Kingsway ward on Rochdale council since 2011, announced last month that she was standing down as a councillor at the next election to pursue other opportunities. She's already hired London-based agent Ginger Comms and is understood to be interested in pursuing TV work. Mrs Danczuk also hit the headlines last year when she started selling signed pictures of herself posing in a bikini on eBay. But the £10 pictures were criticised by many buyers for being poor quality.","31-year-old councillor spotted lingerie shopping with a friend in Rochdale .

"She's one of showbiz's most famous redheads so it's hardly surprising that actress Christina Hendricks has been snapped up to front a new hair colour campaign. The Mad Men star, 39, has been unveiled as the  glossy raven tresses of Nice 'N Easy's new beauty campaign and shared her top tips for red carpet glamour. Naturally a dark blonde, as a young girl Christina was first inspired to colour her hair red by the fictional heroine of LM Montgomery’s books, Anne Of Green Gables - another of the world’s most iconic red heads. Scroll down for video . Christina Hendricks shows off her famous flame-haired locks as she models in a new hair campaign . Finally making the leap early in her career, Christina coloured her hair for an Italian magazine shoot and it’s been her colour of choice ever since; through the beginnings of her acting and modelling career, to all seven seasons of Mad Men. The star, who was once hailed the sexiest woman in the world by Esquire magazine, revealed that her red hair has influenced her style. She said: 'I think being a red head has encouraged me to be a bit more playful with my fashion, maybe be little bit more quirky and eccentric even, so when I go out in the evening I like to play with colour and jewellery and it sort of complements being a red head.' Christina was first inspired to colour her hair red by the fictional heroine of LM Montgomery's books, Anne Of Green Gables, another of the world's most iconic red heads . The actress also opened up her make-up bag and revealed the secrets behind her flawless porcelain complexion. Discussing how she combats dehydrated skin when travelling a lot with work, she said: 'On a plane, I usually try to bring an eye cream and a lip balm with me. 'I don’t like to put too much on when I travel, but I like to keep hydrated around my eyes. When I get tired or if my skin feels dry, I find that it shows up mostly around my eyes. I’m also just constantly slathering lip balm on as well.' Forget dazzling showbiz events by night, Christina says she's 'definitely someone who sits in front of the fireplace' because she thinks it’s 'so romantic' and she 'loves it'. 'I’ve noticed that I’ve started keeping a little group of moisturisers, lip balm and cuticle oil next to where I sit on the couch, so I can file my nails and do some pampering while I watch a movie. I like to keep a little side table of beauty products.' It seems that starring in Mad Men has influenced her sense of style. She added: 'I love fashion and I love beauty and so, to me, it’s about exploration and trying new things. 'I love head pieces and I love hats, I love curls and I love sleek. I love playing around with all those different things.' The natural beauty says she swears by eye cream and lip balm and fireside pampering for her good looks . Naturally a dark blonde, when she was younger Christina coloured her hair red thanks to fictional heroine of LM Montgomery’s books, Anne Of Green Gables, whom she admired . Mad Men will soon come to an end after seven seasons, but Christina  has already started to move on from the period drama. The  actress behind Joan Harris (nee Holloway) has been cast on Cameron Crowe's upcoming comedy, Roadies. Cable network Showtime made the casting announcement in December. Hendricks will play Shelli, the tough-but-emotional production manager of a touring rock band and her character is described as being 'married to her job.' Hendricks' co-stars in the one-hour comedy include Luke Wilson, as a newly sober tour manager, and Imogen Poots as an electrical technician. A busy actress for several years before Mad Men, Hendricks appeared in recurring roles for shows like ER, Firefly, and Life. But it was her casting as head secretary Joan Holloway on Mad Men that brought Hendricks wider fame. The 39-year-old, who was once hailed the sexiest woman in the world by Esquire magazine, revealed that her red hair has helped her experiment with fashion . Her character dealt with the business world of the 1960s, facing everything from casual sexism and rape to single motherhood. For her work, Hendricks received five Emmy nominations for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama. Fans will not have to wait for the premiere of Roadies to see Hendricks again, since the final episodes of Mad Men will air during 2015. Hendricks will also co-star with Chloe Grace Moretz, Nicholas Hoult, and Charlize Theron in the 2015 film, Dark Places. Betty Draper (January Jones), Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) and Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) made names for themselves in Mad Men .","Christina, 39, models for hair colouring brand .

"Zesty: Old Bay seasoning will be added to the Filet-O-Fish's tartar sauce from Monday . McDonald's are banking on beloved Old Bay seasoning to bring new life to one of their staple sandwiches. From Monday, the popular Maryland seafood spice - which has a Sriracha sauce-like following, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic area - will be added to the tartar sauce of the fast good giant's Filet-O-Fish. The idea was developed by McDonald's franchisee in - where else? - Baltimore. Store owner Mark Furr said he came up with the idea because so many customers added Old Bay to the fried fish burger, and so he pitched the idea to his head office. 'We know that Old Bay is as popular as salt and pepper on our tables here in Baltimore,' Mr Furr told The Baltimore Sun. 'McDonald's is extremely excited to be able to deliver a true, local taste to our customers.' Nearly 700 McDonald’s locations in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Delaware and West Virginia will offer Filet-O-Fish with Old Bay tartar sauce. The limited-time-only offering is an official partnership between McDonald's and McCormick and Co., the Maryland company that makes Old Bay. The seasoning was named after the Old Bay Line, a passenger ship line that plied the waters of the Chesapeake Bay from Baltimore to Norfolk, Virginia, in the early 1900s. It began as a spicing for bushels of blue crab, with the main ingredients of mustard, paprika, celery salt and bay leaves. Old favorites: The Filet-O-Fish has been a McDonald's staple since 1962, while Old Bay seasoning has a cult following in the Mid-Atlantic, where it is added to almost everything . However, for many, it has become a necessity that can be sprinkled on just about anything, from popcorn and potato salad to even beer and doughnuts. The Old Bay Filet-O-Fish will hit participating stores on February 16. Of course, locals seem to be all for it. 'It makes perfect sense to spice up the Filet-O-Fish with Old Bay, especially around the Mid-Atlantic,' Chesapeake business owner John Shields told Baltimore Magazine. 'McDonalds tried going locavore a number of years ago on the Eastern Shore with the addition of a crab-cake sandwich. 'Not so good, and it didn't last long. But Old Bay and Filet-O-Fish? How could it go wrong?' The Filet-O-Fish has been around since 1962 and was created by Lou Groen, a McDonald's owner in Cincinnati, Ohio.","Old Bay seasoning, a Maryland institution, will be added to the tartar sauce .

"Threat: Lord and Lady Fink. The Tory grandee said he could sue Ed Miliband over his remarks . A Conservative grandee last night threatened to sue Ed Miliband for calling David Cameron a ‘dodgy prime minister surrounded by dodgy donors’. In a spiralling row over revelations that backers of both main parties had Swiss bank accounts, the Labour leader raised allegations against Lord Fink, a Tory peer. Lord Fink, who stepped down as party co-treasurer in 2010 and has given the Tories £3million, was among those named in documents seen by the BBC’s Panorama programme as being clients of HSBC’s Swiss private bank. Labour donor Lord Paul, who helped to bankroll Gordon Brown’s leadership campaign, was also on the list. The row comes amid claims that HSBC’s Swiss arm may have helped wealthy clients avoid or evade tax. At Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons, Mr Miliband called on Mr Cameron to say what he was going to do ‘to find out about the tax avoidance activities of Lord Fink’. In some of the most intemperate exchanges since the last election, the Labour leader declared: ‘There’s something rotten at the heart of the Conservative Party and it’s you.’ Mr Cameron said the previous Labour government had done nothing to crack down on tax avoidance and was a ‘friend of the tax dodger’. The Prime Minister said of Mr Miliband: ‘The only reason he is sitting there is that a bunch of trade union leaders decided he was more left wing than his brother. ‘For 13 years they [Labour] sat in the Treasury, they did nothing about tax transparency, nothing about tax dodging, nothing about tax avoidance. ‘This present government has been tougher than any previous government. That’s why they Labour are desperate, that’s why they are losing.’ The row prompted a furious response from Lord Fink, who said he would take legal action against the Labour leader if he repeated his remarks outside Parliament, where they are legally privileged. Lord Fink said he had run a business in Switzerland for four years and had needed ‘a local bank account’ for his salary and to ‘pay grocery bills’. ‘As I already banked with HSBC in London, I set up an account with HSBC,’ he wrote in a letter to Mr Miliband. Miliband told the Prime Minister: 'There’s something rotten at the heart of the Conservative Party and it’s you' ‘I submitted tax returns in both Switzerland and Britain showing my revised tax status, which was accepted by the Inland Revenue. ‘I find it extraordinary that you have made claims against me that are without foundation or without contacting me. I challenge you to repeat your allegation outside the House of Commons – or to withdraw it publicly.’ Lord Paul said he had held an account with HSBC for some time in Switzerland because he had a house there, and there was ‘nothing unsavoury’ about it. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, named by the Guardian as another client of the bank, denied he held an account there. ‘I have never had a Swiss bank account, and do not control any Swiss bank accounts. I have never sought or been given tax minimisation advice by HSBC, directly or indirectly,’ the MP said. ‘The fact is that I receive an income from an international trust, and I have paid taxes in full on all the income or capital gains I have received, irrespective of where these arise.’ His father Sir James Goldsmith, who had ‘non-domicile’ status, set up a family trust in Geneva to distribute money to the family, including to Zac and his brother Ben. Claims: A string of public figures have come forward to deny any impropriety in their involvement with HSBC . Overall, the Conservatives are said to have received more than £5million from HSBC clients with Swiss accounts. Labour has benefited from cash and gifts in kind worth well over £500,000 and received a loan for £2million. HM Revenue & Customs was passed a cache of documents in 2010 from France about clients of HSBC’s Swiss operation. Offshore accounts are not against the law, but some people use them to hide cash from the tax authorities. The Government has signed an agreement with the Swiss authorities meaning information is now shared with the UK.","Labour leader named ex-treasurer, who gave Tories £3m, in Commons .

"A heavily-pregnant mother was attacked on her doorstep as she held her one-year-old child in her arms in a case of mistaken identity. The 33-year-old woman, who is eight-and-a-half months pregnant, was punched in the face after answering her door to three men in Portsmouth, causing her to bleed over her toddler. The men - all white and aged in their 30s - were looking for a man last Friday afternoon who had previously lived at the property, claiming he owed them money, Hampshire Constabulary said. Attack: The 33-year-old woman, who is eight-and-a-half months pregnant, was punched in the face after answering her door to three men on this road (pictured) in Portsmouth, causing her to bleed over her toddler . But despite the woman explaining she had no link to the man, she was still punched in the face, leaving her badly bruised and bleeding from her nose. The phone line to the property was later found to have been cut - and detectives condemned the ‘despicable and cowardly’ attack on the mother, which took place between 2.30pm and 2.50pm. The force said the woman felt ‘shocked and distressed’ and was later treated by ambulance staff. Detective Constable Peter Bugden said: ‘It would have been obvious to the men she was expecting and also obvious she had a young child in her arms. Location: The men - all white and aged in their 30s - were looking for a man last Friday afternoon who had previously lived at the property on this road (centre, pictured from above), claiming he owed them money . ‘We are keen to find the three men as soon as possible - especially the attacker. ‘I’d like to hear from anyone who has any information about this assault or who saw the car or anything suspicious at around the time the attack happened.’ The men left in a small dark green two-door car. The attacker is described as stocky with strawberry blond hair. He wore a beige pullover with duffle buttons and had a southern accent. The road on which the attack happened has an average house value of £135,000 and is located in the Buckland area of Portsmouth, close to the city's ferry port. Anyone with information is asked to call Fratton CID on 101, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Eight-and-a-half months pregnant woman, 33, attacked in Portsmouth .

"An English woman who did not want her two children to live with her ex-husband in Australia has lost a fight from beyond the grave. The woman had written a will and said 'under no circumstances' did she wish the youngsters - a girl aged eight and a boy aged seven - to return to their Australian father. Her parents and her ex-husband, who is of Aboriginal descent, became embroiled in a family court fight over the children's futures after she died late in 2014. A judge today ruled in favour of the woman's ex-husband following a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. Two children, aged eight and seven, have been ordered by a judge to return to Australia to live with their father. Their mother, now deceased, took them to England before her death. In her will she directed that under no circumstances should the children live in Australia with their father . Mr Justice Roderic Wood had been told that the pair had married a decade ago and lived in Darwin, Australia. The woman was diagnosed with cancer, so travelled with her children from Australia to England for treatment two years ago. They were still married at the time. Her then husband had agreed to the trip on the basis that she was going for treatment and the children would have a holiday. But, without his knowledge, she had taken legal advice and decided that she wished to stay in England with the children. She had signed a will and 'made it clear' that she wanted the children to 'have little or nothing to do with their father', Mr Justice Roderic Wood said. The judge explained that she had written: 'Under no circumstances do I wish my children to be returned to their biological father in Australia as this would be extremely detrimental to their lives.' The children were born and raised in Darwin, Australia. Their mother took the children to England for a temporary stay in 2012 and then refused to bring them back to Darwin . She said she wanted a friend or a relative in England to bring them up - and the judge said they were in England being cared for by their grandparents. But the woman's ex-husband said they should be returned to Australia under the terms in an international convention. He said they had been born in Australia, had grown up in Australia and their habitual residence was in Australia. And he said he had never consented to them moving to England to live. Mr Justice Roderic Wood agreed. The children's mother was diagnosed with cancer, which eventually caused her death. She took her children to England for treatment, but never returned to her husband in Australia . The judge said the man had been misled by his ex-wife and the children had been wrongfully retained by her in England. He said the man had not consented or acquiesced to the children starting a new life in England. Neither child objected to returning to their father in Australia, and they had not 'settled' in England, he added. He said there was no evidence the children were told of any plans to keep them in England permanently. 'The children left Australia in July 2013 for a holiday,' the judge said. 'They did not say goodbye to their friends, school or neighbours. 'They left many favoured objects behind them fully intending to return.' The judge said the man had been misled by his ex-wife and the children had been wrongfully retained by her in England. The children left Australia with no indication it would be permanent, leaving behind their father, school, friends and many treasured possessions .","Two children will be returned to their father in Australia from England .

"A groom who sparked a mass brawl on his wedding night told a group of teenagers he would 'knock them out with one punch' before butting, glassing and throttling his three victims. John Derick Sandham, 31, was at his wedding reception at a pub in Holywell, Flintshire, when he launched an attack on a group of young friends also having a drink at the venue. The court heard how Sandham, who had swapped vows with his wife Clare just hours earlier, head-butted one victim before hitting him in the face with a glass or a bottle. John Derick Sandham, 31 (right) was at his wedding reception after marrying his wife Clare in August 2013 (left) when he launched an attack of a group of young friends who were also having a drink at the venue . He then grabbed another of the teenagers by the throat, before hitting the third victim on the back of the head, Mold Crown Court was told. Sandham, from Bagillt, near Holywell, had claimed he acted in self-defence, saying: 'This was my wedding night. It is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it was blighted by this.' But a jury at Mold Crown Court convicted him of all three assaults. He has now been bailed until his sentencing hearing. The court heard how the wedding took place on August 24, 2013 before the reception at The Abbott’s Arms. The victims, who were aged 16 and 17, were not part of the wedding party. The court was told how one of the victims went for a cigarette while the others were in the porch 'having a laugh and messing about'. The court heard Sandham (left and right) head-butted one victim and him in the face with glass or a bottle . The defendant then walked through the porch, where he was said to have asked the friends what they were saying. He then walked straight up to the group and grabbed one of them, before launching the gurious attacks. The jury heard how one of the teeangers needed hospital treatment for cuts to his nose after being struck with the glass. He told the jury: 'We were just having a laugh. There were no issues. 'He turned around and asked what we were saying? We said we did not want any trouble but he said he could knock all three of us out with one punch.' The brawl unfolded in the porch at the Abbot's Arms in Holywell, Flintshire (pictured), the court heard . The groom had claimed he only went through the porch to say goodbye to wedding guests, who were leaving by taxi. He said he had left his glass inside the venue. He also claimed that the teenage friends had started growling at him and 'went for him'. He told the court: 'Everyone there had a fantastic day, all the guests, all the friends and family, the children, it was brilliant. Then it was blighted by this.'","John Sandham, 31, married wife Clare in Holywell, Flintshire in 2013 .

"Williams was suspended for six months without pay on Tuesday after he admitted lying to his viewers about riding in a military helicopter hit by a rocket-propelled grenade during the Iraq war in 2003 . Brian Williams tried and failed to secure a promise that he can definitely return to the Night News' anchor chair when his six month suspension ends in August, according to sources close to negotiations earlier this week at NBC. Williams was suspended for six months without pay on Tuesday after he admitted lying to his viewers about riding in a military helicopter hit by a rocket-propelled grenade during the Iraq war in 2003. Journalists at NBC News have described the departure of the star anchor who has led the top-rated Nightly News since 2004 as 'very painful.' 'People are angry at Brian,' one NBC News journalist told The Washington Post on condition of anonymity. 'We all worked so hard at establishing our credibility, and it feels like our credibility has been badly damaged.' Sources at NBC News believe Williams made his own situation much worse with his misjudged and half-hearted on-air apology on February 4. The anchor's statement that he had 'made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago' did little to stem the growing controversy and insiders believe viewers simply didn't buy Williams' excuse. 'It was obvious it fell flat,' one insider told The Post. 'The world felt it was not contrite or fulsome enough. 'Williams' grave error was to continue to claim that he had merely forgotten the facts rather than that he had deliberately inflated his own role in the dangerous situation. Top level: Williams' bosses NBC Chief Executive Stephen Burke and Deborah Turness, the president of NBC's news division, issued a joint statement on Tuesday night revealing that the anchor had been suspended . 'Ninety percent of the people knew it was not misremembering, it was making it up,' the source said. Williams' situation quickly got worse as the spotlight was shone on other stories such as his reporting from New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and even a story about saving puppies while a volunteer fireman in the 1970s. Executives at NBC however were most concerned with the Iraq fabrication. 'When helicopter crew members get shot down and you attach yourself to what they went through, it's pretty outrageous,' another internal source told the Post on condition of anonymity. By now senior management such as NBC Chief Executive Steve Burke, NBC Universal News Group Chairman Pat Fili-Krushel and NBC News President Deborah Turness were involved and the idea of a self-imposed suspension was discussed. Williams' predecessor Tom Brokaw was also involved. 'We will work every night to be worthy of your trust': Williams' temporary replacement Lester Holt directly addressed the controversy surrounding the anchor's suspension during Wednesday night's broadcast . On Febuary 7 network officials agreed to let Williams take himself off the air for several days and it was announced that weekend anchor Lester Holt would fill in. By now an internal investigation lead by veteran journalist Richard Esposito had also confirmed that Williams had lied about his Iraq helicopter story wrong - a conclusion senior management found unacceptable. Esposito also unearthed other 'instances of exaggeration,' including issues with Williams' stories about what he had recalled seeing during Hurricane Katrina. Further action was required and Burke considered three options - firing Williams outright, a lesser suspension and the option that was ultimately chosen. Williams favored a short suspension that would allow him to maintain his position as managing editor. 'That was never going to happen,' a senior NBC official told The Washington Post. The star anchor also failed to receive a promise from his bosses that his return is guaranteed. On Monday senior officials  concluded that Williams should be suspended for six months without pay and Burke contacted him to break the news. Something missing? The banner graphic for NBC Nightly News was wiped of Brian Willams' name starting Wednesday . Williams, 55, has so far declined to comment on his suspension. He may consider a suspension without a promise that he will get his job back tantamount to being fired and attempt to negotiate a settlement with NBC. He is not allowed to make appearances without the approval of people at the network. On Wednesday, the network changed the name of the broadcast from NBC Nightly News With Brian Williams to NBC Nightly News. Acknowledging that it was 'an enormously difficult story' to report, the show aired a segment about Williams' six-month suspension and pledged to make itself worthy of viewers' trust. Replacement anchor Holt opened the report by saying: 'And now to the story many of you are talking about tonight and one that for us not only hits close to home but in our home.' Holt quoted from statements from Turness and Burke, in which they described Williams' actions as 'wrong and completely inappropriate,' and which jeopardized 'the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News.' Holt then added: 'Now if I may on a personal note say it is an enormously difficult story to report. 'Brian is a member of our family, but so are you, our viewers and we will work every night to be worthy of your trust.' Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Williams failed to receive any assurance from bosses that he will be able to walk back into his old job when his six month suspension is done .

"United Airlines customers were left furious on Wednesday evening after the company announced that it would be voiding all tickets which were sold at hugely discounted rates because of an online glitch. The error, which was first identified by customers on Wednesday morning, saw first class, round-trip, transatlantic flights on offer for as little as $74, provided travelers registered themselves as being located in Denmark. But, eight hours after the error was first spotted, the airline dashed the hopes of thousands of holidaymakers after refusing to honor any bookings made as a result of the online glitch, blaming a 'third-party error' for the mistake and accusing customers of trying to 'take advantage' of the situation. For a brief period of time on February 11, round-trip, first class fares from London to Newark were available on United.com for just $74 . Null and void: United issued a statement on Wednesday evening which said that the airline would refuse to honor bookings made during the website glitch . 'United is voiding the bookings of several thousand individuals who were attempting to take advantage of an error a third-party software provider made when it applied an incorrect currency exchange rate, despite United having properly filed its fares,' a statement issued by the airline said. 'Most of these bookings were for travel originating in the United Kingdom, and the level of bookings made with Danish Kroner as the local currency was significantly higher than normal during the limited period that customers made these bookings.' The airline's announcement, which was released via its official Twitter account at approximately 6.20pm EST, prompted a flurry of irate replies from hundreds of disappointed customers. A number of holidaymakers accused the company of violating the Department of Transportation's (DOT) regulations regarding airline travel, while others threatened to pursue legal action against United, particularly those who had received confirmation emails from the company hours earlier. 'Get ready for a couple of thousand DOT complaints,' one user wrote, while another added: 'So you f****d up and are retracting legal contracts?! See you in court!' Outrage: Customers were quick to vent their frustration on Twitter with many threatening to pursue legal action against the airline . Ruined reputation: Many questioned why the airline would risk destroying its credibility for the sake of saving money . Several other customers merely voiced their frustration and anger at the situation, with many accusing United of ruining their eagerly-anticipated holidays. 'Fine. But you have to tell my kids we're not going to NY this summer,' a disappointed parent tweeted, while a second person promised to boycott the airline in the future, saying: 'I have been a @united customer for over a decade. That might come to an end now.' The error on the website was first spotted this morning at around 10am EST, with a number of eagle-eyed travelers taking to Twitter to spread the word about the glitch which saw travelers offered return, first class flights from London to New York for just $74. The round-trip first class tickets from Heathrow to Newark, just outside of New York City, were snatched up by lucky holidaymakers for just 491 Danish krone due to an apparent error on the site. By registering as a customer in Denmark, holidaymakers could snap up the deal, which would normally set them back between $5,618 and $6,778. Bargain! The unbelievable fare totaled 491 Danish krone, which comes to $74 . It is unclear how the deal happened and it appears United quickly made changes to prevent anyone else from purchasing the cheap tickets. One customer who snapped up the bargain fare said she simply logged on to United.com and changed her country status to Denmark. She then chose her dates and made sure to select business class or first class from the drop down menu. Then, using a credit card without a foreign transaction fee, the purchase was completed and a confirmation email sent, although the customer did say she left her country as 'Denmark' when filling out her postal address. Despite the low costs, two customers reported finding 'miscellaneous' charges from the airline on their debit or credit card statements - which they believed to be an additional booking fee of $40 per ticket - meaning the total price of their tickets was closer to $100 each. A second customer secured first class transatlantic flights for a total of 1,356DKK - around $206 or £135 . Both customers said that they were happy to pay the additional amount however, as the price still worked out much cheaper than a full price first class ticket. Daily Mail Online attempted to secure the same deal at approximately 16:20 GMT, but found that selecting Denmark from the country drop down menu was no longer an option. The country option was then turned back to the original country of origin, which was in this case the United Kingdom. In an earlier statement provided to MailOnline Travel, a spokesperson for the company said: 'United has temporarily suspended sales from its Denmark website because a third-party software provider applied an incorrect exchange rate and was misquoting the airline’s properly filed fares. 'This error in the application of the exchange rate primarily impacted individuals who live outside of Denmark and who were not traveling to or from Denmark but were attempting to book tickets using United’s Denmark site.'","The airline issued a statement on Wednesday evening blaming the issue on a 'third-party error'

"Chelsea star Branislav Ivanovic found himself at the centre of a storm on Wednesday night that had people questioning whether he had bitten Everton’s James McCarthy. Moments before Willian grabbed a last-minute winner to maintain Chelsea’s seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League, Ivanovic got embroiled in a melee between both sets of players. Ivanovic first grabbed McCarthy around the throat, nearly throttling him, before he aimed a head-butt at the Everton midfielder. VIDEO Scroll down for Does Branislav Ivanovic bite down on James McCarthy's shoulder? Branislav Ivanovic aggressively wraps his arm around Everton midfielder James McCarthy . Ivanovic (third right) appears to aim a headbutt in the direction of McCarthy . McCarthy looks round as Ivanovic grapples him with both arms as tempers fray at Stamford Bridge . The incident took place during a melee in the closing stages of Chelsea's 1-0 win against Everton . Branislav Ivanovic was the innocent victim on the day Luis Suarez rocked the football world by whipping up English football’s biggest biting storm. Suarez apologised for his ‘inexcusable behaviour’ days after biting Ivanovic in the second half of Liverpool’s 2-2 draw against Chelsea at Anfield in April 2013. It did not spare the Uruguayan a 10-game ban and he committed another biting offence in the 2014 World Cup on Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini. That led to a four-month ban from any football-related activity, plus nine international matches, for Suarez and saw him transferred to Barcelona for £80million. Video footage showed Ivanovic, himself the victim of a Luis Suarez bite two years ago, appearing to bite McCarthy. Sources close to McCarthy later said that he did feel teeth on his shoulder, though he did not believe it to be a bite. Other Everton players said they saw Ivanovic press his head into McCarthy and appear to catch his teeth on his shoulder. Chelsea sources insisted that Ivanovic denied biting McCarthy. But the defender could still face a retrospective three-match ban, which would rule him out of the Capital One Cup final, over the incident if referee Jon Moss claims he did not see the full extent of it. FA disciplinary chiefs are almost certain to investigate the altercation on Thursday morning. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho stormed out of a BBC interview when asked about the Ivanovic incident and when questioned by BT Sport, he replied: ‘Don’t make me laugh, don’t make me laugh.’ In the press conference, Mourinho threatened another walk-out, saying: ‘I’m concerned with my reaction because one more question (about this) and I will leave.’ Mourinho was critical of Everton, who had Gareth Barry sent off, adding: ‘They made lots of fouls, what you would call intelligent fouls, but if the referee follows the rule it’s yellow card after yellow card and then inevitably you get a red card — which they eventually did.’ Ivanovic looks towards McCarthy as the melee takes place in the background .

Ivanovic also clashes with Everton's John Stones in the closing stages of the Premier League match . Ivanovic (left) is embraced by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho after the final whistle on Wednesday . Everton manager Roberto Martinez was in no doubt that Ivanovic should have seen red over the alleged butt. To rub salt into Martinez’s wounds, Ivanovic played a crucial part in Willian’s late winner. ‘If you look at the images Ivanovic’s behaviour is wrong,’ said Martinez. ‘He grabs him around the neck in a forceful manner then puts his head against him when James McCarthy didn’t react, and if you want to be on top of the laws that’s a red card.’ Martin Keown – I think he's just about going to get away with this, there's not enough in it in terms of making contact with his head. He'll get away with it for me. Steve McManaman: I don’t think it was worth a red card, Jon Moss, the referee didn't see the incident - it's up to the law makers now. Robbie Savage: I've seen a lot worse but can you grab someone around the throat and do that? If the referee sees the movement towards McCarthy it's a red for me. Michael Owen: It’s a yellow for me - nothing more. Phil Neville: It's not clear cut enough for the FA to ban him for three games, for me. It’s not good what’s he done granted, but I don’t think the FA will take action.","Branislav Ivanovic may face retrospective disciplinary action .

"A seriously ill pensioner was left on a trolley in a tiny office while nurses at an overrun hospital fielded calls about other patients and made coffee. Great-grandmother Arleene Meekins was moved in to the tiny cluttered room as the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (N&N) was hit by a flood of patients on Tuesday morning - her 77th birthday. The pensioner, who was battling a serious chest infection, was dumped for about four hours  - with nurses leaning over her to work - before she was finally taken to a ward at the 953-bed 14-year-old hospital. Arleene Meekins was moved in to the tiny cluttered room as the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (N&N) was hit by a flood of patients on Tuesday morning - her 77th birthday . The N&N said the room, which included desks, chairs and a telephone, was a 'home therapies clinic room and office' and only used while the hospital experienced 'increased bed pressure' Until then she was forced to lie in her hospital bed as staff sat at a desk just feet away taking a stream of calls about other patients. Workers also filed in and out to make tea and coffee while the room was crammed with filing cabinets, tables and chairs. The N&N said the room, which included desks, chairs and a telephone, was a 'home therapies clinic room and office' and only used while the hospital experienced 'increased bed pressure'. The crisis became so bad that one ambulance crew waited for more than four hours in the early hours of Tuesday morning to drop a patient off. Seven other ambulances spent more than three hours queuing to hand over people at the hospital's emergency department as patients could not be discharged quickly enough. Mrs Meekins was originally kept on a maternity ward when she first went to the N&N with a chest infection two weeks ago. Arleene Meekins was moved in to the tiny room  on Tuesday morning - her 77th birthday . She was then shunted from the ward to the staff office at the Jack Pryor Unit, which treats kidney dialysis patients, for around four hours. Her son, Philip Meekins, 46, of Norwich, said: 'It is ridiculous. I couldn't believe they'd put my mum in an office.' Waiting times for cancer treatment and other operations are at their highest for six years as the crisis in A&E has infected the rest of the health service. Experts warned that hospitals are now ‘stretched to the limit’ and said the situation is ‘critical’. Some 13 hospitals across England declared major incidents last month as they were unable to cope with the numbers arriving in A&E. Now a report by health think-tank The King’s Fund has found waiting times for tests and surgeries for non-emergency patients are at their worst level since December 2008. Her daughter-in-law, Shelley Meekins, 41, went to see Mrs Meekins at 11.30am on her 77th birthday to find her propped up on a bed in the staff area. 'I kicked up a right old stink when I got there,' said the carer. 'Poor Arlene was in a bed next to a load of cupboards. 'The staff had to lean across her to make a cup of coffee and the guy in the office was making calls on the phone to patients. 'She broke down and cried because there was just no dignity for her.' 'The nurse even told me that she wouldn't want this for her mother,' she said. 'She said an overflow of ambulances had arrived and she said they just had to find beds.' Mrs Meekins was finally moved to a ward. 'The powers that be need to be told that this is simply not good enough,' insisted Shelley. A hospital spokesman apologised but said the devastated great-grandmother only spent a 'short time' in the 'home therapies clinic room and office'. The great-grandmother, who was battling a serious chest infection, was left on a trolley in a tiny office while nurses at an overrun hospital fielded calls about other patients and made coffee . Workers also filed in and out to make tea and coffee while the room was crammed with filing cabinets, tables and chairs . He said she was there from about 8am to 11.30am as besieged staff frantically strived to transfer her back to a ward. 'Prior to this time, the patient was cared for in a ward environment,' added the spokesman.

'At the time, the trust was experiencing considerable bed pressure with many patients needing urgent admission to hospital.

The N&N said it was unable to divert patients to other local hospitals on Tuesday morning as they were also busy. Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, simultaneously declared an 'internal critical incident' as it urged people to find alternatives to A&E. The James Paget University Hospital at Gorleston, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was also under intense pressure and was on red alert. Meanwhile, an N&N spokesman said that emergency admission areas remained 'extremely busy'. 'Our staff have been working very hard, alongside ambulance crews, to support patients while we continue to experience a high level of emergency demand,' the spokesman said. 'Being able to turn around ambulances depends on maintaining a flow of patients through the hospital and back to their own homes or to another care provider.'","Arleene Meekins put in tiny room at Norfolk & Norwich University Hospital .

"The wife of the Paris kosher deli Islamist has revealed the murderer's heart 'burned' to join the militants as she boasted of her easy escape to Syria in an ISIS magazine. Hayat Boumeddiene has spoken to Dar al Islam, an online magazine for French speakers, designed to encourage more people to travel to ISIS-controlled land in the Middle East. In the issue - which focuses on the Paris attacks - she speaks lovingly of her husband, Amedy Coulibaly, the man who killed five people in two separate attacks during the three days on terror which gripped the French capital last month. Boumeddiene - who is never referred to by name: only as the wife of Abou Basir Abdoullah Al-Ifriqi, the name given to her husband, and then 'the sister' - also speaks of her escape from France, and encourages others to join her in 'the Caliphate'. Scroll down for video . Terrorist's moll: Hayat Boumeddiene (left), wife of terrorist Amedy Coulibaly (right), gave a long interview to French ISIS magazine Dar Al Islam . Speaking of Coulibaly, France's most wanted woman revealed: 'His heart burned to join his brothers and fight with them against the enemies of Islam in the Caliphate. 'His eyes shone every time he saw the videos of ISIS and he said, 'don't show me this', because he wanted to leave immediately.' Coulibaly never made it to ISIS-controlled Syria, but Boumeddiene left France for the war-torn country before the shootings. In the interview, she boasts of the ease of her journey - and reveals she is happy in her new life. 'I found it easy to get here - I didn't encounter any difficulties,' she said. 'And it is good to live on land which is under the laws of Islam.' She then calls on others to follow in her footsteps. 'My brothers and sisters, I call on you to come to the State of Ummah [a land of an Islamic community], to cross the the world and to act guided by the Koran,' she says. Boumeddiene, who is believed to be in Syria and is thought to be the woman pictured here, right, has said her husband's heart 'burned' to be with his 'brothers' in ISIS . Boumeddiene (pictured) calls on others to join her in 'the Caliphate' ISIS have created in Iraq and Syria . She also has advice for women on how to be a good ISIS wife. 'Sisters, be there for your husbands, your brothers, your fathers, and sons Be good advisers, then they will find in you tranquility,' she said. 'Don't make it difficult for them, facilitate their choices, be strong and courageous. All you do, do it exclusively for All and hope for recompense. 'Be aware that if the companions have spread Islam across the world, there was a pious women behind them. 'Don't waste your time on futility.' The authenticity of the interview has not been confirmed - but it is the second time Boumeddiene has apparently appeared in ISIS propaganda material in recent days.

"Jupiter’s ‘Great Red Spot’ has been turned white in a stunning new infrared image of our solar system’s largest storm. The Jovian storm is believed to have a lifetime of 300 to 400 years and has winds screaming at hundreds of miles per hour. It usually appears as a deep red oval surrounded by swirling layers of white, yellow, orange, but this latest image casts it in a new light. Jupiter’s ‘Great Red Spot’ has been turned white in a stunning new infrared image of our solar system’s largest storm. The Jovian storm is believed to have a lifetime of 300 to 400 years . A gigantic storm twice as big as Earth, the spot was first observed 300 years ago. Like a hurricane on Earth, the center is relatively calm, but farther out, the winds scream at 425mph (680km/h). The spot, whose main cloud layer is likely ammonia, appears to be an area of upwelling, in which clouds form from below. The spot is technically an anticyclone - a cyclones whirling in the other direction. Infrared images such as this can cut through the gas and dust captured in visible light photos . The image, released by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, also shows Jupiter’s moon, Ganymede in the upper right appearing as three coloured dots. The effect is due to the fact Ganymede moved during the time required to take the three separate colour images. The image was taken by a camera mounted on the Subaru Telescope, a 27ft (8.2 metre) instrument located atop Mauna Kea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island. The Great Red Spot seen in this image has baffled astronomers for years, and the cause of its has remained a mystery. One theory put forward in November is that the red spot is in fact, sunburn. Nasa said it believes the spot is likely a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet's upper atmosphere. The results contradict the other leading theory for the origin of the spot's striking colour - that the reddish chemicals come from beneath Jupiter's clouds. The image follows another stunning shot of the gas giant revealed last week by Nasa. The 'spot' is a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet's upper atmosphere . Hubble captured the rare sight of three of Jupiter's largest moons parading across the giant gas planet's banded face. The telescope took a string of images of the event which show the three satellites — Europa, Callisto and Io — in action 601 million miles (968 million km) from Earth. The Jovian lunar gathering, which happens only once or twice a decade, was captured on January 23 showing the unusual sight in a single frame. Jupiter is composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, with just a sprinkling of other elements. Scientists are interested in understanding what combinations of elements are responsible for the hues seen in Jupiter's clouds, as this would provide insights into the giant planet's make-up.

"An Arizona teenager has learned the hard way that he was no Santa Claus. Firefighters in Tucson had to rescue the unnamed 16-year-old boy from a chimney Wednesday afternoon after he forgot his keys and tried to enter the house from the roof. Fire Department Capt. Barrett Baker said they were alerted to the emergency at around 3pm by a neighbor who heard cries for help coming from a home near Glenn Street and Columbus Boulevard. Chim-chimeney! A 16-year-old boy had to be rescued from a chimney in Tucson, Arizona, after he got stuck trying to enter his home . First responders who arrived on the scene found the wannabe Kris Kringle lodged about 6 feet below the top of the chimney. The firefighters tossed the teen a rope, which was then used to pull him out to safety, reported KGUN9. The boy emerged from the chimney caked in soot, but he was otherwise unharmed and did not require medical help. In a post written on the department's Facebook page, firefighters urged people never to repeat the boy's chimney stunt. ‘Kids, leave this to Santa,’ read the status update. ‘The chances of making it down safely are slim to none and getting stuck can lead to serious injury or even death.’ Incredibly, this was not the first time that firefighters in Arizona were called to rescue a child trapped inside a chimney. He's no Santa: First responders say the teenager climbed into the chimney after forgetting his keys . In December, a 13-year-old from Scottsdale found himself in a similar situation when he tried to enter his home after getting locked out. Two months earlier, a woman got stuck inside a chimney in Ventura county, California, during a suspected break-in, requiring firefighters to chisel away much of the smokestack and lubricate it with dish soap. In a similar incident, a 25-year-old man found himself lodged inside a chimney in Florida back in November 2013, when he tried to enter a home to steal money for alcohol.","The teen became trapped 6 feet below the top of the chimney in Tucson, Arizona, while trying to enter his home .

"A kind stranger waited at a cashpoint for more than an hour to return £70 to a shopper who had accidentally left it behind. Now Nanette Lovell, 54, from Helston in Cornwall, wants to thank the man who waited for her in the cold after she left her cash in the machine.

Ms Lovell went back outside and was astonished to find the mystery man, who had been queuing behind her at the cashpoint, still standing there with her money. Ms Lovell, a reflexologist, hurried back inside to pay for her shopping but by the time she left the shop the Good Samaritan had left. She is now appealing for him to come forward so she can thank him properly and offer him a reward. She said: 'I went and did my shopping and I really dawdled around the supermarket.

'I went to customer services in the hope that someone had handed it in - but there was nothing. 'I came outside, trying not to cry, when this man came up to me and said, ""have you lost something?"" 'I was gobsmacked. He said to me, ""I've been waiting out here hoping you'd come out. I did try and follow you but I couldn't find you in the store.""' Ms Lovell said she was so shocked she forgot to ask the man his name, but says he was in his fifties, with short brown hair and brown eyes. She added: 'I think the fact he waited such a long time was really impressive. 'I think he needs recognition for being such a kind man. 'I'd really like the chance to thank him properly.

"Legislators in Puerto Rico are debating a bill that would fine parents of obese children up to $800 if they don't lose weight . Legislators in Puerto Rico are debating a bill that would fine parents of obese children up to $800 if they don't lose weight. The bill aims to improve children's wellbeing and help parents make healthier choices, Sen. Gilberto Rodriguez said. Public hearings for the bill are scheduled to begin on Friday. If approved, public school teachers would flag potential obesity cases and refer them to a counselor or social worker, depending on the severity of the case. Health Department officials would then meet with the parents and determine whether the obesity is a result of bad eating habits or a medical condition. They also would create a diet-and-exercise program combined with monthly visits to ensure it's being followed. After six months, officials would evaluate the child again, with parents possibly facing between $500 and $800 in fines if the situation does not improve within another six months to a year. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control defines childhood obesity as having a body mass index or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex. Several doctors including the president of Puerto Rico's chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics have spoken out against the measure, saying it is unfair. More than 28 percent of children in Puerto Rico are considered obese, compared with some 18 percent in the U.S. mainland. Puerto Rican children's fitness expert Jose Ortiz helps train overweight boys on stationary bikes inside the gym he operates, in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico .","Legislators in Puerto Rico are debating a bill that would fine parents of obese children up to $800 if they don't lose weight .

"Jawaid Ishaq, 72, who lives in Scunthorpe but is originally from Kuwait, is accused of stealing £124,000 from sick friend Ali Salem Sultan . A serving Labour councillor and former town mayor who helped to organise the Queen's first visit to a UK mosque has gone on trial accused of fraud and theft. Jawaid Ishaq, 72,  originally from Kuwait, moved to this country in 1970 and went on to become town mayor of Scuthorpe, deputy chairman of Humberside Police, and was awarded an MBE. But today he was accused of stealing £124,000 from a sick and elderly friend as part of a fraud lasting for 15 years. Sheffield Crown Court was told that Ishaq began his deception in 1997 when Ali Salem Sultan, a close friend of his who used to go to his shop and attended mosque with him, retired. Mr Sultan, who was then 72 but who has since died,  wanted to return to his native country of Yemen where his wife and children lived. However, he owned several assets in Scunthorpe, including two rental properties, which he wanted Ishaq to look after. On July 7 the former steelworks painter drew up a legal power of attorney which granted Ishaq the power to collect rent on the properties and maintain them. This paper clearly stated it applied to 'no other assets whatsoever', but some time later Ishaq is alleged to have created a handwritten forgery. This second document gave him access to all of Mr Sultan's stocks bank accounts, and pension. Craig Hassall, prosecuting, said Ishaq then used the forged document to sell all of Mr Sultan's shares, and withdraw his pension in cash every week. Meanwhile, in Yemen, Mr Sultan became aware of the deception in 2001 after he had trouble accessing his Halifax bank account, Mr Hassall said. Despite falling gravely ill and having to have his leg amputated, Mr Sultan began writing letters to the bank, urging them to give him control of his accounts back, it was claimed. However the jury heard that back in Britain Ishaq had instructed the bank to ignore any letters being sent from Mr Sultan in Yemen. Mr Hassall said: 'His attempts to have his pension paid into his bank account in Yemen were thwarted by the defendant. 'Pension payments were paid in to a new account and were being withdrawn by the defendant in cash on a regular basis.' Eventually Mr Sultan tried to draw up a new power of attorney with his son, who lives in New York, but this had little or no effect, Mr Hassall added. Ishaq has been a Labour councillor since 1983, served as mayor of Scunthorpe in 2008, was deputy chairman of Humberside Police, and organised the Queen's first visit to a UK mosque (pictured, Ishaq third left) Ishaq became a Labour councillor in 1983 in Scunthorpe while the fraud was going on, then served as chairman of the South Humber Racial Equality Council and held the position of former deputy chairman of Humberside Police Authority. He was also awarded an MBE in 2000 for services to community relations, and is still serving as a councillor on North Lincolnshire Council. Mr Hassall said: 'Clearly he was and still is a prominent and influential person in the community as well as the Muslim community in North Lincolnshire. 'This meant people trusted him and were less inclined to check what he was telling them if he had not held such positions of power.' When police raided Ishaq's house in October 2012 they found the handwritten power of attorney, which was dated just eight days after the original was drawn up. However, it had a stamp from a solicitor's firm on it featuring a name that the company did not adopt until 2004. It also had two signatures, whereas the law only requires one. Mr Hassall said: 'It makes no sense that a second power was granted just days after the first one when [Mr Sultan] had been so careful to limit the powers to just the two houses. Sheffield Crown Court was told Ishaq forged a will of attorney and used it to sell Mr Sultan's stocks, withdraw his pension, and access his bank account after he retired to his home country of Yemen . 'The second one is hand-written and there’s nothing in it that says a legally qualified person had anything to do with it. And the legal stamp must have been applied eight years later.' Ishaq is charged with four offences of fraud, four of theft, one of forgery, and of obtaining a money transfer by deception. He is also accused of two charges of using a false instrument with intent, making or supplying articles for use in fraud, possessing an article for use in fraud and perverting the course of justice. He denies all of the charges against him. The trial, which is expected to last four weeks, continues.

"A woman who once tipped the scales at 800 pounds but who was jilted by her fiancé after losing almost half her body weight has found love again and is once again hoping to become America's largest bride. Susanne Eman, 36, from Arizona had slimmed down to 450 pounds in 2013 ahead of her scheduled wedding to chef Parker Clack. The bride-to-be had gone so far as having a wedding gown made with 45 yards of material - the equivalent to half a football field in length. Scroll down for video . Susanne Eman, 36, from Arizona was jilted by her fiancé after losing almost half her body weight, but she has once again found love and hopes to become America's largest woman . But just days before they were due to marry, Susanne was jilted by fiancé Clack who was unhappy about her weight loss. Despite making over $90,000 a year as a Big Beautiful Woman (BBW), the 'gainer' had checked into a slimming clinic after her children revealed they were worried about her health. 'Everything was supposed to be perfect and then he split,' she told Inside Edition. Heartbroken by being dumped but, worse yet, Susanne said she was also unhappy with her new figure. 'What bothered me was seeing my body shrink. I felt absolutely tiny,' she said. Susanne vowed to regain her lost weight and immediately began eating more to regain the weight she lost. She's now back up to 600 pounds. As well as regaining her previous figure, Susanne has also revealed that she's found love again. Boyfriend Nick Abbate is 36 years old and a chef just like her previous fiance. He too once was morbidly obese, but now weighs 168 pounds. Susanne has revealed that she's found love again with Nick Abbate and has also regained 150lbs . The couple met online and Abbate enjoys nothing more than preparing mammoth meals for his partner. 'She likes to eat,' he said . Abbate has written several books weight loss and nutrition, but says he doesn't want Susanne to lose a single pound. 'I find her very sexy and very attractive.' he said. The couple met online and Abbate enjoys nothing more than preparing mammoth meals for his partner. He told Inside Edition that he is supportive of his girlfriend's goal to be the heaviest woman in America. 'She likes to eat,' he revealed. Susanne hit the headlines in 2011 when she first revealed that she wanted to become the world's fattest women. Weighing just over 750 pounds at the time she and her then feeder fiance chef Clack planned for her to reach a target weight of 1600 pounds within 10 years. In 2013 Susanne was engaged to be married to Parker Clack, right, and she had a XXXXXXXXXL wedding dress made featuring 42ft of chiffon . The couple had met online and within months of first exchanging emails Parker had moved in with Susanne and her sons Brendin, now 15, and Gabriel, now 19. Unemployed Susanne said at the time: We are a match made in heaven. I love eating and Parker loves cooking. He loves larger women and sees how happy I am when I'm eating. His cooking skills were definitely part of the attraction. How could I resist a man with talents in the kitchen?' The couple were engaged to be married and Susanne upped her food intake to a terrifying 30,000 calories per day as she strove to become the fattest ever bride. As part of a feature for Inside Edition at the time the couple revealed some of their preparations for the wedding, including the creation of a XXXXXXXXXL wedding dress featuring 42 feet of chiffon. In 2013 Susanne vowed to get healthy after pressure from her children Gabriel, left, and Brendin, right . In preparation for her final fitting, Susanne feasted on enormous breakfasts of pancakes, Belgian waffles, hash browns, sausage links, steak, and a giant 12-egg omelette. And on the day of her appointment with the seamstress she made a pit stop for snacks, arriving at the dressmaker's with a spread of three guacamole bacon cheeseburgers, two orders of chili cheese fries, nine tacos, a chocolate shake and a large Coke. As the months went by Susanne got to her heaviest ever weight, 800 pounds, but her sons were so worried about her health that she agreed to abort her life-threatening mission and instead started to make changes to her lifestyle. Susanne checked into a residential weight-loss clinic in June 2012 where she was put on 1,500 calories food limit and spent up to five hours exercising each day. While her health started to improve as she lost weight her relationship suffered as fiance Parker began to miss her huge size. The couple split in October 2012, and though Susanne continued on her quest to lose weight, dropping to 450 pounds when she checked out of the facility in March 2013.

"Police in suburban Atlanta say three people have been arrested in the death of 21-year-old James Jones Jr. (pictured) Clark Atlanta University says the killing of a junior chemistry major from Central Florida is a 'devastating' loss for the school. Police in suburban Atlanta say three people have been arrested in the death of 21-year-old James Jones Jr., a Daytona Beach native. He was looking to buy an iPhone from a seller on Craigslist. Marietta Police spokesman David Baldwin says Jones was robbed and fatally shot Monday night after responding to an ad for an iPhone 6. Baldwin says 18-year-old Jordan Baker, 19-year-old Jonathon Myles and 21-year-old Kaylnn Ruthenberg are jailed on felony murder, aggravated assault and armed robbery charges. Clark Atlanta said in an email to students that it's reaching out to family and friends of Jones before finalizing any memorial tributes. 'This is a devastating loss for the Clark Atlanta University family,'' a statement read. 'Mr. Jones was a serious scholar and a kind, engaging spirit whose work and comportment spoke well of the university's core values and those instilled long ago by those contributing to his upbringing. In addition to his studies, he was a UPS scholar at Fickett Elementary School and a science mentor for the HBCU Rising Cares Mentoring program at Brown Middle School. He also was an amateur athlete.' 'It was an illegitimate ad he was responding to and he did not know the sellers,' Marietta Police officer David Baldwin told ABC News. 'The ad was posted in the hopes to lure somebody in, but obviously the victim didn't know that.' Jones had been shot while still in his car. Kaylnn Ruthenberg, 21, (left) Jonathon Myles, 19, (right) have been arrested in the plot to lure Jones Jr. to his death with a phony Craigslist ad . Jordan Baker, 18, also allegedly acted in the plot to murder Jones with the lure of an iPhone . After he was killed, the car rolled forward into another car and a tree. Police were dispatched to respond to a motor vehicle accident. 'Through the course of the investigation, they discovered that he was going to that area in response to a Craigslist ad,' Baldwin said. Craiglist has yet to respond to reporters questions. 'It was a heck of an undertaking and investigation but it helps to bring closure to the family. We hope to give them peace to know that everyone involved in this senseless murder will be held accountable, Baldwin said.","Police in suburban Atlanta say three people have been arrested in the death of 21-year-old James Jones Jr., a Daytona Beach native .

"Two former schoolgirl friends are getting married after one of them had a sex change to become a man - and they are now expecting a child. Toni Harper, 22, met Sean Horton, 25, through friends when they were aged 12 and 15 and he was a blonde girl called Sian. They became good friends and Sean 'came out' to Toni after years of torment about his gender and sexuality. Sean started hormone treatment and the pair fell in love  as his voice lowered and he grew facial hair. Trainee mechanic Sean is just one operation away from the end of his treatment and the couple will tie the knot next month after winning a wedding in a competition. Scroll down for video . Childhood sweethearts: Toni Harper and Sean Horton became friends at school when Sean was a blonde-haired girl called Sian - they are now set to be married after Sean underwent a sex change . Before and after: Sean Horton (right, aged 25) grew up as a blonde girl named Sian (left, aged 12) First meeting: Toni was 12 years old (pictured) when she met Sean, who was then a blonde 15-year-old called Sian . The pair are also about to start a family thanks to a sperm donor and Toni is due to give birth four weeks after their wedding. Sean, from Knowle, Bristol, said: 'When I was younger I always wanted to wear boys' clothes. My mum just thought I was a Tomboy until I told her the truth. 'Now I just can't wait to be a dad. I can't wait to hear him call me ""daddy"".' The couple became friends while at school and grew so close that Toni was the first person Sean told that he wanted to be a man. He then later revealed his feelings to his mother Heather, 51, who fully supported her son. She said: 'He came back with a new short haircut - it was around his 16th birthday - and he ran in with a hat on and buried his head in his pillow. 'He poked his head out from under his hat and just said ""this is me"". It was breaking his heart, I could tell. 'I cuddled him and he said to me ""you don't understand, I'm a man"". Wrong skin: Sean (pictured as Sian aged 10) 'always wanted to wear boys' clothes and now aged 25 says he 'can't wait to be a dad' Love and support: Sean's mother Heather (left) has always backed his decision and the couple (pictured) are now looking forward to becoming parents themselves thanks to a sperm donor . 'Later he just came out and said it - he wanted a sex change. I said ""whatever you want, we will be there for you"".' The family approached their GP to find out about having a sex change and he was referred to London's Gender Identity Clinic. Sean said: 'I had to prove to [doctors] I was living as a man and my college, where I was studying mechanics, even wrote a letter to say I was considered Sean, not Sian.' After months of meeting a psychiatrist to confirm he was making the right decision, he began hormone treatment, aged 20, and met up with Toni for the first time in two years. Engaged Toni, a worker at Marks and Spencer, said: 'He suddenly had facial hair and his voice had dropped down really low - I couldn't believe it was him. 'It felt weird at first, but we started seeing each other more and more until we started going out and growing closer and closer. 'When Sean first told me, I asked him how that could be possible. It was so difficult, but I knew what was going on deep inside.' Sean had a full mastectomy and then a year later he began genital surgery - a series of four operations including one where medics took skin from his arm. 'After the first surgery I was in shock,' he said, 'But now I couldn't be happier. 'I used to dread getting dressed and seeing myself in the shower when I was a woman but now I have never felt more comfortable in my own body.' The engaged couple had artificial insemination treatment with donor sperm in a bid to get pregnant, spending £8,000 at a private clinic on three unsuccessful attempts. Family: Toni (pictured at two) said: 'It felt weird at first, but we started seeing each other more and more until we started going out and growing closer and closer' Future dreams: Sean says he always knew he was a man and is now eagerly looking forward to becoming a father . The pair also planned a wedding but put it on hold after Sean's father Martin was diagnosed with cancer. In a cruel twist of fate they got the news they could have further insemination treatment on the NHS the day Mr Horton passed away from cancer. Toni then became pregnant with the baby boy, which due on Mr and Mrs Horton's wedding anniversary. The couple are getting married next month after they won a £12,000 wedding through local paper, The Bristol Post. Excited groom Sean said: 'I believe this is fate falling on us. He wanted his first grandson as bad as we did, but when he was here we had three failed attempts. 'Then, after he passed away, we managed to get pregnant on the first attempt. We couldn't believe it. Toni said she will never forget my face when I found out.' Toni added: 'It was the longest two weeks of our life after the insemination. 'We had tried before. It had been so hard and so disappointing. But we were so relieved in the end.'","Couple from Bristol were once friends when they both girls at school .

Momock Bambang Samiarso, head of Bali Provincial Prosecutor's Office, confirmed on Thursday afternoon that the Australians would be executed outside Bali, but he would not say where. 'On the timing, there will be another meeting,' he told reporters. 'But we ask it to be as soon as possible.' Scroll down for videos . Australian death-row prisoners Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran have been moved for execution . A meeting on Friday will confirm the date of their transfer. Prosecutors are trying to keep the transfer a secret, and the official avoided confirming the men would be taken to Nusakambangan, a prison island off central Java. Mr Momock also promised to give Chan, Sukumaran and their families the required 72 hours notice of their executions. In a chilling comment, he said the families of the condemned pair would be notified about the imminent transfer ‘so they can visit them for the last time.’ Mr Sukumaran is passionate painter who has been conducting art classes to other inmates while in Kerobokan jail. The classes have been his way of showing he has rehabilitated . Chan and Sukumaran were leaders of the so-called Bali Nine, . who were found guilty of attempting to smuggle more than 8 kg of heroin valued at about A$4 million from Indonesia to Australia. They were arrested at Bali's Denpasar airport in 2005 and . their case has taken on enormous resonance as a domestic political issue . in Australia. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that it understood officials have been speaking to airport authorities and Garuda - the national carrier - which has apparently agreed to fly the men to a place where the executions will take place. Three days before the firing squad’s guns will be unleashed, Mr Muhammad Prasetyo, the Indonesian attorney general, will issue a statement confirming the executions are going ahead. Andrew Chan mother's Helen Chan arrives to visit her son at Kerobokan prison on Thursday . Mr Chan has been in jail in Bali since 2005 after his arrest at at Bali's Denpasar airport . Condemned prisoners are usually given three days notice of their execution, so it is possible that Chan and Sukumaran will be shot at the weekend. They are understood to have been shocked to learn that they will be transferred to the ‘execution island’ very soon. Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who was elected last year, has made it clear he will show no mercy to drug smugglers who he says are crowding out the prison system. He has rejected more than 60 bids for clemency, with a number of other pleas yet to come across his desk. Mr Sukumaran stands in front of his paintings at a prisoners' studio in Kerobokan prison . Australia stepped up pressure on Indonesia on Thursday to spare the lives of two drug smugglers facing the firing squad, with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop warning their execution would be a grave injustice. 'Our shared hope is the Indonesian government and its people will show mercy to Andrew and Myuran,' said Bishop. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop made a last-ditch plea for the two men to be taken off death row . Both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve . Officials have been granted permission to transfer the two men from Kerobokan jail in Bali . 'Both men are deeply, sincerely remorseful for their actions. Both men have made extraordinary efforts to rehabilitate. Andrew and Myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve.' In a clear sign of bilateral party support in Australia, the Deputy leader of the Opposition earlier on Thursday also made a passionate plea for the lives of the Bali Nine ringleaders to be spared by highlighting her own husband's drug reform story. Tanya Plibersek's husband Michael Coutts-Trotter was convicted of conspiracy to import drugs in 1986, at the age of 21, and served three years of a nine-year prison sentence. Australia's Deputy leader of the Opposition Tanya Plibersek has made a passionate plea for the lives of the Bali Nine ringleaders . He has turned his life around and is now Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services. 'In 1988, my husband left prison after being charged and convicted of a similar crime to these young men. I imagine what would have happened if he had been caught in Thailand instead of in Australia where that crime was committed, where he was coming back to Australia,' Ms Plibersek said in Parliament.","Bali duo have reportedly been moved out of prison for execution .

"A homeless man was shot dead by police after he hit two officers with rocks and refused to put down other stones, authorities have said. Police Chief Bob Metzger told a news conference that officers had used a stun gun on Antonio Zambrano-Montes in Pasco, Washington, but it had no effect. He added because of Zambrano-Montes's 'threatening behavior', police fired their guns. Metzger said he did not know whether a weapon was found. But multiple witnesses say the man was running away from the scene when he was killed at about 5pm on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Erika Zambrano holds a photo of shooting victim Antonio Zambrano-Montes outside the city hall building in Pasco, Washington. He was shot and killed by Pasco police officers during a confrontation on Tuesday . They told the Tri-City Herald the man had run about half a block when he was killed about 5pm on Tuesday near the Fiesta Foods store. The 35-year-old's last address was a Pasco homeless shelter, according to Franklin County Coroner Dan Blasdel. He was an orchard worker raised in Michoacan, Mexico, who had lived in Pasco for the last ten years and didn't speak any English, the Tri-City Herald reported. His cousin Blanca Zambrano told the newspaper: 'He was a kind person, family-oriented. He was hardworking.' The shooting occurred after officers responded to a report of a man throwing rocks at cars at a busy intersection near a grocery store. Dario Infante, 21, of Pasco, recorded video from a vehicle about 50 feet away as the scene unfolded. He said he decided to start recording when he saw an officer trying to use a stun gun on the man. Infante said he saw the man throw a few rocks at police officers but he didn't see him hit any officers. Five 'pops' are audible shortly after the video begins, and the man can be seen running away, across a street and down a sidewalk, pursued by three officers. Police investigate the scene of an officer involved shooting at the intersection of 10th Avenue and Lewis Street in Pasco, Washington . As the officers draw closer to the running man, he stops, turns around and faces them. Multiple 'pops' are heard and the man falls to the ground. 'He didn't throw any rocks after he started running,' Infante said. Several dozen people gathered at Pasco City Hall yesterday afternoon to raise concerns about the shooting. The ACLU of Washington also issued a statement, calling the incident 'very disturbing.' The group's executive director, Kathleen Taylor said: 'Fleeing from police and not following an officer's command should not be sufficient for a person to get shot,' She added deadly force should be used only as a last resort. Pasco residents, pictured from left,  Angel Morgan, five, and his brother Jose Morgan, six, and Alex Gonzalez, four, and his brother Angel Gonzalez, eight, gather around a candlelit vigil yesterday in memory of Antonio Zambrano-Montes . Ben Patrick told the newspaper police fired at the man as his back was turned. 'I really thought they were just going walk up and tackle or tase him,' he said. 'But they opened fire. His back was turned.' Patrick's wife, Shannon, also said the man was running away. The shooting happened in front of her young children. 'He turned around to take off running and the cops just shot him,' she said. 'All he was trying to do was walk away.' Other witnesses heard officers give the man orders to stop and drop the rock. They said the man refused to listen. Metzger has identified the three officers involved in the shooting. They were placed on leave for the investigation, a standard practice. The Tri-City Special Investigation Unit, which will not include Pasco police, will investigate. Investigators are looking at cellphone video of the scene that has been posted online. Carlos Sanchez, who witnessed the shooting from the grocery store parking lot, also said it looked like the man was running away from officers when he was killed. 'They started shooting and they kept on shooting him,' he said. The case is the fourth fatal shooting involving a Tri-City police officer in Pasco in the last six months. Officers have been cleared of any wrongdoing in all three previous cases.","Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, was shot dead for his 'threatening behavior'

"New doubts have been cast over Brian Williams' claims he was friendly with the SEAL team responsible for killing Osama Bin Laden during his time in Iraq. The embattled broadcaster claims he received a soldier's knife as a gift and was given a piece of the helicopter used in the 2011 operation which led to the former  Al Qaeda leader's death. In interviews he also described flying alongside Navy SEAL Team Six in helicopters a number of times - a tale the U.S. Special Operations Command has disputed because they do not embed journalists with counter-terrorism units. The veteran journalist was also reporting on the conflict from Kuwait at the time he claimed to have arrived in Iraq with the elite team. The new allegations have surfaced just two days after the 55-year-old was suspended by the channel for six months without pay after lying about an RPG attack in Iraq. Scroll down for video . Revelations: Brian Williams openly talked about travelling with Nay SEAL Team Six the day after the raid which killed Osama Bin Laden on Daviud Letterman. The U.S Special Operations Command has however cast doubt on his claims . Shortly after the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks was killed in a secret operation in Pakistan, Williams started talking openly about the unit in interviews claiming he had the 'honor' of flying with them when he first arrived in Baghdad. The Huffington Post reported that during an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman the day after the Bin Laden raid in 2011, Williams said: 'We have some idea which of our special operations teams carried this out. It happens to be a team I flew into Baghdad with, on the condition that I would never speak of what I saw on the aircraft, what aircraft we were on, what we were carrying, or who we were after.' While anchoring NBC's Nightly News the following night he said: 'Now, people might be hearing about SEAL Team 6. I happen to have the great honor of flying into Baghdad with them at the start of the war.' A year later on the chat show he claimed he flew in with the military unit on March 22, 2003, three days after the invasion. However he was in Kuwait for the initial stages of the invasion and did not report from inside Iraq until April 9 - where he used a flashlight to speak to the camera. The embattled broadcaster is seen reporting from Baghdad International Airport. He claimed he arrived three days after the invasion on March 22, 2003. However he was stationed in Kuwait at the time . In another Late Show appearance in 2012, Williams told a soldier he admired his knife while they chatted over a box of Wheat Thins. He then told the host: 'Darned if that knife didn't show up at my office a couple weeks later.' It is allegedly one of the many memorabilia items Williams has been handed over the years - including signed sports memorabilia, autographs and a B-24 control panel from an American Second World War aircraft that was recovered in a field in Great Britain . Eight years after he was gifted the weapon he described how he received an un-signed thank you note with a package containing a piece of fuselage. He claims it was from the helicopter used in the raid on Osama Bin Laden's Pakistan compound. The aircraft was blown up by the commandos after the raid, fearing it contained sensitive material that could have got into enemy hands and used against the United States. In the months after the raid, John Kerry managed to secure a deal with Pakistan that saw some of the tail from the aircraft returned. United States Special Operations Command spokesman Ken McGraw told The Post Williams could only have received a piece of the helicopter after parts of it had been given back. He added: 'We do not embed journalists with this or any other unit that conducts counter-terrorism missions.' Stealth helicopter that Brian Williams claims he owns part of: The rotor blades of SEAL Team 6's damaged helicopter is seen lying near Osama bin Laden's compound after it was destroyed following the successful May 6 raid . Replacement: On Wednesday night, Williams' name was taken off the Nightly News' graphics and the program's title was officially changed . On Tuesday Williams was suspended for six months without pay after he admitted to lying about his time in Iraq. In a note sent to NBC staff, Deborah Turness, the president of NBC's news division, described his puffed-up retellings of events from 2003 as 'wrong and completely inappropriate'. Bosses at the network finally acted after deciding Williams's own decision last week to remove himself from anchoring for 'several days' was not enough. He claimed to have been insidean aircraft when it was hit by an RPG - he was actually around one mile away. On Wednesday, the network changed the name of the broadcast from NBC Nightly News With Brian Williams to NBC Nightly News. Acknowledging that it was 'an enormously difficult story' to report, the show aired a segment about Williams' six-month suspension and pledged to make itself worthy of viewers' trust. Replacement anchor Holt opened the report by saying: 'And now to the story many of you are talking about tonight and one that for us not only hits close to home but in our home.' Holt quoted from statements from Turness and Burke, in which they described Williams' actions as 'wrong and completely inappropriate,' and which jeopardized 'the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News.' Holt then added: 'Now if I may on a personal note say it is an enormously difficult story to report. 'Brian is a member of our family, but so are you, our viewers and we will work every night to be worthy of your trust.' Daily Mail Online has contacted NBC and the Special Operations Command for comment. Scandal: The newest allegations are concerning for Williams (pictured arriving for his appearance on Letterman's show in 2013) who is already facing an investigation by NBC News . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Broadcaster claimed he was given gifts by the elite military unit .

"A couple who had been married for 60 years died within 72 hours of each other after the husband was mugged by two drug addicts as he sat on his mobility scooter. Kenneth Duxbury, an Army veteran, was attacked and robbed  while on his way to pay a bill last August. The following day, after hearing of Mr Duxbury's ordeal, his wife Iris, 79, suffered a stroke and later died in hospital. The day after his beloved wife's death, the great-grandfather, 82, fell ill. He died 48 hours later. Devoted: Kenneth and Iris Duxbury, pictured on holiday in the 1990s, had been married for 60 years. They died just 48 hours apart from each other last September - days after  army veteran Mr Duxbury was mugged . Lifelong love: Mr and Mrs Duxbury, pictured on their wedding day. Mrs Duxbury suffered a stroke just hours after hearing of her husband's ordeal and later died in hospital. Mr Duxbury died 48 hours later . Career criminals Stephen McLeish, 33, and John Carroll, 36, both of Blackburn, Lancashire, were jailed for three years for the attack at Preston Crown Court yesterday. They were branded the 'scum of the earth' by Mr and Mrs Duxbury's family. Preston Crown Court was told Mr Duxbury  had been diagnosed with cancer and was confined to a wheelchair but was able to live an 'independent' life with his wife in an assisted living property. Mr Duxbury was cornered on August 29 last year, just moments after kissing his wife goodbye. He was targeted by McLeish and Carrol after they spotted him while picking up methadone from a chemist. They approached him as he passed under a railway bridge on his 5mph mobility scooter. Prosecutor Miss Emma Keogh said: 'Although it was the middle of the morning, the railway bridge was much darker than the main street and there is no CCTV. Jailed: Career criminals Stephen McLeish, 33, (right) and John Carroll, 36, (left) both of Blackburn, Lancashire, were jailed for three years at Preston Crown Court yesterday for mugging Mr Duxbury . Secluded: Mr Duxbury was targeted by McLeish and Carrol after they spotted him while picking up methadone. They approached him as he passed under a railway bridge, pictured, on his mobility scooter . 'Mr Duxbury became aware of a man stood in front of him, blocking his path. He stopped Mr Duxbury and said, ""have you got the time?"". 'Mr Duxbury said, ""no sorry I don't have the time"". He tried to get past the man and tried to put the scooter between the man and the lamppost. 'But the man said, ""where's your money?"" and his arm was grabbed and pulled up by the side of him. He was aware there were two men and they were searching his pockets. He said: ""You are not getting it"" as realised they were after his wallet. Not content with taking his wallet, they also went in his pocket trying to look for change. One said, 'come on let's go' and they ran off.' Mr Duxbury made his way home to his wife and called the police with a description of his attackers. But the following morning Iris, a former cotton mill worker, was taken to hospital after suffering a stroke. She died on 12 September. Mr Duxbury gave a statement to police in which he said: '£250 is a lot of money to somebody like me. This is a cowardly and despicable crime to rob a pensioner in a mobility scooter.' On September 13 he was rushed into hospital when a viral infection which had collected around his tumour worsened and he died two days later. Police tracked down the two men after Mr Duxbury identified them from CCTV images taken at the chemist in the run up to his death. Miss Keogh added: 'Whilst in the chemist taking methadone, they come out and become aware of Mr Duxbury in his wheelchair. Tragic: Mr Duxbury, pictured with Mrs Duxbury, was cornered on August 29 last year, just moments after kissing his wife goodbye. He was targeted by two drug addicts as they saw him on his mobility scooter . 'At that point there must have been a discussion about what they were going to do. There must be an element of pre-planning. 'He was clearly vulnerable by his disability. This offence is tragic in that the day after the offence Mr Duxbury's wife had a stroke and was taken into hospital and died. 'But even more tragic is that days after the offence Mr Duxbury died too.' Carroll had a number of theft and drug offences and a robbery conviction in 1999 for which he spent 18 months behind bars whilst McLeish had a record for dishonesty matters, burglary and shoplifting as well as GBH in 2002 for which he went to jail for four years. In mitigation for Carroll, defence counsel Anthony Parkinson said: 'He makes comment to the fact that this incident will not leave him on being released from prison. Brave: Mr Duxbury, pictured, was stopped by the muggers while he was on his way to pay a bill . 'It is something he will have to live with for the remainder of his life. He also describes how it not only affects him but his immediate family. 'Everyone knows about the offence. He has suffered from a long standing drug addiction. He has misused heroin and diazepam.' Mr Adrian Williams, for McLeish, said: 'They were in a cycle at the time. A downward spiral and my submission is that they took the opportunity that presented to them and in Mr McLeish's own words, 'a desperate, disgusting, impulsive act'. Passing sentence the judge Mr Recorder Terence Rigby said: 'You are two very wretched men who lived a very wretched life with drink and drugs. 'There is no point me lecturing you and I can't do better than the description of Mr Duxbury of the crime, it was cowardly and despicable. 'You did not know he was dying from cancer but you did know he was disabled, only getting around in a disability scooter, no one to help him, no one to protect him and you robbed him. 'The normal guidance is up to three years but it's clear to me that this is not long enough.' After the case Mr and Mrs Duxbury's son Stephen Duxbury, 57, a security officer said: 'These two are nothing but the scum of earth and I feel angry towards them. 'I hope they are remorseful and they don't do it again but that's about as much as I can hope for. You hope it will make them think twice about doing it again but it probably won't. 'Losing one parent is bad enough but two in the space of three days is heartbreaking. There is no way of knowing if what these lads did had an effect on them - but it can't have helped. 'Dad was effectively dying anyway but that does not lessen the disgusting way these two men treated him. 'He had got the scooter so he could keep up his independence and had bought this chair so it could help him stand up. All he was doing was paying a bill and it happened literally around the corner from home. 'Dad was used to taking care of himself but must have felt very intimidated. He said if it wasn't for his muscle wastage he would have clocked them. 'No one should suffer something like that, whether an old age pensioner or not. Mum and Dad were very close and they did everything together. 'It must have knocked mum for six when she heard about the mugging and I think when she passed away a little part of my dad gave up.

"She was just 17 when she wowed judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry in the latest series The Great British Bake Off judges- all while studying for her A-levels. Now teenager Martha Collison has landed her own column in the Waitrose Weekend newspaper alongside the likes of Pippa Middleton. The youngster, who was fitting in the competition between her school studies in Maths, Chemistry and Food Technology, became a favourite with the nation's amateur bakers. The Berkshire schoolgirl made it through to the quarter finals, despite the sometimes ferocious assessments of judges, Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood. Martha Collison (pictured)  has landed her own column in the Waitrose Weekend newspaper alongside the likes of Pippa Middleton . At one point she nearly fainted because of the stress and heat of the ovens, while she was even reduced to tears when Mary delivered a withering assessment of her custard tart's 'soggy bottom'. Her nemesis came in week seven when the éclair challenge proved too much for the drained and exhausted youngster. 'I was juggling revising with baking and it was just a bit of a car crash moment,' she said. 'When you're there on the location, it's the only thing in the world that matters. 'I never thought I'd be one of those people who cries. I thought, I'll be really strong and I just won't do it. But you just can't help it – you're just overcome with emotion because you're so tired and you've worked so hard for that one thing. 'It's a bit embarrassing, but you do cry. I think pretty much everyone cried at some point.' However, the competition's youngest ever contestant is positively gleeful now after landing a column with the Waitrose Weekend magazine, alongside the likes of Pippa Middleton, Clare Balding, and Mariella Frostrup. She has undergone something of a make-over to be pictured wielding a Valentine' Day cupcake on the weekly magazine's front cover as she begins a new career as a celebrity columnist and baking guru. 'I am so excited. I really can't believe it,' she said. The youngster, who was fitting in the competition between her school studies in Maths, Chemistry and Food Technology, became a favourite with the nation's amateur bakers when she appeared on The Great British Bake Off . Martha impressed judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry when she appeared on the the latest series of the show . When on the BBC show, Martha was essentially following existing recipes, however her new column will feature cakes and buns she has created using the skills and tips that she picked up. 'It's been a learning curve, but through Bake Off I got better and better over the weeks, and I really fell in love with it,' she said. Martha said the whole experience and having to work alongside older people was daunting, however they were very supportive and have become what she calls her 'baking family'. 'I was nervous that they were all looking at me like I was some child. Nancy asked me straight out if I was 10. But after a couple of weeks into it, I'd done some good bakes, I'd proved myself worthy to be there, and then I just relaxed and loved every minute of it, ' she said . Martha, who is a church-going Christian, said there have been some negative aspects to becoming well-known, but the competition has totally transformed her life. Amazingly, she is spending her half-term break in Cambodia with the Tearfund charity as ambassador where she is visiting victims of child trafficking and doing baking workshops with them. 'Obviously you get some people who don't like you, and sometimes you can't help reading it because it just flashes up. But I didn't seek it out – I didn't read comments on news articles and stuff,' she said. 'Some stuff you'd see and wish you hadn't read. But a lot of mine was really positive, and whenever I went out people would stop me and tell me I'd done really well. There aren't many nicer things than people just stopping you and complimenting you in the street.' Martha has connections with Waitrose in that she used to work part-time on the cheese counter in the chain's branch in Sunningdale, Berkshire, on a Wednesday evening and Saturday afternoon. Martha's first column for the upmarket chain's free  newspaper will be tempting readers with a range of her own Valentine-inspired recipes, including raspberry & coconut ice cupcakes and mini berry pavlovas . She admits that all the time spent on baking and preparing for the competition distracted her from her studies. As a consequence, she says her results were okay, rather than fantastic. 'I was just happy to pass, because I hadn't really given a thought to them. Even though I tried to revise, I was thinking, what kind of biscuit scene shall I make?' she said . Martha is currently juggling her baking career with her A level studies, which will be now taken over three years rather than two. 'Bake Off has completely turned my life upside-down. I do things every day that 18-year-olds don't do, and it's just so exciting,' she said. 'I'm going to Cambodia to investigate child trafficking. And it's linked to baking because they've got a safe house on the border between Cambodia and Thailand where they teach the girls that have been rescued different skills,' she said. She is also going to be baking with the Archbishop of Canterbury in front of an audience of 500 as part of an event to support the homeless in Birmingham. 'It's just a bit of fun. He wants to learn some skills. I'm teaching him to make a dessert that they can use in the homeless shelters of Birmingham,' she said. Martha's column will appear in Waitrose Weekend, the chain's free weekly newspaper, once a month and she will also be sharing her recipes on Waitrose TV. The first one this weekend will be tempting readers with a range of her own Valentine-inspired recipes, including raspberry & coconut ice cupcakes and mini berry pavlovas. Asked about her signature dish, she said: 'I always go to a good chocolate cake recipe, or nice hot cinnamon buns for breakfast – that's my family's favourite.'","Martha Collison was 17 when she appeared in The Great British Bake Off .

"A North Seattle woman says she is about to losing her home after ignoring a lawsuit brought against her by an angry neighbor, who is complaining about a barking dog. Denise Norton says that her neighbor, Woodrow Thompson, sued her for 'profound emotional distress', claiming her dog, Cawper's 'raucously, wildly bellowing, howling and explosively barking' could reach 128 decibels. That amount of decibels makes the dogs barking almost as loud as a jet engine. However Norton never contested the lawsuit, and as a result the neighbor was awarded $500,000 by default, according to KOMO News. Scroll down for video . Dispute: Denise Norton (left) said she ignored the lawsuit because it had been one of many complaints from her neighbor and she did not think he was serious . Barking mad?: A lawsuit stemming from the barks of this dog, Cawper, may force its owner out of her home, after she failed to contest the dispute and was billed $500,000 . 'In my head, everything was so bogus that he'd been doing, I don't know why, I just didn't think it was real or something,' Norton told the local ABC News. 'The sheriff comes, puts the papers on the garage and the wall and everything and saying they were going to put the house up for sale.' Mike Fandel, a civil attorney with no ties to the case, said what happened is legitimate. 'You can bring a frivolous lawsuit and win if the other side doesn't show up,' he told KOMO. Norton admits it is her fault but for not challenging the 36-page suit, but says Cawper is not the problem Thompson made him out to be - and it's definitely not a $500,000 issue. 'Howling': The neighbor claims that Cawper's barking can reach 128 decibels, which is close to a jet engine . Up in arms: Denise Norton is now trying to have the decision reversed, but it's not looking good . Behave: Mrs Norton shows her dog is no terror during a TV interview inside her home . 'How can you give somebody a half-a-million-dollar lien over a dog barking?' Norton said. 'He's just a loving, nice dog.' Norton is now fighting to have the decision reversed. She said her savings have been drained by legal fees already and there is still a long way to go. A main part of her case is a camera on Thompson's property that points into her yard.

Called ThreatExchange, the site builds on Facebook’s existing ThreatData tools currently used to discover and tackle scams and cybercrime. 'ThreatExchange enables security professionals anywhere to share threat information more easily, learn from each other’s discoveries, and make their own systems safer,' explained the site. ‘Threats like malware and phishing typically go after multiple targets, and a successful attack at one place usually makes it easier to take over systems elsewhere. We share in each other’s fate.' It added that to 'be stronger together', companies need a more open approach to security to protect people's accounts and get rid of viruses. ThreatExchange builds on Facebook’s existing ThreatData tools currently used to discover and tackle scams and cybercrime. It is built on the existing Facebook platform, but the site added layers to the service to let partners search through available threat information more easily. These firms can also post threat information and discoveries to other partners. Threat data includes typically freely available information such as domain names sending out spam, or examples of malware, but Facebook has also built privacy tools into the system. This means if a company only wants to share certain information with select companies known to be experiencing the same issues, they can limit who this data is shared with.

Mark Hammell, manager of the Threat Infrastructure team at Facebook said: ‘A little over a year ago, a group of technology companies came together to discuss a botnet that was spreading a malware-based spam attack on all of our services. ‘We quickly learnt that sharing with one another was key to beating the botnet because parts of it were hosted on our respective services and none of us had the complete picture. Facebook said threats like malware and phishing (example of a tagging scam is pictured) typically go after multiple targets, and a successful attack at one place makes it easier to take over systems elsewhere. 'We share in each other’s fate. When one company gets stronger, so do the rest of us' explained the site . ‘During our discussions, it became clear that what we needed was a better model for threat sharing. ‘We have a vested interest in making the internet safer and giving people better ways to connect and share. ‘After working with a number of our peer companies to refine the structure and implementation, we are ready to introduce ThreatExchange and see what we can learn from each other.’","ThreatExchange builds on tools already used by Facebook to assess risks .

"Hunting is a sport that often takes place in spectacular surroundings. While some hunters may be tempted to try to capture these environments-and their unassuming target-in an opportunistic selfie, the margin of error is large. Footage has emerged of professional bow-hunter Cameron Hanes pausing from stalking a water buffalo in the Australian Outback to take a selfie of the animal, only for it to panic and run away. Professional bow-hunter Cameron Hanes lines up a shot against a water buffalo in outback Australia . Before shooting the animal, Hanes pauses to take a selfie on his mobile phone . Seemingly unphased, Hanes then approaches the camera man and says with a smile: ‘Don’t take a selfie at crunch time.’ ‘The good thing is,’ he continues, ‘this place is so awesome I’m not even worried about it.’ A herd of water buffaloes can be seen fleeing in the distance as he begins to line up another photograph on his phone. A native of Oregon in America, Hanes is an influential figure in the bow hunting community, hosting seminars at annual hunting events. The buffalo panics and escapes with the rest of the herd . Hanes, an influential figure in the hunting community, then approaches the camera man and says with a smile: ‘Don’t take a selfie at crunch time’ The video, uploaded to YouTube on Monday, was captured somewhere in ‘Australian back country,’ according to the description. It comes after a series of hunting photo misadventures in 2014. In July, a Belgian teenager who scored a modelling deal with L’Oreal had her contract cancelled after public furore over a Facebook image of her posing next a dead gazelle she hunted in Africa. Axelle Despiegelaere, 17, had scored the contract after images of her in the crowd of a world cup match between Belgium and the United States went viral.

Facebook deleted the images in July following a petition signed by a quarter of a million people urging Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to have them removed.","The video comes from somewhere in the 'Australian backcountry'

"This is the incredible moment a unsuspecting wildebeest was attacked by crocodile and a hippopotamus at exactly the same time while drinking from an African river. The stunning photographs were taken by amateur photographer Nick Kleer, 27, on a visit to the Shingilana Dam in Londolozi Private Game Reserve, South Africa. He said the wildebeest was drinking the water when a hungry crocodile appeared out of nowhere and launched its attack. Seconds later a furious hippo joined the fight after apparently becoming irritated that the battle to the death was going on so close to where it was wading. Scroll down for video .

Grab: Nick Kleer said the wildebeest was drinking the water when a hungry crocodile appeared out of nowhere and launched its attack, dragging the animal in to the water . Mr Kleer said the crocodile snapped at the unsuspecting wildebeest while it was taking a drink on the bank's edge, dragging it into the water where a furious battle ensued. The thrashing caught the attention of a nearby hippo, which became aggravated and initiated a fierce three-way tussle. An hour of fighting then ensued, with the wildebeest thrashing and trying to make its escape while the crocodile attempted to tear at its flesh and the hippo tired to sink its massive incisors in to struggling animals back. To make matters worse a pack of hungry hyenas gathered at the waters edge hoping to pick off the wounded wildebeest should it manage to make it out of the water. Eventually the exhausted wildebeest gave up the fight, allowing the crocodile to have its dinner and the hippo to return to its wading. The hyenas, needless to say, went hungry.

He stumbled upon what became an hour-long battle while standing close to the Shingilana Dam - an area of the game park where numerous animals come to drink. Describing the fight to the death, Mr Kleer said: 'It was such an unexpected and aggressive reaction from the hippo towards the wildebeest.' 'I was under the impression the hippo would go for the croc instead of the wildebeest - but that was not the case,' he added. 'It was such a surreal experience and we couldn't quite believe what was happening. It was incredibly exciting,' Mr Kleer went on to say.

The Londolozi Private Game Reserve is part of the larger Sabi Sands Private Game Reserve, situated on the western border of the Kruger National Park in eastern South Africa. Londolozi is a Zulu word meaning 'protector of all living things', with the park having been converted from a hunting farm to an ecological centre in the 1970s. The park has five separate lodges in which visitors can stay, with all of the so-called 'big five' African game animals living in the area. Although the term 'big five' was coined by game hunters to refer to five animals it was hardest the kill, it has since been adopted by tour organisers to describe the five animals to try to spot on safari. The 'big five' African game animals are the African lion, the African elephant, the Cape buffalo, the African leopard, and the white or black rhinoceros.","Wildebeest was drinking from Shingilana Dam in South Africa's Londolozi Private Game Reserve .

"A 28-year-old middle school teacher has surrendered to police after allegedly sending sexts, explicit photos and videos of sex acts to a 14-year-old male student. Whitney Blair Fetters, a Spanish teacher at Hefner Middle School in Putnam City, Oklahoma, handed herself into police on Wednesday after an arrest warrant was issued. Police moved in after it emerged that Fetters was planning to invite the boy over to spend the night with her while she was house-sitting on February 13 'so they could get high and have sex', according to investigators. Scroll down for video . Whitney Blair Fetters, 28, a middle school teacher from Oklahoma, surrendered to police on Wednesday after she was arrested for indecent exposure and lewd proposals to a child younger than 16 . Police moved in after it emerged that Fetters was planning to invite the boy over to spend the night with her while she was house-sitting on February 13 'so they could get high and have sex', according to investigators . She faces charges of indecent exposure, lewd proposals to a child younger than 16, soliciting sexual conduct or communication with a minor by use of technology and a computer crimes act violation. Temptation: The victim is believed to have sent the first sexually explicit message, telling Fetters (left and right) he thought she was 'hot' She was released from Oklahoma County jail on Wednesday after posting $10,000 bail. Fetters graduated from the University of Central Oklahoma with a BA in Spanish. According to public records, she is not married. Fetter met the victim when he was 12 at the middle school and the two began sending each other harmless text messages. But police said what started out as an innocent exchange took a turn in December, when Fetters and the student allegedly began sending sexts and videos of sexual acts. Fetters allegedly sent the teenage boy nude photos of herself. Police learned of the alleged relationship between Fetters and the minor in January when the student's parents found the pictures and contacted authorities. Court documents cited by News9 indicated that the victim sent the first sexually explicit message, telling Fetters he thought she was 'hot.' The text was accompanied by a partially nude photo of the boy. Police said the pair proceeded to swap at least 20 X-rated photos, videos of themselves performing sex acts and explicit snap chats. During a search of Fetters' family home, police seized her cell phone, computers, marijuana, and lingerie matching the photos found on the student's iPad. Documents revealed that the 14-year-old, who is now in high school, had made an attempt to cover up his relationship with the Spanish teacher. He had tried to delete the explicit photos and videos, but police were able to collect and review all the evidence. Officials learned of the allegations against the middle school teacher on January 30. Fetters was removed from her job at that time. The station WSET reported that one text allegedly sent by Fetters to the boy read: ‘Touching myself is fun.’ Another featured a photo of the 28-year-old wearing only her underwear with a suggestive text that read, ‘That’s all you get.’ According to a statement from Putnam City Schools, they will fully cooperate with the Oklahoma City Police Department in the investigation.

"David Cameron was under renewed pressure last night to tackle Barack Obama over America’s failure to release Guantanamo inmate Shaker Aamer. In a bitter blow to campaigners fighting for the 48-year-old, it emerged that the US Defence Secretary has admitted that the last British resident at the notorious military camp is no nearer to freedom. Last month the US President promised to ‘prioritise’ the father-of-four’s case after the Prime Minister raised his plight during talks at the White House. Scroll down for video . Shaker Aamer, pictured, is being held by US authorities in Guantanamo Bay despite being cleared for release . Prime Minister David Cameron has been urged to press US authorities for Mr Aamer's release . But almost a month on, no action has been taken – prompting accusations Mr Obama has fobbed off Mr Cameron with ‘weasel words’, while putting Downing Street under pressure to step up its demands. Joanne MacInnes, co-ordinator of the We Stand For Shaker campaign, said: ‘David Cameron must do more to insist that the US releases Shaker. ‘If he really cared at all, he would have secured Shaker’s freedom a long time ago. ‘It inevitably raises questions about whether Britain is not doing enough because it has actually got something to hide.’ US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, who must give the final authority to transfer captives from the facility in Cuba, has confirmed Mr Aamer’s file had still not crossed his desk. Challenged on whether he was still willing to sign off the release of Guantanamo inmates, he dismayed Mr Aamer’s supporters by telling reporters recently he had nothing pending in his in-tray. Responding to claims he had one file ‘on his desk’, he said: ‘I don’t know about one still on my desk, unless it’s under my desk. As far as I know, I have made a decision on everything that is ready to be made a decision on.’ US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, pictured, said he has not seen Mr Aamer's file to sign his release . On Saturday, Mr Aamer, who lived in South London with his wife and four children, will have been held in Guantanamo for exactly 13 years without charge or trial. He has twice been cleared for release – first by the Bush administration in 2007 and again by President Obama in 2009. Clive Stafford Smith, the detainee’s lawyer and director of human rights charity Reprieve, said: ‘The admission that Shaker’s case isn’t even on Chuck Hagel’s desk suggests that Obama’s claims to be prioritising it may be little more than weasel words. ‘If the US government wanted to prioritise invading a country, it could be done in a week. So sending one man home to his family in London cannot be too much to ask. ‘Coming just days after David Cameron personally requested that Shaker be returned home to Britain, it doesn’t say much for the state of the so-called special relationship.’ Mr Stafford Smith added: ‘The suspicion must be that the US fears he will reveal yet more about its shameful torture programme if he is ever allowed to speak freely.’ Tory MP David Davis said: ‘It is simply not good enough for the US Defence Secretary to ignore decisions made by two US presidents. He should be released without further ado.’ The US administration has said it is ‘aggressively pursuing the transfer’ of Guantanamo’s remaining inmates. The number has plunged to 122 from a peak of 650, and Mr Obama has vowed to close the detention camp before the end of his term in office. Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and married, securing leave to remain in Britain. In 2001, he was detained in Kabul after going to Afghanistan to carry out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity, his representatives claim. His supporters allege he was then captured by bounty hunters, handed to the US military for $5,000 and tortured at a secret ‘black site’ prison – effectively a dungeon. He was then sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002.","Shaker Aamer has been twice cleared for release by US authorities .

"Former New York Knicks power forward Anthony Mason is in a critical condition tonight after a massive heart attack. Retired NBA writer Peter Vecsey tweeted earlier Wednesday that the 48-year-old athlete suffered congestive heart failure and had four surgeries over the course of nine hours. His two sons, Anthony Jr and Antoine, are currently at his bedside at the hospital. Mason's mother, Mary, will celebrate her 90th birthday tomorrow. 'Fighting for his life': Former New York Knicks power forward Anthony Mason (pictured left in 1995 and right in 2013) is in critical condition tonight after a massive heart attack . Mason's old team sent out this tweet Wednesday as news of his health crisis began circulating online . According to Vecsey, the 6-foot-7, 350lbs Mason has been struggling with heart problems recently. On Wednesday, he was at a hospital undergoing tests when he suffered a heart attack. While the Knicks would not directly address Mason's health crisis, the team sent out a tweet that read: 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Anthony Mason and his family.' Mason played for six different teams between 1989 and 2003, including five memorable seasons with the Knicks in the mid-90s. In 1994, he helped the New York team reach the NBA Finals. A year later, Mason was named the league's Sixth Man of the Year, and in 2001 he became an All-Star with the Miami Heat. Athlete: Mason played for six different teams between 1989 and 2003, including five memorable seasons with the Knicks . Storied career: The power forward averaged 10.8 points and 8.3 rebounds a game over the course of his 13-season career . Known for his aggressive, physical style on the court, Mason gave himself the nickname 'Locksmith', saying, ‘Put me on anybody, and I’ll lock them up,' according to the New York Post. The power forward averaged 10.8 points and 8.3 rebounds a game over the course of his 13-season career. He made more than 50 per cent of his shots in a total of 882 games, reported CBS Sports. A native of Miami, Florida, Mason grew up and went to school in Queens, New York. In 1988, Mason was drafted out of Tennessee State University by the Portland Trail blazers as a third-round pick. Both of Mason's sons followed his in footsteps: Anthony Jr played for St John's University between 2005-2010, and Antoine is currently a guard on Auburn University's team.","Retired NBA writer Peter Vecsey tweeted the 48-year-old athlete suffered congestive heart failure and had four surgeries .

"Holes in the walls, cracks in the plaster and peeling tiles are just three of a long list of problems one homeowner discovered when he moved into his £580,000 dream house. Luke Mahon and his wife, Alison, 35, hoped the newly-built property would be the perfect place to start a family. But they soon uncovered major faults with their four-bedroom home - and have catalogued 140 since moving in five months ago. And Mr Mahon, 45, is so frustrated with homebuilder Taylor Wimpey that he has set up a Twitter account to list them - and warn others off buying similar homes. Freezing: Luke Mahon, 45, was shocked to discover the loft of his newly-built four-bedroom home, pictured, had not been fitted with insulation . Poorly finished: The £3,000 granite kitchen worktop if the £580,000 property, pictured, was not fitted properly, leaving gaps between two pieces . Sludge: The Mahons also discovered that no turf had been laid in the garden - just one of 140 faults they uncovered in the property . The couple first found signs of wear and tear - including cracks in the walls and plaster - shortly after moving in to the home at Woodley, Berkshire, last September. They also encountered bigger problems, such as a badly-fitted £3,000 granite kitchen unit and a misplaced toilet, in the detached home. And when temperatures started to plummet last winter, marketing director Mr Mahon discovered his home - which was advertised as being 'energy efficient' - had not been fitted with loft insulation. He has created a Twitter account to vent his frustration, and publicly document the long list of problems that he claims have yet to be fixed. Desperate: This photograph, which appears to show poorly-finished floorboards, was captioned with the words 'please fix our house!' Warning: The toilet is off-centre, left, and, right, the photographs and notice the Mahons' posted on their windows to publicise their problems . 'Gaping holes': This photograph shows a corner of the house that appears to be exposed to the outside, it was posted on Twitter by Mr Mahon . Using the account @MyHouseSucks, Mr Mahon shares photographs taken inside his home along with captions explaining what is wrong. No loft insulation . Poorly-fitted kitchen counter . No grass in the garden . Gaping hole in corner of one wall . Off-centre toilet . Unfinished floor . Faulty bathroom mastic . Peeling plaster and paintwork . Cracks on toilet floor . Gaps in bathroom sealant . Wonky doors . Ill-fitting toilets . Not energy efficient . He said: 'I shouldn't have to resort to these sorts of measures to get something done. 'I'm really disappointed because we were told we'd have a new home that would not need any work as we want to start a family. We lived in Caversham for seven years and did a lot of work on it. We didn't want to live in a building site again, and that's what's happened.' The couple have even posted the photos in the windows of their home along with a warning to house-hunters hoping to buy a property in the same new development. And the Mahons are not the only couple to have experienced problems since moving to the 48-home estate. Jason and Tracey Bass said their home has been a constant building site since they moved in last summer. The couple have had three separate patios installed in just six months after bodged building work meant rainwater kept flowing into their garage and flooding it. Mr Bass said: 'We haven't found anyone living here who is happy. 'The site manager told one lady who lives on her own that they are building water-tight properties, not Rolls Royces. But we are paying Rolls Royce prices. It's disgraceful.' Mrs Bass added: 'We have reached rock bottom with the circumstances that we find ourselves in.' House builder Taylor Wimpey insists it is constantly working with residents to repair faults. A spokesman said: 'We would like to apologise to Mr Mahon and his wife for the issues they have experienced with their new home. We are in regular contact with the customers, and have met with them to discuss their specific concerns. 'During these meetings we have agreed the work that will be undertaken to resolve the issues and we will complete this as soon as possible.'

Frustrated: Marketing manager Luke Mahon, left, and one of the photographs of peeling paint he posted using the @MyHouseSucks account .

"Islamic State religious police have been filmed beating musicians and destroying their instruments as punishment for playing an 'un-Islamic' keyboard. The men were pictured being hit across the back and legs with a wooden stick in a public square after ISIS's fanatical Islamic enforcers ruled the electric keyboard was 'offensive to Muslims'. Another picture shows two keyboards and what appears to be a lute smashed to pieces after raids thought to have taken place in Bujaq, a few miles to the east of Aleppo in  Syria. Scroll down for video . Musicians in Syria were given 90 lashes each after they were caught by the Islamic State's religious police playing an electric keyboard, which they deemed 'offensive to Muslims', according to pictures posted online . Pictures show the men being beaten on their backs and legs by tribal elders in a public square believed to be in Bujaq, a town to the north east of Aleppo . According to text posted along with the images on a file-sharing website, the musicians were punished with 90 lashes alongside a man caught impersonating a 'hisbah'. The Arabic term generally refers to the obligation on Muslim leaders to uphold the law, but in this context likely refers to a local official or tribal elder. According to the online post, which claims to have come from ISIS's information office in Aleppo, a man caught smuggling cigarettes was also punished with 50 lashes. Since taking control of large parts of Syria and Iraq last year ISIS claims to have formed a Caliphate in the Middle East, and has taken to enforcing strict Sharia law within its borders. Thieves are regularly pictured having their hands or arms amputated in public squares amid crowds of onlookers, while adulterers have been executed. The men were apparently caught playing electronic keyboards, and what appears to be a lute, instruments that were deemed to be 'un-Islamic' by ISIS's fanatical religious police . After the men had been beaten the instruments were destroyed. ISIS has been enforcing a terrifying vision of Sharia law across its so-called Caliphate, including executing people for breeding pigeons . Earlier today, it was reported that at least 15 pigeon breeders in eastern Iraq were rounded up  after ISIS ruled the sport distracted them from praising Allah. Three of those held by the group in the eastern province of Diyala have reportedly been killed, according to a security official. Abu Abdullah, a farmer, said a total of six gunmen barged into his home earlier this week and dragged away his 21-year-old son. Mr Abdullah's son is just one of the 15 young men – all aged between 16 and 22 – who have reportedly been captured in the province for breeding birds. Yesterday it was reported that 13 youngsters were killed by firing squad in Iraq's second city of Mosul for watching an Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan. According to Arabic script posted alongside the pictures, the men were given 90 lashes, along with another man caught impersonating a hisbah - likely referring to a local official or elder . The message, which claims to be from the information office in Aleppo, also said another man was given 50 lashes for helping to smuggle cigarettes into the country . Activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, which operates out of Syria, reported that the teenagers were shot in public and their bodies left there as their parents are too afraid to go and get them. The boys' 'crime' - breaking religious laws by watching football - was read out on a loudspeaker before their executions. It came just days after ISIS released a video showing two men being thrown off the top of a tower block in Raqqa, Syria, for being gay. A masked Islamic State fighter announced the charges against the accused using a small handheld radio, before declaring them guilty of engaging in homosexual activities. He said they should be punished by death, in accordance with Islamic State's radical interpretation of Sharia law. The men were then bound and blindfolded before being pushed off the 100ft tower block to their death. Just a few days ago footage emerged showing men being thrown off the top of a 100ft tower in Raqqa, Syria, after being accused of being gay by ISIS police .","Men given 90 lashes for making music which is 'offensive to Muslims'

"With a rooftop pool, an indoor football pitch and a private climbing wall, Google’s vision for its Kings Cross headquarters sounded more like a giant holiday camp than an office. The architect’s plans showed pictures of staff cycling between meetings, and lounging about in cosy nooks in a carefully manicured roof garden. But Google boss Larry Page ordered the extravagant plans to be ripped up because they were too boring. Google boss Larry Page has ordered extravagant plans for his company's new London offices to be scrapped . The company's headquarters in California is known for its bike paths and recreational facilities (pictured) Mr Page, who co-founded the American technology giant, ordered the UK team to go back to the drawing board and come up with a building worthy of existing for 100 years. Google originally hoped that the £1bn development would be ready in 2016, but that deadline is now looking more than a little ambitious. Building work on the site behind Kings Cross has not started, putting the project at least a year behind schedule. From the outside, the shelved plans looked like an office block that might have belonged to any wealthy company. Up to 4,500 staff would have been housed in a glassy, 11-storey, structure, occupying a narrow, wedge-shaped strip of land behind Kings Cross station. The building’s most distinguishing features were its spacious interiors and extensive facilities. Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, the architecture firm which was primarily responsible for the plans, said it would be ‘organised around a looped three-dimensional promenade’, and ‘sit upon a retail plinth punctuated by three generous light-filled halls’. Cycling ramps, terraces and a large roof garden were supposed to create an ‘easy and enjoyable journey that encourages encounter’. ‘The idea is that the people who are in the building…need to be attracted to the actual building,’ architect Simon Allford said, shortly after the blueprint was unveiled. Camden Council gave its blessing to the project by granting it planning permission, but it was not good enough to please the powers that be at Google’s global headquarters. Mr Page scrapped the design, and ordered the team to come up with a new, more ‘Googly’ building, whose exterior lived up to its zany interior. The company's current London offices (pictured) will soon be replaced by a new building in King's Cross . Google's sprawling Mountainview site in California (pictured) boasts an on-site bowling alley, and volleyball court . Joe Borrett, the company’s European real estate boss, said that it would still build on the site. ‘King’s Cross is Google’s future home in London. As we raise our ambitions on what we can achieve in developing our own building, this will inevitably take some additional time. We look forward to working with our partners and local community as our new designs come together.’ Google is known for its unusual offices around the world, which often feel more like a playground than a work space. The sprawling Mountainview site boasts an on-site bowling alley, a volleyball court, yurt-shaped meetings rooms and ‘pods’ for staff who want to sleep, not to mention 19 free restaurants and 60 snack kitchens. Meanwhile, Google’s offices in London’s Victoria includes a room stocked with musical instruments, like a teenage boy’s fantasy bedroom. The extraordinary campuses are designed using data about staff movements at work, helping to create an environment which works them harder, and makes many employees reluctant to leave. However, Google has always tended to refit existing offices, instead of designing its own building. Sources said bosses were eyeing the Kings Cross site as a chance to do things differently.

"A schoolboy has tragically died after being hit on the head by a bottle thrown across the playground. Oisin McGrath, 13, was struck while playing football on his lunch break at St Michael's College in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, on Monday afternoon. A 17-year-old boy was arrested and later bailed pending further police inquiries into what happened. Tragedy: Schoolboy Oisin McGrath was playing football on his lunch break when he was hit in the head by a bottle. A keen sportsman, he is seen here playing Gaelic football for his local team . Peter Robinson, First Minister of Northern Ireland, sent a message of condolence on Twitter and wrote: 'Young Oisin McGrath's death is heartbreaking. 'I'll be praying for his family and all those devastated by this sad news tonight.' Sources at the school said Oisin was playing football with friends when he was hurt. It is believed a water bottle was thrown across the playground and struck the schoolboy on the head. Condolences: Peter Robinson, First Minister of Northern Ireland, sent a message of condolence on Twitter, writing: 'Young Oisin McGrath's death is heartbreaking' Local priest Father Seamus Quinn had been at Oisin's bedside along with his devastated family. He said: 'They are stunned, numb and utterly shocked, with their hearts broken. 'People were shocked when they heard that there were no signs of life and the support would be gradually removed.' Oisin, a keen sportsman from the village of Belcoo in Fermanagh, was being treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) in Belfast. Fr Quinn described Oisin as a very well-grounded and well-rounded young teenager, and added: 'He was happy and helpful, genuinely helpful, intelligent young fellow. 'They are a well-loved and well-respected family, they are solid, salt of the earth people, faith-based people, Christian people.' He said the community in Belcoo had been united in prayer for Oisin, with 500 people attending Catholic Mass on Wednesday night at St Patrick's Church in nearby Holywell, a small village outside Belcoo. Fr Quinn added: 'There is a silence in the village, there was a silence after Mass last night, naturally people were just dumbfounded and in shock. 'For anybody who has children it is their worst nightmare.' Closed: St Michael's College in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, where the incident happened, will be closed on Friday 'in the light of the tragic events this week and the impact on the school community' The teenager played Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) football in Belcoo. His mother Sharon is secretary in the local club. Paul McGrath, coach of the Belcoo under-14 side, described Oisin as a 'good, quiet lad'. Fr Quinn had earlier told how Oisin's mother Sharon had spoken of her sympathy for the other youth's parents. He said: 'I heard his mother saying there was some other poor family suffering at the moment. She said that yesterday. She was very concerned about Oisin's friends too. 'I would echo that myself. Our hearts go out to anybody else involved in this if there was some sort of accident. Nobody sets out to do this; it was obviously an accident of some description.' St Michael's is a Catholic boys' grammar school with 700 pupils, and a statement from the school said: 'A group of students were playing at lunchtime when one student became unwell and we sought medical assistance.' A notice on St Michael's College website said it would be closed on Friday  'in the light of the tragic events this week and the impact on the school community'.","Oisin McGrath was hurt on Monday afternoon while on his lunch break .

"The parents of a US journalist who was kidnapped in Syria more than two years ago claim communication from White House officials about their son has been 'exquisitely horrible' and the Barack Obama has never spoken to them. Despite a pledge by the President to work with families of hostages and do anything to try and find them, Marc and Debra Tice claim he has never spoken to them about the disappearance of their son Austin and the only certain thing they have is that they have no idea where he is. Austin Tice was last heard from in August 2012 near Damascus as he took photos to report on the conflict for a number of news organisations. Scroll down for video . Austin Tice was last heard from directly on August 13, 2012, near Damascus, while travelling to Lebanon . Mr and Mrs Tice said communication from the White House has been very limited since their son's disappearance. 'That line of communication has primarily been one way,' Mrs Tice told NBCNews. She said officials were keen for them to share any information they receive, but said communication back from them 'has been exquisitely horrible, honestly.' The couple have struggled with the normal approach to keep a low media profile that officials believe can captives safer, and have instead done publicity campaigns in the hope that the American Government may take more action. The former Marine was in the region reporting for McClatchy News, the Washington Post, CBS and others when he was taken. So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and no demands have been made. Earlier this week Mr Obama said the Government would do all it could to help find people who had been taken hostage after kidnapping victim Kayla Mueller was confirmed dead. The 26-year-old aid worker from Austin was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013 by ISIS. Marc and Debra Tice said communication from the US Government has been poor and 'exquisitely horrible' The extremists said she had died during a Jordanian air strike on Friday. Mr Obama said: 'It's as tough as anything that I do -- having conversations with parents who understandably want, by any means necessary, for their children to be safe. 'We will do everything we can short of providing an incentive for future Americans to be caught.' Footage of a man who appeared to be Austin surfaced in September 2012. In a crudely shot video, a group of armed men lead a blindfolded American up a rocky hillside, where he makes statements in broken Arabic before becoming too distressed to carry on. Barack Obama said this week that the Government would do everything possible to try and find hostages . The former Marine was reporting for McClatchy News, the Washington Post and CBS when he was taken . The identity of the man hasn't been confirmed, but friends of Austin believe it is him. At the time Mr and Mrs Tice said: 'Austin is the oldest of our seven children. The Tice kids are very close, and Austin's absence is agonizing. 'We steadfastly work and pray for Austin's safe return. We are sustained by our faith and by the kind thoughts and prayers that are being offered for Austin and our family. We are humbled, amazed and deeply grateful for the tremendous outpouring of support and assistance we have received from every corner of the globe; affirmation of all the lives that have been touched by our extraordinary son.'","Austin Tice was last heard from in August 2012, working near Damascus .

"Nigel Farage has boasted he is fighting fit for the general election after he lost weight while giving up alcohol for January. The Ukip leader used a major speech in the Movie Star Cinema in Essex to set out his party's pitch for May 7, where everything from popcorn boxes to a smart car had been branded in Ukip colours. Ruling out a coalition with either Labour or the Tories, Mr Farage set out Ukip policies including taking workers on the minimum wage out of income tax and scrapping tuition fees for science and engineering students. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage appeared at the Movie Star Cinema in Canvey Island, Essex to set out his party's pitch for May 7 . Mr Farage boasted that he had lost weight and could now get into old suits after giving up alcohol for Dry January, but that didn't stop him tucking into Ukip-branded popcorn . Mr Farage seemed particularly amused by a washbag in a Benfleet as he campaigned ahead of the electon . Mr Farage used his first speech of the election year to claim that the Ukip 'people's army' will shake the Establishment in the general election on May 7. Appearing in Canvey Island, Essex, the Ukip leader was introduced on stage by Castle Point candidate Jamie Huntman who claimed Mr Farage 'refreshed the parts that other politicians cannot reach'. The party leader joked that it was 'very nice of him, after a dry January'. Mr Farage would not say how much weight he has lost, insisting he had not 'looked at the scales'. But he said: 'I did do 'dry January' and have lost a substantial amount of weight doing so. 'I'm fighting fit for the upcoming campaign. I didn't weigh myself at the start of January or at the end but I am wearing suits that I haven't squeezed into for years.' Mr Farage is famous for enjoying a pint of beer in front of the cameras but was overheard saying he 'wouldn't mind a G&T' as he arrived at the venue. The unlikely health regime did not stop Mr Farage from tucking into a tub of Ukip-branded popcorn as he appeared at the cinema. Mr Farage used his speech to rule out entering a coalition with either Labour or the Tories after the election . With the polls showing that no party is likely to get an overall majority in May, Mr Farage ruled out entering a formal coalition government with either Labour or the Tories. He said the three main parties do not 'believe in Britain' and predicted Ukip would win 'significantly more' than two or three seats. The only firm 'red line' commitment he made during the speech was that the party would not compromise on its call for an EU referendum. Mr Farage added: 'We will not enter a coalition, no matter how tempting ministerial cars may be. 'We will only do a deal with anyone on the condition that there is an in/out referendum on the EU.' He said Ukip was the only party standing up for the little man and that it would not engage in 'dirty politics' as its opponents 'turned nasty'. Ukip branding for the event covered popcorn boxes, posters, balloons and even a smart car . Mr Farage claimed his party was digging in to 'the ethnic community vote', adding that there would be 'lots of Ukip candidates' from minorities in the general election campaign . Castle Point is a key target seat for Ukip, with Mr Farage predicting his party will win 'significantly more' than two or three seats natonwide . Mr Farage also claimed his party was digging in to 'the ethnic community vote', adding that there would be 'lots of Ukip candidates' from minorities in the general election campaign. He told the crowd: 'We have crossed the class barrier in British politics. That is a remarkable achievement for Ukip and we pick up support from across every social spectrum. 'And we are also beginning now to dig quite deep into some of the ethnic community vote in this country as well, because people that have come to this country legally, that have made this country their home, that have integrated within our society, they want the Ukip agenda as much as anybody else. 'And what you will see during this election campaign are lots of Ukip candidates from the ethnic minorities. It is something the commentariat in Westminster probably won't understand but I think all of us in this room do.' Mr Farage drank a cup of tea at the Smallgains boatyard during a campaign stop on Canvey Island in Essex . Mr Farage, who is running to be an MP in South Thanet, said the party's policies - aside from taking the UK out of the EU - included taking those on the minimum wage out of tax, scrapping tuition fees for science and engineering students, stopping HS2 and injecting £3bn more a year into the NHS. He added he would 'fight' for a right of recall for MPs and axe taxes such as the so-called 'bedroom tax' and Labour's mooted mansion tax. But last night he claimed the party's supporters were more interested in its general approach than its detailed policies. He said: 'We will have a fully-costed manifesto, with policies across a range of issues. But I actually think people are looking for the right type of people – they are sick of the college kids of the political class who are in hock to the big corporates. We are different – we are unashamed to be patriotic. 'It's about a state of mind, an attitude. We are on the side of the small guy, we are on the side of patriotic people, we believe in a Britain that is free and independent with a proper border control policy, and people know that.' Labour frontbencher Jon Trickett said: 'No single speech is going to hide UKIP and Nigel Farage's long-held beliefs on increasing NHS privatisation and further tax breaks for those at the top. 'The truth is UKIP are a party of Tory people, Tory policies and Tory money: they are more Tory than the Tories.'","Farage rules out a coalition with Tories or Labour after the election .

"Members of Iraq's Yazidi minority have been accused of carrying out revenge attacks on Sunni Muslim villagers they believe helped Islamic State commit atrocities on their community last year. Arabs living in  Sinjar in Iraq's Nineveh province say groups of heavily armed Yazidis have made four raids on the villages over the past two weeks, leaving 21 people dead and a further 17 missing. Yazidis, whose ancient religion has elements of Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Islam, suffered grievously after ISIS' rapid offensive last year. Hundreds were killed and thousands captured, enslaved and raped by the Sunni Muslim militants, who consider Yazidis devil worshippers. Scroll down for videos . Revenge: Members of Iraq's Yazidi minority (pictured) have been accused of carrying out  attacks on Sunni Muslim villagers they believe helped Islamic State commit atrocities on their community last year . Displaced: Hundreds of Yazidids were killed and thousands captured, enslaved and raped by the Sunni Muslim militants, who consider the group devil worshippers. The rest, including these children, have had to relocate to one of the increasing number of camps for internally displaced people in Iraq . Yazidis returning to their homes in Sinjar are uncovering one mass grave after another in the area - evidence of ISIS rule there from last August until its fighters were driven out late last year. Now some Yazidis are striking back. More than a dozen Sunni Arab residents have told journalists that armed groups of Yazidis raided four of their villages in Sinjar two weeks ago, killing at least 21 people. A further 17 went missing. 'It was an act of revenge by the Yazidis,' said 41-year-old Dhafer Ali Hussein from Sibaya, one of the affected villages. 'The aim is to expel Arabs from the area so that only Yazidis remain: they want to change the map.' The identity of the Yazidi assailants is unclear because there are several competing forces fighting ISIS in Sinjar, with them all blaming each other for the raids.. But what is certain is that the reprisals expose how ISIS; incursion created divisions between communities that had coexisted for decades, turning one village against another and making enemies of former friends. They also show the risk of similar violence when other groups displaced by ISIS, such as Shi'ite Turkmen and Shabak, Christians and Kakais, are able to return home. Base: Members of the minority Yazidi sect are seen at one of their temporary camps on Mount Sinjar . A displaced girl from the Yazidi community is seen at Dawodiya camp for internally displaced people in Iraq . Amid ISIS' brutal rape and slaughter of the Yazidis, those who could fled in the summer heat in an exodus that prompted  U.S.-led airstrikes against the jihadists in both Iraq and Syria. Over the past week, the remains of more than 40 Yazidis who had been unable to leave before the arrival of ISIS were discovered in two bloodstained pits in northwest Iraq. Residents of Sibaya, now staying in another village about 28 miles away, say they helped Yazidis escape in August and stashed away their belongings for safekeeping, even though the jihadis punished those who were found doing so. But Yazidis from the nearby Gohbal settlement say Arabs in the surrounding villages sided with ISIS looting their possessions and actively participating in what they call attempted genocide. Sunni residents admitted several men from Sibaya had joined the militants but said they were killed or fled to Syria when Kurdish peshmerga forces drove Islamic State from the area in December. After regaining control, the peshmerga confiscated weapons from Arab villagers, who began to receive threats from Yazidis, culminating in the attack on Sibaya and Chiri on January 25. The following day, Yazidi gunmen plundered and torched the nearby Arab villages of Khazuga and Sayer, whose residents had already fled. Peshmerga intervened to prevent further attacks. Members of the Yazidi minority search for clues that might lead them to missing relatives in the remains of people killed by ISIS a day after Kurdish forces discovered a mass grave near the Iraqi village of Sinuni . Grim task: Kurdish forces found the remains of about 25 men, women and children of the Yazidi minority killed by the Islamic State in the grave while searching for explosives left behind by the terror group . Most of Sibaya's 1,000 residents were sleeping when gunshots signalled the arrival of a military convoy flying the Kurdish flag. At first, they thought peshmerga or Kurdish secret police known as Asayish, both of which recruit local Yazidis, were conducting a routine inspection. Two Yazidis, one in military uniform, came to 31-year old Nawaf Ahmed's house and ordered him to hand over his car keys and identification. 'Who does that belong to?' asked the one in uniform, pointing at an electricity generator, which Ahmed explained had been entrusted to him by a Yazidi friend. 'You are all Islamic State,' said the other, loading the generator into Ahmed's car and driving off with it. Dozens of civilian cars began to arrive from the direction of Gohbal and men, whom the Arab villagers identified as local Yazidis helped themselves to household appliances, vehicles and livestock. Women said the assailants, dressed in military and civilian clothing, pulled rings off their fingers and stole valuables from their pockets. Many people fled, some hiding in a nearby valley. Those who stayed said they saw the men spread out through Sibaya and pour petrol from jerry cans before setting fire to the village, incinerating several elderly people in their homes. Horror: Over the past week, the remains of more than 40 Yazidis who had been unable to leave before the arrival of ISIS were discovered in two bloodstained pits in northwest Iraq . Searching for answers they don't want to find: Members of the Yazidi sect sift through the skeletal remains . A skull is seen resting on the ground a day after at a mass grave containing the remains of members of the Yazidi community killed by ISIS is uncovered . Kheder Ahmed, a 35-year-old shepherd with mental disabilities, was tending his flock on the outskirts of Sibaya when a car sped up to him. His elder brother, Idrees, watched from a distance as a man got out of the vehicle and shot Kheder before making off with his sheep. Idrees later took Kheder to hospital in the Kurdish city of Duhok, where he lay last week with a bullet wound to his right side. On the same ward were six other villagers wounded in the attack, including 11-year-old Raddad, who had been shot twice. 'It was like Judgement Day had arrived,' Raddad's father said. As Sibaya burned, the gunmen moved on to Chiri, 2 km to the south, where 60-year-old Abdullah Muhammed watched smoke rising from the neighbouring village. One of the militants thrust a machine gun barrel in Muhammed's chest and ordered him out. 'Where should I go?' Muhammad recalled asking. 'Go to hell!' was the reply. 'We are the Yazidi state!' Muhammad said he had been spared because one of the assailants knew him personally and allowed him to escape. Jomaa Marii was less fortunate: he was shot dead in front of his wife. 'I saw it with my own eyes,' she said. Once night fell and the gunmen withdrew, residents of both villages returned to retrieve the dead, protected by peshmerga. Of the 10 corpses recovered from Sibaya, three were old women, residents told Reuters. Four bodies had been burned, one belonging to a community elder bound to a chair. Eleven corpses were found in Chiri. A member of the Yazidi minority searches in a wallet for clues to the identity of the victims . ISIS spearheaded a June offensive that began in the northern province of Nineveh, where this mass grave was discovered, and overran large areas north and west of the Iraqi capital . Slaughtered: ISIS carried out a campaign of killings, kidnappings and enslavement against Yazidi Kurds living in the area that the UN termed an 'attempt to commit genocide' The villagers accused prominent Yazidi fighter Qassem Shesho of involvement in the attacks. Shesho, who is close to the dominant Kurdistan Democratic Party, confirmed he had been in Sibaya and Chiri that day, but denied his men were responsible. 'Our traditions do not allow for that kind of behaviour,' he said, blaming 'extremists' serving a foreign agenda - a reference to the rival Kurdistan Workers' Party and its Syrian affiliate, which are fighting in Sinjar and have formed a Yazidi militia there. The PKK says it had nothing to do with it. Yazidi civilians took up arms alongside them during a months-long siege of Mount Sinjar by ISIS last year. Kurdish peshmerga and Asayish officers are also present in the area. Arabs and Yazidis agree Sinjar will never be the same as it was before Islamic State came, when they were friends and farmed together. Many Yazidis no longer trust the peshmerga to defend them, while the newly displaced Arabs, all from the Juhaish tribe, said they would return to their villages only if Kurdish forces physically separated them. Since the attack on Chiri and Sibaya, two Yazidis have been killed in Sinjar, in what some believe was an Arab reprisal. Others said it was an internal Yazidi feud. 'For every action there is a reaction,' said an Arab man from Sinjar. 'This is not over'.","Arabs living in Sinjar claim Yazidis have carried out attacks in their villages .

"Children are returning to the type of books loved by their grandparents. A new wave of writers inspired by traditional favourites like Enid Blyton has marked the resurgence of mystery and detective novels for children, according to a leading bookstore. Six novels shortlisted for the Waterstones Children’s Book Prize involve super-sleuthing children who are left to their own devices to solve mysteries, reminiscent of old favourites like the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys series or Enid Blyton’s Famous Five. Children are now reading the sort of books their grandparents did, according to the shortlist for the Waterstones Children’s Book Prize . Half the novels shortlisted in the categories ‘Best Books for Teens’ and ‘Best Fiction for 5-12s’ are mysteries. In recent years vampire novels and dystopian stories have dominated teenage reading lists and light-hearted ‘funny fiction’ has prevailed for younger readers. Now new trends suggest there is a demand for wholesome novels which are familiar to parents from their own childhoods. Books shortlisted for the prize include ‘Murder Most Unladylike’ by Robin Stevens, which stars a pair of boarding school teens investigating the murder of their teacher, and ‘Smart’ by Kim Slater which follows a misfit teen investigating the death of a homeless man. Melissa Cox, head of children’s buying at Waterstones, said: ‘Crime fiction is a perennial favourite on adults’ bookshelves, but the resurgence of children’s mystery books recently is striking. ‘Enid Blyton is a classic example of a children’s mystery author and her storytelling has clearly been an influence on a couple of the authors we have shortlisted. Old favourites like The Famous Five (pictured are the cast from the 1995 TV version) are informing contemporary successful children's books . ‘The trend harks back to more traditional storytelling compared to some of the other stuff we have seen lately like funny fiction for younger readers or dystopian and vampire fiction for teens. ‘The sorts of books that are easy to sell are one that parents deem, not necessarily a ‘safe’ read, but as something they would have read in their own childhood. ‘By borrowing from the detective genre, many of our shortlisted authors have allowed their characters to deal with some very serious issues within a framework that also feels safe and familiar for young readers. 'Some books, however, have simply channelled the good old-fashioned fun of catching the baddie.’ YouTube star Zoella, real name Zoe Sugg, with her 'squeaky clean' novel Girl Online . Another current children’s bestseller, Girl Online, the fictional novel by YouTube star Zoella (real name Zoe Sugg) is also linked to a desire for ‘innocent’ books for tweens and teens. Ms Cox added: ‘Zoella’s book is very squeaky-clean. There is nothing in there that is going to alarm parents.’ Natalie Doherty, from Penguin Random House, is the editor of Murder Most Unladylike, which has been shortlisted in the Best Fiction for 5-12 category. She said the novel, set in a boarding school, is a fresh, modern take on two classic children’s genres. She said: ‘It takes the traditional murder mystery story in the style of Agatha Christie and combines it with the Enid Blyton-style boarding school stories like Mallory Towers. 'It has a nostalgic appeal to people who grew up reading those types of novels. ‘Despite that, it doesn’t feel like an old-fashioned story. It is really fresh and modern and looks at themes like racism, same-sex relationships and bullying. 'It’s also very funny, with lots of dry humour.’ The winner of the Waterstones Children’s Book Prize will be announced on March 26. Six books will compete in each category: Best Illustrated Book, Best Fiction for 5-12s and Best Books for Teens. The winning author from each category will receive £2,000 with the overall winner receiving an extra £3,000. Mystery novels nominated for Best Fiction for 5-12s include Murder Most Unladylike by Robin Stevens, Violet and the Pearl of the Orient by Harriet Whitehorn and A Boy Called Hope by Lara Williamson. In the Best Books for Teens category, the mystery novels shortlisted include The Apple Tart of Hope by Sarah Moore Fitzgerald, Dead Ends by Erin Lange and Smart by Kim Slater.","Six novels shortlisted for the Waterstones Children’s Book Prize involve super-sleuthing children left to their own devices to solve mysteries .

"Two Al Jazeera journalists sentenced to seven years in jail over alleged terrorism offences have been released on bail after spending more than a year behind bars in Egypt. Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were imprisoned after being arrested alongside Australian reporter Peter Greste in Cairo in 2013. The men were convicted of spreading lies to assist a terrorist organisation, namely the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, and sentenced for to up to 10 years each. Baher Mohamed (left) and Mohamed Fahy (centre) have been released on bail on the first day of their retrial. Their colleague, Australian journalist Peter Greste (right) was freed last week . Canadian Mohamed Fahmy (left) was told to pay $33,000 by a judge as he set conditions of bail this morning. He and Baher Mohamed (right) have spent more than 400 days behind bars . All three have maintained their innocence, claiming they were merely covering the fallout from the army's removal of President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013 at the time. Last week Egypt's highest court ordered a retrial into their case, claiming the prosecution had not presented firm ties between the defendants and the Brotherhood throughout the original trial. Greste was released from jail under at the order of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi citing a new law which allows the deportation of foreign prisoners. Neither Fahmy nor Mohammed was given the same fate, though both were released on bail at a court in Cairo this morning, the former ordered to pay $33,000. None of the other 11 defendants, mostly students, were ordered to pay the court any money. They are all Egyptian nationals. Upon his release this morning, Fahmy's fiancée Marwa Omara broke down in tears, weeping: 'Long live justice.' Australian journalist Peter Greste was released under presidential decree last week. The former BBC correspondent said it was now 'his job' to ensure his colleagues release . Following his imprisonment in December 2013, Fahmy applied to marry Miss Omara in prison. His release allows them to tie the knot, though his fiancée said she would not be entirely satisfied until her partner was acquitted. 'I am very happy. It is a rebirth for me and Mohamed. 'I am happy but my happiness is incomplete until he gets acquitted.' Last week the 40-year-old journalist described the notion of retrial as 'his worst nightmare' in a statement released on his behalf. Amal Clooney, the international human rights lawyer, is representing the journalists . He is represented by international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney who was herself threatened with arrest in relation to the case last month. Mrs Clooney, who married Hollywood actor George Clooney last year, was warned against publishing a report which criticised the Egyptian judicial system. Her findings suggested the country's courts were not sufficiently independent of its military. Upon the defendants' bail yesterday, Mrs Clooney said: 'I am encouraged by the Supreme Court’s findings that the trial was unfair, and by today’s ruling granting Mr Fahmy bail. 'At the same time, there is no guarantee that a retrial will be carried out in compliance with international standards or result in the full acquittal on all charges that Fahmy deserves. 'It may also take several months to complete. 'So this case is not over yet; but it should be.' On January 15, a statement released on behalf of Mr Fahmy by  Doughty Street Chambers, where Mrs Clooney works, highlighted the inability of the Canadian government to secure his release. The former CNN journalist, who has dual Canadian and Egyptian nationality, said: 'My situation and the ongoing legal limbo that I am enduring affects all Canadians who are in the Middle East because it shows that anyone, regardless of how innocent, can become a victim of the political turbulence here. 'And rest assured there will be other Canadians who will suffer like me as long as there is such injustice in this region. 'Canada and Egypt have friendly relations and so I hope you will continue to advocate until the diplomatic process results in my release. 'It is vital that Ottawa continues to engage with my lawyers Amal Clooney and Lorne Waldman at this critical stage of the negotiations so that my colleagues and I can achieve a smooth transition to freedom.' Upon his release last week, Australian journalist Peter Greste said he felt compelled to secure the men's freedom. The men were arrested on December 29, 2013, accused of assisting the Muslim Brotherhood in their coverage of the aftermath of the ousting of President Morsi. They denied having any hand in terrorism, consistently claiming that they fulfilling their roles as journalists in reporting the conflict in Cairo. December 29 2013:  Mohamed Fahmy, Baher Mohamed and Peter Greste are arrested alongside a handful of others in Cairo . January 29 2014: The men are charged with spreading false news, belonging to a terrorist organisation and operating without a permit . June 23: After a trial lasting nearly four months the men are sentenced to up to 10 years imprisonment . November 12: President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi signs a law allowing the deportation of foreign prisoners to serve the remainder of sentences in their native countries . January 1 2015: Egypt's highest court orders a retrial, the three journalists remain in prison . February 1: Peter Greste is freed and makes his return to Australia .

"A father-of-six claimed he was made to feel like a paedophile after being forced to hand over his phone during a visit to his daughter's primary school. David Burns walked out of Tregolls School in Truro, Cornwall, after staff told him to leave his mobile phone at reception in case he took unauthorised photos of children. The 56-year-old hit out at the school's policy, saying staff 'couldn't treat the whole world like paedophiles'. David Burns walked out of Tregolls School in Truro, Cornwall, after staff told him to leave his mobile phone at reception in case he took unauthorised photos of children. Above, David and Amy Burns with Jasmine . But the school defended its decision and said the rule had been introduced as the 'ultimate safeguarding solution'. Mr Burns and wife Amy had gone to the school to see a display of their 10-year-old daughter Jasmine's artwork. When he was told to leave his phone, he explained to staff that he needed to be constantly available in case his eldest son George, who has Asperger's Syndrome, had to contact him. He walked out after staff responded they were sorry, but that he couldn't go into the school with a mobile phone in case he took pictures. He said: 'I was flabbergasted. I didn't go in and my wife Amy went in alone to see our daughter's work. I went back outside and waited in the car - I was so angry. I am a parent - not a paedophile. 'Does the school really think we're going to go in waving a camera around taking pictures of other kids?  You can't treat the whole world like they're paedophiles - we're parents.' Tregolls School defended the decision, and said they had introduced the ruling as the 'ultimate safeguard' last year and said it even applies to teachers and other staff. Posters detailing the policy are displayed on the main entrance door to the school. Sara Cadge, chair of governors at the school, said: 'The rule applies to absolutely everyone. 'When Henry Winkler the American actor came here he handed in his phone and when Ofsted inspectors visited they did as well. We felt this was the ultimate safeguarding solution. 'When it was introduced last year, it was off the back of very high profile cases in London where teachers had actually been found guilty of inappropriate behaviour. 'Our staff said they never want those accusations coming their way. It is to protect themselves and to protect the children. 'We can also not have children in the school being put onto social media inadvertently.' A spokesman for the Department of Education said such a policy would be a matter for the individual school. It comes just months after the issue of photographing children in schools made headlines after parents were ordered to remove a video of their daughter's nativity from social media. Tregolls School, pictured, defended the decision, and said they had introduced the ruling last year as the 'ultimate safeguard' and said it even applies to all guests, teachers and other staff . Douglas Holmes said his four-year-old daughter Emmi-Rai had played the role of innkeeper in her nativity play at Ynysboeth Primary School in Abercynon. His partner Lisa Evans filmed their daughter's performance and posted the video on Facebook. But the next day she was asked to take it down by a teacher who appeared in the video because of concerns of the online safety of pupils. Official guidance issued by the Information Commissioner's Office states that parents should be able to take photos of their children at events such as school plays and sports days, without fear of breaching the Data Protection Act. Advice posted on its website states: 'The Data Protection Act is unlikely to apply in most cases where photographs or videos are taken in schools and other educational institutions. 'If photos are taken for personal use they are not covered by the Act.'","David Burns was on his way to see 10-year-old daughter Jasmine's artwork .

"Myleene Klass made the headlines recently for complaining about the the cost of birthday presents for pupils at her daughters' school. But it seems the television presenter isn't alone - new research shows that children’s parties are fast becoming an expensive headache for many Brits, with parents under heavy pressure at the school gates to cough up for 'cheeky' gifts. In a new survey, one in four mothers and fathers admit they have felt forced by fellow parents to spend more than they felt necessary on birthday presents. Scroll down for video . Many parents actually agree with singer Myleene Klass, who last week said she felt under pressure at the school gates to cough up for 'cheeky' presents for other people's children . The findings suggest that many parents share the negative view of Myleene about being asked to donate money towards a class collection for birthday gifts. One in eight of those polled said they had been asked to contribute towards a bigger present for a child, and of these, the majority (53 per cent) thought the request had been cheeky and that the child should be happy with what they received. Only a quarter of those questioned  (28 per cent) said they were happy to contribute to a group present if it meant the youngster got what they wanted. In terms of cost, more than a third were asked to contribute less than £10, while a further 42 per cent could choose how much to give. Classic FM presenter Klass hit the headlines last week after posting two emails she received 'from some school mums' detailing the parents’ preferences for 'a class gift for their daughters this year' - a desk and a Kindle. The group email suggested a donation of £10 each, but added that there was no obligation to join in. Classic FM presenter Klass hit the headlines last week after posting two emails received 'from some school mums' detailing the parents' preferences for 'a class gift for their daughters this year' Myleene posted the text of two emails she received from fellow parents, as well as her response . In a tongue-in-cheek reply, the 36-year-old mother-of- two, who lives in north London, jokingly said her daughter Ava might like a unicorn, adding that money could be donated at fictitious site www.getwhatyouregivenandendthismadness.com. The singer later confirmed that the emails were a year old and she also admitted that there had been some hard feelings in the playground following the publicity. But she maintained she was trying to convey a serious message and it was her intention to remind parents, who are under pressure to do the best for their children, of what birthdays should be about. The  findings from the new research into birthday presents show that Myleene's school was towards the top end of the scale when it came to financial contributions. Around two-thirds of parents spend between £5-£10 on a gift to take to a child’s party, with a similar proportion saying they think this is the appropriate amount. Only a fifth (23 per cent) spend £10 or more, and a similar proportion (22 per cent) think it is appropriate to do so. Myleene, pictured, right, with her two young daughters, maintained she was trying to convey a serious message and it was her intention to remind parents, who are under pressure to do the best for their children, of what birthdays should be about . The poll also found that while the vast majority of parents (85 per cent) buy a new gift to take to a party, more than one in four (27 per cent) have given cash, and 28 per cent have recycled a birthday present. More than a third (35 per cent) have asked what the child wanted and then bought it. Cathy Ranson, editor-in-chief of Netmums, who commissioned the survey for the Press Association, said: 'Putting on a birthday party for youngsters should be child’s play - but it seems to bring out the worst in some parents. 'Over the last decade we’ve seen parties grow from simple affairs focused on the child to excuses for one-upmanship with ever more lavish venues and expensive gifts crammed into party bags. 'A recent study by Netmums found 16 per cent of parents now pay out more than £300 for a single party, with girls between the ages of two and four given the most pricey events. 'Shockingly, some parents admitted giving opulent gifts in party bags including jewellery, cameras, video games, phones, iPods and even tablets. 'While this may make the parents feel pleased with themselves, is it really what their kids want?' A recent study by Netmums found 16 per cent of parents now fork out more than £300 for a single party . She continued: 'Parties are about the people who go, not where they are held. 'After the last crumb of cake is eaten and final present unwrapped, children’s happy memories are made of who they played with, not how much their mum and dad spent on the day.' It is not the first time that children’s parties have come under the spotlight recently. Last month, Derek Nash from Torpoint, Cornwall criticised a mother who sent him an invoice for failing to give notice that his son Alex would not be attending her child’s birthday party. After his son did not go to the event, the birthday boy’s mother sent him an invoice for £15.95, saying that Mr Nash had left her out of pocket. Mr Nash said he did not have contact details for the boy’s mother, but she said in a statement that all details had been on the party invite.","Myleene Klass made headlines by complaining about pushy school mums .

"As news broke yesterday that Australia will be competing in this year's Eurovision Song Contest for the first time, the internet imploded with a long list of questionable suggestions on who should represent the Land Down Under. So far the lucky Australian performer, who will sing in front of an estimated 195 million people, is still yet to be picked, with many names being thrown around including; Sia, Iggy Azalea and Samantha Jade, to name a few famous Aussies. But many Australians  are gunning for the underdog and already petitions and Twitter hashtags have been created in the hope of sending a more unconventional act to Vienna in May. Scroll down for video . Australian performer Dame Edna Everage's legion of fans have taken to social media to petition for her to represent Australia in the Eurovision . A Change.org petition has been launched by Australian Andrew Wade begging his fellow countrymen to sign on and make 2015 'EuroTISM' in the hope that the anonymous rock band TISM from Melbourne will reunite for the big event. 'We, the undersigned, humbly request that landmark Australian rock band reform and take charge of the stage. Since you left us in 2004, we've had a never ending parade of gormless depressing electro-indie, depressing indie-folk, and depressing Aussie hip-hop,' the Change.org page says. 'We the undersigned, ask that you get on stage in front of the world and remind them of just how great Australian music is.' In just one day, the petition has been signed over 8,900 times, with only 3,500 more signatures needed before it reaches it's quota. Dame Edna is just one of a range of unconventional celebrities whose names have appeared on social media . Hollywood Actor Hugh Jackman and Pince Philip have been named online as possible entrants for the Eurovision 2015 in May . This year, not only will voters be able to back Australia, but the country will be fast-tracked to the final to celebrate the contest's 60th anniversary in May. The Twitter hashtag #EmRuscianoForEurovision is gaining momentum online. The popular comedian's name has popped up on the social media account with many people getting behind the performer. Rusciano is a TV and radio presenter with experience singing and performing in musicals and may be Australia's golden ticket for the Eurovision win. Jackman has appeared in many musicals including Oklahoma and Les Misérables . Hugh Jackman's fans have tagged him in a Twitter hashtag started to suggest famous names who should appear in the Eurovision . After Prince Philip received an Australian knighthood many joked he would be the perfect man to represent Australia . While Prince Philip is not from Australia, Twitter users seem to think he could be drafted in to help the Aussies win the European competition . Last year's winner: Conchita Wurst, a bearded drag queen from Austria, clinched the title with her belter Rise Like a Phoenix at the final in Denmark . One Twitter user seemed impressed that the comedian may be toted for the top job, claiming he would 'stay up late' to watch the Eurovision if Rusciano was appearing. Another user supported his stance saying: 'Attention Australia. There is only one woman for this job. You know it. I know it. Let's do this.' A host of other hilarious names were added to the list of Twitter hashtags. Tweeters have been quick to suggest that Prince Philip may be the man to represent Australia, having controversially recently received a knighthood from Tony Abbott. 'Prince Philip is the obvious Australia entrant,' one Twitter user said, while another user backed him up claiming Prince Philip should be sent to the Eurovision as he is now an honorary Australian. Dame Edna Everage, Tim Minchen, Peta Credlin and Brendan Maclean's names have also been mentioned on social media, with many Australian's throwing their support behind their favourite contender for the job. 'If Dame Edna Everage does not represent Australia at Eurovision, there is no justice. She has the right level of musical talent,' one Twitter user said. Fans of Melbourne based band The Cat Empire have also begun their own online campaign in the hope the anonymous group will bring their hit The Wine Song to Europe. Others suggested that some of our most well-known actors could light up the stage and win the competition for Australia. Hollywood actor Russell Crowe has also been suggested online as a possible candidate for the international contest . Mr Crowe has appeared in Les Misérables alongside Hugh Jackman where he showcases his impressive singing voice . Hollywood stars Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman have both appeared in musicals including Les Misérables and Oklahoma and according to social media users could be the very men for the job. 'Hey Australia, you know there's only one choice for Eurovision: Hugh Jackman a Twitter user said. Australia has until March 16 to decide who will represent them at the show which has previously accepted entries from outside Europe but none from so far away. A petition has also been launched to get Spinning Around pop superstar Kylie Minogue to represent her home country at the Eurovision song contest. And a campaign on change.org started by Ismael Gomez in Madrid, in Spain, shows support for Kylie has already begun. Popular Australian band The Cat Empire are also contenders for the job . The Change.org campaign was set up by a TISM fan, who claims the band should represent Australia and show the Europeans what real Australian music sounds like . Last year, Australian singer Jessica Mauboy was watched by 180 million people when she performed as a guest - but didn't compete- at  the Eurovision Song Contest in Denmark in 2014. A statement from SBS said 'The [new] deal is a result of SBS's ambition to increase Australia's presence at Eurovision following the success of Jessica Mauboy's performance last year in Denmark.' The petition states, 'It is the first time and the last one Australia will take to the stage and compete in the popular song contest as it marks its 60th anniversary. 'Kylie is the symbol of that country, the best pop singer in the world and, for sure, the Spanish community will support her in Vienna next May. Comedian and fan-favourite Em Rusciano has received her own hashtag on Twitter. #EmRuscianoForEurovision has set the Twitosphere alight . 'And, finally, because WE LOVE KYLIE!!!!' The petition, which has so far earned 25 signatures and messages of support, was sent to SBS, long associated with the contest. Australia's participation is a one-off initiative to mark the show's anniversary and organisers say that even if Australia wins, it will not host next year's contest, which will remain in Europe. However, if they do win the title Australia will be allowed to defend their crown the following year. Many Twitter users have got behind the comedian, claiming she is the only woman for the job . Em Rusciano has dabbled in theatre and is a singer and perfomer . Some Austraians have started a petition to get pop superstar Kylie Minogue to represent her home country .","Australia has been invited to compete in Eurovision 2015 .

"Amanda Knox did not tell her former lover and co-accused Raffaele Sollecito she had become engaged, his father has revealed. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Sollecito's father revealed Knox had not told his son she was set to tie the knot. Knox, 27, will reportedly marry Colin Sutherland, a 27-year-old musician who wrote to her while she was in an Italian prison and who she has known since middle school. Meanwhile, a legal back and forth continues in Italy as Knox and her co-defendant and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito fight back against their 2014 re-conviction by an Italian upper court for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher. Engaged! Amanda Knox (right) is reportedly engaged to her childhood friend, musician Colin Sutherland (left) First love: Raffaelle Sollecito (right) previously said Knox (left) was his ‘first love’ and they were ‘living in a fairytale’ when the horrific murder took place . Sollecito's father, Francesco Sollecito, revealed Knox had not told his son she was set to tie the knot . The news of Knox's engagement was first reported in a Seattle Times column on Wednesday. Columnist Jonathan Martin writes that Knox confirmed the engagement to him via email but said no more. No date has been set for the nuptials. Her ex-boyfriend's father, Francesco Sollecito said: ‘Neither of us knew about it. But then Raffaele has not spoken to her lately. He is not in regular contact with her. ‘But if it is true, then he is happy for her, it’s evident that she has found the right person. We are very happy for her.’ Doctor Sollecito said his son is currently in a relationship with Italian girlfriend air-hostess Greta Menegaldo. However, they only see each other ‘from time to time’ as his son is very busy working with his lawyers and preparing for his final appeal next month. Now that he has passed his degree, he has also been working as a computer engineer, Dr Sollecito said. Raffaelle Sollecito previously said Knox was his ‘first love’ and they were ‘living in a fairytale’ when the horrific murder took place. He later suggested they marry to give him the same protection she enjoys as a U.S. citizen, according to reports. Amanda refused. Before her current love was revealed in September, Knox was known to be living in Seattle with her classical guitarist then-boyfriend James Terrano. Sutherland (right) once lived in Brooklyn but has since moved back to Seattle, where he and Knox (left) attended middle school . Sealed with a kiss: Sutherland (seen here with Knox during her visit to New York as they locked lips at Coney Island) and Knox reported were engaged last week . Sutherland once lived in Brooklyn but has since moved back to Seattle, where he and Knox attended middle school. She's now working at a Seattle bookstore and as a writer for the West Seattle Herald. Meanwhile, her case is headed back into the Italian courts once again in March. Sollecito and Knox were first found guilty of murder in November 2009. The killers' convictions were later quashed after experts said forensic evidence had been contaminated and they were released. Prosecutors then appealed that finding and the case was re-tried in March 2013. In January last year a court upheld the original verdict. It seems unlikely Knox, who now lives in the U.S., will ever return to jail for the crime as she has repeatedly refused to return to Italy. Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. Back then: Knox was accused along with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (both at left) of brutally murdering Knox's roommate in Perugia, Italy Meredith Kercher, 21 (right) in 2007 .

"Levi Stevens, son of Jon Stevens, posted a cryptic message of support on his Instagram on Monday following his father's arrest for allegedly assaulting his fiancée Jodhi Meares. The heavily tattooed 21-year-old, who follows in his father's footsteps and works as a performer describing himself as an 'MC', posted the quote just hours after the former Noiseworks singer was picked up by police in Sydney's exclusive Point Piper. 'When you're mad at someone you love, be careful what you say because your mind gets angry but your heart still cares,' the post read. Scroll down for video . Loyalty: Levi Stevens, son of Jon Stevens, posted a cryptic message of support on his Instagram on Monday following his father's arrest for allegedly assaulting his fiancée Jodhi Meares . Caring: Levi posted this quote just hours after the former Noiseworks singer was picked up by police in Sydney's exclusive Point Piper . The New Zealand-born star and brother of New Zealand Idol judge, Frankie Stevens, was released on bail and is reportedly set to appear in Waverley Local Court relating to the incident on Thursday. Levi has previously taken to his social media three months ago on November 15 to post a picture of Chris Brown alongside Rihanna along with the message: . 'Sometimes u love people so much that despite what they put you thru, you'll always be there.' Chris attacked Rihanna at a pre-Grammys bash in 2009 leaving her bruised and battered. He was charged with assault and continues to face a public backlash against his domestic violence actions, but famously did get back with Rihanna for a short period in 2013. Levi also took to his social media three months ago on November 15 to post a picture of Chris Brown alongside Rhianna . Continuing tradition: The heavily tattooed 21-year-old follows in his father's footsteps and works as a performer describing himself as an 'MC' All together: Levi appears to have a healthy relationship with his step-mother-to-be, joining her and his dad on holiday in Hawaii last month . Levi seems to have a healthy relationship with his step-mother-to-be, joining her and his dad on holiday in Hawaii last month, while Jodhi regularly takes to her own social media account to share snaps of him. In January, she shared a picture of Levi's tattooed hand with a tiny lizard crawling on his fore finger and another of him getting a substantial 'Polynesian tattoo' on his leg. 'Levi Jay- finishing what he started two years ago- finally made it back to Hawaii to complete his tattoo with the incredible artist Donavan. #levijay #donavan #tattoo @dazed_tnr #polynesiantattoo,' she captioned it. Ex: Jon split with his wife of 20 years Tracey in 2007 before he moved into realtionship with Jodhi . New man:  She has since moved on from the marriage and is dating a man called Jonny . She also often likes snaps posted on social media of Jon's two grandchildren Summer and Leo from his daughter Millie. Jon split with his wife of 20 years Tracey in 2007. She has since moved on from the marriage and is dating a man called Jonny. Message of support? The designer's company The Upside posted this quote, which appears to  reference the situation . According to Channel Nine, the incident between Jodhi and Jon allegedly occurred after the former wife of billionaire James Packer discovered text messages on 53-year-old Stevens' phone. The Daily Telegraph reported claims the messages were in emails and were from an ex-girlfriend. Jodhi is alleged to have sustained minor injuries on her wrist. Police confirmed that officers arrested a man in his 50s at a Wolseley Road property in the early hours of Monday morning before charging him with assault. Incident: The assault is the second incident for Jodhi in just eight months after she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi in June last year, recording a blood alcohol level of 0.181 . Crash: Jodhi collided with three parked cars when she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi on June 21 last year . The Sydney Morning Herald reported police were called to the couples' exclusive Point Piper home after the alleged fight and immediately issued an interim AVO, forbidding the Jezebal hitmaker from going near Jodhi for 28 days. The former INXS rocker was arrested and charged with assault. It is believed the AVO could be dropped. The rocker had been due to play several gigs this week, including Rooty Hill RSL on Friday night and Revesby Workers Club on Saturday night, but the shows have now been cancelled, with concert-goers offered refunds. 'Haunted' by marriage: Jodhi married billionaire James Packer in 1999 and split from him in 2002 . A-list: Jodhi and then husband James in 2001 at a Channel Nine function . The assault is the second incident for Jodhi in just eight months after she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi in June last year, recording a blood alcohol level of 0.181. In the wake of that event, The Upside posted similar inspirational quotes, apparently in relation to Jodhi's situation. Attributed to Kurt Cobain, it read: 'I'd rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I am not.' Moment of pride: Model Jessica Gomes paraded Jodhi's label The Upside down the catwalk at the David Jones Autumn/Winter launch last week, with the founder watching on from the audience . Just last week, an account in the name of Jon Stevens didn't take well to some people on social media criticising Johdi for last year's drink driving incident. One user commented: 'Hope she doesn't get p***** & stack her 4wd afterwards.' Stevens hit back, writing: 'Hope you don't choke on your own vomit.' He wasn't finished there, the rant posted in the early hours of Thursday continuing: . 'Your poor taste just shows what a pathetic person you must be ... as with everyone makes mistakes and nobody got hurt in Jodhi's accident thank god ... and she completely put her hand up and took full responsibility for her actions which I reckon you don’t know how to do that coz you must be perfect? But I doubt it very much as clearly you are a very boring person that has never made a mistake in your life...' The user replied: 'No I'm not perfect Jon but I have lost a family member through the actions of a drink driver.' Stevens recently showed support for his fiancee by slamming users on Facebook who criticised Jodhi for her car accident .

Huge project: The logs were delivered to the property from Clifford Jones Timber in Ruthin, north Wales . Work in progress: Mr Szwajgier (right) said the transformation has giving him 'a real sense of achievement' So when the couple bought their house last October they decided they could use the extension to create their own version of a log cabin in just one room. Little House on the Prairie was a US drama series about a family living on a farm in Walnut Grove, Minnesota, in the 1870s and 1880s. It was adapted from Laura Ingalls Wilder’s best-selling series of Little House books published from 1932 to 1943, and ran for nine series on the NBC network from 1974 to 1983. The central characters were farmer Charles Ingalls, his wife Caroline and their four daughters, Mary, Laura, Carrie and Grace. The series followed the children's simple farm upbringing but also tackled issues such as adoption, alcoholism and blindness. And Mr Szwajgier added: ‘It’s worked out very well and gives me a real sense of achievement - especially when I look at all the scars on my hand from the cuts I got while I was working on it.’ Miss Druzkowska, a fitness instructor, said: ‘I think we’ve created something which could be quite unique in the UK. I definitely think it will add extra value to the house. ‘It now has an extra room overlooking the garden which is very cosy and relaxing - it’s certainly not your normal living room and is a lot more personal. ‘The neighbours said they couldn’t imagine how it would look when it was finished but some of them have been in to see it and have been really impressed.’ The couple - who have two children, Dominik, 11, and Oliwia, seven - became engaged just over a year ago. The logs were delivered from Clifford Jones Timber in Ruthin, north Wales. Company employee Lesley Taylor-Williamson said: ‘This was one of the more unusual orders we have received but we are used to supplying a variety of different customers. ‘We send fence posts to the Falkland Islands, lampposts to Center Parcs and special logs to a chain of pizza shops but this was definitely a first.'

"Ms Wheatley complained that the handle of her Glock 17 pistol (pictured) was too big for her hands . Two ‘petite’ firearms officers are set to receive a pay-out of £70,000 after winning a sex discrimination case over the size of their big guns. Victoria Wheatley and Rachael Giles said their weapons were too big for their small hands and as a result they could not reach the trigger, a tribunal has heard. The two women struggled with the grip of the pistols they were using – a Glock 17 – and they also claimed their heads and legs were too small for their protective gear. The case, held at the Central London Employment Tribunal last week, found the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) guilty of discrimination against both officers in the provision of suitable firearms and safety equipment. It is understood the officers are set to receive £35,000 each after winning the case against the force – but there is expected to be an appeal. The decision comes after a number of extraordinary cases where police forces across the country have had to pay out thousands in compensation to officers due to injuries at work - including £8,000 to a policeman bitten by fleas. The two officers were based at different stations in the north west, with Miss Wheatley part of the armed unit which protects the Sellafield atomic complex in Cumbria and Miss Giles based at Chapelcross, near Annan. Both females, who were described as being ‘petite in stature’ and with ‘small hands’, asked on several occasions for a smaller and suitable grip on the weapon when they could not reach the trigger, but this did not happen, the tribunal heard. They also said their trainers failed to adjust their pistols while carrying out a test shoot. They both complained separately about their problems, after it is understood they did not receive as high a test marks as their male colleagues which put them at a disadvantage. Their solicitor, Binder Bansel, of Pattinson & Brewer, said that every officer joining at the rank of constable or sergeant is required to train to recognised standards as an authorised firearms officer and maintain the standard. A cycle of annual training shoots tests their ability which they must undertake as part of their job. Mr Bansel said: ‘Continued failure at these shoot days results in an unsatisfactory assessment, which could lead to the officer being dismissed.’ Miss Wheatley, 39, and Miss Giles, 32, also said there were other problems during the tests, including protection equipment which did not fit. They argued the helmets and kneepads were too large for their legs and heads which hindered their performance. They also argued they were too short for a wooden barricade, which was used as a resting place for the firearm. Protection: Miss Wheatley worked with an armed unit which protects the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria . The barricade was built for an officer of average male height and only offered support for those much taller. It is not known how tall the women were. The tribunal found there was no justification for this. It was said the women raised their concerns on ‘a regular basis’ but they were often dismissed, with no ‘adequate consideration’. The CNC said it was planning to appeal the tribunal decision. A spokesman said: ‘The judgement has been passed and the CNC has lost on the grounds of indirect sex discrimination, however any claims of victimisation were unanimously dismissed. ‘As a result of what was discussed in this case, the CNC can also state it will be conducting an equality impact assessment. ‘This is to ensure that the CNC remains committed to providing the right training and equipment, together with a commitment to equal opportunities.’ Miss Wheatley and Miss Giles were members of the Civil Nuclear Police Federation, which supported the claim. A spokesman for the federation said the officers were expecting to receive a pay-out of £35,000 each subject to an appeal and remained in their current roles. They said the pay-out was on the basis of sex discrimination – which included their reputational damage as they received lower marks on their tests as a result. Work: Meanwhile, Miss Giles, 32, worked at the Chapelcross nuclear site near Annan in Scotland (file picture) The spokesman added: ‘It was all part and parcel of it – the damage to their reputations because if they were scoring less on these proficiency tests while other colleagues were more suited to the equipment, they were in a lesser position.’ The spokesman said they may not receive the pay-out for months due to the appeal. No further details of the officers could be released due to the fact the case was still on-going. After the judgement, chief executive of the federation, Nigel Dennis, said he was pleased with the outcome, adding he hoped the constabulary would remove the ‘disadvantage’ and ensure all officers had a fair opportunity. In December last year it emerged a police community support officer who injured her knee while investigating a burglary was awarded £4,000 in compensation. Pauline Harrison, 53, was responding to a 999 call reporting a break-in at a derelict school when she fell over a 3ft-high wooden fence. In April last year a policeman was paid £8,000 compensation after being bitten by fleas while at work. The extraordinary injury claim was made after colleagues complained that their police station in Birmingham had become infested with the insects. It was one of a number of workplace injury claims paid by West Midlands Police which had spent £900,000 settling cases made by more than 50 policemen in three years. And WPC Kelly Jones triggered public outrage and criticism from her own chief constable last year for suing a burglary victim for £50,000 after tripping over a kerb. Other claims include a police officer awarded £16,610 in compensation after he fell over a pile of blankets while chasing a suspect.","Victoria Wheatley and Rachel Giles are part of armed units at nuclear sites .

"Plans: Iain Duncan Smith, Work and Pensions Secretary, believes a new 'right-to-own' scheme would attract more 'C2 voters' from the skilled working classes, providing a timely election boost . Millions of working families would be given the chance to own their own homes in radical Conservative plans to extend Margaret Thatcher’s flagship housing policy. The right-to-buy would be extended to up to 2.5million housing association tenants – transforming the lives of many. Some could even be rewarded for holding down a job for a year or more by simply being handed a stake in their properties. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is understood to be pushing both ideas – designed to echo Lady Thatcher’s defining right-to-buy policy for council house tenants – for inclusion in the Tory election manifesto. A senior Government source said this was being ‘seriously considered’. Introduced in 1980, the right-to-buy led to more than 1.5million homes being sold off at discounted rates. Mr Duncan Smith believes that a new ‘right-to-own’ would attract more ‘C2 voters’ – the skilled working classes who helped to deliver Lady Thatcher’s three election victories. As well as promoting home ownership and rewarding work, he argues that the scheme would reduce the vast housing benefit bill. Currently, taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower-paid workers who live in housing association properties. Housing associations are non-profit making private bodies that provide low-cost social housing. Regulated by the state, they receive public funding. Right-to-buy rules allow most council tenants to buy their homes at a discount, but the rules do not apply to housing associations. They only qualify for limited discounts and can only buy a property that has been acquired by an association since 1997. Discounts vary between areas, but range from £9,000 to £16,000. Council house tenants, by contrast, can get discounts of up to £77,000 across England and £102,700 in London. The Centre for Social Justice, the think tank set up by Mr Duncan Smith in opposition, has suggested housing association tenants should be offered discounts of up to 30 per cent of a property’s value. Former Tory leadership contender David Davis and former Labour welfare minister Frank Field have also backed new rights for tenants to buy their homes. Still more radical would be rewarding those with the best employment records with free stakes in their homes. Mr Duncan Smith is understood to want to consider the idea for those in work for a year or more. The association would retain a 40 per cent stake, ensuring taxpayers gain from an increase in house prices, while the owners would have the remaining 60 per cent. Money raised when the property was sold would be ploughed back into more social housebuilding, which would be spread out rather than concentrated on estates. Flagship policy: Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher introduced the 'right-to-buy' scheme in 1980, which led to more than 1.5million homes being sold off at discounted rates . The move is being supported by the Conservatives’ election campaign chief Lynton Crosby, according to Government sources. Some in Downing Street are said to be cautious about Mr Duncan Smith’s proposals. There are fears that handing people in social housing a stake in their homes might anger voters renting in the private sector, with little hope of affording to buy. However, the Government has already launched its Help to Buy scheme, which offers first-time buyers support in getting on to the property ladder. Kate Davies, chief executive of Notting Hill Housing, said: ‘It would be important to ensure that housing associations were able to replenish housing stock.’ A Tory spokesman said: ‘We will set out our manifesto policies at the appropriate time. No decisions have been taken.’ Enabling housing association tenants to buy their homes would be likely to require major changes to the 1996 Housing Act so that associations are forced to sell at the discounts set by government. The Coalition has already increased right-to-buy discounts for council homes, meaning more are moving into the private sector. But housing associations, which date back to the 19th century, have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing. They are autonomous, not-for-profit bodies backed by public money and loans from the private sector. David Orr of the National Housing Federation, which represents Britain’s non-profit housing associations, said: ‘We fully support the aspiration of homeownership, but not at the expense of the 1.7million people currently waiting for desperately needed social housing. ‘Selling off homes at a price that leaves very little to replace them does not make sense.’ He said the suggestion that housing association tenants might own their homes after a year of work was ‘so preposterous, it cannot be considered a serious solution to our housing crisis’.","Conservatives plan to give working families chance to own their homes .

"Police can make 'sinister associations' when dealing with black men and American police are facing a 'crossroads' in race relations, the director of the FBI has warned. James Comey made an unprecedented speech about policing and race issues at Georgetown University today -  becoming the first director of the FBI to speak at length about the issue. Mr Comey made the speech, called ‘Hard Truths: Law Enforcement and Race’, at a time when racial tensions with police in America are high, following the police shootings of Michael Brown in Ferguson in August and Eric Garner in New York. Scroll down for video . James Comey, director of the FBI, said American police face a 'crossroads' with race relations as he admitted that police officers who work in areas where street crime is committed may hold biases towards blacks . Mr Coney admitted that officers had to acknowledge that ‘much of our history is not pretty’ and that they had to change. He said  police officers who work in neighborhoods where most street crime is committed by young black men may hold unconscious biases which means they can be tempted to take a 'mental shortcut' in dealing with suspicious situations. 'The two young black men on one side of the street look like so many others the officer has locked up,' he said. 'Two young white men on the other side of the street - even in the same clothes - do not. The officer does not make the same sinister association about the two white guys, whether that officer is white or black.' He acknowledged the shortfalls of police who may take particular approaches based on their past experience or if they are working in an area where black people make up the majority of perpetrators of crime. 'Something happens to people in law enforcement,' he added. 'Many of us develop different flavors of cynicism that can be hard to resist because they become shortcuts. Something happens to people working in that environment...that mental shortcut becomes almost irresistible.’ Mr Comey said America is at a crossroads when it comes to race relations and law enforcement, and the 'hard truths' must be confronted. During the unprecedented speech at Georgetown University Mr Comey acknowledged there were problems and that police officers could make 'sinister associations' with black people they encountered . Protesters from Ferguson to New York, Washington and London clashed with police following the fatal shooting of black teenager Michael Brown - creating racial tensions between officials and communities . He added: ‘All of us in law enforcement must be honest enough to acknowledge that much of our history is not pretty. ‘At many points in American history law enforcement has enforced the status quo, a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavoured groups’. The director said it was also important to break a cycle that means often ethnic minorities in poor neighborhoods too often inherit a 'legacy of crime and prison,' a cycle he said must be broken to improve race relations with police. The death of Michael Brown has seen protesters take to the streets across America . However he said that racial bias was not endemic in the force and most officers were committed to doing the right thing. He also said that citizens needed to do more and had to ‘give (police) the respect and space they need to make their job possible and that body cameras on officers was not the answer. Mr Comey has been praised for tackling race when previous directors of the bureau have made limited comments. Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, told the New York Times: 'Not to take anything away from the previous directors, but it was almost as though they thought, 'This is something we shouldn't weigh into.''' The Bureau has a complicated history with black Americans dating back to the surveillance of Dr Martin Luther King during the civil rights era. Racial tensions are once again high in America after a number of controversial police shootings which have sparked a national conversation about law enforcement. Michael Brown was shot dead by white officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis, Missouri, suburb on August 9, last year. The 18-year-old was not armed and there are disagreements about whether he held up his hands and cried 'don't shoot' before the gun was fired. His death precipitated a number of protests in Ferguson, New York and as far away as London - aiming to raise awareness of racial bias. In Berkeley, California, there was violence four nights in a row with police using tear gas against protesters . Attorney General Eric Holder opened an FBI civil rights investigation but it is not expected to bring charges against Darren Wilson, the former officer who opened fire. Comey is best-known for a 2004 standoff at the hospital bedside of Attorney General John Ashcroft over a no-warrant wiretapping program. Comey rushed to the room of his bedridden boss to physically stop White House officials from trying to get Ashcroft to reauthorize the program. He later described the evening as one of the most difficult of his life. During the speech, Comey said he keeps on his desk a copy of the order John F Kennedy signed authorising the wiretapping of Dr King as a reminder of what not to do. The director previously worked as a federal prosecutor who served for several years as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. He the came to Washington after the September 11 attacks as deputy attorney general. In recent years, he's been an executive at defense company Lockheed Martin, general counsel to a hedge fund, board member at HSBC Holdings and lecturer on national security law at Columbia Law School.","FBI director James Comey gave speech about policing and race .

"Rosie O'Donnell thanked Barbara Walters for giving her two shots on The View as she bid farewell to the troubled ABC show today. Holding her little daughter Dakota, Rosie, 52 - who spoke out yesterday to say the program needs leadership and its founder Barbara Walters - said: 'Thank-you to the cast and crew and mostly to Barbara Walters who has always looked out for me in my life and career and is an amazing woman. 'We had lunch yesterday, I want to thank her for making this show and letting me be on it twice.

Rosie announced she was leaving the troubled ABC daytime show on Friday - as she revealed she had split from her wife Michelle Rounds. The feisty star - who said that 'something had to give' - was planning to pre-record her last show. However, an ABC source told Daily Mail Online that her farewell show would be live today, adding: 'For production reasons Friday’s show was taped on Tuesday, but Rosie wasn’t part of it. 'It didn’t make sense to tape her final appearance so many days in advance of her actual last day, plus Rosie Perez can’t do taped shows because she has to leave for theater rehearsals right after the live show ends at noon.' She walked out on set, dancing to Flo Rida's hit Low, and was greeted to chants of 'Rosie' from the audience. 'If you had done that every day I probably would have stayed.' she joked, as she high-fived her co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie Perez and Nicole Wallace.

She was there to introduce the world premiere of HBO Documentary Films' Rosie O'Donnell: A Heartfelt Stand Up. She said: 'You can't really minimize it so I'm having a lot of stressful situations in my family life at the moment and having stressful situations in my work environment, so something had to give. Most easy way to accomplish the lessening of the stress is to not go to work for right now.' She also addressed persistent reports that her departure had to do with disagreements with co-hosts and said: 'No. This is definitely about my heart. It’s about [the] company of Disney being amazing.' Chic: Rosie Perez looked chic in the snow . Easy: Flo Rida arrives at The View today . She continued: 'When I sat down with them and said, ""Here is the deal, this is what's been going on with me personally and professionally,"" they were great…It’s not about anybody else.' 'It never was and it never will be. Everybody wants a show to work and for it to succeed. But [what] you want mostly is to take care of your health.

"Plenty of performers have had explosive entrances. Some rise like meteors, soaring to new heights. Others find their moment in the spotlight fleeting. Few have done all of this at once and quite so literally as Gemma Kirby, the 25-year-old human cannonball at Circus Xtreme. She hurtles out of a cannon at up to 66 mph and lands up to 104 feet away in an air bag. 'It's a very intense sensation. Very few human beings get to feel that sensation, except for fighter jet pilots or an astronaut,' she said by phone recently. 'It's really remarkable to feel it completely untethered to any type of vehicle.' Daring feat: Gemma Kirby is the human cannonball at Circus Xtreme. The 25-year-old, from Minneapolis, Minnesota, flies out of a cannon at up to 66mph and lands 104ft away in an air bag . Kirby will be celebrating a special milestone on Saturday: She's expected to notch her 500th total flight in Philadelphia — a heart-thumping moment on Valentine's Day. 'I can never do this act half-awake or not prepared or warmed up,' she said. 'Every single time is a risk. Every single time is a bit of a mystery.' Circus Xtreme is a new traveling show from Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus that showcases extreme acts — acrobats rappelling from a 15-foot towers, BMX riders, high-wire performers, contortionists and Bengal tigers, to name a few. It's part of what Nicole Feld, executive vice president of Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company, hopes will 'tap into that edge-of-your seat, thrill-seeking live entertainment experience.' Kirby, who during her act experiences a G-force of seven, about the same as an astronaut re-entering the atmosphere, is one of the circus' highlights, even though her actual flight lasts only about 2.4 seconds. 'Gemma lives and breathes the thrill of being a human cannonball,' said Feld. 'And there's something about her that feels like a fairy tale superhero come to life.' Extreme goals: Kirby, who has been nicknamed 'The Jet', hopes to notch 1,000 flights by the time the circus's two-year tour of the US ends . Kirby, nicknamed 'The Jet,' hopes to notch 1,000 flights by the time the two-year tour ends. After Philadelphia, the circus hits states including New York, New Jersey, Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia, Ohio, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Missouri and North Carolina. Born in Minneapolis, Kirby fell in love with performing as a youngster and she danced onstage at age seven. She liked ballet, but began to find it restrictive and not creative enough. At 13, she attended aerial classes at the youth-orientated Circus Juventasin in Saint Paul and was hooked: 'I knew right away I wanted to be in the air.' From age 17-22, Kirby was on the flying trapeze with several circuses. Last year, while working toward her bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Minnesota, she was contacted about possibly being shot out of a cannon for Circus Xtreme. She's a rare woman in a secretive, exclusive world. 'Everyone in the circus knows the cannon is the most daunting, the most thrilling, the most daring of all the acts,' she said. 'It's just something I never thought in my wildest dream that would be offered to me.' Kirby and her team are constantly checking the specially-designed cannon and calculating the details of her flight, which includes everything from humidity to the arena's temperature. The cannon, whose exact workings Kirby won't reveal, is calculated for her body, which means she can't gain or lose more than a few pounds. She relies on her aerialist background. Privilege: Last year, while working toward her bachelor's degree in psychology, Kirby was contacted about being shot out of a cannon for Circus Xtreme. She's a rare woman in a secretive, exclusive world . 'Being detail-oriented and being a creature of habit is really essential in this line of work. Consistency is key and every flight is a little bit different,' she said. 'Sometimes I'll come out of the barrel and I'll realize, 'I've got a little more rotation than is ideal' and I have to decide in a split second how am I going to stop my rotation so I don't over rotate.' Though her time in the air is brief, Kirby loves to see young women's stunned faces as she zooms through the air, a missile in a sparkly silver outfit. 'I'm not saying that little girls should necessarily watch me and want to do exactly what I do, but I hope that some of them can see my performance and say, ""That's something I didn't realize girls could do,""' she said. For me, that's the most important thing: empower someone to believe in themselves.'","Gemma Kirby is a human cannonball at Circus Xtreme, a new traveling show from Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Circus .

"A top parenting expert has warned mothers that being too possessive of their sons and not letting men be strong father figures can be detrimental to their boys' upbringing. The frank advice comes from parenting expert Noël Janis-Norton in her new book Calmer, Easier, Happier Boys. According to the parenting and behavioural specialist and former teacher, fathers have much greater influence than mothers in shaping  boys into well-adjusted young men - but too often mothers find it hard to back off and let dad take control. A top parenting expert has warned mothers that being too possessive over their sons and not allowing fathers to get enough of a look can be detrimental . 'Without a strong father-figure, (which could also be a step-father or grandfather), boys may struggle to learn how to express their emotions constructively, how to handle their physical strength and learn to respect others - and themselves,' Janis-Norton tells the MailOnline. ‘Mothers need to allow dads to be dads and to have their own relationship with their children - and in particular with their boys - without trying to micromanage,' she says. The parenting expert, who has been credited by the likes of Helena Bonham-Carter turning her family life around, also warns mothers about being barking too many orders. 'A boy will lose respect for the mother who appears to bossing the father around – or criticising him,' she says. So when Dad gets little Tommy dressed in the wrong clothes, feeds him the wrong breakfast and then starts a pillow fight should Mum just look on through gritted teeth? 'Yes - absolutely she should!' says Janis-Norton. 'And the gritted teeth part comes because mums assume they know best - but actually none of us is perfect. We’ve got weaknesses too. 'We’re not doing it right all the time. So really we shouldn’t be judging the dads!' Despite the title of her book, the Calmer, Easier, Happier Boys author, is at pains to point out that keeping calm is not always the goal. In fact, she actively encourages play-fighting for boys . Of course mums are usually more familiar with the routines: 'Even in families where both parents work long hours outside the home, children tend to spend more time with their mothers,' says Janis-Norton. 'That’s not a problem for a girl – but for a boy it is. Because the  genetically preprogrammed urge is for boys to copy their fathers. And it’s hard for a boy to do that when he doesn’t spend enough time with Dad.' Despite the title of her book, the Calmer, Easier, Happier Boys author, is at pains to point out that keeping calm is not always the goal. In fact, she actively encourages play-fighting for boys - especially when it's with their father. 'Mums generally don’t have an interest in play fighting and they worry someone's going to get hurt, or feelings will get hurt, or clothes will get ripped or something will get damaged. 'But none of that is as important as boys getting their energy out and through play fighting they learn a lot about how to fight fair. 'They learn how to control themselves, they learn how not to be too rough - and they also learn how to make amends if it does go too far.' By play fighting with Dad, boys can learn how to control themselves, how not to be too rough - and  how to make amends if they have been too rough . 'Dads can teach boys all of that,' she says but  does advise that  play fighting that is likely to become manic or annoy others in the house is best taken outside. Of course mothers are not the only ones that need to make an effort to encourage that father-son relationship to flourish. Fathers needs to work at it too: . 'Because so many fathers are spending more hours at work and often have longer commutes their time at home may be taken up with household chores such as paying bills, mowing the lawn and doing repairs. Noël Janis-Norton has written the new book using her tried-and-tested Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting strategies . 'You can see that even a loving, conscientious father can end up not being a very good role-model. 'They may be reluctant to insist on good behaviour, to enforce rules and routines and to follow-through when rules are broken or routines drift. 'The less involved a father is, the less confident he will feel and the less confident he feels, the less involved he will want to be,' she warns. Janis-Norton decided to write the book, which adapts her tried and tested Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting strategies to focus on boy behaviour, after parents of boys kept asking the same questions. 'They were often frustrated exasperated and perplexed,' she says. 'Parents often complain that their boys are fidgety and easily distracted and socially immature. Parents worry that their son isn’t fulfilling his academic potential. 'Another issue that concerns parents of boys is the tendency towards disrespect, defiance and aggression. And parents don’t know what to do.' The most important piece of advice Janis-Norton has for parents is to sop telling their children off. It may not sound like a recipe for cooperative offspring, but according to Janis-Norton it is key: 'Telling off doesn’t work and motivate to improve,' she says. 'Thankfully there are strategies that can help parents get back in charge,' she says. ‘The strategies I teach parents will help boys to become more cooperative, more confident, more motivated, more self-reliant and more considerate.' One such strategy is Descriptive Praise, describing what your child is doing right rather than what they're doing wrong. ‘Let’s imagine a family around the dinner table. The little girl is eating with her knife and fork properly and using her napkin properly and sitting with legs in front of her – and waiting to swallow her food before she talks. 'The boy is doing all the opposite - plus he’s singing and talking too loudly and interrupting and maybe doing a deliberate burp. Noël Janis-Norton's new book: Calmer, Easier, Happier Boys . 'So it’s very tempting to keep saying ""no"", ""don’t"", ""stop"".' 'Reprimands may - or may not - get you immediate cooperation, but in the long-term telling off and endless reminders make the behaviour worse – because when children keep hearing about what they’re doing wrong, they start to feel that’s who they are. 'So after a while they don’t even bother trying to improve their behaviour. 'In fact, boys often enjoy being able to wind up their parents by burping or making some kid of a vulgar joke. 'So I advise parents to focus most of their attention on the OK things that the boy is doing. Notice and mention the tiny steps in the right direction. 'I’m not saying it’s easy to stay positive; it takes a lot of self-control. But it’s worth practising this strategy, which is called Descriptive Praise, because the more we notice when our children are doing things right, the more motivated they will be to behave better.' Within a meal a parent might say: ‘You’re sitting up straight’ or ‘You’re using your napkin instead of your sleeve’ or even 'Your chewing with your mouth closed and I cant see any of the food in your mouth’. 'If you take a moment to look carefully, there’s always something your son is doing that’s OK that you can comment on,' Janis-Norton says. 'For example, if your son is talking too loudly, just look at him, with a friendly face, and wait a few seconds until he pauses. Then at that moment you can say, with a big smile, ""And now you’re not talking too loudly. You’re using your indoor voice"".' Helena Bonham-Carter, who took a course in Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting in 2010 is just one mother who has been helped by Janis-Norton's strategies. 'It absolutely works,' the star said of trying Descriptive Praise with her son Billy, then seven. 'Billy is lapping it up. And as a parent, you become happier because you’re observing all these good things about your child, if you’re being specific about what they’ve done.'","Advice in new book Calmer, Easier, Happier Boys by Noël Janis-Norton .

"A sports anchor's argument with an 'erratic' house painter who has pulled a gun on clients in the past led to him being shot 10 times outside of his suburban home. KFMB-TV's Kyle Kraska, 48, hired shooting suspect Mike Montana to work on the outside of his house in the Scripps Ranch area of San Diego months before he was gunned down in his Mercedes on Tuesday. The broadcaster was dissatisfied with the job so paid the 54-year-old for the work he had done before the pair parted ways. For months the disgruntled Montana, who has pulled a gun on customers who owed him money in the past, left threatening notes at the journalist's home. His anger reached a tipping point earlier this week when he approached Kraska in his car and shot him 10 times through the back window. Scroll down for video . Dispute: Kyle Kraska, 48, (left) was shot by disgruntled painter Mike Montana, 54, (mugshot right) on Tuesday afternoon in the Scripps Ranch area of San Diego after a working relationship between the pair soured . Personality: Montana, described as 'erratic' by past clients, began leaving threatening notes at Kraska's home after the two parted ways. The sports anchor was said to be unhappy with the work done on his home . Montana, who surrendered to police hours after the incident, has had issues with working relationships in the past, leading him to pull a gun on people who owed him money and leave violent phone messages after a company told him to start one of his jobs again. The CBS affiliate station said Kraska's injuries were serious but his prognosis was good. He was recovering after surgery for 10 gun wounds, including shots to the leg and stomach. Todd Villalobos, a KFMB sports producer and friend of Kraska, told the station that the anchor hired Montana to paint the outside of his house after seeing him work in the neighborhood. Kraska was dissatisfied with the work, paid the painter for what he had done, and the two agreed to part ways. Months later, Montana began leaving notes on Kraska's door, Villalobos said, according to KFMB. San Diego police Lt. Scott Wahl said the dispute involved the painting of the anchor's house but didn't offer specifics. Montana surrendered to authorities Tuesday night, hours after the shooting and a SWAT standoff at his home in suburban El Cajon. He was booked into San Diego County jail and was scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday on a charge of attempted murder. Kraska, 48, is the sports director at KFMB, where he has worked since 1999. He has been a fixture in San Diego homes as the station's evening sports anchor since 2003 and hosts the San Diego Chargers postgame show. The Boston native previously worked for television stations in Los Angeles; Sarasota, Florida; Tampa, Florida; El Paso, Texas; and Albany, New York, according to KFMB. Hands up: The moment Montana surrendered to authorities on Tuesday evening was captured on camera . Outlook: Kraska's injuries were serious, but his employer KFMB-TV confirmed he is recovering and his prognosis is good. He has worked at the station since 1998 and is a fixture in San Diego homes . Popular: He has been sports director since 2008 and hosts the San Diego Charger's postgame show. He is pictured interviewing one of the players after a game . He began his career as weekend sports anchor in Watertown, New York, during his senior year at Syracuse University. Montana identified himself as self-employed and the sole owner of Superior Painting Corp. in a filing for personal bankruptcy protection in January 2014. He listed assets of $11,030, liabilities of $38,878 and monthly income of $2,012. Superior Painting's California business license was suspended in October 2013 for an unpaid balance of $1,951, said Tami Grimes, a spokeswoman for the state Franchise Tax Board. Robert Nicoll, who lives next door to Montana, told the U-T San Diego newspaper that Montana spoke to him about pulling a gun on three people who confronted him at work to demand that he stop seeking payment from a customer. Montana said the customer owed him money. Frank Coit, a senior manager at Lone Star General Contracting in Santee, told the newspaper that the company refused to pay Montana in full for a job that was incomplete and needed to be redone, eliciting threatening phone messages from Montana that included mention of a gun. 'He was a very erratic personality,' Coit said. Jail records do not list an attorney for Montana, who didn't immediately respond to an email sent through jail system. San Diego police said the attack was unrelated to any other crimes and described it as 'targeted.' '(The suspect) was looking for him,' said Wahl. 'He wasn't looking for someone else.'

"A 17-year-old boy has undergone the world's first penis reduction surgery, surgeons claim. The American teen requested the surgery after his penis grew too large, restricting his ability to have sex or play competitive sports. The boy's surgeons were shocked when he came to them complaining that his penis was too big. When flaccid, it measured almost seven inches in length and had a circumference of 10 inches - around the size of a grapefruit. Surgeons described it as being shaped like an American football. The surgeon who treated the teenager, Rafael Carrion, a urologist at the University of South Florida, told MailOnline: 'There comes a time in every urologist's career that a patient makes a request so rare and impossible to comprehend that all training breaks down and leaves the physician speechless. 'That question was ""can you make my penis smaller""?' A 17-year-old boy in Florida is thought to be the first person to undergo penis reduction surgery. The teenager requested the operation after his penis (pictured on an X-ray) grew too large . The teenager had suffered from several bouts of priapism - an unwanted erection, due to having a condition in which abnormally-shaped blood cells block vessels in the penis, causing it to swell. These episodes had left his penis bloated and misshapen. He said he was unable to have sex or play competitive sport, had difficulty wearing his pants due to his 'large and heavy phallus', and was embarrassed by how visible it appeared underneath regular clothing. Though his penis was so large, it did not grow when he had erections - it merely became firmer. 'His penis had inflated like a balloon,' said Dr Carrion. 'It sounds like a man's dream - a tremendously inflated phallus - but unfortunately although it was a generous length, it's girth was just massive, especially around the middle. 'It looked like an American football.' Dr Carrion and his team looked at the medical literature but couldn't find any precedent for what to do. 'Lord knows there's a global race on how to make it longer and thicker in plastic surgery circles, but very little on how to make it smaller,' he said. In the end, they decided to embark on a surgical technique normally used to treat Peyronie's disease, a condition where scar tissue develops along the penis, causing it to bend. The surgeons sliced along an old circumcision scar, unwrapped the skin of the penis, and cut out two segments of tissue from either side. 'It was a bit like having two side tummy-tucks - that's how we explained it to him,' said Dr Carrion. The teenager said he was unable to have sex or play competitive sport, had difficulty wearing his pants due to his 'large and heavy phallus', and was embarrassed by how visible it appeared underneath clothing (file pic) The doctors were able to bypass the urethra - the tube which carries urine through the penis - and all of the nerves that provide sensation. The teenager spent just two days in hospital before returning home, apparently 'ecstatic' with his new penis. The doctors did not take final measurements of the penis, although Dr Carrion told MailOnline the result was 'generous'. 'It's slightly longer and slightly thicker than the average male, but now it looks symmetrical, and the patient was very satisfied,' he said. The teen now has no problem having normal erections and has full sensation. 'It looks cosmetically appealing, and he said it was a life-changing event, he's all smiles,' said Carrion. Since the paper describing the surgery was published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, Dr Carrion has only had one person approach him to request the same surgery. He said: 'This [second] man seems to have a naturally large penis, because there's nothing unusual in his medical history, so it doesn't seem like there's any real abnormality in this case'. Whereas the first teenager had an obvious medical condition that needed treating, performing surgery on someone who is completely healthy but having difficulties with the size of his penis is another matter, said Dr Carrion. 'These are controversial waters we're stepping in,' he added. 'Who is to judge what is a legitimate complaint and what isn't? 'You don't normally have men complaining about this kind of thing. These are very unique cases.'","17-year-old complained his penis was too large, stopping him have sex .

"Bothered: Elderly and vulnerable homeowners are being targeted with nuisance calls (posed by model) Firms that bombard pensioners and Alzheimer’s sufferers with nuisance text messages and cold calls must be reined in, the Information Commissioner says. Christopher Graham, head of the watchdog responsible for guarding our personal information, said the Government was ‘letting people down’ by refusing to strengthen legislation to stop millions of people being harassed by calls. He urged ministers to change the law to make it easier to clamp down on unwanted calls and spam texts by companies promising to write off debts, pursue compensation and sell anything from mobile phones to double glazing. Elderly people and the vulnerable were ‘particularly at risk’ because they are more likely to be cajoled into buying products or services over the phone. Speaking at an event staged by the Alzheimer’s Society yesterday and attended by justice minister Simon Hughes, Mr Graham said: ‘The current rules around marketing calls are a licence for spammers and scammers. ‘The elderly and vulnerable are particularly at risk, and this can only add to the worries of those who care for them. The Government is letting people down. ‘Time and time again the Government talks about changing the law and clamping down on this problem, but so far it’s just that – talk. We seem to be going round in circles. The Government need to lay the order, change the law and bring in a reform that would make a real difference.’ In October, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid announced a six-week consultation on the issue. He said the law could be changed within 12 weeks of the end of the consultation. The Information Commissioner’s Office, which is responsible for regulating nuisance marketing calls and spam text messages, can impose fines up to £500,000. But the watchdog can issue penalties only if it can prove there has been ‘substantial damage or distress’. In October, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid (pictured) announced a six-week consultation on the issue . Mr Graham wants the burden of proof lowered so he can punish rogue firms. In December, an insurance firm was fined £90,000 after harassing elderly victims with cold calls. Croydon based boiler insurance company Kwik Fix Plumber Ltd – formerly Boiler Shield Ltd – repeatedly called elderly people, encouraging them to take out policies. Some paid for insurance it appeared they did not need. In the same month, the organisers of a Manchester music festival were fined £70,000 after sending unsolicited marketing text messages. The digital junk went to 70,000 people who had bought tickets for the city’s annual Parklife Weekender festival and appeared on recipients’ mobiles to have been sent by ‘Mum’.","Plea issued by Information Commissioner Christopher Graham .

"There are growing fears of 'lone wolf' terrorists in Australia following a string of recent incidents involving individuals who were not on security watch lists, meaning the threat is often with 'the guy next door'. The Sydney siege in December was conducted solely by gunman Man Monis. There have since been a string of arrests as police conduct terror raids across raids. On Tuesday, Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25, were the latest to be charged as they were allegedly preparing to carry out a terrorist attack in Sydney. Neither were on security watch-lists. However, a terrorism expert in Melbourne gave a warning four years ago of the growing threat from 'lone wolf' terrorists. Scroll down for video . Mohammad Kiad, 25 (right), and his Iraqi born housemate Omar Al-Kutobi, 24 (left), were arrested on terror charges in their shared squalid granny flat at Fairfield on Tuesday . Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs Ibrahim Al-Jaafari (left) shakes hands with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Thursday. Al-Jaafari is in Australia to give a first-hand update on the battle against Islamic State . Noor Huda Ismail went to school with a number of the Bali bombers, and developed a program to de-radicalise jihadists returning to Indonesia. He now lives in Melbourne and says would-be terrorists who are not connected to any command structure are almost impossible for security agencies to identify. Mr Ismail, who went to the Al-Mukmin Islamic boarding school in Solo, central Java, along with a number of the Bali bombers, says the arrests this week are further evidence the new breed of extremist is the 'guy next door'. 'This will be the difficulty of any security apparatus at the moment,' he said. 'This is clearly now the challenge. The biggest threat will come from people like that.' Mr Ismail identified the growing the threat from so-called lone-wolf terrorists, and in 2011 contributed to a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute warning of the increasing number of 'freelancers' inspired by groups such as al-Qaeda. In internet chatrooms, he says, these 'at risk' individuals will easily segue from conversations about 'hair gel' to talk about the 'latest beheading video'. Mr Ismail says it's almost impossible for security agencies to identify such people before they act, and authorities must 'move away from looking at this as a security issue and focus on the demographic aspect of the threat'. The comments come as details of the contents of a video allegedly made by Al-Kutobi and Kiad emerged on Thursday. During Question Time in parliament Prime Minister Tony Abbott gave a graphic description of the disturbing video. He explained that one of the men made threats about carrying out an attack on Australia and stabbing victims in their 'kidneys' and 'livers', whilst 'kneeling before the death cult flag with a knife in his hand and a machete before him'. Abbott informed parliament that the man on the video said: 'I swear to almighty Allah, blond people, there is no room for blame between you and us. 'We only are you, stabbing the kidneys and striking the necks.' Facebook pictures of  Kiad, who immigrated to Australia from Kuwait in 2009, revealed his fashion interest and showed him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as making some strange fashion statements . A keen weight-lifter, the 25-year-old removalist also shared selfies of himself at the gym . Mr Ismail says the language allegedly used in the video was undoubtedly aimed at 'glory for himself and to inspire others'. Mr Abbott made his comments while arguing that the parliament should pass the government's proposed further changes to data retention laws. This comes after social media accounts of one of the two men charged with plotting a terrorist attack involving large knives on Wednesday revealed he was a fashion-loving weightlifter with a keen eye for expensive jewellery. Pictures of Mohammad Kiad on his Facebook page show him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as taking numerous selfies while at the gym. In contrast to the snaps of him in shiny sparkling tight pants, other pictures show him wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces. However in person, the 25-year-old nurse who worked as a removalist has been described as a quiet man who never mentioned his religion, according to Fairfax. Both men  arrived in Australia from the Middle East seeking a better life as refugees but allegedly became radicalised in recent months, it has been claimed. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton told the Today Show on Thursday Kiad, from Kuwait, and Al-Kutobi, from Iraq, were granted refugee status. Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was studying to be a nurse after he arrived in Australia by plane in 2009. The Daily Telegraph alleges a senior intelligence source has confirmed he arrived in the country with false documentation. Mr Kiad entered Australia in 2012, where he had worked as a nurse - but when he arrived in Australia he found he could not transfer his skills. He was granted a visa under the family and spousal visa arrangements and recently took up a job as a removalist but was fired and was on the dole at the time of his arrest, it has been reported. A Sydney police station and officers on the street were revealed to have been the the targets with attacks scheduled for just before midnight on Tuesday, Channel Nine reported. In contrast to the snaps of him in shiny  pants, other pictures show him wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces . Pictures of the duo from mid-2013 show them poking faces and smoking shisha together. Mr Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was studying to be a nurse while Mr Kiad, originally from Kuwait where he immigrated from in 2009, was reported to have been recently fired from his removalist job. While some neighbours told Fairfax that he was 'friendly', 'open minded about religion' and 'never talked about Islam', others admitted he and Mr Al-Katobi had begun acting differently after the anti-terror raids in western Sydney last September. 'He began wearing a scarf, just like ISIS and Mohammad, he grew a long beard,' Neighbour Michael David said of Al-Kutobi. 'I heard them praying in [the granny flat] and reading the Koran,' said Mr David, who speaks Arabic. Ms Jeisele-Brown said the pair had fallen out with another neighbour over the last month or two for 'speaking sharp' and that she had been upset with them after finding a religious picture she owned dumped in the rubbish bin. Pictured smoking shisha in mid-2013: The mens' neighbours said they mostly kept to themselves but admitted their behaviour had changed drastically in the last few months following police raids in western Sydney and the Martin Place siege . 'I had been in hospital having chemotherapy and when I came back home my picture of Jesus Christ was missing,' she said. 'I found it in the rubbish. I don't know who dumped it but I thought ... I didn't say anything.' Neighbours Teresita Heisele-Brown said she had noticed that after the Martin place siege, the two men had had lengthy discussions in Arabic and had watched a lot of television, perhaps coverage of the a siege. She said when the police came around to arrest the pair, Mohammad had pretended he didn't speak English. She said detectives had made the men lie on the ground while they handcuffed them. Their home, workplaces and cars were all searched by police. On Thursday, accused terrorist Kiad accidentally appeared briefly in court.

"Jailed: Dr Michael Salmon, 80, faces his final years in prison after he was convicted of 11 sex attacks on six girls he was treating and jailed for 18 years . A ‘Cold-blooded and ruthless’ doctor who sexually assaulted patients as young as 12 at the hospital at the centre of the Jimmy Savile scandal has been jailed for 18 years. Michael Salmon, 80, was convicted of a string of rapes and indecent assaults on seriously ill patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where Savile abused scores of youngsters at the same time. Salmon, a renowned children’s doctor who was praised by Princess Diana for his charity work, lured a 16-year-old girl to his home where he raped her in his bedroom. Other vulnerable teenagers were molested between 1980 and 1988, often while their unsuspecting parents sat on the other side of a screen at the Buckinghamshire hospital. It can now be revealed that Salmon has enjoyed the lifestyle of a country gentleman for the past decade on an NHS pension worth as much as £100,000 a year – despite being struck off from the medical register in 1991. He was jailed for 18 months in November 1990 after admitting indecently assaulting three girls as young as 12. But on his release from Grendon Underwood Prison, he reinvented himself as a wildlife expert and bought a £700,000, four-bedroom home in the picturesque village of Woodgreen on the edge of the New Forest National Park where no one knew of his past. There, Salmon told neighbours he was a distinguished retired hospital consultant who hailed from a family of esteemed doctors descended from aristocracy. The twice-married father of two quickly established himself in the community, becoming a member of the golf club and a regular attendee at church. Abuse: Six victims who were being treated at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the 1980s fell into the clutches of Salmon who indecently assaulted and raped girls as young as 12 . He insisted on being addressed as ‘Dr’ in his church and golf club circles, where he said he was descended directly from the Duke of Northumberland and claimed to be a world expert on butterflies who advised the Natural History Museum. But he remained far from popular in the village, where he was described as ‘sneery’, ‘pompous’ and ‘haughty’. One resident said: ‘He told us he was related to the Percy family of Northumberland. He went up to Alnwick Castle and he said he could see the family likeness in the portraits.’ Salmon claimed to be a wildlife expert, having travelled to Zambia in 1984 with the BBC Natural History Unit. He boasted how he had published a book on British butterflies and claimed he regularly visited the Natural History Museum in London to give advice. But when contacted by the Mail, the museum said it had never heard of him. Marriage: Salmon's wife Susie, pictured together last month, has stood by her husband despite the terrible abuse, but was not in court to see him jailed . It wasn’t until the Savile scandal erupted that the true scale of Salmon’s offending emerged when new victims came forward. But residents in his village had long held suspicions, with one neighbour telling the Mail: ‘I thought he was a dirty old man.’ Yesterday a judge at Reading Crown Court said Salmon was a predatory paedophile as she sentenced him for two rapes and nine indecent assaults on six girls between 1980 and 1988. Judge Johanna Cutts QC said: ‘These are the actions that breached, in the most heinous way, what the medical profession stands for. This was someone who was cold and calculating. ‘It was your conceited arrogance that led to your downfall. ‘All the girls were ill at the time. They were treated as objects for your sexual gratification.’ Speaking about the 16-year-old victim whom he raped in his home, the judge said: ‘You raped her at a time when she couldn’t have been more vulnerable. 'This court sees a lot of rape cases. It is rare to see such cold-blooded and ruthless behaviour as against this girl.’ As his victims wept in the public gallery yesterday, Salmon – who had a picture of Savile on the wall of his office – remained stony-faced. He betrayed no emotion as he listened to moving victim impact statements from the women, one of whom said she suffered nightmares and another who said she couldn’t get Salmon’s face ‘out of her head’. Jessica Standley, an abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon which represented two of his victims, said: ‘The crimes he committed were among the most despicable imaginable. 'This case raises serious questions about the culture at Stoke Mandeville Hospital at the time Jimmy Savile and Salmon were there.’","Paediatrician Michael Salmon abused girls as young as 12 in the 1980s .

"Police failed to notice a mentally ill 16-year-old girl in custody had refused food or water for 44 hours before they took her to hospital, it has been revealed. The 'serious' incident was among several highlighted in a report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) on standards of child protection within Nottinghamshire Police. Conducted in September as part of a programme assessing child protection throughout England and Wales, HMIC inspectors expressed concern at cases in which children were being unnecessarily detained in police custody overnight. The 16-year-old girl refused food or water for 44 hours before police took her to hospital, the report revealed . Giving details of 'the most serious case' seen by inspectors, in which a 16-year-old was detained for 52 hours before being taken to hospital, the report said: 'It was only after the girl had been in custody for 44 hours that custody staff realised that she had gone without food or water. 'She was subsequently treated by a paramedic before being taken to hospital. 'The force was fully aware of the circumstances of this case, which was subject to an independent health service review at the time of the inspection, but it was not clear to inspectors that steps had been taken to learn the lessons.' In a statement, Nottinghamshire Police said the girl, who was in custody under mental health laws for her own protection, had declined the offer of food and water on several occasions. HM Inspector of Constabulary Zoe Billingham (pictured) said it was clear Nottinghamshire Police needed to do more to improve its approach to protecting children . Assistant Chief Constable Steve Jupp said the force recognised that people in crisis due to mental health should not be in police custody. Mr Jupp said: 'We never want to be in a position where children need to be taken into custody, whether for crimes or because of mental health issues, and we continue to work with our partners to find alternative accommodation wherever possible. 'A full review into the case of the 16-year-old girl who was arrested has been conducted. 'Doctors and nurses assessed her welfare, and she was deemed to require specialist mental health assistance, and attempts were made over many hours to find appropriate accommodation.' HM Inspector of Constabulary Zoe Billingham said: 'It is clear that despite good work in many areas, Nottinghamshire Police needs to do more to improve its approach to protecting children. 'We found some areas of practice that are uniformly good, for example, the management of sex offenders. 'However there is often a lack of effective supervision of child protection investigations, which sometimes results in unacceptable delays and an inconsistent approach across the force. 'I encourage Nottinghamshire Police to act on our recommendations as a matter of urgency, and I have asked that within six weeks it provides me with an action plan to demonstrate how it will take forward our recommendations for improvement.' The report noted police staff responsible for managing child abuse investigations in Nottinghamshire were highly committed and dedicated to providing good outcomes for children.","Police did not realise the teenager, 16, had not eaten or drunk for 44 hours .

"Ryanair was forced to correct its website this week after it claimed that Sicily's capital has been dominated by the Cosa Nostra for 'many years'. 'Palermo is a forgotten treasure,' said Ryanair in the tourist guide section on its website, 'dominated for many years by the Mafia and poverty, the city has reclaimed a place among European cultural cities.' The description sparked outrage from Sicilian regional tourism alderman Cleo Li Catzi and Fabio Giambrone, president of the Gesap company managing Palermo's Falcone-Borsellino airport. Officials in Palermo, Sicily have reacted angrily after Ryanair described the city as being run by the Mafia for many years . If you look closely in the circle, you will spot the word 'mafia', which has caused outrage in Italy . Users on Twitter reacted to Ryanair's description of Palermo by describing it as an #epicfail . Ryanair marketing manager Giuseppe Belladone said: 'We are removing the content in question, this is content supplied to us by a third party and this detail escaped an internal check.' The Sicilian Mafia, also known as Cosa Nostra ('Our Thing'), is a criminal syndicate in Sicily, Italy. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a common organizational structure and code of conduct, and whose core activities are protection racketeering and the arbitration of disputes in the black market. Each group, known as a 'family', 'clan', or 'cosca', claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighbourhood (borgata) of a larger city, in which it operates its rackets. Its members call themselves 'men of honour', although the public often refers to them as 'mafiosi'. Police crackdowns in recent years have sought to limit the power of the group. Many key leaders have been arrested and jailed. 'On behalf of Ryanair I want to apologise for what happened. 'The statements do not reflect the content in question or the thoughts of Ryanair on the city of Palermo.' The site description now speaks of Palermo as  'intoxicating, lively and energetic.' Twitter users reacted to the description by labelling it as an 'epic fail' and a 'sensational gaffe'. Steve Knox labelled the description 'typical lazy Ryanair,' and labelled Palermo a 'great city.' Meanwhile John Hard Tweeted his belief that those upset with the description should 'boycott' the airline. However, there are others who have simply stated that the original description was 'telling the truth.' One supporter on Twitter, interestingly, is a group called 'Live Palermo'. They Tweeted to the no-frills airline expressing their 'support' and Tweeted that they failed to see the 'error' in the original description. Sicily is known as the birthplace of the Italian Mafia, however in recent years police crackdowns have detained some of the key players. Dozens were arrested in 'Operation Apocalypse' in June last year, with local police saying that two entire Mafia families had been wiped out. The investigation also solved a 100-year-old murder of a New York policeman. Extortion, money laundering and drug trafficking are among the offences alleged by the Palermo Anti-Mafia Investigation Department, which co-ordinated the operation - codenamed Apocalypse or Apocalisse in Italian. 'There hasn't been a dragnet on this scale in many years,' finance police Colonel Calogero Scibetta told Reuters at the time. 'These arrests have wiped out two entire mob families.' In recent years police have dealt severe blows to the Sicilian Mafia, historically Italy's most powerful criminal group while 'Ndrangheta, which operates out of Calabria at the southern end of the Italian mainland, has grown in strength by becoming a big importer of cocaine. Domenico Rancadore, now residing in the UK, is believed to be one of the Sicilian Mafia's big players . Mafia fugitive Domenico Rancadore was arrested last year over his connections to Italian crime gangs. The 65-year-old is described as 'one of the heads of one of the most powerful mafia associations in Italy' by Adam Harbinson, representing the Italian authorities. The Metropolitan Police arrested Rancadore at his home in Uxbridge, west London, following a new European Arrest Warrant request from Italy. Mr Harbinson told the court that the latest arrest warrant is identical to the previous one, save for assurances about the prison conditions he faced with in Italy. It alleges that Rancadore has an 'outstanding sentence of seven years imprisonment to serve for participation in Mafia association' between 1987 and 1995 in Palermo. Rancadore, known as The Professor, was first arrested in August last year under a European Arrest Warrant for the same allegations. He had evaded Italian authorities for 20 years, who accused him of fleeing Italy, where he faced trial over his alleged Cosa Nostra 'man of honour' connections. Rancadore and his wife moved with their two children to Uxbridge in 1994 and lived under the name of Skinner, the maiden name of Mrs Rancadore's British mother. Police arrested 'Marc Skinner' under a European arrest warrant on August 7, 2014 at his upmarket semi-detached home. At a previous hearing, Mr Rancadore said he came to the UK to give his children 'a good life', and to bring his time in Italy to an end. Police arrested Mafia don Domenico Rancadore at his west London home; wanted in Italy for connections to the Cosa Nostra crime syndicate . Details about this unassuming pensioner's secret double life — part-time chauffeur and devoted father who slipped into the United Kingdom 20 years ago and mafia crime boss during a 25-year criminal career in Italy — emerged this week after a British judge refused an Italian request for extradition. It is claimed Rancadore ordered henchmen to send a lamb's head still dripping with blood, along with three silver bullets, to a Sicilian priest who had dared speak out against his mafia clan. Accompanying them was a note to Father Gino Sacchetti, who ran a charity on land wanted by Domenico, making clear what would happen if he did not give it up: 'One is for your head, one for your heart. One is for the coup de grace. This is your final warning. His father, Giuseppe, was one of the most feared mobsters in Sicily.","Description sparked outrage from Sicilian regional tourism members .

"Lord Darzi, who suffered from meningitis himself as a child, has slammed the NHS for not introducing a meningitis vaccine, despite it being approved . Former health minister Lord Darzi has condemned the government's two year delay in introducing a vaccine against the last major strain of meningitis because of wrangling over funding. Britain has one of the highest rates of Meningitis B in the world and campaigners have warned that dozens of lives have needlessly been lost to the disease because of procrastination by officials. Prof Lord Darzi, who revealed for the first time that he almost died of the disease aged five, has even personally met with Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, to plead with him to introduce the vaccine on the NHS as soon as possible. He said: 'Every parent should be getting the vaccine through the NHS.' The Bexsero Meningitis B vaccine was licensed two years ago and a year later it was backed for NHS use by vaccine advisers, who initially declared it would not be cost-effective 'at any price'. However the Department of Health did not even enter negotiations with the manufacturers Novartis until six months ago. Statistics show one baby dies every month in Britain from Meningitis B. There has been stalemate over the cost of the jab to the NHS, which has not been revealed. It is available privately at a cost of up to £600 in some areas. Lord Darzi, who is patron of the charity Meningitis Now, said: 'The government eventually decided to make the vaccine available through the NHS after a significant amount of lobbying from the charity, including myself in visiting the Secretary to State to discuss the matter. 'I think there has been some delays since the announcement by the Secretary of State which are mostly operational. 'I hope they will be overcome so that the vaccine will be utilised by those in need.' He said: 'Although I got meningitis at the age of 5, I still remember it was the least pleasant experience but more importantly I am very fortunately and lucky to be alive. 'I believe if the NHS has approved the vaccine, then every parent should be getting the vaccine through the NHS route rather than the costly private alternative.' It is feared that if agreement cannot be reached soon the process will be further delayed by the General Election. A U-turn by medical advisers to the Government last March led to routine vaccination being approved for infants and a one-off catch up programme for babies aged three and four months. Professor John Watson, deputy chief medical officer, said at the time: 'We will be working closely with Novartis in the coming months and, if negotiations are successful, we hope to work with the other UK health departments to introduce a vaccine to prevent meningitis B as quickly as possible.' The Bexsero Meningitis B vaccine was sanctioned for use two years ago, and approved for NHS use soon after, but health chiefs only entered talks with suppliers six months ago . Meningitis Now has launched a hard hitting TV advert in an attempt to keep the disease in the forefront of ministers' minds. Founder of the charity, Steve Dayman who lost his baby Spencer to Meningitis B in 1982, said 'I have waited half my life for this vaccine – it's a watershed moment in the fight to eradicate the deadly disease. 'Now is the time to act to save our children – one more lost is another heinous and scandalous injustice. 'On this unwelcome anniversary, I call on Government and the vaccine manufacturer to take advantage of the last window of time before the General Election to do the right thing.' During the last two years there have been 1,130 cases of Meningitis B, of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities. Many of these would have been avoidable if the vaccine had been introduced immediately after it was licensed. Mr Dayman added: 'I was sick to my stomach to learn that so many people have died in the two years due to red tape. 'Tragically, in the time, we've heard of and helped numerous families freshly touched by the disease, which prove this lethargic bureaucracy is costing lives and causing disabilities.' A spokesman for Novartis said 'Novartis Vaccines is currently engaged in a procurement process with the UK Department of Health to agree a price for Bexsero to be included on the National Immunisation Programme. 'Whilst it is not possible to comment on the process, or predict how long it will last, both sides are working to come to an agreement and Novartis Vaccines stands ready to supply Bexsero immediately. 'Unfortunately the confidential nature of this process makes it impossible for Novartis Vaccines to comment further on any elements of the negotiations.' A Department of Health spokesperson said 'We are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease. 'The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) recommended that a MenB vaccine be introduced, but only at a cost-effective price – below the price published by Novartis. 'We need to make sure NHS funds are used effectively and negotiations are continuing.'","Jab approved years ago but officials only just started talking to suppliers .

"A married high school teacher from Washington state accused of having sex with her 15-year-old student pleaded not guilty today to child rape charges. Stephanie McCrea, 35, a drama and English teacher at Evergreen High School in Vancouver, was arrested in late January on suspicion of carrying on a sexual relationship with a teenage boy. On Wednesday, Miss McCrea arrived at Clark County Superior Court dressed in all black, with her attorney by her side, and entered not guilty pleas to four counts of third-degree child rape, four counts of first-degree sexual misconduct and tampering with a witness. In court: Teacher Stephanie McCrea (pictured here in January)  pleaded not guilty today to child rape charges after being accused of having sex with a 15-year-old boy at school and at her home . About a dozen people, including McCrea’s family, friends, and current and former students, attended the formal arraignment to offer her their support. One of the people from the audience was seen approaching an emotional Ms McCrea and giving her a hug. McCrea is set to go on trial May 18. She has been out on $40,000 bail since January 28. According to court documents shared by The Oregonian around the time of the teacher's arrest, the teenage victim told authorities that he met the married mother of one four or five times each week in her office, where they would kiss before school and after drama rehearsals. He also said that she performed oral sex on him at school before the Christmas break, and over the vacation, she allegedly collected the boy and took him to her home for sex. They then met up with other drama class students and went to a movie, with the permission of the boy's parents, according to the court documents. Once they returned to school after the break, they had sex on the campus, the boy told police. Clark County prosecutor Camara Banfield told Judge David Gregorson last month that McCrea had threatened to kill herself if the student revealed the alleged sex abuse, The Oregonian reported. The victim even agreed to set up fake Facebook accounts so they could exchange messages while avoiding detection, she said. McCrea, who was hired by Evergreen High School in 2006, was put on administrative leave after officials learned of the alleged affair - but the sexual abuse continued, Banfield said. McCrea's attorney, Steve Thayer, said McCrea and her husband separated in December and that she attempted to take her life two weeks before her arrest. The estranged couple have a nine-year-old son together. According to the woman's attorney, she started suffering mental health issues after a car accident in 2012. Making headlines: McCrea, pictured with an article about one of her plays, taught theater and English . At work: McCrea, pictured at a rehearsal, was put on administrative leave earlier this month after the school's administrators learned about the allegations. They contacted police, who launched an investigation . Principal Lisa Emmerich shared 'the disturbing news' of McCrea's arrest in an email to parents, reported The Columbian. Emmerich explained that as soon as administrators learned of the accusations, they contacted Vancouver police, who launched an investigation. The school continues to work with the police. McCrea was hired by the school in 2006 after passing all necessary background checks, she said. 'At this point, no other students have been identified or come forward with additional information or allegations,' her letter read. Property records listed her as living with a 34-year-old man in Vancouver. Students also told KOIN6 that she has one child. Most recently, she directed a student play called 'The Investigation' and afterwards, she took to the theatre department's Facebook play to gush about the show. 'I could not have asked for a better experience as a teacher and director. Thank you all,' she wrote. Popular: Some students voiced their support for the teacher, pictured center, following her arrest on Tuesday . Scene: McCrea, who is married with a child, joined the high school in 2006, the principal said . The allegations against Stephanie McCrea have left the Evergreen High School community divided. Becky Young, whose son was in McCrea's class, was in court for her arraignment Wednesday. She said news of the drama teacher's arrest 'crushed' her son. ‘My son considered her a friend and that's where the line has been blurred,’ Young told The Oregonian. ‘It's frustrating because the truth is out there. My son looked up to her and she abused that right.’ Kimberly Boucher, an alumna of the school who worked on theater productions under McCrea, came out to support the suspended teacher, saying that she is still standing by her.","Mother-of-one Stephanie McCrea was arrested January 27 for 'having sex at her home and at school with the 15-year-old student'

"Kristin Beck, a transgender former Navy SEAL, is planning a primary challenge to the second-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer. Beck would be the first transgendered American to serve in Congress, a trailblazer status that will make it practically difficult to attack her in campaign ads. But she has already given Hoyer some ammunition that has nothing to do with her sex-reassignment. 'The religion of today’s world is going to destroy the earth,' Beck wrote Feb. 2 on Facebook, in an apparent slap at faiths that judge her situation harshly. 'I really believe this is true.' Scroll down for video . Kristin Beck had to wait to dress like a woman and take hormone therapy until her 20 years of US Navy service were over, since transgender Americans are banned from the military . FROM CHRISTOPHER TO KRISTIN: She served as a Navy SEAL through 13 deployments and is now running for Congress in Maryland as a woman . House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland is the second highest-ranking Democrat and will face a long-shot challenge in next year's primary election . 'I don’t worry about global warming or the politics of China or communism; I worry about religiosity.' 'The two biggest culprits today are the Christians and the Muslims with communism (void of religion, but full of indoctrination and zeal) – taking up a poll [sic] position,' she wrote. 'The Christians had their Crusades and Inquisitions and their hunting of outcasts and naysayer; which includes people like me throughout time (I will not drink hemlock).' 'Now Islam seems to be following suit,' she claimed, 'and maybe, thanks to modern technology and greater population density could out kill the Christians.' The state Board of Elections website shows Beck filed her candidacy paperwork Monday. Her campaign website highlights her military service and criticizes the government's handling of the home-loan crisis. It says Hoyer 'has been too busy helping Wall Street since 2008 to even notice Main Street. Hoyer says he'll work to earn his constituents' votes in 2016, but he will face a colorful campaign to send him into retirement. Beck considered running for a House seat in Florida last year but didn't meet the filing deadline, according to news reports. She was a member of both SEAL Team 1 and the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group, a specialized counterterrorism unit referred to by civilians as SEAL Team Six,and 6. After her military retirement in 2011 she started dressing as a woman and then underwent hormone therapy to transition from male to female. Hoyer's seat is considered safe in liberal Maryland. He has been a member of Congress since 1981 and supports gay marriage. 'I fought for 20 years for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,' she told CNN; 'I want some happiness' Some of Beck's former comrades have been accepting of her choice, but not all . One of his daughters is gay and came out as a lesbian just after he announced his position on same-sex unions. Beck was the subject of a CNN film called 'Lady Valor' and told host Anderson Cooper in September that she wanted to be a SEAL because they were 'the toughest of the tough.' 'I fought for 20 years for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,' she said. 'I want some happiness.' She was deployed 13 times in all, serving in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. She earned a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart and other decorations. She told Cooper that she had felt like a woman trapped in a man's body since elementary school, but had to keep it a secret in adulthood because transgender men and women are banned from serving in the U.S. military. In her Facebook essay, Beck complained that she is 'hated by all of the religions with equal zeal.' 'I am living my life as my spirit guides. I prefer two-spirit or twin flame,' she wrote. 'I am not in the wrong body and I have transitioned nothing; I have not changed.' 'My life now, showing two-spirits has put me in direct fire of the prejudice and outright mistreatment toward women, minorities and people who live outside of norms. I see the issues and weep over the subjugation of women and minorities around the world.' 'I lived as a man and now as a woman,' she added; 'I am living a path of two-spirits and the religious zealots say, ""This is against god’s plan"".' 'I ask you, ""How do you know?"" What if my journey while here on earth is to live in both genders? What if this is god’s plan?'","Steny Hoyer, the House Whip, will face a primary challenge from Kristin Beck, born Christopher Beck .

"It was third time lucky for SpaceX who today launched an observatory  toward a solar-storm lookout point a million miles away. The unmanned Falcon 9 rocket blasted off at 6:03pm EST from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in perfect weather conditions. High seas, however, prompted SpaceX to cancel a test that would have landed the rocket's discarded first stage on a platform in the ocean. Scroll down for video . The unmanned Falcon 9 rocket, launched by SpaceX and carrying the Deep Space Climate Observatory Satellite, lifted off from launch pad 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida today . The California-based company said its autonomous spaceport drones were instead heading back to port in Jacksonville, Florida to pick up the remains. 'Rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target & nicely vertical! High probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather,' tweeted Elon Musk. 'We are experiencing just such weather in the Atlantic with waves reaching up to three stories in height crashing over the decks,' SpaceX said in a statement. 'Also, only three of the drone ship's four engines are functioning, making station-keeping in the face of such wave action extremely difficult. 'The rocket will still attempt a soft landing in the water through the storm (producing valuable landing data), but survival is highly unlikely.' This time, the wind stayed within safety limits and everything else went SpaceX's way - at least for launch . The unmanned Falcon 9 rocket blasted off on the third try in four days, hoisting the spacecraft for Nasa . Sending the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Satellite observatory on its $340 million mission was the main event of this launch. DSCOVR (pronounced discover) is designed to provide advance warnings of solar outbursts that could disrupt life here on Earth. DSCOVR will spend nearly four months traveling one million miles, four times farther than the moon, to the so-called Lagrange point, a gravity-neutral position in direct line with the sun. At this lookout location, 92 million miles from the sun, it will provide advance warnings of incoming geomagnetic storms that could disrupt power and communications on Earth, beginning around midsummer. The steady stream of Earth pictures, meanwhile, is expected to be high on the 'wow' factor. The observatory's camera will provide the first snapshots of the entire home planet, its full face lit by the sun, since Nasa's final Apollo moon-landing in 1972. Subsequent Earth views have been stitched together from multiple images. Sending the DSCOVR observatory on its $340 million mission was the main event. It represented the first deep-space mission for SpaceX. DSCOVR replaces a 17-year-old satellite monitoring for potentially dangerous solar storms, which can disrupt GPS signals, block radio communications and impact power grids on Earth. It will take DSCOVR 110 days to reach its operational orbit around the sun. where it will serve as a weather buoy, providing about an hour's advance notice of threatening solar activity. DSCOVR also has two sensors to monitor Earth to track volcanic plumes, measure ozone and monitor droughts, flooding and fires. Former Vice President Al Gore - who dreamed up the idea for an environmentally conscious, Earth-gazing satellite 17 years ago - returned for the sunset launch. He was at the previous two attempts as well, eager to see his brainchild finally soar. SpaceX said there will be many other opportunities this year for test. Dangerously high winds kept the deep-space observatory grounded yesterday and put off a radically new landing test of the booster rocket. SpaceX called off its sunset launch with just 12 minutes remaining in the countdown because of gusts of 115 mph several miles up - strong enough to damage the rocket in flight. Last-minute radar trouble foiled Sunday's launch effort, then SpaceX skipped Monday because of heavy rain. And last month's inaugural test ended in flames after the launch of a supply run to the International Space Station. With three hours remaining in the countdown, SpaceX called off the radical landing test of the first-stage booster. It would have been just the second such experiment; last month's try ended in flames when the booster slammed into the platform, fell over and exploded. Pictured is the launch in Florida . DSCOVR will spend nearly four months traveling one million miles, four times farther than the moon, to the so-called Lagrange point, a gravity-neutral position in direct line with the sun .

Photographers line up at sunset to capture the unmanned Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the DSCOVR satellite . The first-stage booster ran out of hydraulic fluid too soon and slammed into the platform, falling over and exploding. SpaceX added extra hydraulic fluid for the guidance fins this time. But Musk and others warned the landing would be harder to nail because of the booster's higher incoming speed from 80 miles up. Musk - whose Southern California company delivers supplies to the International Space Station and aims to haul astronauts as well in two years - wants to start retrieving and reusing his rockets to save time and money. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. Saturday's mission was the group's first to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea, which was held in position using deep-sea oil rigs.

"A friend of ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller, who was confirmed dead this week, revealed she left her a message shortly after being kidnapped by militants begging her to help her escape and saying 'I'm so sick, I'm dying.' Kayla Mueller, of Arizona, was kidnapped by ISIS in Aleppo in 2013 and was confirmed dead on Friday. The Islamic extremist group claimed she had died during a Jordanian airstrike in Raqqa and later sent her family photos of her dead body to confirm it. One of these photos showed the aid worker covered in a white burial shroud, intended to show she had been treated with respect. Others showed bruising on her face, supposedly a sign of the airstrike - a fact disputed by US authorities and Jordan. Oruba Barakat told CNN she had befriended the aid worker in Turkey before she left for Syria and later received a desperate message from her after she had been captured by ISIS militants. Scroll down for video . Aid worker Kayla Mueller phoned a friend begging for help shortly after she had been kidnapped by ISIS as she left a Syrian hospital, her friend Oruba Barakat revealed. The 26-year-old American hostage was confirmed dead last week . 'She said 'please try to help me, get me out, I'm so sick I'm dying,' said Ms Barakat, recalling the message. Miss Mueller was captured in August 2013 as she left a Doctors without Borders hospital. After Miss Mueller had been taken, along with three other hostages, Ms Barakat said she tried in vain to get her contacts to convince ISIS to release her - but with no success. Two to three months later she received a message from her. Ms Barakat said the message from Miss Mueller lasted 10-15 seconds and she was never able to contact her herself. 'She begged for help,' she added. 'I called the American Embassy, I called many people inside Syria asking for help asking if they could convince ISIS to free her because she is a very good girl and did good things for Syrians. But ISIS doesn't care about Syrians. But as more months passed it began to look more impossible that Miss Mueller would be released. Ms Barakat said the three other people with her - all Syrian - were eventually released purely, she suspects, because being from Syria meant they had 'little value' to ISIS. Miss Mueller had volunteered to help people dispersed across the world and is pictured giving a presentation to a group in 2013 as part of her dedication to her humanitarian work . Miss Mueller wanted to help Syrians who had been dispersed by the civil war and worked for Support to Life . Ms Barakat said she asked her friend not to travel to Syria, but she was determined to go and try and help people. ISIS claimed they had treated the aid worker with respect - a fact echoed in a letter written by Kayla while she was in captivity. After she died militants are believed to have sent a message to her parents, along with three photos of her dead body. Officials told CBS that one photo showed her covered in the shroud, while two others showed bruising on her face. It has not yet been confirmed how she died. An intelligence assessment has also revealed she may have been offered as a bride to an ISIS fighter. During her time in captivity the family also received a video featured the aid worker, forcibly filmed by ISIS as proof she was still alive. Miss Mueller's parents have released a letter their daughter wrote to them while being held in captivity telling them to be strong and not worry, and that she was being well looked after (full transcript below) Miss Mueller had been working with humanitarian groups helping Syrian refugees dispersed by the civil war when she left for Syria. He attitude and dedication to her volunteer work is revealed in a letter received by Miss Mueller's parents, which she wrote in captivity. 'I have been shown in darkness, light + have learned that even in prison, one can be free. I am grateful,' she wrote. 'I have come to see that there is good in every situation, sometimes we just have to look for it.' The aid worker, who had dedicated her life to helping people across the globe who had become dispersed, also said she had been well looked after, writing that she had even put on weight. She added: 'I have been treated w/ the utmost respect + kindness.' Extremist militants are understood to have sent an email to Miss Mueller's parents confirming her death. This contained photos of her body - one covered in a white shroud, which they claims show they had treated her with respect. Miss Mueller graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009 and since then spent her time volunteering across the world - including in India and Palestine. Her humanitarian service over the years included volunteer work at a women's shelter in her hometown of Prescott, as well as work at an HIV/AIDS clinic. She has even been praised by American president Barack Obama, who previously said: 'She epitomized all that is good in our world.' Everyone, If you are receiving this letter it means I am still detained but my cell mates (starting from 11/2/2014) have been released. I have asked them to contact you + send you this letter. It's hard to know what to say. Please know that I am in a safe location, completely unharmed + healthy(put on weight in fact); I have been treated w/ the utmost respect + kindness. I wanted to write you all a well thought out letter (but I . didn't know if my cellmates would be leaving in the coming days or the coming months restricting my time but primarily) I could only but write the letter a paragraph at a time, just the thought of you all sends me into a fit of tears. If you could say I have 'suffered' at all throughout this whole experience it is only in knowing how much suffering I have put you all through; I will never ask you to forgive me as I do not deserve forgiveness. I remember mom always telling me that all in all in the end the only one you really have is God. I have come to a place in experience where, in every sense of the word, I have surrendered myself to our creator b/c literally there was no else….+ by God + by your prayers I have felt tenderly cradled in freefall. I have been shown in darkness, light + have learned that even in prison, one can be free. I am grateful. I have come to see that there is good in every situation, sometimes we just have to look for it. I pray each each day that if nothing else, you have felt a certain closeness + surrender to God as well + have formed a bond of love + support amongst one another… . I miss you all as if it has been a decade of forced separation. I have had many a long hour to think, to think of all the things I will do w/ Lex, our first family camping trip, the first meeting @ the airport.I have had many hours to think how only in your absence have I finally @ 25 years old come to realize your place in my life. The gift that is each one of you + the person I could + could not be if you were not a part of my life, my family, my support. I DO NOT want the negotiations for my release to be your duty, if there is any other option . take it, even if it takes more time. This should never have become your burden. I have asked these women to . support you; please seek their advice. If you have not done so already, [REDACTED] can contact [REDACTED] who may have a certain level of experience with these people. None of us could have known it would be this long but know I am also fighting from my side in the ways I am able + I have a lot of fight left . inside of me. I am not breaking down + I will not give in no matter how long it takes. I wrote a song some months ago that says, 'The part of me that pains the most also gets me out of bed, w/out your hope there would be nothing left…' aka -¬ The thought of your pain is the source of my own, simultaneously the hope of our reunion is the source of my strength. Please be patient, give your pain to God. I know you would want me to remain strong. That is exactly what I am doing. Do not fear for me, continue to pray as will I + by God's will we will . be together soon. All my everything, . Kayla .","Kayla Mueller was an aid-worker, basing herself at the Turkey-Syria border .

"A new action movie out this week includes a scene in which a U.S. President – clearly based on Barack Obama – gets his head blown to bits. Kingsman: The Secret Service stars Colin Firth as a British secret agent attempting to save the world from a billionaire bad guy played by Samuel L Jackson. The cheeky James Bond-influenced caper opens this weekend and some critics have been quick to wonder if it is the first major studio movie to kill a sitting U.S President. Kingsman:The Secret Service tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid, played by Taron Egerton, who is recruited by Colin Firth's secret agent character . Cinematic killings of a current U.S. president are virtually unheard of in major studio movies, although President George W. Bush was assassinated by a sniper's bullet in the 2006 British indie docudrama Death of a President. Kingsman, based upon an acclaimed comic book and directed by Matthew Vaughn, of X-Men: First Class fame, doesn't refer to President Obama by name but the inference is clear. In one scene Jackson's character Valentine is seen pitching his evil plan at the White House and he shakes hands with a man who - although he only see him from behind - is clearly supposed to be President Obama. Later on in the film we see as the Obama-esque leader's head explode. Director Vaughn isn't shy about admitting that the character is supposed to the POTUS. 'The White House and Obama-ish president — there's no other symbol about a global power than the White House,' he told IGN. 'If I used 10 Downing Street, most people would go, 'What's that little black door? Where is that? Who is that?' So I needed to show that Valentine was — when you hear Valentine saying, 'Politicians are s***,' you pull back and go, 'Oh, f***! He's in the White House! This guy's powerful.'' Director Matthew Vaughn isn't shy about admitting that the character is supposed to be President Obama . Samuel L Jackson plays a billionaire bad guy in Kingsman who is attempting to take over the world . Kingsman is released by Twentieth Century Fox, a sister company of Fox News which is well known for not being a big fan of President Obama. The film is released not long after the controversy surrounding Sony's The Interview which featured North Korean leader Kim Jung-Un being assassinated. The Secret Service tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. It also stars Mark Strong, Taron Egerton and Michael Caine. The 2006 indie  Death of a President featured George W. Bush being assassinated by a sniper's bullet .","WARNING SPOILER ALERT!

"Retired Marine Eddie Routh, the man accused of murdering famed sniper Chris Kyle and his friend, confessed to police officers on camera that he had 'taken a couple of souls' and had more to take, it was revealed during his trial Thursday. The body camera footage shows officers in Lancaster, near Dallas, trying to coax Routh from a pickup truck in the hours after Kyle and Chad Littlefield were found dead at a shooting range in February 2013. The video played Thursday in Routh's murder trial shows him negotiating with police while making comments like, 'Anarchy has been killing the world.' Scroll down for video . This is the moment Eddie Routh surrendered to police after a 30-minute standoff. The dashcam footage was shown in court today as the former Marine stands trial for killing American Sniper Chris Kyle . Eddie Ray Routh (center) arrives in court on Thursday in the second day of his capital murder trial. The former Marine stands accused of shooting to death Navy SEAL Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield . The 27-year-old also talked about voodoo, hell, and the apocalypse, and wondered aloud to the cops, ' I don't know if I'm going insane.' Routh eventually sped away from officers, who pursued and rammed the pickup before the suspect surrendered. It also emerged on Day 2 of the trial that two hours after the alleged shooting, Routh drove Kyle's pickup truck to a Taco Bell drive-through where he bought two burritos for $2.36. Prosecutors say the stop for a meal proves Routh was mentally competent when he killed Kyle and his friend. Routh has pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charges on the basis that he is mentally ill, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Lancaster police later intercepted Routh parked outside a home where they had a 30-minute standoff, trying to convince him to exit the car. Instead, Routh sped off and it wasn't until another car rammed into him that the chase was brought to an end and he exited the truck with his arms up in surrender. Prosecutor Jane Nelson acknowledged in court that Routh made some 'odd statements' to police, but suggested that his reference to the apocalypse could have been a metaphor for world problems, reported the Dallas Morning News. Routh's defense attorney R. Shay Isham argued that his client's ravings served as proof that he was out of touch with reality that night. 'If it's voodoo that's upon us, is the apocalypse upon us right now?' Isham quoted his client as asking Detective Jesse Chevara. The lawyer also quoted his client as saying: 'I can feel everybody feeding on my soul.' Chevara, who was Routh's neighbor, tried to calm him down by telling him, 'You will defeat that evil.' But the ex-Marine replied that the feeling he has is not going to go away. Routh is heard in the police video asking for his parents. Police eventually get them on the phone and he briefly talks to them. At different points in the video, Routh made comments including, 'I didn't sleep a wink last night at all,' 'I don't know if I'm going insane,' and, 'Is this about hell walking on earth right now?' Kyle's widow Taya Kyle is escorted from the courtroom on Thursday during a break in proceedings . The widowed Mrs Kyle sat in court this morning and listened to the testimonies of officers who arrested her husband's suspected killer . Kyle gives a puzzled expression to someone seated behind her in court on the second day of the trial . Texas Ranger Michael Adcock was one of the law enforcement officials to testify Thursday, and said that Kyle and Chad Littlefield were both armed when they were shot to death. He said it didn't appear the weapons carried by Kyle and Littlefield were ever removed from their holsters. Their wounds included multiple gunshots to the back. The case has drawn intense interest, largely because of Kyle's memoir about being a sniper who served four tours in Iraq. The Oscar-nominated film based on the book has grossed nearly $300 million. Other police officers testified in court about the intense 30-minute standoff they had with Routh after he allegedly killed Kyle and his friend. While Routh was parked outside a home, an officer approached and spoke with the clearly distraught man about the shooting. 'Eddie we all grew up together here. This will be best for everybody if you do as I ask you,' the officer coaxed Routh through a cracked window. A Lt Michael Smith testified that Routh said something to the nature of: 'He had taken a couple souls and he had some more souls to take.'

Texas Ranger Michael Adcock shows a revolver cylinder to the jury during his testimony . Ranger Adcock shows a bullet unpackaged as evidence as he testifies during   Routh's trial at the Erath on  Thursday . At one point, Routh's mother called and asked if he was ok.  Cops say Routh shouted back: 'I don't know!' 'Everything's just happening so fast...I don't know if I'm going insane,' he told the police officer. 'That's what we need to figure out,' the officer responded. 'We need to figure out what you're thinking and then see if it's right or wrong.' But instead of peacefully getting out of the car, Routh sped off as officers topped 100 mph through neighborhoods, school and construction zones in order to catch up with him. The chase was brought to an end when another car slammed into Kyle's pickup truck that Routh was driving and he came out of the vehicle with his hands held up. Lancaster police officer Flavio Salazar listens to Erath County Assistant District Attorney Jane Starnes as he testifies during the second day of the trial. Officer Salazar was one of the officers who helped capture Routh . Defense attorneys for 27-year-old Routh have said he was insane when Kyle and Littlefield took him to a shooting range in February 2013 to provide support and camaraderie. Routh faces life in prison without parole if convicted of capital murder. Routh's mother had asked Kyle, whose wartime exploits were depicted in his memoir, to help her son overcome personal troubles. Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, had testified a day earlier, clutching military dog tags as she told jurors about her final moments with her husband, just hours before he and Littlefield were slain at the range. Reliving the agony: On Wednesday, Taya Kyle told the court that her husband had never met Eddie Ray Routh before and only wanted to help a fellow veteran struggling to readjust to civilian life . Chris and Taya Kyle pictured before his death. The couple had two children together . Erath County District Attorney Alan Nash described Routh as 'a troubled young man' who on the morning of the killings numbed himself with marijuana and whiskey. He said a history of mental illness should not absolve Routh in the deaths. During opening statements, a defense attorney had revealed a text message exchange between Chris Kyle and Littlefield as they drove to the lodge with Routh, whom Kyle had picked up at his house. Kyle texted Littlefield: 'This dude is straight-up nuts.' 'He's (sitting) right behind me, watch my six,' Littlefield texted back, using a military term for watching one's back. Tim Moore, an attorney for Routh, said Kyle and Littlefield's text exchange shows how Routh was spiraling out of control. He told jurors that Routh was suffering from severe mental strain that day and thought he needed to kill the two or they would turn on him. Routh was a small arms technician who served in Iraq and was deployed to earthquake-ravaged Haiti before leaving the Marines in 2010. Authorities say that after the shootings, Routh drove to his sister's house in Kyle's truck, admitted to the killings and told his sister 'people were sucking his soul.' Routh's case has drawn national attention because a movie on Kyle's life, American Sniper starring Bradley Cooper (right), is currently in wide-release and has been nominated in the Academy Awards .","Ex-Marine Eddie Routh appeared in court Thursday for the second day of his capital murder trial .

"A British ex-pat accused of punching a suspected paedophile to death in a Spanish restaurant may have been friends with his alleged victim, it emerged today. Devinder Kainth allegedly attacked Sandro Rottman after catching him photographing his young daughter. Kainth, 39, had been enjoying a meal with his girlfriend Gemma Hawkins, 31, and their three children in the millionaire's playground of Sotogrande on the Costa del Sol in Spain. A source today revealed the two men and other friends had been socialising together freely and were in good humour for a couple of hours before the incident. A British ex-pat, Fiona Goodwood – who has known Rottman for the last 12 years – also claimed there had been a 'good friendship' between the pair. Meanwhile, Ms Hawkins has vowed to stand by her man, but says she will return  to the UK to get the support of her family, according to friends. Scroll down for video . Charged: Devinder Kainth (pictured with his girlfriend Gemma Hawkins) may have been friends with a suspected paedophile he is accused of beating to death after catching him photographing his  daughter . Unsettling: Mr Rottman, 43, who was arrested over child pornography a few days before his death, had posted this image on Twitter showing him holding a young girl to his chest . A witness said Ms Hawkins entered the Spinnaker Restaurant with a female friend and the three children at around 5pm last Saturday. He said: 'The children ran around the restaurant causing chaos and cycled in and out of the restaurant with their bikes while the women ordered a couple of glasses of wine and chatted.' About an hour later, a male friend joined them at their table who is believed to be the partner of Ms Hawkins' friend. Mr Rottman is said to have arrived at a similar time and was seen standing by their table chatting and laughing. Ms Hawkins is understood to have offered him at least one drink. Mr Rottman paid nothing throughout the evening, the source added. At around 6.30pm-7pm, Kainth, also known as Victor, arrived and the group continued to chat and everything seemed 'good humoured'. 'They were definitely not drinking that much as the bill was not that big but they were having fun,' the source said. 'The children were clearly enjoying themselves on their bikes and being like typical noisy children.' According to witnesses, Mr Kainth and his partner, Gemma Hawkins, were eating with their three children (pictured, above, with Ms Hawkins) when they started chatting to Sandro Rottman . Two of the couple's children attend one of the most exclusive schools on the Spanish coast where fees are around 10,000 euros a year. The third goes to nursery . British father Victor Kainth (left) allegedly beat a suspected paedophile to death after catching the man filming his daughter on his iPad while eating at a Spanish restaurant with his partner Gemma Hawkins (right) The millionaire, who is a keen boxer, allegedly caught Rottman photographing his daughter on an iPad and confronted him before attacking him at around 9.20pm. According to the source, the CCTV doesn't show what happened next as one of the cameras wasn't working. At 9.30pm, the security were called and were on the scene within minutes. The police finally arrived on Tuesday night to take the CCTV from the restaurant, with the restaurant source confirming that it was now being studied as further evidence. When contacted last night, a member of staff at the restaurant confirmed that police had finally taken the CCTV but insisted he was 'unable to comment for legal reasons'. Rottman, 43, later died from his injuries in hospital. Kainth was later arrested and is being held at maximum-security Botaguegos Prison in the southern Spanish port city of Algeciras on suspicion of homicide. Yesterday, Miss Hawkins told a friend that she would stand by the millionaire, but needed to come home to her family for emotional support while he was in prison. He is believed to have been refused bail but Miss Hawkins is thought not to have visited him at the prison. 'Attached himself to the couple': Sandro Rottman (left), a suspected paedophile allegedly beaten to death by a British ex-pat in Spain, is said to have acted as an assistant to Katie Price and her ex-husband Alex Reid in Sotogrande during the launch of her polo clothing range in August 2009 (above) 'Beaten to death': Mr Rottman died on Sunday after a man named locally as Devinder Kainth, 40, caught him photographing his daughter on an iPad and attacked him in a restaurant in the Spanish resort of Sotogrande . A source close to the investigation said: 'He has hired his own defence lawyer. He was offered a duty lawyer after he was arrested but wanted to go with his own brief.' Yesterday, Miss Hawkins' mother Denise said from her detached home in Kent: 'Gemma is a lovely girl. She has a strong close family and a great group of friends out there. 'I've spoken to her about what happened and it's as has been reported in the papers. 'The children mean everything to her and the most important thing is that they are safe and well and so is she. 'I'm hoping to go out and see her at some stage.' Yesterday, it also emerged that suspected paedophile Sandro Rottman apparently acted as an assistant to glamour model Katie Price. Photographs show Rottman with the model and her ex-husband Alex Reid in Sotogrande during the launch of her polo riding range in August 2009. Fiona Goodwood – who has known Mr Rottman for the last 12 years and described him as 'something of an eccentric character' – said he told her he had assisted Miss Price on the trip. The altercation happened at the The Spinnaker, pictured above, in Sotogrande on Spain's Costa del Sol on Saturday night after Devinder Kainth  reportedly saw Sandro Rottman filming his daughter . It is claimed that Mr Rottman was very close to the entourage and was involved in organising the event. Another British expat who has known Mr Rottman for eight years claimed he had 'attached himself to the couple' when Miss Price came to open her clothes line KP Equestrian in the resort. The source said: 'He had slick-backed hair and was always dressed very smartly'. A spokeswoman for Miss Price told MailOnline: 'Katie was present at an event where Mr Rottman was working for the organisers.' In a full statement she said: 'I had no recollection of meeting him as he was not my assistant but it appears I did during the course of my one day working trip to Sotogrande promoting KP equestrian. This is clearly a tragic incident that will impact the families of all involved.' A spokesman for the Santa Maria Polo Club said yesterday: 'Katie Price's visit must have been a private visit. 'More than 70,000 spectators, including many British visitors, come to see our International Summer tournament every year. 'We do not know if Katie Price hired Sandro Rottman's services. We can state categorically that Mr Rottman never had any type of working relationship with Santa Maria Polo Club.' He has been described as ‘something of an eccentric character’ who was well known for years around the exclusive resort of Sotogrande. But as yet very little else is known about Sandro Rottman, right. The 43-year-old German is understood to have been charged with child pornography a month before he was allegedly battered to death for filming a British father’s daughter at a restaurant. But British expat Fiona Goodwood – who has known Mr Rottman for the last 12 years – has dismissed claims he had been engaging in paedophilia. She said: ‘If Mr Rottmann had been charged before as reported, it would be very unlikely that he would be sitting in a public place brazenly doing what he had been accused of?’ Mrs Goodwood also found it hard to believe he would have been caught with child porn images because she knew him as such a skilled computer programmer. She said: ‘All his work that I have seen him carry out previously was meticulously passworded. 'I find it very hard to believe that if there were any pornographic images, as has been claimed, that he would be so naive as not have password protected them and made it very difficult to access especially in the circumstances described.’ Mr Rottman appears to have held down a number of different jobs, being variously described by locals as a web designer, IT consultant and he once even helped to organise the launch of Katie Price’s polo clothing range. Meanwhile, other locals say they knew him as a drunk who was once so intoxicated he fell into the sea and had to be fished out. He walked with a limp and is thought to have been treated for a liver problem previously. A worker at the exclusive El Octogano Beach Club, near The Spinnaker Restaurant where Rottman was killed on Saturday, said: ‘He had a drink problem and would get through up to three bottles of vodka a day. ‘He’s been banned for the past year because he ran up a huge bill he never paid. ‘He’d fallen on hard times after making a lot of money during the boom years in Spain when he was spending £50 a day on drink. ‘He was always on his own and always on his computer because that was how he made his money but I never saw him misbehaving.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Devinder Kainth 'attacked Sandro Rottman for photographing his daughter'

"Huge plant pots have been branded a danger to both drivers and pedestrians after they were dumped on a busy road by a council in an attempt to slow down traffic. Brighton and Hove City Council installed the four large planters on Viaduct Road in Brighton, East Sussex, after some residents raised concerns that cars were travelling too fast. But the move has sparked anger from residents who claim the new additions to their street cause cars to violently swerve  to avoid the plant pots. Scroll down for video . The huge plant pots (pictured) have been branded a danger to drivers and pedestrians after Brighton and Hove City Council took the unusual step of installing them on a busy road in a bid to slow down traffic . Chris Morford, who uses the road on his daily commute, said: 'These planters are a danger, causing cars to swerve. 'If there is a speed issue let us have details of the number of complaints. 'If there is a realistic number then enforce the 20mph speed limit.' A report presented to London Road Local Action Team said the road was used by 11,200 vehicles per day - and more than half were driving at over 30mph. The four large black planters have been strategically placed along Viaduct Road in Brighton, East Sussex . Brighton and Hove City councillor Ken Norman said the planters were a 'crazy and very dangerous addition to this heavily used road.' Businesswoman Sue Addis, who uses the road every day, said: 'It's just ridiculous. There's not enough room for two cars anyway. 'Will they be planted up with palm trees to make the entrance to our city more attractive with a tropical feel? 'Or is it a new game of swerve and bump to keep us all going at 20 miles an hour?' The council said the measures were experimental and there were currently no plans for permanent plant pots to be installed. They were installed after some residents raised concerns that cars were travelling too fast on the busy road . Brighton and Hove City Council's road safety manager, Martin Heath, added: 'Further softening of the traffic environment through planting can create strong visual clues about the residential nature of the street. 'Following some local public utility work last weekend, which resulted in the closure of a traffic lane, we took the opportunity to introduce some planters. 'The aim was to determine the impact that such measures might have on speeds, again to inform decisions about measures later on. 'At this stage, other than an objective to reduce excessive traffic speeds, there are no specific plans for any types of measures. 'The feedback we receive from the London Road Local Action Team and other stakeholders will be used as a basis for developing options.' Brighton and Hove City Council says there are no plans for permanent plant pots to be installed at this time .","Brighton and Hove City Council installed huge plant pots on busy street .

"David Cameron will today plead with Greece’s new far-Left leader to end a standoff over his country’s vast debts. The Prime Minister is due to hold one-on-one talks in Brussels with Alexis Tsipras, whose government is threatening to turn to Russia for help if the Eurozone cuts it adrift. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has sent shockwaves through Europe after declaring that if Athens does not continue its aid programme with tough conditions ‘then that’s it’. ‘We have a programme,’ he added. ‘The programme is either brought properly to an end or there is no programme.’ Scroll down for video . David Cameron, left, will hold crunch talks with Greece's new hard-left leader Alex Tsipras, right, later today . A summit of European leaders is set to be dominated by economic concerns following the victory of the Greek radical anti-austerity party Syriza in elections last month. British officials said Mr Cameron would be in ‘listening mode’ in his meeting with Mr Tsipras, but wanted an explanation of how he would tackle the crucial issue of Greece’s debts. ‘I expect the Prime Minister to make clear that we expect to see a swift resolution to the current stand-off between Greece and the rest of the Eurozone,’ an official said. ‘The Prime Minister’s point will be this is not about us taking sides, it’s down to Greece and Eurozone partners to agree on the best way to move forward to get the Greek economy growing, to bring their debt down and get it on a sustainable footing. ‘They need to work on this together but they need to be acting responsibly and coming up with a plan for growth. ‘The point from the UK perspective is that the uncertainty around Greece is clearly a risk to our economy. We want Greece and Eurozone partners to get on and sort this out.; . German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble warned Greece against abandoning the current economic plan . Yesterday, the Greek government presented its demands at an emergency meeting of Eurozone finance ministers in Brussels. It wants to overhaul 30 per cent of its bailout obligations, but EU ministers insist it must stick to the existing terms. The Greek government wants a ‘bridging loan’ lasting till August rather than the next stage of its bailout from the Eurozone, which is conditional on continuing with spending cuts. Mr Tsipras insists Athens has no intention of requesting an extension of its 240 billion euro EU/IMF rescue package and is intent on reversing what he has called ‘cruel’ austerity imposed by foreign creditors. The think tank Open Europe said the standoff means the chances of Greece exiting the euro are now around 40 per cent, higher than at the height of the Eurozone crisis in 2012. David Cameron and George Osborne have asked the Bank of England and Treasury to make contingency plans for such an outcome. The impasse risks leaving Greece without funding as of the end of this month, when its current bailout expires. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who met his new Greek counterpart Nikolaos Kotzias in Moscow yesterday, said he would consider any request for financial aid from Athens. Greek Defence Minister, Panos Kammenos, said Greece might seek funding from Russia or China unless the Eurozone gives ground.","David Cameron will meet Greece's new leader Alexis Tsipras in Brussels .

"Getting dressed can be a challenge for mothers and their toddlers who may rather wear mismatched shoes and a superhero costume than blue jeans and a t-shirt. Summer Bellessa, a mother of two, fashion blogger, and actress based in Arizona decided to let her three-year-old son Rockwell dress her for a change after picking out his outfit every day of his life. 'I have picked out my son’s outfits almost every day of his three years on this planet. I thought it would be fun to turn the tables and let him pick my outfits out for a few days,' said summer in a blog post she wrote for Babble.com posted recently. Scroll down for video . Switching roles: Summer Bellessa (left) decided to let her three-year-old son Rockwell pick out her outfit for five days to see what looks he could come up with . On day one Rockwell chose a laid back rock n' roll chic look for his mom. 'The first few items were great: my Bob Dylan tee, with a gray skirt, and tights. I think I’ll put this in my rotation. Fabulous choices, Rock,' wrote Bellessa of the conversation with her son. When Rockwell told his mother to wear nude shoes along with black tights she was a little hesitant but took his advice anyway. When showing the outfit to her husband later that day she expected him to laugh but he didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. 'I walked down the stairs to show off my outfit to my husband. I waited for a laugh, but he didn’t notice anything different,' she wrote. On day two Bellessa said that Rockwell chose her favorite outfit so far which consisted of a Mickey Mouse t-shirt, polka-dot leggings, and gold pointy shoes which she says she wouldn't have thought to wear. Rock n' roll chic: Summer Bellessa enjoyed most of her son Rockwell's rocker outfit but was less enthused about the nude heels she normally wouldn't pair with black tights . 'These polka dotted Lula Roe leggings look great with my Mickey T-shirt. And although I wouldn’t have worn it with these shoes, it does have a fun feel to it. It’s almost like homage to Minnie,' she wrote. Day three was a flower filled outfit that sent her son Rockwell through the roof with excitement. 'I like flowers' said Rockwell as he pointed to flowery socks and a petal patterned sundress. 'They both have flowers,' he said. He then enthusiastically paired the outfit with pink striped shoes and a green jacket. While Bellessa said she felt a little self-conscious walking around in her outfit that day one woman actually complimented her. 'Side note: I was a little self-conscious running my errands that day; but again, to my surprise I didn’t get one double-take or stare of curiosity. Instead, I got a woman who stopped me to tell me she liked my socks!' she wrote. Mommy's favorite: Summer Bellessa said that Rockwell chose her favorite outfit on day two which consisted of a Mickey Mouse t-shirt, polka-dot leggings, and gold pointy shoes . Day four proved to be a bit of a challenge for mother and son when Rockwell chose three shirts but no bottoms to go along with it. 'Mommy can’t go outside without any pants on,' said Bellessa. 'How about we switch one of these shirts for a pair of pants?,' she added. Rockwell understood and chose the closest pair of pants along with two different types of leopard print shoes. On day five, Rockwell chose his mother another pair of mismatching shoes, this time two boots: one blue and one brown. Rockwell chose a shirt with arrows on it for his mother and desperately searched for pants with arrows on it as well but later settled for a pair of jeans. 'I guess you have to look for some pants that have arrows on them,' he told his mother with a stern face. Tired and exhausted from choosing his mother's clothes, Rockwell was pleased it was the last day of outfit picking. 'His busy toddler schedule is packed with a lot of fun things and picking out my outfit every day was starting to take too much out of his day. When it came down to it, he’d rather be painting or riding his bike,' wrote Bellesma. Bellessa said that the experience taught her that role reversal with children can be therapeutic. She also said it taught her to take more risks with her wardrobe, though she may not start wearing no pants and mismatched shoes anytime in the near future.

"Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, the most senior judge in the country, said many judges felt under paid . Half of all Appeal Court judges think they don’t earn enough – despite getting £200,661 a year- according to a new survey. And when it comes to High Court judges, four in five are unhappy with their £176,226 salary while the same proportion of Circuit judges, who get £130,875 a year, also felt hard done by. In comparison, the Prime Minister’s salary is £142,500. Nearly nine in ten of all judges in England and Wales responded to the latest job satisfaction survey. Most said their salary and pensions did ‘not adequately reflect the work I do’. Fewer than half (49 per cent) thought their work was valued by the public. And just two per cent said they felt valued by the Government. The grumbling follows a series of pay freezes and a long-running spat over Coalition attempts to rein back judges’ generous pension scheme. The poll was carried out at the suggestion of the Senior Salaries Review Body, which advises the Government on pay levels in the public sector. Most respondents also felt there is declining respect for them and that their working conditions are getting worse. While almost every judge consulted in the survey complained that his or her computer was inadequate. Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, the most senior judge in the country, said: ‘The survey shows that many judges are feeling, in common with millions of other people, that their work has become harder year after year in many ways. 'Even though they know they are well paid compared to most people, they, like many others, have seen their pay drop in real terms.’ ‘The survey also shows that judges do not carry out the work solely for the money. Their work is rewarding, but also demanding - confronting significant human suffering, loss and family breakdowns or untangling business transactions with livelihoods and businesses at stake. Unhappy: An officially-organised survey found that most judges felt their salaries did nto reflect the work they did . 'Judges are dedicated to their role, working harder and longer to keep standards high.’ He added: ‘Investment which has been promised to give judges modern IT will help.’ Traditionally, judges have always earned high salaries – partly to lessen the risk of bribery and corruption, and partly to encourage good-quality lawyers to leave highly-paid jobs as advocates in the courts.","A job satisfaction survey found many judges felt  underpaid in their jobs .

"Motorists are likely to enjoy low petrol prices for the rest of the year, the boss of Shell is expected to say today. Chief executive Ben van Beurden will say in a speech that prices look set to remain at their six-year low because of volatility in the global oil market. The falling price has been described as a tax cut for consumers - helping end the cost of living crisis - with RAC analysis suggesting drivers would enjoy a £4billion windfall. Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden will say in a speech that prices look set to remain at their six-year low . But Mr van Beurden will warn that oil prices will inevitably increase again as more supplies are needed to deal with the rising demand, according to The Telegraph. Speaking at the International Petroleum Week dinner in London this evening, Mr van Beurden is expected to say: ‘The market will remain volatile in 2015, if only because for now, Opec [Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] shows no sign of wanting to resume its role as swing supplier.’ The falling prices have been welcome news for the public. Yet Mr van Beurden is also expected to caution that a longer-term slump in oil prices could have potentially dire economic consequences. Since June, the collapse of global oil prices and fierce competition between supermarkets has driven down prices at the pump. The average price of unleaded currently £1.06 per litre – down from £1.33 last summer. The RAC Foundation recently predicted that motorists could be at least £140 better off this year than if prices had stayed similar to last summer.

"It is likely to be the last time that the generation who served in the Second World War is able to gather in numbers. And following mounting alarm that the 70th anniversary of VE Day risked being overlooked, David Cameron is to announce plans for three days of national commemoration. Party leaders, senior Royals, veterans and organisations whose members played a part in the war effort will gather on May 8 at the Cenotaph in London. Scroll down for video . Jubilant: A beer truck passes through London's Piccadilly Circus on VE Day in 1945. Party leaders, senior Royals, veterans and organisations whose members played a part will gather on the 70th anniversary . Communities will be encouraged to put on street parties and other events over the two following days, culminating in a national service at Westminster Abbey and a parade. Earlier this month, the Daily Mail highlighted concerns that the anniversary of the greatest victory in the country’s history risked being overshadowed by the general election, which takes place the day before. Dame Vera Lynn, 97, was among those who called on the Government to do more. May 8 will mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day, the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany and the destruction of Hitler’s Third Reich. The Prime Minister has appointed former Foreign Secretary, William Hague, now leader of the Commons, to oversee plans for the anniversary. The commemorations will recognise all aspects of the war effort, including the home front. Mr Cameron told the Mail: ‘VE Day is one of the most pivotal moments in our nation’s proud history. Celebrations: Thousands of people flooded the streets of London for the 50th anniversary of VE Day in 1995 . ‘After years of all-out war and the untold sacrifice of millions at both home and abroad this day marked the moment when the threat of Nazi brutality was finally lifted. ‘As a nation, it is vital that we remember the 70th anniversary of this historic day and I am delighted to announce that William Hague will play a key role in coordinating the final stages of those plans.’ The celebrations will start 24 hours after the general election, while some of the results are still being declared. The May 7 poll is widely expected to be close and could result in no clear winner. Commitment: The idea was confirmed by David Cameron, pictured during PMQs yesterday . For the 50th anniversary of VE Day in 1995 there were celebrations across the country, as people came together to thank the wartime generation. Hundreds of thousands of people assembled in London’s Hyde Park for concerts and ceremonies. Great-grandmother Margaret Dickson, 96, of Darlington, who served as an ambulance driver in Corby, Northamptonshire, welcomed the announcement of three days of commemorations this year. ‘It’s wonderful news. I had tears in my eyes when I read how little had been planned so I am delighted that something will be done,’ she said. ‘We had been through hell and VE Day was such a wonderful moment. I still remember the street parties and all the baking. It’s so important for today’s young people to know about it.’ Dougie Radcliffe, secretary of the Bomber Command Association, said: ‘We’re still looking after 3,000 members in their 90s and if there is to be a commemoration on this scale, we will love to take part.’ Neil Coppendale of Shoreham, West Sussex, who organised a petition calling for the Government to recognise both VE Day and VJ Day, in August, said May 8 commemorations are important for two reasons. ‘The first is to raise awareness and to educate the next generation,’ he said. ‘The second is an opportunity to say thank you to those involved. ‘They are all in their 90s and won’t be around forever. I think it would be criminal if this country did not mark the occasion.’ Lord Astor of Hever, a Government spokesman on defence, said: ‘Our plans hope to mark the achievements not only of our Armed Forces personnel during the Second World War but also those who were fighting another battle on the home front.’ The veterans of the ‘Forgotten Army’ and the bitter campaign against Japan will not be overlooked. Plans are also under way to mark the final cessation of hostilities and the 70th anniversary of VJ Day on August 15. The Government spent £50 million on commemorating the 100th anniversary of the First World War.","William Hague to oversee events to recognise those at home and abroad .

"Rory Fox (pictured at the school) was made a 'super head' at Ryde Academy, on the Isle of Wight, in 2013 with the task of improving standards and attainment . A headmaster who clashed with teaching unions after being brought in to tackle a failing school has been removed from his job. Rory Fox was made a 'super head' at Ryde Academy, on the Isle of Wight, in 2013 with the task of improving standards and attainment. He launched a crackdown on pupils' bad behaviour and is understood to have confronted some teachers about their alleged poor conduct. It is claimed he was due to hold disciplinary meetings with three staff members on Wednesday last week, but instead left his post without notice. Teachers arrived the next day to find him absent. Shortly afterwards, his job was advertised with a six-figure salary. Dr Fox had been appointed to the role after improving results at a school in Essex, and had been head of learning at a prison. Ryde Academy had been rated 'inadequate' and put in special measures, but under Dr Fox's tenure this rose to 'requires improvement'. In a report in November, Ofsted inspectors described him as a 'determined principal' who had been 'tenacious in tackling teachers' underperformance'. But Ofsted criticised the school's sponsor, Academies Enterprise Trust (AET), saying it had not always been supportive enough of the school's leaders. During Dr Fox's time at Ryde, he adopted a number of strict measures including sending hundreds of children home for breaches of uniform rules. In a letter to union leaders, revealed in November last year, the head said 22 poorly performing teachers remained at the school. He said some senior members of staff skipped classes or arrived late and displayed aggressive behaviour – which included bullying junior colleagues. Dr Fox also complained that some teachers were spilling coffee on homework and refusing to mark it. He said he found 'unions disquieting staff with claims about what they can and can't do with lesson observations … [and] tying us up in time-consuming correspondence'. He alleged there were rigged union votes, obstruction and delaying tactics. Union leaders complained of 'excessive burdens' on staff, he said, adding: 'We have teachers complaining about being asked to set homework. It is clear to me that there are some very odd views about what is 'excessive'.' During his stint, he famously launched a crackdown on pupils' bad behaviour and uniforms- sending 40 girls home in one day because their skirts were too short- which was reported in the Daily Mail last December . A source said Dr Fox had taken a confrontational attitude with unions and had refused to offer redundancy to teachers he believed were performing poorly, deeming it a waste of taxpayers' money. The head was due to stay in his post until the end of this academic year but has now been removed by AET 'to work on other projects'. AET, sponsored by Greensward Charitable Trust, is the country's largest academy chain. It was told not to take on any more schools after Ofsted found shortfalls at some of those it runs. Jerry Glazier, a leading member of the National Union of Teachers, sits on AET's executive board. Amanda Martin, an executive member of the NUT, said: 'We welcome the support of AET in working with us to encourage and promote the employment of qualified, experienced and dedicated teachers rather than allowing staff to be driven out by bullying tactics.' Mr Glazier said that when he was appointed to AET it was 'on the basis that I did not represent the NUT'. A spokesman for AET said: 'We deny that the reason for [Dr Fox's] transfer was for poor relations with teacher unions.'

"America's East Coast was frequently battered by hurricanes as damaging as Katrina at a time when Europe was going through the Middle Ages. This is according to sediments found beneath Salt Pond in Massachusetts which suggests that between the years 250 and 1150 more than 20 huge storms hit the area. Scientists believe a change in sea surface temperatures in the western North Atlantic caused the storms — and they say climate change could cause them to return. America's East Coast was frequently battered by hurricanes as damaging as Katrina during a time when Europe was going through the Middle Ages, according to a new report. In this image waves crashed ashore in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, during a 1938 hurricane . 'These records suggest that the pre-historical interval was unlike what we've seen in the last few hundred years,' said Jeff Donnelly, a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, who led the research. The prehistoric hurricanes were likely category three storms, such as Hurricane Katrina, or category 4 storms, like Hurricane Hugo, that would be catastrophic if they hit the region today. The study is the first to find evidence of historically unprecedented hurricane activity along the northern East Coast of the United States. The most powerful storm to hit Cape Cod in recent times was Hurricane Bob in 1991, a category 2 storm that was one of the costliest in New England history. The left image shows a sediment core section. The light-coloured shows evidence of an intense past storm. Pictured on the right is an aerial image of Dauphin Island, Alabama, following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . Storms of that intensity have only reached the region three times since the 1600s, according to Professor Donnelly. The intense prehistoric hurricanes were fuelled in part by warmer sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean than have been the norm off the U.S. East Coast over the last few hundred years. However, as ocean temperatures have slowly inched upward in recent decades, tropical North Atlantic sea surface temperatures have surpassed the warmth of prehistoric levels--and are expected to warm more over the next century as the climate heats up, Professor Donnelly said. 'We hope this study broadens our sense of what is possible and what we should expect in a warmer climate,' he added. Scientists believe a change in sea surface temperatures in the western North Atlantic caused the historic storms — and they say climate change could cause such storms to return. Pictured is a satellite view of Hurricane Earl as it threatens the U.S. East Coast in 2010 . The research is based on  sediments found beneath Salt Pond in Falmouth which suggests that, between the years 250 and 1150, more than 20 huge storms hit the area. 'We may need to begin planning for a category three hurricane landfall every decade or so rather than every 100 or 200 years. 'The risk may be much greater than we anticipated.' The team looked at sediment deposits from Salt Pond near Falmouth on Cape Cod. The pond is separated from the ocean by a 4.3 to 5.9 ft (1.3 to 1.8 metres) high sand barrier. Over hundreds of years, strong hurricanes have deposited sediment over the barrier and into the pond where it has remained undisturbed. The researchers extracted 30ft (9 metre) deep sediment cores, which they then analysed in a laboratory. Similar to reading a tree ring to tell the age of a tree and the climate conditions that existed in a given year, scientists can read a sediment core to determine when intense hurricanes occurred. They found evidence of 32 prehistoric hurricanes, along with the remains of three documented storms that occurred in 1991, 1675 and 1635. The sediments showed that there were two periods of intense hurricane activity on Cape Cod -- from 150 to 1150, and 1400 to 1675. Droughts in the US Southwest and Central Plains during the last half of this century could be drier and longer than drought conditions seen in those regions in the last 1,000 years. This is according to a Nasa study which combined projections from climate models, to find human-produced greenhouse gas emissions drives up the risk of severe droughts in these regions. Natural droughts, like the 1930s Dust Bowl, and the current drought in the Southwest have historically lasted maybe a decade or a little less, said Ben Cook, a Nasa climate scientist. 'What these results are saying is we're going to get a drought similar to those events, but it is probably going to last at least 30 to 35 years,' he said. According to Cook, the current likelihood of a megadrought, a drought lasting more than three decades, is 12 percent. If greenhouse gas emissions stop increasing in the mid-21st century,Nasa projects the likelihood of megadrought to reach more than 60 per cent. However, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase along current trajectories throughout the 21st century, there is an 80 per cent likelihood of a decades-long megadrought in the Southwest and Central Plains between the years 2050 and 2099. In this image, scientists collect a sediment core; the sediment shows intense storms going back 2,000 year . The earlier period of powerful hurricane activity matched previous studies that found evidence of hurricanes during the same period in more southerly areas of the western North Atlantic Ocean basin - from the Caribbean to the Gulf Coast. Powerful storms also battered more southerly U.S. coasts . These early storms were more frequent, and in some cases were likely more intense, than the most severe hurricanes Cape Cod has seen in historical times, including Hurricane Bob in 1991 and a 1635 hurricane that generated a 20-foot storm surge, according to Donnelly. The hurricane activity continued in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico until 1400, although there was a lull during this time in New England. A shift in hurricane activity in the North Atlantic occurred around 1400, when activity picked up from the Bahamas to New England, until about 1675. 'These records suggest that the pre-historical interval was unlike what we've seen in the last few hundred years,' said Jeff Donnelly, a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, who led the research.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been condemned on social media after he described job losses under the Labor government as a 'holocaust of jobs'. In parliament on Thursday, he used the term - which means destruction or slaughter on a mass scale but which has become inextricably linked to the Nazi genocide in which approximately six million Jews died - to the loss of defence jobs when Labor were in power. 'Under members opposite defence jobs in this country declined by 10 per cent. There was a holocaust of jobs, a holocaust of jobs in defence industries under members opposite,' Mr Abbott said. 'That's what there was, Madam Speaker, jobs, jobs - I'm sorry and I withdraw, Madam Speaker.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott described job losses under the Labor government as a 'holocaust of jobs' He apologised and then replaced the word 'holocaust' with 'decimation' Journalist at The Australian Peter van Onselen wrote: 'Somebody should shirtfront the PM' Mr Abbott subsequently apologised and withdrew the comment.

NSW Jewish Board of Deputies Chief Executive Officer Vic Alhadeff told Daily Mail Australia that because Mr Abbott 'immediately withdrew' his comment and 'immediately corrected it' there was not an issue. 'It would have been an issue if it was not withdrawn, he certainly did the right thing.' But on Twitter, the prime minister's use of the word was blasted. Journalist at The Australian Peter van Onselen wrote: 'Somebody should shirtfront the PM for that holocaust line. No suppository of wisdom saying it. Am I critical? You bet you are, you bet I am.' Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he feels 'no guilt whatsoever' about the way children have been dealt with in Australian immigration detention centres . Prime Minister Tony Abbott speaks during Question Time at Parliament House in Canberra . Lesley Plummer said Abbott's job was 'gone' after that remark . Tony Abbott's choice of language was quickly pointed out despite him correcting himself . Earlier Thursday, Mr Abbott used tough language on another topic, telling a radio interviewer who asked if he had any guilt about the detention of children in immigration centres that he had, 'None whatsoever.' The question was prompted by a new Human Rights Commission report that found children in the centres are suffering mental and physical affects because of their detention. Mr Abbott went on to say that 'of course' he would like the children to be released, but attacked the commission for politicising the issue. Buzzfeed Australia reporter Mark Di Stefano commented: 'It was the killing six million Jewish people of job losses.' Another Twitter user asked the PM: 'Are you on something or just more incomparably stupid than I already believed?' Mark Simpson wrote: 'Wow, I can't believe it, but @TonyAbbottMHR actually seems to be getting stupider today.' Robert Knox said that despite Mr Abbott's apology, the comment was 'still a very inappropriate comment for a PM to make, mouth works faster than the brain'. Mr Abbott made the comparison after attacking former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. 'Madam Speaker, I know members opposite do not like being reminded of their comprehensive and monumental failure, but we will remind them of the mess and chaos they created every day, every single day, and, Madam Speaker, seven years ago, . 'Eight years ago now, nine years ago now, Madam Speaker, Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister, promised, he absolutely promised categorically that the subs would be built in SA without a tender, without a tender, and then did absolutely nothing for six years. 'Madam Speaker, members opposite want to know about jobs? Members opposite want to know about jobs. Under members opposite defence jobs in this country declined by 10 per cent,' Mr Abbott said.","Tony Abbott used the term 'Holocaust of jobs' while speaking in Parliament .
'I'm sorry and I withdraw, Madam Speaker,' he quickly apologised .

"The humble cask wine is celebrating a milestone, turning the ripe old age of 50 this year. Fondly known as boxed wine, bag-in-box, goon bag or goon sack, this South Australian invention has come a long way. Despite the innovative design, which is certainly quite prominent on our drinking culture, Aussies have also made a fundamental contribution to society for its rather radical ideas and inventions over the years. Just to name a few, they include the first ever notepad, ultrasound, bionic ear, pacemaker, plastic banknotes and Wi Fi. Of course, there's also our iconic Vegemite and Hills Hoist clothesline. The humble cask wine is celebrating a milestone, turning the ripe old age of 50 this year . This woman appears to be playing a round of 'Goon of Fortune' by pegging the bag of wine on a Hills Hoist clothesline - which was also invented by an Aussie . The invention of cask wine began when winemaker Thomas Angove of Renmark, northeast of Adelaide, designed a plastic bladder as an alternative for the traditional wine bottle. The bag is placed in a box and wine is poured through an air-tight valve. Son John Angove, who's now the managing director of Angove Family Winemakers, watched his father's invention come to life when it was patented on April 20, 1965. He told the ABC the idea evolved from his father talking about creating the sack in old goat skins to a plastic bag. 'He put the plastic bag inside a cardboard box and it just grew from that,' he said. 'It was a pretty amazing idea and I remember as a youngster thinking: 'god Dad that's crazy, that'll never work, who's going to buy wine in a plastic bag?"".' The invention has gained a lot of love over the years - also helping to Aussies to further develop drinking game 'Goon of Fortune', which involves pegging the bag of wine on a clothesline. And when the liquid goods have been consumed, it is then often reused as a makeshift pillow. CSIRO scientists were also behind the development of the method of Wi Fi in 1992 . A popular choice of sun protection for beachgoers, zinc cream which is sun block made from zinc oxide developed by the Fauldings Pharmaceutical Company in 1940 . In 1902, the first notepad was made by Launceston stationer J.A. Birchall. It was a lightbulb moment as he cut sheets of paper in half and used cardboard on the back then glued them together at the top . In 1961 the ultrasound scanner was developed by David Robinson and George Kossoff at the Australian Department of Health . One of Australia's other well-known invention is Vegemite, the iconic spread founded in 1922 by Dr Cyril P. Callister in Melbourne. The clapperboard, also known as a slate used in film-making, was invented by film director and producer Frank Thring Sr of Melbourne's Efftee Studios in 1930. Then comes the popular choice of sun protection for Aussie beachgoers - zinc cream - which is sun block made from zinc oxide, developed by the Fauldings Pharmaceutical Company in 1940. Also the Hills Hoist clothesline was developed by Lance Hill in 1945 - although it is said the design was originally patented by Gilbert Toyne of Adelaide in 1926. In 1906, the world's first feature film - The Story of Kelly and the Gang - was shown . The film about the infamous bushranger Ned Kelly was over an hour long . The Australian feature film was written and directed by Charles Tait . The list goes on as they are plenty more inventions proudly made Down Under. In 1902, the first notepad was made by Launceston stationer J.A. Birchall. It was a lightbulb moment as he cut sheets of paper in half and used cardboard on the back, then glued them together at the top. Four years later, in 1906, the world's first feature film - The Story of Kelly and the Gang - was shown. It was just over an hour long. Then there's the paddle boat surf skis which were first invented by brothers Harry and Jack McLaren of Port Macquarie, north of Sydney, in 1912. In 1926 Dr Mark Lidwill made an impromptu pacemaker at Sydney's Crown Street Women's Hospital and in 1961 the ultrasound scanner was developed by David Robinson and George Kossoff at the Australian Department of Health. The baby safety capsule was established in 1984 while the ploymer bank note was created by CSIRO scientists in 1988. The buffalo fly traps were also established by CSIRO in 1991, a low-tech plastic tent which traps flies when they are brushed off cattle as they walk through. The CSIRO scientists then developed the method behind Wi Fi in 1992. Some smaller household goods invented by Aussies include the splayd, a combination of a knife, fork and spoon, by William McArthur in 1943 and more recently the heg, a clothes peg with a hook developed by Scott Boocock in 2012. Of course, there are more which may ring a bell such as the power board in 1972 by Peter Talbot who worked for Kambrook, the bionic ear created by Dr Gaeme Clark of the University of Melbourne in 1979 and spray on skin in 1992 developed by Dr Fiona Wood at Royal Perth Hospital.

"Two mothers, who had grown frustrated with stereotypical clothing collections designed for little girls, have launched their own fashion line which features the cars, dinosaurs and pirates that were once exclusive to boys' clothing. Rebecca Melsky and Eva St. Clair, both from Washington D.C., took to Kickstarter on February 3 to raise $35,000 for production of their gender-bending Princess Awesome collection. Since then, their crowdfunding campaign has already made more than $90,000, making it the highest-funded children's clothing project in Kickstarter history. Scroll down for video . Pretty in blue: Princess Awesome is a line of dresses for little girls that are adorned with the kinds of patterns that were once exclusive to boys' clothing . Science project: Two little girls hug while modeling the Pi symbol dresses from the collection . 'Girls shouldn't have to decide between dresses and dinosaurs or ruffles and robots,' they explained on their fundraising page. 'We're a different kind of girly.' The Princess Awesome line includes colorful dresses featuring airplanes, pirates, spaceships, trains and classic art, as well as math and science symbols. Ms Melsky, a third-grade teacher with two children, told Yahoo that when her daughter was two years old, she insisted on wearing frilly dresses, but she would also wear boys' pajamas featuring spaceships and trucks to bed. Original design: The child on the left models a red A-line dress featuring a train pattern, and the girl on the right wears a play dress with a dinosaur print . Worth the money: Moms Rebecca Melsky (left) and Eva St. Clair (right) took to Kickstarter this month to raise $35,000 for production of their line. Their crowdfunding campaign has already made more than $90,000 . Lifelong interests: The child on the left models a play dress featuring a graphic print, while the toddler on the right dons a train pattern . 'She loved them,' Ms Melsky recalled. 'And I thought, ""I wish she had a dress with spaceships"" or, really, any of the patterns we could get on her ""boy"" jammies.' She teamed up with her friend Ms St. Clair, who is a mom of four, and they debuted their innovative designs in April 2013. They started by selling their unique dresses at the Christmas bazaar held by Ms St. Clair's church and later made their collection available online. Their original play dresses featuring dinosaurs and Pi symbols sold out within a few weeks of production. Group effort: A group of girls model Princess Awesome's popular Pi dresses . Multiple interests: The little girl on the left wears a bright blue A-line dress adorned with airplanes and helicopters, while the girl on the right dons a patterned dress featuring the periodic table . Baby genius: This child poses in front of her chart featuring the scientific abbreviations of elements commonly found in household products . 'The demand is there, but the supply is not,' Ms Melsky said in their fundraising video. Ms Melsky and Ms St. Clair's website is currently closed as they prepare to begin factory production and add new styles to their growing collection. Many online commenters took to Princess Awesome's Kickstarter page to praise the project and thank the moms for their designs. Variety of tastes: The baby on the left dons a Pi dress, while the little girl on the right wears a pirate pattern . Not just for boys: This little girl wears the Princess Awesome Pi dress while meeting Buzz Lightyear . Big business: The money earned from Ms Melsky and Ms St. Clair's Kickstarter page will go towards factory production of their designs . 'As a scientist and a mom, I couldn't be more excited about this movement,' one woman wrote. 'I hope your success and the budding popularity of your dresses is a signal to mainstream clothing/toy makers that parents want more for their daughters than what they currently offer.' She added: 'If I could have given more money, I would have! Thank you for being a voice for us!' Another mom added: 'I don't know who is more excited about your company, me or my daughter.' Ms Melsky explained that she and Ms St. Clair believe that a lot of girls like things that are 'traditionally girly' as well as things that aren't. 'As a parent, I want to honor my daughter’s love of feminine fashion choices and also foster her interest in math or science or construction all in one outfit,' she told Yahoo Parents.

In the end, both men ended up calling 911, and authorities were able to come and diffuse the situation according to Fox 9. Neither of the men decided to file a report at the time, but Taylor apparently changed his mind after that according to police and will be making a report. 'In my personal opinion, had I been Caucasian, had I been Mexican or Asian, he wouldn't be taking pictures,' said Taylor. What's more, Taylor, who said he has never before interacted with this man, spoke to some neighbors who he claims said; 'It's not the first time he's done this, he's done it before.' The homeowner never pointed the gun at Taylor and was on his property at the time, so may not have broken any law.","Demetrius Taylor filmed a confrontation between himself and a white neighbor as the neighbor pulled out a gun as Taylor approached .

"A father who strapped his one-month-old baby to a steering wheel, span it around and posted footage of the stunt online has been blasted by children's rights groups. Yong Liao,  39, was at a service station in western Taiwan's Miaoli county when he strapped the baby to the wheel of his car and spinned it back and forth. The baby's mother, Xia Lung, then posted the clip online to the horror of children's rights groups. Scroll down for video . A father has been blasted by children's rights groups after sharing a video of his baby strapped to the wheel of a car . After receiving a torrent of abuse, the 34-year-old removed the video, having responded to her critics: 'I don't know what everyone is complaining about, we weren't on a main road at the time, we were only at a service station.' Despite widespread criticism, social workers said no action would be taken against the couple. Throughout the brief video, Mr Liao and Miss Lung can be heard cooing and singing to the baby as it's rocked back and forth. The infant does not cry, but kicks its legs and makes a gargling sound when turned to be almost upside down. Officials said while the video should not be imitated, it does not appear as though the baby's parents were trying to bring it any harm. Wang Wei-Jun, the director of the Taiwanese Committee for the Improvement of Children's Rights, said: 'Looking at the video, it does not seem as if there is intentional abuse of the child, although I think it's fair to say that the parents are a bad example for others and that the activity is certainly dangerous.'

"The only lifeline one tiny, isolated Alaskan island has to the rest of the world is cut off, leaving snowed-in residents deprived of any food, mail or deliveries of any kind. The single helicopter that normally supplies Little Diomede Island, population around 100, has been out of commission for servicing for three weeks. Even the hardy native hunters who populate the tiny speck of land 2.4 miles from Russia are having trouble bringing home game because of nasty weather conditions. And that leaves residents scrambling to meet basic needs as the winter wears on. Scroll down for video . Getting hungry: Nasty conditions and a broken down helicopter have left the 170 or so residents of isolated Little Diomede Island in Alaska with their cupboards running bare . 'In our store, it's pretty bare. We do have a bunch of food here at the school, which will last for a while,'  Andrea Okbealuk, who works at the school on Little Diomede, told the Anchorage Dispatch News. On Tuesday, hungry community members ate alongside schoolchildren at the Diomede School. The last flight of the Boeing Bölkow BO-105 helicopter to Diomede arrived in January. Since then, cupboard, mailboxes and even baby models have steadily emptied. 'It is hard when there's no milk...When you've switched your baby to regular canned milk to whole milk, to nonfat milk, to two percent milk, and then to nonfat milk again, and then now to powdered milk, it upsets the baby's stomach,' said Okbealuk. 'A couple of us are going to that now.' While the helicopter that residents are accustomed to has not touched down in weeks, the people of Little Diomede have since gotten airborne visitors.

"Paris City Council authorized Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Wednesday to sue U.S. broadcaster Fox News for reporting there are 'no-go zones' in the French capital where non-Muslims and police fear to venture. City officials voted to file a lawsuit at a French court for defamation regarding comments on Fox News and a map it broadcast with eight such so-called off-limits areas circled in red. The report came when Paris was on high alert after attacks by Islamic radicals last month. Suing: Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo (above) announced in an interview with CNN last month that the city would be suing FOX News and today the Paris City Council authorized the lawsuit . Fox report: City officials voted to file a lawsuit at a French court for defamation regarding comments on Fox News and a map it broadcast with eight such so-called off-limits areas circled in red . Fox was widely mocked for that report and for comments describing the English city of Birmingham as 'totally Muslim.' The broadcaster later apologized for 'some regrettable errors.' Hidalgo vowed to 'save Paris' honor,' and stressed the importance of image for a top world tourist destination. A law firm representing Fox News said the broadcaster would fight any lawsuit brought in Paris. 'The decision by the City of Paris to bring legal proceedings against a United States news organization is antithetical to free speech,' according to a statement provided by Fox News from lawyer Dori Ann Hanswirth of the Hogan Lovells law firm. 'Fox News will invoke every protection afforded it under all applicable laws.' The city of Paris first said they intended to sue Rupert Murdoch's Fox News after the U.S. cable network 'insulted' the French capital's image, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said last month. During an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Hidalgo said the city was planning legal action against Fox News because the honor of Paris had been 'prejudiced.' In the wake of the deadly attacks at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and at a kosher supermarket in Paris, Fox News apologized last month for falsely portraying some neighborhoods in the city. Not pleased with Fox: Hidalgo, pictured in Febrauary 2914,  vowed to 'save Paris' honor,' and stressed the importance of image for a top world tourist destination . Controversial: Steven Emerson (right), billed as an expert on terrorism-related issues, described Birmingham as a no-go area for non-Muslims last month . Host Sean Hannity was the first to make mention of the alleged zones on his January 7 program, saying; 'It seems if you watch in recent years, it’s not just France but all of Europe, there’s been a major influx, immigration, people from Muslim countries. They’ve even - and they’ve not assimilated, they’ve separated.' He then added; 'They have no-go zones. If you’re non-Muslim, you’re not allowed. Not police, not even fire department if there’s a fire. Sharia courts have been allowed to be established. Prayer rugs in just about every hotel.' Just a few days later, Jeanine Pirro welcomed analyst Steve Emerson on her show, who said of these zones, believed by many to be entirely inaccurate from the start; 'They’re sort of amorphous, they’re not contiguous necessarily, but they’re sort of safe havens.' Response: Fox News presenter Julie Banderas told viewers: 'Over the course of this last week we have made some regrettable errors on air'. She added the apology applies to 'discussions of so-called no-go zones' Emerson then took the idea a step further by stating; 'And they’re places where the governments, like France, Britain, Sweden, Germany — they don’t exercise any sovereignty so you basically have zones where Sharia courts are set up, where Muslim density is very intense, where police don’t go in.' Finally, Emerson wrapped the segment up by making the claim that Birmingham, England was an example of one of these zones, and that 'non-Muslims just simply don’t go in.' FOX News ultimately issued corrections for these statements, as well as an apology. That, however, was not enough for Mayor Hidalgo. 'When we're insulted, and when we've had an image, then I think we'll have to sue, I think we'll have to go to court, in order to have these words removed,' she told CNN's Amanpour last month. 'The image of Paris has been prejudiced, and the honor of Paris has been prejudiced.' Michael Clemente, the Executive Vice President of News at the network said in a statement last month; 'We empathize with the citizens of France as they go through a healing process and return to everyday life. However, we find the Mayor’s comments regarding a lawsuit misplaced.'","Paris City Council authorized Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Wednesday to sue U.S. broadcaster Fox News for 'prejudiced' reporting .

"Sir Peter Fahy, national police lead for preventing extremism, said officers who demanded the names of people who bought Charlie Hebdo in the wake of the Paris attacks appeared 'overzealous and unneccessary' Anti-terror units handed local police officers the names of British newsagents who stocked the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in the wake of the Paris attacks. But the decision by some forces to then visit the outlets and quiz shopkeepers about who bought the publication was 'overzealous and unnecessary', Britain's anti-terror police chief has said. Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and national police lead for preventing extremism, said he was now urgently clarifying guidance to all UK forces. It comes after police were caught asking British newsagents which sold copies of the satirical magazine for details of the customers who bought it. Shopkeepers in Wales, Wiltshire and Cheshire reported that police approached them and demanded personal information on readers of the magazine. In a letter to the Guardian, Sir Peter said that the move to provide details of newsagents to local police was intended to 'provide community reassurance'. But he admitted that officers who then asked for details of individuals who bought the magazine had appeared 'over-zealous and unnecessary'. He said: 'Following the attacks in Paris, there has been an increase in incidents of antisemitism and Islamaphobia. 'Forces were aware of the potential for heightened tension with the release of Charlie Hebdo and many neighbourhood police officers, who are well known in their communities, may have opted to visit sellers to establish any concerns and provide reassurance. 'However, it is important that we do not erode the very freedoms that we are trying to protect. I understand why asking for the names of those who might have bought this magazine will appear over-zealous and unnecessary. There was no national guidance to this effect and it is not to be supported unless there is clear evidence that a crime has been committed.' Wiltshire police have since apologised, while the other forces have denied their officers asked for names. The MailOnline revealed yesterday that The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) was handed a list of Charlie Hebdo's UK stockists by John Menzies, one of the magazine's UK distributors, via the National Counter-Terrorism Policing unit. ACPO then alerted forces who had shops selling Charlie Hebdo in their area, saying that officers should be aware that the magazine was on sale. But while the alert said police may wish to visit the shops involved, they should only do so if there were signs of rising tensions. Officers visited  a small newsagents and post office in Wiltshire and requested the personal details of all subscribers to the Charlie Hebdo magazine (pictured), which was the subject of a terrorist attack. Now it has emerged that officers in Wales and Cheshire have also approached shopkeepers . The advice said forces should review the lists for retailers using post codes, and if there are raised community tension indicators, or a large number of copies advertised for sale, then they should consider a site visit. The ACPO advice did not recommend visiting each shop, and did not mention taking down the details of customers who had bought the publication, according to the spokesman. It would appear that the three forces concerned either misunderstood the advice, or acted on their own impulse when they decided to ask for information on customers. Paul Merrett, 57, owner of a newsagent in Presteigne, Wales, said a detective and a police community support officer arrived at his shop and started to question his wife about the people who bought them. He said: 'They wanted to know where we had got them from, and did we know who we had sold them to. Twelve people were killed when gunmen (pictured) stormed the office of Charlie Hebdo in Paris on January 7 . '[My wife] said she wasn't prepared to give any names. She thought we were in trouble for selling them originally, but they said we weren't, and they just wanted to know who bought them. 'We didn't give them any details. It was all very strange. There were a couple of customers in here at the time, so it soon got around town.' A Dyfed-Powys police spokesman denied that customer details were asked for. She said: 'It was not the intention to gather any personal information of those who purchased the magazine and we can confirm no purchaser details were asked for or recorded. Dyfed Powys Police can confirm the visits were only made to enhance public safety and to provide community reassurance.' Cheshire police also denied that officers had asked for customers details. A spokesman said: 'Officers were asked to call into local newsagents in their area to provide visible reassurance around the time of publication and were not asked under any circumstances to make enquiries as to who was purchasing or preordering the Charlie Hebdo magazine. 'Each area endeavored to visit as many newsagents as possible however we cannot provide an exact figure.' Wiltshire officers asked at least three newsagents for people's details. The force apologised after admitting that an officer had taken down the names of four people in the town of Corsham who bought the magazine featuring a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on the front. A spokesman said: 'Wiltshire Police are confident that the police officer’s intention was purely around enhancing public safety and ensuring that the newsagent was advised appropriately.' The Paris massacre led to an outpouring of support around the world, including the 'Je Suis Charlie' message . Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: 'The Charlie Hebdo attack brought millions of people worldwide together to condemn those who seek to silence free speech through threats of intimidation and violence. 'This move by the police is entirely unacceptable. This sort of investigation would be understandable if a crime was being committed, but the fact is that they have requested information about people who have purchased a perfectly legal publication. 'It is far from clear why the police thought it was acceptable to request this information or what it is that they actually intend to do with it. Considering the comments made in the aftermath of the attacks in Paris by world leaders, that free speech should be celebrated and encouraged, the moves by the police in the UK completely undermine that.' Hundreds of Britons queued for a copy of the £3.50 souvenir edition of the magazine, published following last month's attack by Islamic extremists on its offices which left 12 people dead. John Menzies said it had handed over a list of newsagents which had ordered the magazine in the interest of safety and security. A spokesman said: 'Given the sensitive nature of this product, Menzies Distribution's priority was the safety and security of our employees and customers. 'Where appropriate we consulted with the relevant authorities to ensure the these priorities were met at all times.' Smiths News, another Charlie Hebdo distributor, has also refused to comment. The move has been branded 'entirely unacceptable' by privacy campaigners.","Distributor John Menzies passed details of magazine stockists to police .

Tearful: Deputy Mark Wallace, Sultan's K9 partner, made an emotional speech about the police, describing his death as 'one of the worst days of my life' Will be missed: The beloved Belgian Malinois-German shepherd mix from Slovakia had served on the force since September 2013 and was half of the city's only K9 team . Salute: Hundreds turned out Wednesday for a memorial service honoring Sultan . Memorial: The service was held at the War Dog Memorial near March Air Reserve Base in Riverside . Vigil: Hundreds of mourners bid farewell to the California K9 who was shot and killed last month . RIP: Gatherers at the War Dog Memorial in Riverside on Wednesday brandished candles for a vigil . Sultan took it upon himself to go after a felon who had barricaded himself inside a crawl space under a house in Hemet, California. Todd Allen Hodge, 36, had failed to show up for his arraignment on a weapons charge and had been spotted in the neighborhood. He ran into the house to hide. Sultan went in after Hodge and discovered him in the crawl space. However Hodge shot the dog in the neck. Sultan emerged from the space wounded and later died at the vet. 'I know if it wasn't Sultan, it would've been another dog on our team,' Wallace said at the memorial, according to KESQ News Channel 3. 'I know this because all of our dogs would've acted and done just as Sultan did that day. 'I wouldn't want any other member of our team to go through an experience like this. 'When I got to the vet, I pulled Sultan's limp body from the back seat of my patrol car. 'He was gone. 'They say dog's are a man's best friend. 'Sultan wasn't man's best friend, he was my best friend.' Sultan Wallace were the city of San Jacinto's only police K9 team.

Memorial: The service was held at the War Dog Memorial near March Air Reserve Base in Riverside . Remembrance: An officer at the service holds a toy that symbolizes Sultan . The standoff began around 2:30pm on January 21. Hours later, deputies fired tear gas into the crawl space. Hodge later emerged holding a handgun and deputies opened fire. Hodge died at the scene. Sultan, a Belgian Malinois-German shepherd mix who was born in Slovakia, had been working with the department since September 2013. He worked in narcotics detection, tracking and apprehension. 'When I heard (SUltan had died), it felt like I'd lost a peer,' Riverside County chief deputy Geoff Raya told People. 'There is very little differentiation between four legs and two legs – they are all members of the Riverside Sheriff's Department.' Beloved: San Jacinto police sent Sultan into a home where a suspectwas barricaded with a gun. Sultan re-emerged from the home suffering a gunshot wound and would later die . San Jacinto Mayor Crystal Ruiz told KNBC, 'We've lost a family member, we've lost one of our own...It's heartbreaking and it's scary to think people would do something like this.' Area residents were not evacuated during the standoff, but those who weren't home when the incident began were barred from returning for several hours. Cornerstone Christian School, just north of the incident, was ending its class schedule at 3 p.m. when school officials were asked by officers to lock down the school. Parents, staff and the few remaining students were on campus until deputies lifted the lockdown about two hours later.","San Jacinto police sent Sultan, a Belgian Malinois-German shepherd mix, into a home where a suspect was barricaded with a gun on January 21 .

"These images show the blossoming of Dresden in east Germany from the ruins of the Allied bombings towards the end of World War II. British and American bombers dropped 3,900 tonnes of explosives on the Saxony city during four raids on 13th-15th February 1945, killing an estimated 25,000 people and reducing the city to rubble. The bombing, ordered by Royal Air Force marshal Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, was widely criticised because of 'blanket bombing' which hit civilian areas as well as military targets - killing thousands of innocents. Scroll down for video . These images shows the ruing at Theaterplatz square in 1946, still wrecked from the Allied forces' firebombing on February 13-15 1945, and the square today . Final stop: People getting on a tram on Moritzstrasse, now Moritzgasse, near the Judenhof palace, now a transportation museum, in 1946, amidst the ruins left by the bombings, and now, pictured last week . Building Dresden again: Women are pictured carrying bricks outside the Martin Luther church in 1946, while Dresden was still being rebuilt, and now, pictured today . Over two days and nights in February 1945, 722 heavy bombers of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and 527 of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), turned the city into a sea of flames and rubble. The resulting firestorm is said to have reached temperatures of over 1,500C (2,700F), destroying over 1,600 acres of the city centre. The victims - mostly women and children - died in savage firestorms whipped up by the intense heat of 2,400 tons of high explosive and 1,500 tons of incendiary bombs. It was initially claimed that up to 250,000 civilians lost their lives in the Dresden bombings but an official report released after the war showed the casualty figure was in fact closer to between 22,500 and 25,000. A police report written shortly after the bombings showed that the city centre firestorm had destroyed almost 12,000 houses, including 640 shops, 18 cinemas, 39 schools, 26s pubs and the city zoo.

Herbert are seen in the wreckage of Dresden outside City Hall in March 1947, and now, rebuilt again . Saving the painting: The Zwinger palace, an art gallery built in Rococo style in central Dresden, pictured in the year after the bombings and today, was destroyed, but much of its collection had been salvaged before the war . These images show the ruins of the Frauenkirche, a Lutheran church in Dresden, and the then empty pedestal for a statue of Martin Luther following the February bombings of 1945, as well as the reconstructed church and statue in 2015 . The destruction of Dresden has been subjected to much debate in the 70 years since the war. Although no one has ever been charged over the bombings, several historians both in Germany and former Allied nations hold the opinion that the bombing was a war crime. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, ultimately responsible for the attack, distanced himself from the bombing of Dresden shortly afterwards. An RAF memo issued to airmen on the night of the attack said: . Dresden, the seventh largest city in Germany and not much smaller than Manchester is also the largest unbombed builtup area the enemy has got. In the midst of winter with refugees pouring westward and troops to be rested, roofs are at a premium, not only to give shelter to workers, refugees, and troops alike, but to house the administrative services displaced from other areas. 'At one time well known for its china, Dresden has developed into an industrial city of first-class importance.... The intentions of the attack are to hit the enemy where he will feel it most, behind an already partially collapsed front... and incidentally to show the Russians when they arrive what Bomber Command can do.' The Bomber Command, which suffered the highest casualty rate of any British unit, losing 55,573 of its 125,000 men, eventually got a memorial in 2012.","Allied Forces dropped 3,900 tonnes of explosives over Dresden during four raids on 13th-15th February 1945 .

"It was expected to fetch over $50 million when it went on sale, but now in a dramatic move, the price of a massive 5,000sq m beachfront mansion has been slashed in half to $25 million. Tukurua, the sprawling estate in Cottesloe, Perth, is owned by Ted Smith, a gardener who inherited the heritage home from a wealthy spinster. While he was hoping to bag over $50 million for the hot property, he found that despite its unrivalled views and expansive garden, it just wasn't selling. Now Mr Smith has switched agents and dropped the price to $25 million in the hope of attracting a buyer to his historic property. Scroll down for video . The property at 1-9 Rosendo Street, Cottesloe is 5001 sq m and has had interest from Chinese and local investors . Mr Smith spent six years and more than $5 million restoring Tukurua . Ted Smith, 80, has slashed the price of his historic Tukurua mansion on the beachfront in Cottesloe, Perth to $25 million . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, new agent Peter Clements from Mint Real Estate in Cottesloe said '$50 million was never the right price' for the property and believes the old agent priced the house way out of the market. 'There's a price that people will pay and a price that people won't pay,' Mr Clements said. Mr Clements revealed that the house has been given a new lease of life after Mr Smith employed Mint agency, claiming numerous people are now interested in the property, which is located in prime real estate. Tukurua is of great cultural significance to WA, as it was built in 1896 by WA's first attorney general Sir Septimus Burt to be his holiday home . Mr Smith says it's time for him to downsize from the sprawling property . The sprawling estate in Cottesloe, Perth, which is called Tukurua, is owned by Ted Smith, a gardener who inherited the heritage home from a wealthy spinster . Miss Cass (pictured left aged 18) was one of the first women in WA to graduate from university . For 23 years Mr Smith helped Miss Cass take care of the sprawling gardens and do repairs around the estate . Mr Smith has spent $5 million renovating the house over the past six years and is ready to move on to something a bit smaller and has cut the price in half. According to Mint real estate, offers of over $25 million will be accepted for the property and should be presented by Monday 9th March before 2pm. The mansion boasts six bedrooms, four bathrooms and has been beautifully restored to it's former glory. Ms Smith started renting a room at the sprawling beachfront estate in Cottesloe, Perth in the 1970s and struck up a great friendship with its owner, Dorothea Cass, and for years he helped her take care of the huge property and gardens. When Miss Cass died in 1994 she had never married or had children and she left the entire heritage-listed estate to him. Mr Smith, now 80, has been taking care of the property on his own for two decades and he's ready to move on. 'I've been here for 43 years so I think it's time to down size,' Mr Smith told Daily Mail Australia in September. Mr Smith, who was born in Ireland in 1934, moved into the house aged 37. He had moved to Australia some years earlier because he suffered from emphysema and asthma and wanted to be in a warmer, drier climate. 'I never got married because I left Ireland and I was in very poor health and that's why I came to Australia,' he said. He spent time in various parts of WA working in agriculture and catering while also trading shares on the side, but in 1971 he wanted to get more involved in the share market so he moved back to Perth and got a job in the old Swan Brewery's share registry. At the same time he moved into Tukurua, leasing a room off Miss Cass, who was about 63 at the time. Miss Cass had inherited the property from her parents Berry and Catherine Cass, who ran the property as a boarding house and military headquarters throughout World War II. Heritage listing documents state that when the property passed to Miss Cass in 1943 'a condition of inheritance was that Miss Cass did not marry'. Mr Smith said he wasn't sure it that was true. 'I don't know about that, she never told me,' he said. 'But I've heard that rumour… rumours can be good and bad. She never did get married.' Mr Smith started renting a room at the sprawling beachfront estate in Cottesloe, Perth in the 1970s and struck up a great friendship with Miss Cass . After Mr Smith moved in the pair soon struck up a friendship. He was studying metaphysics at night school and Miss Cass, one of the first women in WA to get a university degree, loved talking about religion. 'That's where Dorothea and I had a bond, she was very interested in religious studies and metaphysics and I was too,' he said. 'It was a very interesting time, she was very, very well-educated and very qualified in English. 'So that was a bond for us both. We had a lot of discussion in the evenings and at weekends.' When Alan Bond purchased the Swan Brewery in 1981 Mr Smith stopped working there, but continued trading shares as well as helping Miss Cass with the upkeep of the estate. 'After the brewery I did share trading and as time went on, when Dorothea got more feeble, there was more to be done as far as minding the property and doing repairs,' he said. 'And of course with 5000 sq m it's quite a large piece of land and there were always things to do, repairs to be done.' The property's previous owner Dorothea Cass, pictured right with Mr Smith in the 1980s, left the historic mansion to him when she died in 1994 . Miss Cass had inherited the property from her parents Berry and Catherine Cass, who ran the property as a boarding house and military headquarters throughout World War II . When Mr Smith moves out after 43 years he hopes to find a place to live nearby in Cottesloe with a big garden . Miss Cass moved into a nursing home in 1993, and Mr Smith stayed to take care of Tukurua. When she died the next year, aged 86, she left the entire property to him, which he said was a 'big surprise' and something he only found out Miss Cass was planning to do very late in her life. 'Because, like us all, she couldn't take it with her,' he said. 'And because she trusted me and she always recognised that I was good with finances and I didn't squander money and I didn't drink alcohol.' In 1994 it was valued at $4 million. Now, it is set to sell for  $25 million. Mr Smith spent six years between 2003 and 2009 restoring the historic property at a cost of more than $5 million. Tukurua is of great cultural significance to WA, as it was built in 1896 by WA's first attorney general Sir Septimus Burt to be his holiday home. 'I didn't have any option, the house was in very, very bad disrepair,' Mr Smith said of the restoration. 'I started with the roof which was in appalling condition and we had put a whole new roof on and then we couldn't stop, one thing led to another. Heritage listing documents state that when the property passed to Miss Cass in 1943 'a condition of inheritance was that Miss Cass did not marry' Miss Cass moved into a nursing home in 1993, and Mr Smith stayed to take care of Tukurua. When she died the next year, aged 84, she left the entire property to him . 'I didn't start out with the intention of a complete rebuild but it went on and on and on.' Mr Smith said there were lots of different things that could happen to the house when it sold – including it being broken up into 10 separate blocks of land and developed. 'Definitely there are lots of options and it could be a beautiful home for some wealthy people or it could be developed with quite a lot of apartments, all depending on who the buyer is,' he said. 'I can't control that aspect when it's out of my hands but it would be very nice to see say a wealthy family and big family, hopefully, having a very beautiful home.' When Mr Smith moves out after 43 years he hopes to find a place to live nearby in Cottesloe with a big garden. 'I live a very simple, humble life and I like it that way because too many people are making too much noise,' he said. 'I like to study and read and listen to classical music, which Dorothea liked very much too.' Mr Smith, who was born in Ireland in 1934, moved into the house aged 37. He and Miss Cass, then aged about 64, soon struck up a friendship . At the time it was valued at $4 million.

"High-tech 'fight cameras' which can automatically alert police when violence is about to break out on busy streets are being developed by British scientists. The crime-fighting CCTV system will use sophisticated software to predict when a fight will happen - by analysing crowd movements and triggering an alert as fists are about to fly. Police say the the groundbreaking surveillance technology could help them detect crime 'before it happens' - much like the pre-crime unit featured in the Steven Spielberg sci-fi film Minority Report. Scientists at Cardiff University have developed a futuristic CCTV system (stock image shown). It can alert police when a fight is about to break out. It does this by analysing crowd movements and triggering an alert. The project is only in development at the moment but could help reduce the number of violent crimes . The million-pound project to develop the smart cameras is believed to be a world first in using CCTV to analyse people's behaviour in public. In December it was announced police in Germany are considering adopting a similar software that predicts crimes and is named ‘Precobs’ - in a nod to the sci-fi film. Developed by the Institute for pattern-based Prediction Technique in Oberhausen, the software programme predicts when and where a crime is most likely to occur, based on different sets of data. It is being tested by police in the southern state of Bavaria. The German Precobs system relies on data of the location, time and other details of past crimes, such as home break-ins. When a new incident is reported, the software analyses the data to look for a pattern that will point to a future target. Developed by scientists at the Violence & Society Research Group at Cardiff University, the imaging technology alerts CCTV operators and police officers when fights are detected on city centre cameras. 'Developing smart camera technology that can pinpoint violence is a really cost effective way of helping police to do their jobs,' said Professor Simon Moore. 'Officers can't monitor hundreds of city centre CCTV cameras all the time. 'By using imaging technology, officers will be alerted to violence hotspots in real-time, helping to further reduce violence. 'It's a great way of using technology to make the streets safer for all of us.' It comes amid a surge in violent crime in England and Wales, with the number of incidents soaring by 16 per cent to nearly 700,000 incidents in figures released last month. According to Home Office estimates, the average violence incident costs more than £33,000 ($50,700), including NHS and criminal justice costs and lost working hours. Police say the the ground-breaking surveillance technology could help them detect crime 'before it happens' - much like the pre-crime unit featured in the 2002 Steven Spielberg sci-fi film Minority Report (shown) Adrian Lee, Chief Constable of Northamptonshire and Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on alcohol and licensing, said the CCTV system would 'hopefully identify ways to automatically predict potential disorder in the night time economy so we can deploy officers to it before it happens.' He added: 'As austerity continues in policing it is important that we work together with academia to develop an evidence base of knowledge to ensure officers and resources are deployed as effectively as possible.' The project team is working to develop a fool-proof system which can operate at night - when most street fights take place - and recognise the complex behaviour of people in a crowd. 'Detecting violence from CCTV camera footage presents some interesting technical challenges due to the time of day, the need to operate in all weather conditions, camera positions and recognising people's often complex activities in such footage,' said Professor David Marshall, from the university's Computer Science School. The project is a partnership between Cardiff University, Airbus Group and the Welsh Government. Airbus is developing the technological infrastructure, whilst the Welsh Government is providing funding.","Scientists at Cardiff University have developed a futuristic CCTV system .

"A Sicilian mafia boss dubbed the Godfather of Uxbridge could finally be extradited back to Italy after spending two decades holed up in the leafy London suburb. Domenico Rancadore, 65, also known as The Professor in mafia circles, fled to Britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in Italy for his role as a 'man of honour', taking bribes from builders in Palermo. Eventually he was tracked down but the Italian authorities had their bid to have the don extradited quashed on human rights grounds, with Rancadore's lawyers arguing the country's prisons were not safe. Sicilian mafia boss Domenico Rancadore, pictured with his British wife Ann last year, could face extradition back to Italy . The ageing mafia 'linchpin' was told in March last year that he would not not be extradited to serve the seven-year jail term because of concerns over the state of Italian jails. Rancadore's lawyers had argued that his ailing health, including heart problems, would not be catered for in an Italian prison. But last month the High Court ruled that Italian jail cells were safe and not overcrowded, allowing extradition proceedings to get back underway. Hannah Hinton, prosecuting, today told a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'Figures demonstrate the Italian authorities have been committed over time to reducing the number of inmates in prison.' Rancadore did not appear at today's hearing because he is in hospital, but his lawyer Alun Jones QC said he would be discharged soon. Rancadore, known as the Godfather of Uxbridge for spending two decades holed up in his west London home with his wife (right) and family, had an earlier bid to extradite him quashed on human rights grounds . The mafia boss lived a double life in Uxbridge under the name Marc Skinner after arriving in Britain in the 1990s . The mafia boss fled Italy for Britain in 1993 and lived a double life in Uxbridge under the name Marc Skinner, raising a family with his English wife Ann, the daughter of a former Italian consul to London. She was in the public gallery and watched the brief hearing alone. Rancadore's extradition hearing will take place on February 20. A European Arrest Warrant for Rancadore was first lodged in January 2012. His lawyers had argued that sending him back to Italy would be in contravention of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Under the law no person should suffer 'inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment' while incarcerated. Last year's decision not to extradite Rancadore came a week after the High Court rejected reassurances by Italian authorities that Hayle Abdi Badre, wanted by a Florence court for breaking finance rules, would not breach his rights. District Judge Howard Riddle, ruling on Rancadore's case, said that judgement was binding despite finding that the extradition was 'compatible with the defendant's convention rights, including prison conditions'. Also known as Cosa Nostra, which translates as 'Our Thing', the Mafia emerged in Sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct. Groups, often known as families or clans, will claim leadership of an area, usually a town or village, and operate rackets within it, using violence to punish those causing problems to their 'clients' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection. Most of the clans are led by a 'boss' (capofamiglia or rappresentante), who is aided by an underboss (capo bastone or sotto capo) and supervised by one or more advisers (consigliere). Only men are allowed to join the clans, and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges. It has been estimated that the Sicilian Mafia costs the region's economy more than €10 billion a year, and that roughly 70 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money. Politicians have also been accused of using the Mafia to buy votes during elections. The American Mafia arose from offshoots of the Cosa Nostra that emerged in the United States during the late nineteenth century, following waves of emigration from Italy.","Mafia boss Domenico Rancadore could face extradition back to Italy .

"A man has been convicted of beating his wife to death and dumping her body off a remote logging road in the woods just hours after she filed divorce papers. James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont is alleged to have flown into a rage and callously killed his wife who was found ten days later with her head and hands detached from her corpse. During his murder trial, he testified  that he had not killed her, but a New Hampshire jury  convicted him of second-degree murder after deliberating for more than 12 hours over three days. Guilty: James Robarge, of Charlestown, New Hampshire listens as Assistant Attorney General Susan Morrell cross-examines him during his trial at Sullivan County Superior Court in Newport . Sentence: James Robarge waits to be escorted out of Sullivan County Superior Court Wednesday after a jury found him guilty of beating his wife to death hours after she filed divorce papers . Tears: Sisters Ciera Robarge, center, and Gabriel Robarge Pellerin, right, follow Ronald Prouty Jr. out of Sullivan County Superior Court after the verdict . After the verdict was handed down, Robarge's two daughters left the courtroom sobbing and clutching one another in disbelief. According to police, Kelly Robarge, 42, had filed for divorce after more than 20 years of marriage on June 27, 2013 — the day she disappeared from her Charlestown, New Hampshire, home. Her badly decomposed body was found ten days later in Unity. Her husband could face life in prison for her murder when he is sentenced in April. The jury rejected a first-degree murder charge but found him guilty of second-degree murder for reckless conduct that showed 'extreme indifference to the value of human life.' Defense attorney Caroline Smith said: 'We are pleased that the jury who met him as well could not believe he would ever plan to kill his wife. Shock: Family members of Kelly Robarge react to the not guilty verdicts on charges of first- and second-degree murder before the announcement of a guilty verdict for the charge of second-degree murder for reckless conduct against James Robarge . 'We're certainly saddened that they thought he killed her at all.' However, prosecutor Diana Fenton told jurors last month: 'He dumped her out in the woods like a piece of trash and left her out there in the woods to rot.' Prosecutors said the entryway to Kelly Robarge's home contained 'countless' spatters of blood. And James Robarge's disabled car was found several miles from where her body was discovered with a bloodstained trunk and numerous bloody items outside it. However, most of the case was built largely on circumstantial evidence. The closest thing to an eyewitness was a Unity man who said he saw Robarge, wearing latex gloves, crouched beside his disabled car on a turnaround in Unity the night Kelly Robarge disappeared. Her body was found off a logging road not far from there, and forensics experts said metal fragments found near an oil-smeared rock on the road matched Robarge's shattered oil pan. Due to the condition of her body, a medical examiner could not pinpoint the cause of death or determine how her head and hands became detached but concluded she died as the result of 'homicidal violence.' Meanwhile, one of the last people to see Kelly Robarge alive the day she disappeared was Frances Uptegrove, a physician assistant who had treated her for anxiety and depression for several years. Uptegrove testified that Kelly Robarge told her she was heading to court to file for divorce. He said: 'She seemed clear-headed, determined. She'd made up her mind.' Public defender Alex Parsons told jurors during his opening statement on January 15 that James Robarge was 'the critical witness.' In testimony spanning two days, James Robarge showed no emotion as he repeatedly denied threatening or harming his wife and stared straight ahead when the verdict was announced. Robarge claimed that he didn't know his wife had filed for divorce, but he acknowledged that just days before, he found a letter from her on their kitchen counter saying she wanted one.","James Robarge, 45, from Saxtons River, Vermont was convicted of the crime .

"Illegal metal detecting at Hadrian's Wall is wrecking the country's cultural heritage and stealing items of archaeological interest land owners, police and experts have warned. Areas close to 1,900-year-old World Heritage Site, which stretched for 80 miles across some of Northern England's most rugged scenery, have been hacked away by 'nighthawkers'. Turf has been pulled out and unscrupulous searchers have raked through the dirt to steal items which could have laid hidden since Roman times. Police have warned that 'nighthawkers' - people who use metal detectors to raid historical sites at night - are wrecking part of Britain's cultural heritage (pictured, an excavation close to the wall) English Heritage, the National Trust and Northumberland National Park have joined police in issuing a warning to anyone carrying out the activity that it is illegal and they will be prosecuted. In recent months, illegal digs have taken place at National Trust land at Steel Rigg and Peel Crags on Hadrian's Wall. These sites have special protection as Scheduled Ancient Monuments and even using a metal detector without authorisation from English Heritage is an offence. Mark Harrison, English Heritage National Crime Advisor said: 'The practice of ""nighthawking"", particularly from such important sites as Hadrian's Wall, is an issue that we take very seriously. 'We recognise that the majority of the metal detecting community comply with the laws and regulations relating to the discovery and recovery of objects from the land, but just as it is against the law to break into someone's house and steal their possessions, so it is illegal to damage land and steal valuable historical artefacts. 'The objects they are stealing belong to the landowner, in this case the National Trust, and the history they are stealing belongs to all of us.' Because the site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument it is illegal to even use a metal detector without permission, and people are strictly forbidden from taking away what they find . Hadrian's Wall, a 1,900-year-old World Heritage Site, originally stretched for more than 80 miles across some of the most rugged terrain in Northern England . Eric Wilton, National Trust Countryside Manager for Hadrian's Wall Country Group said: 'It is disappointing at a time when archaeologists and legitimate metal detectorists are working together more closely that this incident has occurred. 'The National Trust wants the public to enjoy its many and varied sites, such as these at Steel Rigg and Pele Gap, but cannot tolerate illegal metal detecting that harms the appreciation of our collective heritage.' Chris Jones, the Historic Environment Officer for the Northumberland National Park said: 'The illegal removal of archaeological material is a serious offence. 'Such criminality has a damaging effect on people's ability to understand and enjoy the cultural heritage of the National Park.' West Tynedale Neighbourhood Inspector Kevin Oates of Northumbria Police said: 'Because of the harm that nighthawking causes to our heritage, Northumbria Police are committed to investigating these issues. 'Any perpetrators can be expected to be prosecuted. Anyone with any information about unlawful metal detecting should call the police on 101, quoting incident number 418, 12/11/14.'","'Nighthawkers' use metal detectors to raid historic sites after nightfall .

The pair were pictured together just days after the conversation was leaked by hackers . Pascal said 'everybody understood' because they all lived in 'this weird thing called Hollywood' Pictured: Angelina Jolie with Mrs Pascal . 'Angie didn't care,' Mrs Pascal said, according to the website Recode. 'Everybody understood because we all live in this weird thing called Hollywood. If we all actually were nice, it wouldn't work.' Mrs Pascal made the comments during the Women World Conference in San Francisco. 'All the women here are doing incredible things in this world. All I did was get fired,' she said, according to the  site. The email exchange between Mr Rudin and Mrs Pascal began because Jolie wanted director David Fincher to oversee her planned remake of Cleopatra instead of a Steve Jobs biopic written by Aaron Sorkin. Rudin wrote to Pascal: 'There is no movie of Cleopatra to be made (and how that is a bad thing given the insanity and rampaging spoiled ego of this woman and the cost of the movie is beyond me)...I have zero appetite for the indulgence of spoiled brats and I will tell her this myself if you don't.' In the emails Rudin added that he was 'not destroying my career over a minimally talented spoiled brat.' The emails were leaked between Hollywood producer Scott Rudin, pictured left, and Amy Pascal, pictured right . Pascal responded: 'You better shut Angie down before she makes it very hard for David to do Jobs.' In another of the offensive email exchanges that emerged, Mrs Pascal made racist jokes about the US President, suggesting that he would like films about slavery or that centred on black characters. Amy Pascal made the comments during the Women World Conference in San Francisco . 'Should I ask him if he liked Django?,' she wrote. In one discussion, she told a producer who complained about Leonardo DiCaprio that the Wolf of Wall Street star is 'actually despicable'. In some of the leaked messages Mrs Pascal insulted some of the Hollywood studio's most bankable stars. The hack attack was linked to North Korea, and is thought to have been an attempt to force Sony to scrap The Interview, a comedy about the assassination of the country's leader, Kim Jong-un. At the event in San Francisco Mrs Pascal was asked about the emails regarding President, and described it was 'horrible,' according to the website. She was also asked about paying Jennifer Lawrence less money than her male co-stars in American Hustle by interviewer Tina Brown. Mrs Pascal said that she was running a business and has paid Lawrence a 'lot more since,' It was announced late last week that Mrs Pascal was leaving her role as the co-chairman of Sony Pictures this May. Just three days later Mrs Pascal was named as co-producer for the latest installment of the company's multi-billion pound Spider-Man franchise.","Amy Pascal reportedly says Angelina Jolie didn't care about leaked emails .

"Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-ah has been handed a one-year jail term for aviation law violations following her 'nut rage' on an airplane. The court said Cho, who was a Korean Air executive vice president at the time, was guilty of forcing a flight to change its route at New York City's JFK airport, and two other charges. The 40-year-old had taken exception to being served macadamia nuts she had not asked for in a bag, not a bowl. She ordered the chief flight attendant off the flight, forcing the taxiing plane to return to the gate. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-ah (above) has been sentenced to a year for her notorious 'nut rage' incident that caused an uproar in South Korea . The daughter of Korean Air's chairman has been in custody since December 30 and was charged with forcing a flight to change its normal route and which carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. The district court in Seoul ruled that Cho had illegally altered the course of the plane, judging that an aircraft was 'in flight' from the moment it begins to move. Cho, who has been in custody since December 30, made a grovelling apology (above) where she bowed her head in shame and said she was 'sorry' following the incident . Cameramen take images of a prison bus carrying Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-Ah as she arrives at a court following 'nut rage scandal' Cho had treated the flight 'as if it was her own private plane', justice Oh Sung-Woo said. 'It is doubtful that the way the nuts were served was so wrong,' Oh added. The judge said Cho had failed to show enough remorse for her actions, even though she had submitted some letters to the court expressing repentance for her behaviour. Cho, who attended the court in a green prison outfit, stood silently throughout the ruling, her head bowed while she was sentenced to one year in prison. She had pleaded not guilty to most of the charges, including physically assaulting the chief steward, Park Chang-Jin, who says she made him kneel and beg for forgiveness while jabbing him with a service manual. The case triggered a huge public backlash, which Justice Oh said had 'damaged the dignity of the country.' Park Chang-jin (left), the chief flight attendant ordered off the flight by angry Cho, told the court he and other staff were treated like 'feudal slaves' by the heiress. Her father and airline chairman Cho Yang-ho (right) called her behaviour 'foolish' and said that he regretted that he did not raise her better . She was seen as emblematic of a generation of spoilt and arrogant offspring of owners of the giant family-run conglomerates, or 'chaebols,' that dominate the South Korean economy. Like Cho, many are given senior positions in the family business, sometimes after a token period 'learning the trade'. In the past, chaebol owners have appeared to be above the law. Those convicted of gross fraud have either received lenient sentences or been granted pardons after just a short time in jail. Cho resigned from all her posts and publicly apologised for her behaviour, which her father and KAL chairman Cho Yang-Ho also criticised as a 'foolish act'. She backed up her actions and said that cabin crew in first class had made a mistake by not following proper procedures, Seoul Western District Court heard. During the incident which occurred on December 5, Park Chang-jin, the chief flight attendant, was ordered off the plane by angry Cho, following a heated confrontation with cabin crew because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a dish. Furious that he had not followed protocol, she screamed at Park and told him to bring out the company's in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines. When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him off the flight. Without giving the 250 passengers on board a warning, the Incheon-bound plane was forced to return to the gate at John F Kennedy Airport in New York. The Airbus A380 eventually arrived in South Korea 11 minutes late. In court, Park said he and other staff were treated like 'feudal slaves' by the heiress. And a statement from one crew member described Cho as behaving like an 'angry tiger' during the incident. Cho did admit to using violence against one flight attendant by pushing her shoulder and throwing an object at her. She also said she did not realize the chief flight attendant has law enforcement authority during the flight and that by ordering the chief flight attendant off the plane was consequently a risk to safety. The 'final call' about returning to the gate was made by the captain, said Cho. 'I think this case happened because of devotion to my work and because I could not be considerate to other people,' she said. During the trial, cabin crew told the court they were pressured by Korean Air executives to cover up the incident and to lie to investigators. The 40-year-old's 'nut rage' tantrum caused an uproar in South Korea where the economy is dominated by family-run conglomerates known as 'chaebol' that often act above the law. She resigned from her role as executive vice president . Macadamia nut sales rose following Cho Hyun-ah's 'nut rage' tantrum. Auction, a South Korean unit of eBay and South Korea's second-largest e-commerce website, said last December that sales of macadamias surged nearly 12-fold without any promotions. It also said macadamias previously made up five per cent of its nut sales but said (at the time) they were accounting for almost half. Prosecutors called for two years in prison for Kim Woon-sub, a transport ministry official and former Korean Air executive accused of leaking secrets about the ministry's investigation. Following the incident last December, Cho made a grovelling apology where she bowed her head in shame and admitted in a trembling voice that she was 'sorry'. Cho's lawyers did not dispute the major elements of the prosecutor's account of events, and instead focused on a technical rebuttal of the charges. This has included trying to demonstrate flight attendants did not know proper service procedures. On the most serious charge of changing a flight's route, they argued events fell short of that definition because the plane was only meters from the gate when it turned around. She backed up her actions and said that cabin crew in first class had made a mistake by not following proper procedures, Seoul Western District Court heard. During the trial, cabin crew told the court they were pressured by Korean Air executives to cover up the incident and to lie to investigators. The court said Cho Hyun-ah was guilty of forcing a flight to change its route and two other charges. It also found Cho guilty of obstructing the flight's captain in the performance of his duties and forcing a crew member off a plane. It found her not guilty of interfering with a transport ministry investigation into the incident. A letter was read in court about how Cho, one of the richest women in South Korea who regularly flew first class, was adjusting to the basic conditions of her prison and finding time to reflect on her life. 'I know my faults and I'm very sorry,' she said.","Cho Hyun-ah took exception when she was served nuts in bag and not in dish .

"Christmas was ruined for tens of thousands of passengers caught up in train chaos when botched engineering work over-ran, a damning report said today. More than 115,000  people faced 'widespread confusion, frustration, disruption, discomfort and anxiety' in the Christmas rail engineering overruns, the rail regulator said. Network Rail came under fire for late-finishing work over the festive period which hit services into King's Cross, Paddington and Finsbury Park stations in London. Passengers were left in tears in some cases with hundreds of journeys ruined by the overrunning works. The disruption caused chaos at King's Cross, Paddington and at Finsbury Park where there was overcrowding . Queues formed at Finsbury Park station, because of the closure of Kings Cross station due to overrunning maintenance work . East Coast mainline services into King’s Cross were halted over Christmas for the works between the terminus and Finsbury Park in north London. When they over-ran into the weekend there was chaos as services between Scotland, the North East and London were cancelled. Those that ran were massively overcrowded and delayed, while suburban Finsbury Park station failed to cope with the crowds.  The crush was so great at one stage that passengers were unable to disembark. Some services were ushered into King’s Cross by railmen waving red and yellow flags. The Office Of Rail Regulation (ORR) said the catalogue of problems led to 'unacceptable' service levels. 'Passengers were really let down,' said ORR's railway markets and economics director Joanna Whittington. The ORR report into the disruption, affecting services on Saturday December 27 and Sunday December 28, follows NR's own critical report last month which acknowledged the company's failings. In today's report the ORR said: . The ORR made a number of recommendations to ensure 'that in future passengers do not suffer the same experience'. Engineers were forced to use red and yellow flags to signal trains in and out of the station today as the chaos at King's Cross station continued . The report said: 'Passengers who travel between Christmas and the new year include families with young children, the elderly and vulnerable often travelling with lots of luggage in an unfamiliar environment. 'Over the two days we estimate that more than 115,000 passengers were affected in some way by this disruption. ' The report went on: 'There were impressive examples of good service from individual members of staff but the overall service passengers received was not acceptable. 'It led to widespread confusion, frustration, disruption, discomfort and anxiety.' Ms Whittington said: 'NR has rightly acknowledged it didn't do enough for passengers affected by overrunning engineering works at King's Cross and Paddington this Christmas. NR chief executive Mark Carne, who was criticised for not returning from his holiday home in Cornwall when the problems occurred, repeated his apology today . 'While the company generally has a good record for delivering engineering work on time, in this instance passengers were really let down.' She went on: 'Our investigation found that contingency planning did not fully consider the impact of potential overruns on passengers and that this needs to change. 'In future, plans will address the impact on passengers as well as engineering and train operation issues. NR cannot achieve this alone, train operators will also need to play their part.' Ms Whittington added: 'NR has committed to ensuring all work undertaken this Easter has a contingency plan which is fit for purpose, and to implement all recommendations in time for engineering works planned over Christmas 2015. 'ORR will audit its progress, to ensure that passengers' needs and safety are central to NR's and train operator contingency arrangements.' NR chief executive Mark Carne, who was criticised for not returning from his holiday home in Cornwall when the problems occurred, repeated his apology today. He said: 'Putting passengers at the heart of our planning is absolutely the right thing to do and we recognise that we let people down during the disruption experienced on December 27 and 28. 'Over Christmas, we undertook the biggest programme of engineering and investment work ever, upgrading train lines across the country. The overwhelming majority of this work went to plan but in the case of King's Cross and Paddington we accept we got things wrong. 'Our own report has caused us to look again at the work we have planned this year and the contingency plans we have in place and the ORR's report underlines the necessity of this work.' House of Commons Transport Committee chairman Louise Ellman said: 'NR must implement the ORR's recommendations in full so that passengers do not face avoidable disruption and chaos. 'The scenes at Christmas were unacceptable. Bad planning, the failure of contingency arrangements and breakdown in communication resulted in thousands of people waiting for hours in the cold outside Finsbury Park station, or stuck on delayed trains.' She went on: 'The rail sector must work together to ensure that NR's planning and communication improves. NR's investment programme for 2014/19 means that more major and complex engineering work will need to take place. NR must learn from their errors to regain the confidence of the public.' Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher said: 'Over 100,000 passengers were affected by the rail chaos over the Christmas period. We now know that David Cameron's Government was warned and failed to act. 'While it is clear that NR needs to learn lessons, out of touch ministers must learn from their failure too.' Passengers on trains to Edinburgh from London, one of the worst affected routes yesterday, complained of overcrowding as they were forced to stand in aisles and sit on the floor despite purchasing tickets . He went on: 'It is also increasingly evident that there needs to be big reforms to the running of our railway so that we have a rail service that is fit for purpose. 'The ORR is right to say that the rail industry must place passengers at the heart of enhanced contingency planning. Labour has argued consistently that passengers must be given a proper voice in the running of the railway, so that they are at the centre of the way in which the industry is run.' Michael Roberts, director general of the Rail Delivery Group which represents operators and NR, said: 'Major projects like those completed over Christmas are crucial to improving the railway. 'But many passengers did not get the service they deserved in the days following Christmas and for that we are very sorry. NR and operators are working closely together to avoid making the same mistakes again.' He added: 'Passengers are our primary focus and it is vital that the industry provides them with accurate and timely information, particularly during disruption. 'In the coming months train operators will be publishing individual plans to improve customer communications.' Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: 'This report reveals that the post-Christmas chaos was such a shambles because NR tried to substitute a small suburban station, Finsbury Park, for mainline King's Cross which has 12 platforms. 'Any schoolboy knows you cannot get a quart into a pint pot. For some reason, no one at the top of NR seemed to know that basic fact. 'When they tried to ignore this very basic sum, tens of thousands of passengers had their holidays ruined.' David Sidebottom, director at rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, said: 'Thousands of passengers were left angry and frustrated when trying to travel at Christmas. 'We heard of passengers standing for hours on trains, locked outside stations and left to find out what to do by themselves.' He went on: 'This cannot happen again. We welcome this report from the regulator, which echoes our call for industry to put passengers' experience right at the heart of planning, especially for plans to cope and compensate when things go wrong.' Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: 'Passengers should be at the heart of everything the rail industry does. The industry must learn lessons to avoid any repeat of the completely unacceptable disruption we saw in December. 'NR and the operators are delivering essential improvements that we are investing in as part of our long-term economic plan. However, it is vital they ensure these works are properly planned and any impacts to services are communicated to passengers.'","Office of Rail Regulation found 115,000 people were affected by problems .

"It's been a long wait but after Fifty Shades of Grey premiered in at the Berlin Film Festival last night, and so far the hotly-anticipated film has been given a  bit of a spanking. Many reviewers who caught a New York screening the day before lamented the lack of sex in the the film adaptation of EL James's erotic novels. And now critics have dismissed it as 'bleak', 'gloomy' and reminiscent of a 'teen romance' although Dakota Johnson has been singled out as the clear star of the kinky flick. Scroll down for video .

Bleak: Critics have slammed Fifty Shades of Grey calling the film 'bleak' and criticising Jamie Dornan's performance as Christian Grey . The film, which follows the romance between bondage-loving businessman Christian Grey and hapless student journalist Anastasia Steele has been one of the most talked about releases of the year. However, it seems to have fallen far short of expectations, with the only person singled out for praise being film ingenue  Dakota, 25, in her first major role. Kaleem Aftab of the Independent bemoaned the film's, 'obvious,' visual metaphors and claimed the plotting of the film would have seemed, 'light in a teen romance.' He says of the first section of the film: '[It] plays like the opening of a porn movie in which a washing machine repairman will turn up at a house and be met by a bored housewife.' However, he says: 'The daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson is notable for more than having her mother’s good looks, as she jumps from being naive to forthright with aplomb.' Director Sam Taylor-Johnson and author EL James hit the red carpet in Berlin last night, Taylor-Johnson has said she is not reading any criticism . Disappointment? Some critics have pointed out that there are no shots of genitalia in the film . Peter Bradshaw of the Guardian said: '“I don’t make love. I f**k. Hard.” With these bold but very misleading words we are introduced to what is the most purely tasteful and softcore depiction of sadomasochism in cinema history.' Bradshaw goes on - like many other critics - to point out that there is a noticeable dearth of genitalia in the film. Indeed, for a movie which is predominantly about sex, it is reported that you barely see Mr Grey below the belt. He jokes: 'There are no glimpses of a penis in this film, not in any state. It’s primly off-camera. Or maybe the smoulderingly sado-obsessed hero does not have a penis.' Too many clothes? Movie critics remarked on how little sex there was in the film version of Fifty Shades of Grey . The Sydney Morning Herald refers to it as 'bleak', with film critic Philippa Hawker saying: 'Director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel have turned EL James' overheated, annoying first-person narrative (the first novel of a trilogy) into a somewhat gloomy vision of expectations and desires, the story of a man's will for control and a woman's resistance.' However, at New York Magazine, David Edelstein was pleasantly surprised. 'It’s elegantly made, and Dakota Johnson is so good at navigating the heroine’s emotional zigs and zags that you want to buy into the whole cobwebbed premise. In fact, he describes it as 'Jane Eyre with ropes'. But the hero comes in for some criticism and he says Jamie Dornan, 'cuts a less commanding figure than you’d hope, so the first look between Anastasia and Grey is a non-event. 'With his fluffed-up hair and pert, pretty little face, Dornan’s Grey looks more like a natural bottom than a top. He’s a bantamweight. Although I did grow to appreciate his modest, unshowy acting, it’s clear he’s not sending much heat her way and that she’s having to work herself up in a vacuum.' Pants on: One writer noted that Dornan spent much of the raunchy film with only his shirt off . And although she again praises Dakota's performance she notes that Jamie has a more difficult time making Mr Grey's character believable. Similarly the New York Times questioned Jamie's role in the film. A.O.Scott said: 'Mr. Dornan has the bland affect of a model, by which I mean a figure made of balsa wood or Lego. 'What vitality “Fifty Shades of Grey” possesses belongs to Ms. Johnson, who is a champion lip-biter and no slouch at blushing, eye-rolling and trembling on the verge of tears.' However Scott says that there is something to be said for the film in that there is a shared enjoyment of its viewing, however awful it may be. He said: '“Fifty Shades of Grey” might not be a good movie — O.K., it’s a terrible movie — but it might nonetheless be a movie that feels good to see, whether you squirm or giggle or roll your eyes or just sit still and take your punishment.' Sam Taylor-Johnson has revealed that she doesn't read the criticism saying: 'I don't read anything. It's a golden rule to live by I think. 'Otherwise if you read all the good things and then one bad thing it's the one bad thing that you will remember and it haunts you so it's better to not read anything. 'But people do keep telling me little bits and I'm like, ""shhh,' I don't need to hear.'","Sam Taylor-Johnson movie premiered in Berlin last night .

"Britain faces its first dose of deflation for more than 50 years, the Bank of England declared yesterday. In a boost to family finances in the run-up to the general election, Governor Mark Carney said prices generally would probably fall in the coming months as the cost of essentials such as petrol and food come down. Inflation has already fallen to 0.5 per cent following an oil price slump from $115 a barrel last summer to below $60 last night. Mark Carney has said inflation rates could turn negative in 2015 . Mr Carney said the falling oil price was ‘unambiguously good’ for the economy, adding: ‘It is more likely than not that headline inflation will turn negative at some point in the spring and will remain subdued for much of the rest of the year.’ An inflation rate below 0 per cent marks the onset of deflation, when the price of goods and services across the board falls. If prices do drop, then rising wages and the first bout of deflation since 1960 will push household incomes up at the fastest rate for more than a decade, according to the Bank. It also opens the door to a further cut in interest rates, a move all but ruled out by the Bank until now. David Cameron and George Osborne will hope that the feel-good factor generated by the boost to family budgets will translate into votes on polling day in May. However, Mr Carney said that if falling prices become ‘self-fulfilling’ – and risk triggering a dangerous bout of the deflation seen in Japan – then interest rates could once again be cut. This would make mortgages even more affordable for borrowers already benefiting from some of the cheapest home loans in history. But it would be a blow to savers, who have lost out since rates hit a record low of 0.5 per cent in March 2009. The 0.5 per cent interest rates are already an historic low after soaring to 17 per cent in the 1980s . Mr Carney said if the Bank needed to tackle deflation, its monetary policy committee could cut interest rates and add to the £375billion of emergency funds it has already printed through quantitative easing. But he warned: ‘Negative inflation rates are unlikely to endure for very long. It is pretty clear that the most likely next move is an increase in interest rates.’ As he published the Bank’s forecasts in its quarterly inflation report, Mr Carney said any rate rise would be ‘limited and gradual’. Investors do not expect the first rate rise since 2007 to come until April 2016. Rates are not forecast to reach 1.5 per cent until 2019. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne (right) will be hoping the feel-good factor generated by the boost to family budgets will translate into votes on polling day in May . Mr Carney said the prospect of a temporary dose of deflation ‘masks stronger underlying dynamics’ in the UK. The Bank estimated the economy grew by 3.1 per cent in 2014 – stronger than the 2.6 per cent rise reported by the Office for National Statistics and the best performance since 2003. It predicted growth of 2.9 per cent till the end of 2016. Incomes after tax are expected to grow by 3.5 per cent this year – the best performance since 2001 – leaving families feeling richer. Mr Carney said: ‘The combination of rising wages and falling energy and food prices will help household finances and boost the growth of real take-home pay this year.’ But a feel-good factor ahead of the election could hit Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has railed against a ‘cost of living crisis’. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Mark Carney said inflation 'likely' to turn negative within months .
As a result rates could be cut from the current record low of just 0.5% .

"A father of twins from Canada, both in desperate need of life-saving organ transplants, has undergone an operation to donate a portion of his liver to one of his 3-year-old daughters. Michael Wagner, from Ontario, recently found out he is a match to his adopted three-year-old girls, Binh and Phuoc, but was told he can only save one of them after a transplant, forcing him to make a heart-wrenching choice. He and his wife Johanne, brought the sisters to Canada from Vietnam when they were just 18 months old after seeing they were in poor health at an orphanage. Recovering: Phuoc Wagner, 3, is pictured post-surgery in Toronto Tuesday after receiving a liver transplant from her adoptive father . Phuoc was listed in fair condition in the intensive care unit at SickKids hospital after the operation . Nervous but excited: The 3-year-old patient is pictured here smiling right before the surgery . Both of them suffer from Alagille syndrome - a genetic disorder that affects the liver, heart and other organs. Their liver functions are slowly coming to a halt - meaning a transplant could potentially save their lives. On Tuesday, it took medical teams at Toronto General Hospital and The Hospital for Sick Children 13 hours to remove a part of Mr Wagner's liver and then transplant it into his daughter Phuoc's body. The father of nine was listed in good condition post-surgery. His 3-year-old was said to be in fair condition in the intensive care unit at SickKids hospital. According to an update posted Tuesday on a Facebook page documenting the family's quest for liver transplants for their girls, little Phuoc's new liver 'looks great,' and that the pint-size patient looks better than expected. Father's love: Michael Wagner, Phuoc's dad, was heart-broken that he could only donate a part of his liver to one of his twin daughters, both of whom were in need of transplants . Ailing: Binh and Phuoc Wagner (pictured) both suffer from the genetic disorder Alagille syndrome . Johanne Wagner, the twins' adoptive mother, thanked her husband for giving their little girl the best gift a father could ever give. ‘I could not have asked for a better way to end this long day. I am the luckiest,’ Mrs Wagner wrote. She also shared that when her husband woke up in the recovery room, he joked that ‘someone had stolen a piece of his liver.’ On a more serious note, Johanne Wagner reminded their supporters that they are still waiting for a new liver for Binh. Toronto General Hospital has received more than 400 responses so far to the Wagners' appeal for a living liver donor . The hospital is now in the process of sifting through the responses in search of a potential match. Grateful: Johanne Wagner, the twins' adoptive mother, thanked her husband for acting as an organ donor for their little girl . Waiting game: The family are still waiting for a new liver for three-year-old Binh . Impossible choice: Michael Wagner said it's been hard for him to accept that he could only help one of his girls . Johanne Wager told the Globe and Mail that she was waiting to be tested as a potential donor for her daughter. In the run-up to the surgery, Michael Wagner said it's been hard for him to accept that he could only help one of his girls. 'The cruel part of the liver is that you can only do it once,' he told the site Yahoo Canada. The Wagners said the girls’ doctor was the one who ultimately decided that Phuoc would get her father’s liver based on medical necessity. Gary Levy, who runs the liver donor program at the Toronto General Hospital, told The Canadian Press vial Global News that donors can give up to 70 per cent of their liver, which will regrow to its full size, but it can only be done once. The Wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phouc in. Mrs Wagner said: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really. Heart-wrenching choice: Michael Wagner recently found out that his liver is a match to his sick three-year-old twin daughters Binh and Phuoc . Taken in: Mr Wagner and his wife Johanne adopted when they were 18 months old after seeing they were in poor health at a Vietnamese orphanage . 'They were 9 pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.' Despite the health problems, Mrs Wagner does not regret her decision. She said: 'We look back and we have no regrets. 'We would travel this path all over again. They have taught us openness, they have taught our children sharing and openness. It's been nothing but a wonderful mess.'","Michael Wagner found out he is a match to daughters Binh and Phuoc .

"The Duchess of Cornwall stopped to pose for a selfie with a 13-year-old boy during a tour of an arthritis centre in London today. Danny Roberts, from Maida Vale, is currently being treated for the illness but was delighted when he received a bedside visit from Camilla. Speaking afterwards, the teenager said the Duchess had been 'really concerned' and added that it was 'very nice of her' to come and visit. And smile! Camilla poses for a photo with 13-year-old arthritis sufferer Danny Roberts from Maida Vale . 'It was fantastic to meet the Duchess of Cornwall,' he said. 'She was really interested in why I’m at University College Hospital and wanted to find out more about how I’m being treated. 'It was really nice of her to come and see us and be so concerned.' The Arthritis UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology is the first in the world to be dedicated to understanding how and why arthritis affects teenagers. During the visit, the Duchess was shown immune cells in a microscope, which were there as part of a project working out how puberty and stress can affect the immune system. Speaking after the visit, Dr. Liam O’Toole, CEO of Arthritis Research UK said that the findings being made at the centre are helping to improve the wellbeing of arthritic teens across the country. 'Having arthritis at any time in your life is difficult but having arthritis as a teenager is particularly challenging,' he said. Enjoying the tour: Camilla was shown around the Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology . Important work: The Duchess of Cornwall was shown some immune cells under a microscope . 'The daily pain can have a massive impact on a young person’s appearance, social life and education. 'The research at the centre is focused on improving the health and wellbeing of these young people living with arthritis and other rheumatic diseases . 'We were thrilled that we were able to showcase examples of our research at the Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology to the Duchess of Cornwall. 'Her Royal Highness was shown research looking at how puberty and stress can impact a teenager’s immune system, as well as practical technological solutions being developed to help young people better manage their condition.' The visit came hot on the heels of a trip to a school, where Camilla told a class of children that they were being 'very brave' as they read a scene from Shakespeare's As You Like It in front of her. Big job: The centre is dedicated to improving the wellbeing of young arthritis sufferers . Impressed: The Duchess was left impressed by the literary efforts of the children at Holland Park School . The Duchess, who was on elegant form in a tailored black jacket and a flared grey skirt, was visiting Holland Park School in West London to present a creative writing prize to one of the children. Mukahang Limbu, who received a certificate from the Duchess, had taken part in a competition run by charity First Story, of which Camilla is patron. The charity aims to inspire more children to write by sending authors into schools, among them Scottish writer Kate Clanchy, who was at the school when the Duchess arrived. Touring the school, Camilla was shown into several classes, including Latin, History, English and one of the science labs. While in the English lesson, she chatted to 14-year-old Annise Afflick from Fulham who showed the Duchess a monologue she had written based on Shakespeare's As You Like It. After hearing the class read some of the play, Camilla smiled and said: 'I'm very impressed by you all; you're very brave to read it all out loud! There's real talent here.' All smiles: The Duchess was on typically elegant form in a tailored black jacket and silk scarf . Meeting the public: The Duchess was welcomed by a line of smiling children - and their delighted headmaster . Are these for me? A delighted Camilla was presented with a pretty bunch of flowers by the children . Later, while presenting Mukahang Limbu with his prize during a specially convened assemby, the Duchess spoke of her hope that a literary talent of the future would be found in the school. 'I hope that looking at all of you here today there may be sitting amongst you some of the great writers of the future,' she said. The Duchess of Cornwall is in the middle of a busy schedule of engagements and spent yesterday afternoon meeting men from the 4 Rifles and their families, before continuing on to a gala dinner thrown by the National Literacy Trust. Camilla, who who has been Patron of the National Literacy Trust since 2010, was greeted by Dame Julia Cleverdon, Chair of the National Literacy Trust and spent time chatting with the charity’s author ambassadors.

"Much like Sam from the Dr. Seuss book, 'Green Eggs and Ham,' American kids were met with both delight and disgust when served typical breakfasts from around the world which to them seemed utterly foreign. 'It tastes like cow poop!' said one young boy when tasting coffee from Brazil as part of the gustatory experiment from website KitchenBowl.com . Video of the American youngsters trying foods from Korea, Brazil, Finland, Vietnam, Poland and the Netherlands has nearly half a million views on YouTube since being posted yesterday. Korea: The American kids were less than thrilled when offered this Korean breakfast of anchovies, kimchee, and eggs though they dared to try it anyway . Gross!: This American kid grimaced as he tried the breakfast typically served to kids in Korea . The first breakfast the American children tried was from Korea and consisted of kimchee (pickled cabbage), anchovies, egg, and other spicy foods, . 'There's a dead fish in it,' said one of the boys as he proceeded trying the dish with caution. The others seemed to have a bit of trouble gulping down the savory tastes as well. When trying food from Brazil they were given coffee, ham, bread, and banana. 'I think it's weird that kids in Brazil drink coffee' said one of the American participants who was as shocked as 'cow poop' kid that the typically adult drink was an item on the menu. The children had no trouble munching on the banana part of the meal which may have been the most recognizable element on the breakfast table. You want me to drink what?: This American likened coffee as part of this Brazilian breakfast to 'cow poop' but didn't mind the bread, ham, and banana it was also served with . Next the adventurers were asked to try food from Finland which was characterized by a bowl of raspberries along with salmon and onion on a piece of bread. 'No I would not eat fish for breakfast,' said one girl who was presented with the common dish of Finland. 'This is pretty soft that could be my pillow,' said the spunky young boy of the bread, salmon, and onion creation. One of the American kids was fond of the meal but wasn't quite sure where it came from. 'I actually would eat this for breakfast,' he said. When asked where he thought the food might come from he replied, 'Africa.' I'd eat it: This kid said he liked the salmon, onion, bread and raspberry breakfast from Finland but guessed that the meal actually came from Africa . Another American girl who tried the fish breakfast had trouble placing a geographic origin. 'What's Finland,' she asked? 'A country in Europe,' replied one of the adults serving her the food. The young Americans were then served a very old egg called a Century Egg in a breakfast menu from Vietnam. 'So it kind of has liked a portable toilet smell and a rotten egg smell,' said one boy when describing the Vietnamese food. Vietnam: One American youngster said that the extremely old Centry Egg from Vietnam smelled like portable toilet and also rotten egg . Not pleased: This American child had trouble sniffing and stomaching this breakfast from Vietnam . 'This is really good,' said another. The egg, sausage, potato, and apple, breakfast from Poland proved to be a hit with the American kids. 'This tastes like French fries and French fries are good,' said one kid. The other kids stuffed their faces until they couldn't take eating any more food. Poland: This American's eyes were bigger than his stomach when he was served the Polish breakfast of eggs, sausage, apple, and potato . The final breakfast from the Netherlands which was Hagelslag (chocolate sprinkles) on toast, proved to be the biggest hit. 'I don't think my friends would eat this for breakfast because their mom's would say it would be too unhealthy,' said one child. 'This is great,' said another girl as she voraciously scarfed down the toast leaving chocolate smudges all over her face. While some of the foods may have differed from the egg and cereal breakfast common to American children, chocolate sprinkle toast may be popular with kids in America and many countries across the globe. Disbelief: This American said he didn't think he or his friends would be allowed to eat the chocolate dish at home for fear that it would be 'too unhealthy' Netherlands:: The kids unanimously enjoyed the Hagelsag (chocolate sprinkles) toast from the Netherlands and were sent into a chocolate stupor .","'It tastes like cow poop!' said one young boy when tasting coffee from Brazil as part of the gustatory experiment from website KitchenBowl.com .

"Seven years after becoming infamous across Australia for trashing his parent's house after holding an epic party - Corey Worthington has re-emerged displaying a massive tattoo across his neck and claiming he has turned his life around. When he was just 16 years old Corey posted an invite on his MySpace site and 500 people turned up to his suburban home in southeast Melbourne in January 2008 while his parents were on holiday. The carnage that inevitably ensued attracted police helicopters and the dog squad to his family home in Narre Warren - not to mention huge amounts of media attention. Ironically seven years on, Corey now has a beautiful new home of his own but will never forget the good times as a careless and unrepentant teenager. Scroll down for video . Corey Worthington has re-emerged displaying a massive tattoo across his neck and claiming he has turned his life around after trashing his parents from holding an epic party . Corey was renowned for his belligerence about the debacle while sporting his trademark bright yellow hair and sunnies at the time . Ironically seven years on, Corey now has a beautiful new home of his own but will never forget the good times as a careless and unrepentant teenager . Renowned for his belligerent lack of contrition about the debacle while sporting his trademark bright yellow hair and sunnies, Corey goes head to head for a second time with A Current Affair host Leila McKinnon who famously told the bold teenager 'to take a good hard look at yourself' after the crazy incident. 'I took the ride and just enjoyed it really, he says on A Current Affair airing on Thursday night. 'I will never let it go. I was 16, had fun and yeah always will have the yellow sunnies close to heart.' Although he admits he endured a tumultuous ride, Corey relished in the media spotlight all the same. 'Yes there was a lot of up and down times with it all, but like I said 16 turning 17 it was a lot of fun I guess for someone that age,' he says. 'Getting cameras thrown at your face, money left right and centre, it was yeah a big enjoyment, I sort of just took the ride and just enjoyed it really.' A Current Affair host Leila McKinnon (left) famously told the bold teenager 'to take a good hard look at yourself' after the crazy incident . Corey, who is now covered in tattoos, says he kicked back and enjoyed the crazy ride at the time . 'Getting cameras thrown at your face, money left right and centre' was a 'big enjoyment' for Corey . Despite being called many names right across the world, Corey received numerous job offers including thousands of dollars to organise more teen parties. The mayhem included out-of-control and intoxicated kids throwing glass and bricks, breaking letterboxes, shouting obscenities and even damaging police cars. Mortified neighbours couldn't believe what was happening on their quiet suburban street with one comparing the noise that of a football crowd, adding that people were jumping on cars. 'Just hundreds of kids, big groups, large groups coming up and down the street and they were basically throwing bottles, smashing things, picking bricks up and smacking them against the lamp-posts,' said another to the ABC at the time. But the drama didn't end there as a few weeks later Corey's mother, Joanne Delaney, was fined $500 for trying to prevent police for arresting her son the following month after the party. Ms Delaney was reported at inviting the officers into her home but stopped them from going through a doorway. The mother-of-three, who was understood to be stressed at the time about her son's behaviour, was placed on a good behaviour bond and fined $500 for pushing a police officer in the chest. Corey's notoriety got him a gig on Big Brother four months after the massive party (pictured being interviewed by Kyle and Jackie O) 'I will never let it go. I was 16, had fun and yeah always will have the yellow sunnies close to heart' Corey says .

"The Utah mother who allegedly killed six of her newborn babies before stashing their bodies in her garage has pleaded guilty to six counts of murder. Megan Huntsman, 39, appeared in court in Provo on Thursday and faces between five years and life in prison for each murder when she is sentenced on April 20. In exchange for the guilty pleas, prosecutors said they will recommend that her sentences run concurrently - but the Utah County Attorney's Office still expects she will spend the rest of her life behind bars, the Deseret News reported. Prosecutors had called it a unique case in both its heinousness and in the number of victims. Scroll down for videos . In court: Megan Huntsman, 39, is pictured in court in Provo on Thursday as she pleaded guilty to murder . Distraught: She stayed largely silent in the court apart from to enter the six guilty pleas for killing her babies . The deaths sent shockwaves through the quiet, mostly Mormon community where Huntsman stored the tiny bodies for more than a decade after strangling the newborns. Her estranged husband, Darren West, made the grisly discovery in April 2014 while he cleaned out a garage in the home they had shared in Pleasant Grove, just south of Salt Lake City. He called police to report finding a dead infant in a small white box covered with electrician's tape, and they ultimately found six other bodies. Authorities say the seventh child had been a stillborn. Huntsman told police she either strangled or suffocated the babies immediately after they were born. She wrapped their bodies in a towel or a shirt, put them in plastic bags and then packed them inside boxes in the garage. Police say Huntsman killed the babies over a 10-year period from 1996 to 2006, during a period of her life when she told investigators she was addicted to methamphetamine and didn't want to care for the babies. Scene: Her estranged husband found one of the babies' bodies while cleaning out the garage at her Pleasent Grove, Utah home, pictured, in April last year. He called police, who found six more, including a stillborn . Search: Authorities investigate the crime scene after the bodies of seven babies were found in the garage . DNA results have revealed that all seven newborns were full term and that West was the biological father of the infants. West lived with her during the decade the babies were killed, but he is not considered a suspect in their deaths. West discovered the bodies shortly after he was released from federal prison where he spent more than eight years after pleading guilty to meth charges. In her few brief court appearances, Huntsman has said very little. The day the babies were found, Huntsman told police that were eight or nine dead babies in her home, search warrant affidavit show. But police later concluded Huntsman was confused and was taking a ballpark guess. Discovery: Hunstman, left, was arrested after her estranged husband Darren West, right, found the bodies in her garage.

"A guest attending a gipsy wedding was shot dead and a second man was injured outside the church during fighting before the ceremony. Barney McGinley died in hospital from his injuries after the shooting yesterday outside St Mary’s Catholic Church in the rural village of Newtownbutler in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. Parish priest Father Michael King - who was inside the church when the shooting happened - has described how he pleaded for the fighting to stop, while the bride was at the back of the church. Scroll down for video . Dramatic day: The bride and members of the wedding party leave St Mary’s Catholic Church in the rural village of Newtownbutler in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, after the service yesterday afternoon . Police at the scene: The priest said there had been an 'altercation' in the car park long before the bride arrived . Father King said there had been an ‘altercation’ in the car park long before the bride arrived, and then a ‘group of women took one side and a group of women took another side’. He told The Irish Times journalist Gerry Moriarty: ‘The women were basically trying to get the men to stop fighting. I pleaded with them to stop and they did, but then it started again.’ Father King added: ‘The bride was standing at the back of the church waiting to come up the aisle, and the next thing there was a bit of commotion at the back of the church. ‘Several women ran in and said “there are shots, there are shots, there is somebody shooting”.’ The priest told how he went outside yesterday lunchtime and saw some men gathered around the injured pair. The police and the ambulance service were then called and the wedding went ahead. Probe: Forensics officers searched for clues last night around the grounds of St Mary's Catholic Church . Investigation: Politicians told of a 'significant onus on police to ensure that these criminals are caught' Father King said the wedding party had asked him for the service to take place as planned. The priest explained: ‘They said “father, we would like you to proceed with the wedding”, so I proceeded with the wedding. 'They spent at least half an hour inside the church at the end taking photographs.’ The priest said he was ‘really shocked’ to hear of the injured man’s death later on yesterday. There were unconfirmed reports last night that a ‘jealous lover’ went on the shooting spree targeting a man present at the church. Mr McGinley was in his mid-60s and lived in Longford but was originally from Athlone, County Westmeath. He was flown to hospital in a police helicopter but later died from his injuries. Carry on: Father Michael King said the wedding party had asked him for the service to take place as planned . Location: Concern has been raised that the incident yesterday happened 'next door to a primary school' The other victim, in his 30s, did not suffer life-threatening injuries after the incident. A third man is understood to have sustained a knife wound to his hand. Sinn Féin councillor Thomas O’Reilly told the Irish Daily Mail that there were rumours in the town that a ‘jealous lover’ turned up at the church but he ended up missing his intended target and shooting two other men instead. He added: ‘Everyone in the community is shocked. My condolences to the dead man’s family and all injured but this happened next door to a primary school, this is of huge concern. ‘People are arriving home from work this evening and no-one can believe what has happened. Apparently the bride was still in the church when the shooting took place,’ added Mr O’Reilly. Possible explanation: There were unconfirmed reports that a ‘jealous lover’ went on the shooting spree . Transport: After the shooting, the victims were driven to a police station in nearby Lisnaskea in a white van . The councillor said that St Mary’s primary school is adjacent to the church and its playground overlooks the scene. ‘This is a small, close-knit community and village here at Newtownbutler. No-one can believe that something like this could happen,’ he remarked. The wedding party and guests travelled from Longford and Dublin in the Republic of Ireland. Assembly member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Tom Elliott said the attack was ‘horrific’. ‘It is very worrying that certain people have access to firearms and are willing to use them for any reason,’ he said. ‘There is a significant onus on police to ensure that these criminals are caught and that the courts ensure they are locked up for a long period.’","Barney McGinley died in hospital after shooting in Northern Ireland .

"This is the moment two 'remorseful' thugs laughed and punched the air with joy after being spared prison for beating a man unconscious. Corey Savory and Thomas Vernon were let off with suspended jail sentences by a judge who had heard they were full of remorse for the unprovoked late night assault. The pair, both 23, were sombre in the dock during their sentencing hearing and Savory appeared to be in tears at times. However, the North Yorkshire men showed no signs of being sorry for their actions as they gave two thumbs up  and celebrated wildly on the steps of Teesside Crown Court after the hearing. Corey Savory (left) and Thomas Vernon (right) appeared delighted as they left Teesside Crown Court after being handed suspended jail sentences for the 'ferocious and unprovoked' assault on the unsuspecting man . The pair, both 23, were each handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months with supervision and ordered to pay £100 compensation after the judge said they showed 'genuine remorse' The pair were each handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months with supervision, and ordered to pay £100 compensation to the victim after the judge said they showed 'genuine remorse' for the attack on March 30 last year. The court heard how the pair targeted the victim, who was unknown to them, as he smoked and waited for a friend outside a pub on Redcar high street. The victim was struck in the face before the pair ran off towards Savory's home, which was also in the high street. The victim followed and repeatedly kicked the door, the court heard. Jenny Haigh, prosecuting, said the victim was shocked, upset and angry at being attacked and wanted to know why he was hit and threatened. Just seconds later, at about 11.30pm, a third unknown man came up behind the victim and hit him, knocking him to the ground. Savory and Vernon then attacked him, kicking him in the head until he lost consciousness, the court was told. Ms Haigh said Savory kicked the victim's torso and both men punched him repeatedly. The victim suffered a two-inch cut to his forehead, which needed stitches and left a permanent scar – which he described as a 'constant reminder' of the attack. He said the assault contributed to him losing his job and he feared being attacked again. As the court was shown CCTV footage of the assault yesterday, Savory put his head in his hands and refused to watch the video. Both Vernon and Savory admitted assault causing actual bodily harm, but they both denied kicking the victim. The court heard how the two men attacked the victim in Redcar high street on March 30 last year. They admitted actual bodily harm at Teesside Crown Court and hitting the victim, but denied kicking the man . Defence advocates described their behaviour as unacceptable, reprehensible and 'utterly inappropriate'. Graham Brown, defending Vernon, said he called police in a 'Mexican stand-off' which escalated when the 'random third party' struck the victim. He said the two men took advantage of the situation in a joint assault which lasted 30 seconds. He added that Vernon was a single man who was 'petrified' by the court process and said prison would have a 'lifelong impact' on him. Uzma Khan, defending Savory, said: 'They were provoked into reacting and defending their property. 'That went too far and it was perhaps opportunistic when the victim was lying on the floor. They never set out to cause any injury.' She said Savory never wanted trouble, tried to defuse the situation and did not expect it to go beyond verbal abuse. The two men were handed eight-month jail terms, suspended for 18 months with supervision, when they appeared at Teesside Crown Court (pictured). The judge described the attack 'ferocious' and 'unprovoked' The court heard how Savory claimed the victim made comments to him in the pub earlier in the evening and became the 'aggressor' when the pair retreated to the house. He was said to be 'utterly remorseful' and willing to consider restorative justice with a direct apology. He also suffered from depression and there was a risk of self-harm and suicide, the court heard. The judge, Recorder Sarah Mallett, did not accept that the victim was the aggressor. She told the pair: 'You could simply have returned to your home, shut the door and stayed there. 'You could and should have retreated back inside. But you didn't do that. 'This was a ferocious attack by two men who had the advantage of having their victim put on the ground for them by a third party. 'He was already on the floor and he wasn't doing anything provocative. They are nasty injuries.'","Corey Savory and Thomas Vernon attacked man until he was unconscious .

"It was the first day of New York Fashion Week and the debut of Kanye West's collaboration with Adidas. But the rapper had without a doubt the most star-studded front row of the shows so far, with the likes of Beyonce, Jay Z, Justin Bieber, Rihanna and of course, his wife Kim Kardashian sitting pride of place. Reality star Kim was happily wedged in between her new BFF Beyonce and US Vogue editor Anna Wintour. Scroll down for video . In the front row: KimKardashian  was flanked on both sides by Beyonce and Anna Wintour as little North sat in her lap at Kanye West's collaborative debut with Adidas at New York Fashion Week on Thursday . His biggest fans: Kim  took 20-month-old North to see Kanye's NYFW debut . The 34-year-old had brought along daughter North, but the toddler apparently grew upset ahead of the show and was taken backstage. Her youngest sister Kylie Jenner, 17, was among the models who featured in the presentation, while pro Kendall watched from the sidelines. Kim, who told the latest issue of LOVE magazine that Kanye encourages her to 'dress sexier', did just that for the occasion in a camouflage mini-skirt and jacket. Star-studded turnout: Jay Z, Beyonce, Wintoour, Hailey Baldwin, and Russell Simmons sat with Kim in the front row for the show . They even managed a rare smile: The family posed for a photo with a surprisingly cheerful Anna Wintour . The crowd kept on growing: P Diddy was also in attendance, sitting next to Jay Z . Crowd pleaser: The stars in attendance applauded the show . Kim teamed the thigh-skimming skirt and bulky coat with a tight brown top and stockings tucked into boots. The 34-year-old left her raven locks loose and went for her signature make-up, featuring mauve lipstick, strong eyebrows and lashings of mascara. She cradled little North in her arms, and the youngster looked adorable in a brown knitted jumper, black jeans and boots. Dropping in: The happy couple posed with pop sensation Rihanna, who Kanye just collaborated with on FourFive Seconds . Kim's camoflage jacket . Get army chic!

"A 24-year-old nursing student charged with planning a terror attack on a Sydney police station had once tried to join the Australian army out of love for the country. However, Omar Al-Kutobi's father Ahmad told Fairfax that his son's application was rejected two years ago, adding that only six months ago the Iraqi born refugee admitted he was frustrated with the nation he called home. 'He told me ""life in Australia is so hard"". I told him, ""You don't remember when you said Australia is the best country in the world?"",' Ahmad recalled from his home in Germany. 'Yes, but it is changing,' he said was his son's response. Scroll down for video . Omar Al-Kutobi's father has revealed that he spoke to his son, who was lonely in Australia, just hours before he was arrestedand charged with plotting an 'imminent' terror attack on Sydney . Al-Kutobi and his housemate Mohammad Kiad, 25, appeared in court on Thursday two days after they were arrested at their granny flat home in Fairfield, where police allegedly found a machete, a hunting knife, and a video in which they appeared in front of an Islamic State flag and one of them made violent threats. They were detained just after Al-Kutobi bought a hunting knife from military and camping supplies store and only hours before their alleged plan to attack police officers was due to take place, according to Channel Nine. Neither were on security watch-lists and both entered Australia as refugees. Fairfax has reported that Al-Kutobi entered the country on a false passport in 2009 before being granted an Australian citizenship in 2013. Kiad, whose Facebook page states that he has been married since 2010, received a family and spousal visa in 2012 after leaving Kuwait, shortly before separating from his wife. Pictured are the two men who were charged with plotting an 'imminent' terror attack in Sydney: Mohammad Kiad (left),25, and Omar al-Kutobi (right), 24 . 'If they had managed to hurt someone I would have felt guilty for the rest of my life, because I brought this man to Australia,' his wife, who preferred to remain anonymous, told Channel 10. It comes after Ahmad revealed his son had grown lonely in Australia and said that he'd spoken to him just hours before his arrest. 'He told me he [was] working as a truck driver and asked me about his mother. That is all. Everything was OK,' Ahmad, told Fairfax. He said his son was struggling to find a balance between his work as a removalist and his studies and revealed that he had begun a nursing degree after struggling to find work in IT. Mohammad Kiad, 25, and Omar al-Kutobi, 24, lived together in this granny flat in Sydney's west . During police raids at the property on Tuesday it's alleged a machete, a hunting knife, and a video featuring one of the men making threats were found . 'He told [me] many times to come to him because he is alone,' Ahmad said. The men's neighbours  said Al-Kutobi and Kaid had begun acting differently after the anti-terror raids in western Sydney last September . 'He [Al-Kutobi] began wearing a scarf, just like ISIS and Mohammad, he grew a long beard,' neighbour Michael David said. 'I heard them praying in there [the granny flat] and reading the Koran,' said Mr David, who speaks Arabic. Photos from inside the flat where Mohammad Kiad, 25, and Omar al-Kutobi, 24, lived shows their home in a mess after it was raided by counter-terror police on Tuesday . A neighbour said both men rarely cooked - sometimes a barbecue - and ordered in pizza or Chinese and went out to meet friends or go to the mosque . Kiad has reportedly lived in the flat for a year and al-Kutobi for up to three years . Police will allege the men were plotting to carry out an attack on Tuesday and had armed themselves with a machete and a hunting knife and made a video detailing their plans. An image of the pair smoking shisha together - obtained from 25-year-old Kiad's Facebook page - was uploaded in July, 2013. Neighbour Deresita Heisele-Brown said Omar al-utobi was friendlier than Mohammed Kiad who was 'shy' but both young men had become more withdrawn over the last month. She said the boys rarely cooked - sometimes a barbecue - and ordered in pizza or Chinese and went out to meet friends or go to the mosque. 'They wore western clothes but sometimes head wear and Mohammed wears long white tunic, maybe for the mosque.' She said both men went to Centrelink but were often short of money and couldn't pay rent to the owner of the house, Mr Huynh, who has a large property with a granny flat in which the two men lived, Kiad for a year and al-Kutobi for up to three years. Kiad  worked as a nurse in Kuwait but could not transfer his skills to Australia and both men had worked as furniture removalists. The Fairfield granny flat of Mohammad Kiad and Omar al-Kutobi . A neighbour said both men went to Centrelink but were often short of money and couldn't pay rent to the owner . Moldy Lebanese bread, boxes of energy cereal, an unused sink full of plastic-ware and barbecue trays and utensils were found inside the home. Inside the squat two bedroom granny flat which the two alleged terrorists tented from their Vietnamese landlord, there are scenes which could depict the squalor of any twenty something bachelors. A picnic table sits out the back by the rubbish bins. A song book is propped on the sink near a toolbox on top of the unnused stove. A box of Arabic green tea has been torn open in the kitchen. An Islamic calendar still hangs on the wall in a back room by a pulled out drawer full of wires and leads. Neighbour Deresita Heisele-Brown said Mohammed Kiad was 'shy' but had become more withdrawn lately . A home-made flag, representing the prescribed terrorist organisation Islamic State, was found at the flat, police said . Outside the scenes from a police raid on a granny flat in Sydney's west, in which two men were arrested and charged with one count of 'do act in preparation/planning for terrorism act' Ms Jeisele-Brown said the pair had fallen out with another neighbour over the last month or two for 'speaking sharp' and that she had been upset with them after finding a religious picture of hers dumped in the rubbish bin. 'I had been in hospital having chemotherapy and when I came back home my picture of Jesus Christ was missing,' she said. 'I found it in the rubbish. I don't know who dumped it but I thought... I didn't say anything.' Ms Heisele-Brown said Omar Al-Kutobi had been talking about going to Germany where his mother lived and had been waiting for his mother to send him money. 'He had no family here, but he said he could never go back to Iraq.' She said she had noticed that after the Martin Place siege, the two men had had lengthy discussions in Arabic and had watched a lot of television, perhaps coverage of the a siege. She said when the police came around to arrest the pair, Mohammad had pretended he didn't speak English. She said detectives had made the men lie on the ground while they handcuffed them. NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn and Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said two men have been arrested on terrorism charges . The defendants, who were housemates at the time of their arrest, have asked for an Arabic interpreter. NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn said in a press conference on Wednesday two men, aged 24 and 25, have been charged with 'acts done in preparation, for, or planning terrorist acts'. 'We will be alleging that the two men were well advanced in their preparations,' Ms Burn said. It will be alleged that the two were going to undertake an act of terrorism in Australia as revenge for incidents overseas. Searches were conducted at their residence, as well as on a car, and where the men work. Crown prosecutor Michael Allnut leaves Fairfield Local Court in Sydney on Wednesday . A machete, a hunting knife and an IS flag were seized along with other items in two terror related arrests . 'We will allege both of these men were preparing to do this attack yesterday... it was imminent and we acted,' Ms Burns said. 'The type of act is consistent with the messaging coming out of IS but we are of the view that there is no further imminent attacks planned.' AFP Deputy Commissioner, Michael Phelan, said the raids and arrests were an example of how authorities are having to be 'nimble to adjust to the threat'. 'We acted as soon as we possibly could,' he said. The raids, titled Operation 'CASTRUM', were led by NSW Police Force's Joint Counter Terrorism Team. NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn revealed details of the alleged terror plot which police foiled on Tuesday .

The homeowner inspected the vehicle through her bedroom window after it veered off the street towards her home in Houston, Texas, just before midnight on Thursday.

"Almost everyone has lost a friend a concert, only to find they either have no phone signal, or it's impossible to describe their exact location in a sea of faces. But now there’s an app that flashes a rainbow of colours to attract the attention of friends separated from a group. Users of the app, called LookFor, simply have to hold their phone in the air to display its full screen turning into pulsing colours. An app called LookFor flashes a rainbow of colours to attract the attention of friends (illustrated) The self-titled ‘world’s dumbest app’ costs 78p (99 cents) on iTunes and Google Play, where comments include: ‘How has no one thought about this before?!’ and ‘So simple, so effective.’ Users have to pick the colour of the light they desire then send their missing friend a message, saying ‘look for a blue flashing light,’ if they have chosen blue as the colour of their digital beacon. They then simply wave their phone, the screen of which has been turned into a flashing coloured light, until they attract their friend’s attention.

Dumb simple.’ It claims the app is the only friend finder that doesn’t rely on GPS, a data connection or any wireless signal, meaning it can be used anywhere, including in underground venues. The app is fully functional, but having raised over $1,500 (£1,000) on the crowd funding site in May last year, Retroproof had vowed to add ‘location-based push notifications, iBeacons and a slew of other great technologies’. The app works on iPhones running iOS 5 and newer and Android handsets running Gingerbread and newer. The firm says it should also work on Windows Phone and Blackberry 10 and newer – and takes up around 3MB of space.

"Disgraced former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn referred to women as 'material' as he arranged to meet them for orgies at a 'secret' Paris flat, a court heard today. Asked why he needed the apartment just a few miles away from his family home, the 65-year-old said it was to meet political allies and girlfriends, adding: 'It's as simple as that.' The 65-year-old, popularly known as DSK, is facing up to 10 years in prison and a fine of more than £1 million for aggravated pimping. On trial: Dominique Strauss-Kahn leaves his hotel on his way to the Lille courthouse this morning . Accused: Dominique Strauss-Kahn faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of more than £1 million . On his third day in the witness box, Strauss-Kahn continued to defend himself against lurid allegations that he was a 'brutal' pimp who regularly abused the women he paid. He said he regretted the use of the term 'material' in text messages with Fabrice Paszkowski, one of 13 other men on trial with him. Another text message read: 'Absolute discretion a must, but she's a tidy bit of work and very sexy'. DSK, who was married to the art heiress and journalist Anne Sinclair at the time, admitted 'libertine' parties took place at the flat, which he rented in a friend's name, 'but I didn't organise them'. By saying it was Paszkowski organising the girls, DSK was supporting his defence that he had no idea the women were prostitutes. Disgraced: Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn (pictured) referred to women as 'material' as he arranged to meet them for orgies at a 'secret' Paris flat, the court heard today . Yesterday Strauss-Kahn  told a court women 'offering themselves to him' was 'nothing unusual'. 'I was one of the world's most powerful men. Many people wanted to please me. Women have offered themselves to me ten times. It is nothing unusual to me,' he told the courtroom in Lille, northern France. His boast followed claims from a former prostitute that the former IMF chief paid her £1,500 to fly to the organisation's Washington HQ with him. The judge asked the woman, referred to only as Jade, why she had agreed to the trip  in January 2010. She replied: 'For 2,000 euros! I am not going to say no. I love travelling. I had never seen Washington.' She said she was delighted to have posed for a picture with DSK in the IMF office. On his third day in the witness box, Strauss-Kahn (pictured wearing red tie) continued to defend himself against lurid allegations that he was a 'brutal' pimp who regularly abused the women he paid . Prostitution is not illegal in France, but procuring women for sex is, and Strauss Kahn has three days in the witness box to offer his side of the story. He denies all the charges. The case is known as 'The Carlton Affair', after the luxury hotel in Lille where prostitutes were meant to have been coordinated. DSK admits attending the sex parties, but insists he was too preoccupied with his work at the IMF to consider paying the women involved. He was also considering running for the position of French President, and had problems at the time with his now divorced wife, Ms Anne Sinclair, he claims. The case continues . Half-way through his three-week trial for aggravated pimping, Strauss-Kahn has been forced under days of questioning to explicitly detail his history of, in his own words, his 'libertine' sexual practices. While much of the courtroom testimony is raunchy, here is a PG-selection of some of the attention-grabbing testimony so far: . 'It was a slaughterhouse. They were lying on the mattress in all directions. It was a rather degrading scene. 'I didn't know whether these people had showered. I didn't want any part of it.' Ex-prostitute known as 'Jade' testifying about a 2009 orgy with Strauss-Kahn at a Belgian sex club . A court sketch shows former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn testifying at a Lille court during his trial . 'That's him, but with his clothes on.' 'Jade' testifying about how she only realised Strauss-Kahn's identity after she saw him on television sometime after one of his orgies. 'We met 12 times in four years. It wasn't the frenetic, unbridled activity that the investigating magistrates' report makes out. 'At the time, I mention without pretension, I had other things to do.' Strauss-Kahn in response to questioning over the frequency of his orgies during the period in which he is accused of organizing a prostitution ring. 'What can I say? It's nothing to be proud of, but there have been 10 times that I've found myself in a situation where a woman threw herself at me.' Strauss-Kahn in response to questioning about why he didn't suspect the women he spontaneously had sex with in a restaurant basement were prostitutes. 'I had a very hectic life, with just a few outlets for recreation, and these sessions were part of that.' Strauss-Kahn explaining how the function of IMF chief limited his occasions for sex parties. 'People say that at these soirees, the girls were gifts, but in fact at these parties the gift was Dominique Strauss-Kahn.' Co-defendant Fabrice Paszkowski testifying about the organisation of Strauss-Kahn's orgies. 'That's certainly what some people think, and I believe the IMF saved the world from a crisis that could have been as bad as that of 1929.' Strauss-Kahn responding to a judge's description of him as 'once one of the world's most powerful people.' 'I dare you to distinguish between a prostitute and a naked socialite.' Strauss-Kahn lawyer Henri Leclerc, explaining the difficulty Strauss-Kahn had in identifying his sex partners as prostitutes.","Text messages reveal Dominique Strauss-Kahn called women 'material'

"Security experts are warning healthcare and insurance companies that 2015 will be the 'Year of the Healthcare Hack,' as cybercriminals are increasingly attracted to troves of personal information held by U.S. insurers and hospitals that command high prices on the underground market. Anthem Inc, the No. 2 U.S. health insurer, last week disclosed a massive breach of its database containing nearly 80 million records, prompting investigations by state and federal authorities. That hack followed a breach last year at hospital operator Community Health Systems, which compromised some 4.5 million records. Anthem Inc, the No. 2 U.S. health insurer, last week disclosed a massive breach of its database containing nearly 80 million records, prompting investigations by state and federal authorities - and experts say more are to come . Stolen healthcare data can be used to fraudulently obtain medical services and prescriptions as well as to commit identity theft and other financial crimes, according to security experts. Criminals can also use stolen data to build more convincing profiles of users, boosting the success of scams. 'People feel that this will be the year of medical industry breaches,' said Dave Kennedy, chief executive of TrustedSEC LLC. In the past decade, cybercriminals focused their efforts on attacking banks and retailers to steal financial data including online banking credentials and payment card numbers. But as those companies boost security, using stolen credit card numbers has become more difficult. Their prices on criminal exchanges have also dropped, prompting hackers to turn to the less-secure medical sector, just as the amount of digital healthcare data is growing dramatically, Kennedy said. Stolen healthcare data can be used to fraudulently obtain medical services and prescriptions as well as to commit identity theft and other financial crimes, according to security experts. Criminals can also use stolen data to build more convincing profiles of users, boosting the success of scams. 'All of these factors are making healthcare information more attractive to criminals,' said Rob Sadowski, marketing director at RSA, the security division of EMC Corp. RSA Executive Chairman Art Coviello recently wrote in a letter to customers that he expected well-organized cybercriminals to turn their attention to stealing personal information from healthcare providers. 'A name, address, social and a medical identity ... That's incredibly easy to monetize fairly quickly,' said Bob Gregg, CEO of ID Experts, which sells identity protection software and services. Identities can sell for $20 apiece, or more, he said. Insurers, medical equipment makers and other companies say they have been preparing for breaches after seeing the waves of attacks on other industries. Cigna Corp has looked to financial and defense companies for best practices, including hiring hackers to break into its systems, said Chief Executive David Cordani. Attempts to break into corporate systems to probe for information are a constant, he said in an interview. St Jude Medical Inc CEO Daniel Starks said the company increased investment in cybersecurity significantly over the last few years, to protect both patient data and the medical devices it manufactures. 'You may see from time to time law enforcement briefings on nation-based (intellectual property) issues, espionage,' he said. 'Those are things that we take very seriously and have been briefed on and that we work to guard against.' Stolen healthcare data can be used to fraudulently obtain medical services and prescriptions as well as to commit identity theft and other financial crimes, according to security experts. The FBI is investigating the Anthem breach alongside security experts from FireEye Inc. The insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc and Aetna Inc have warned investors about the risks of cyber crime in their annual reports since 2011. UnitedHealth has said the costs to eliminate or address the threats could be significant and that remediation may not be successful, resulting in lost customers. In response to the Anthem attack, UnitedHealth spokesman Tyler Mason said in an emailed statement: 'We are in close contact with our peers in ... the industry cybersecurity organization, and are monitoring our systems and the situation closely.' Aetna has cited the automated attempts to gain access to public-facing networks, denial of service attacks that seek to disrupt websites, attempted virus infections, phishing and efforts to infect websites with malicious content. Aetna spokeswoman Cynthia Michener said in a statement: 'We closely follow the technical details of every breach that's reported to look for opportunities to continually improve our own IT security program and the health sector's information protection practices broadly.'","Anthem last week disclosed a massive breach of 80 million records, .

"Did Vice President Joe Biden call a former congressman his 'butt buddy' during a speech in Iowa this afternoon? Biden, known for making inappropriate slips of the tongue, appeared on Thursday to refer to a former Iowa lawmaker Neal Smith his 'butt buddy' while making remarks at Drake University. Butt buddy is a term that can mean two close friends who are considered inseparable. But it also has homosexual connotations. Oh, Joe: Vice President Joe Biden, pictured here on Wednesday at a White House event, appeared on Thursday to refer to a former Iowa congressman as his 'butt budy' In video posted to YouTube of the event, the gaffe-prone VP can be heard asking if his 'old butt buddy' Smith was in the crowd. 'Neal, I miss you man,' he added emphatically. 'I miss you.' A fellow Democrat, Smith served in the House while Biden was in the Senate. Smith, 94, is the longest serving member of the House of Representatives in Iowa's history, holding his seat from 1959 to 1995. Despite his self-proclaimed interest in seeking the presidency in 2016, Biden has stayed largely stayed away from media opportunities in the last several months after making a string of embarrassing verbal mistakes while on the campaign trail during the midterm elections. At another Iowa event, this one in September, Biden referred to the former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew as 'the wisest man in the Orient.' That followed an incident the day before in which Biden, while telling a story about money lenders who take advantage of armed service men and women, called the financiers 'Shylocks.' The term Shylock is often associated with a Shakespearean play about greedy Jewish lender of the same name and is considered an anti-Semetic slur. Biden immediately apologized for comment calling it a 'poor choice of words' The VP was at Drake this morning to push the White House's free tuition plan for community college students.","Biden was presumably referring to former Iowa lawmaker Neal Smith while making the remarks at Drake University .

"These are some of the terrifying goods for sale on a new black market website inspired by the Lord of The Rings books. Middle Earth Marketplace, named after the fictional world of the Tolkien novels, exists in the shady underbelly of the internet known as the darknet where criminals use special software and the digital currency Bitcoin to evade law enforcement. Currently on offer are illegal drugs of every type, guns, ammunition as well as a fearsome knuckle duster stun gun that claims to deliver a 950,000 volt punch. Sellers and administrators use names such as Gandalf, Bilbo and Laketown taken from the Lord of The Rings and Hobbit books and the site features images of scenes and characters from the hit films. Shocking: Currently on offer on Middle Earth Market[placer are illegal drugs such as cocaine (pictured) , guns, ammunition as well as a fearsome knuckle duster stun gun that claims to deliver a 950,000 volt punch . Horror: This fearsome knuckle duster stun gun claims to deliver a 950,000 volt punch . Weapon: This second hand 9mm pistol is offered to purchasers anywhere in the world . Middle Earth was set up after the original darknet marketplace Silk Road, dubbed the eBay of drugs, was shut down following a sting operation by the FBI in 2013. Silk Road's creator Ross Ulbricht, who was known online as 'Dread Pirate Roberts', was last week convicted on seven drug and conspiracy charges. Prosecutors said he enabled more than a million drug deals through the site and earned about $18 million in bitcoins. Middle Earth was one of several illegal 'market places' that emerged to fill the void following the closure of Silk Road but its gimmicky use of Lord of the Rings imagery appears to be putting it ahead of its rivals. One item currently up for sale is described as a 'knuckle-blaster stun gun' which is said to be able to incapacitate a person by delivering a 950,000 electric shock with a single touch. It is being sold for 0.222 bitcoins - around £32. A powerful Glock handgun, a type favoured by many police forces, is on sale for just over nine bitcoins - around £1,300 - and comes equipped with two magazines. The seller promises to deliver anywhere in the world. Also on offer is a cheaper American-made Keltec 9mm handgun for 7.27 bitcoins - around £1,060. The seller describes it as 'reliable', claiming it has been test fired to ensure there are 'no issues'.

Information: Illegal instruction manuals on everything from how to hack computers, how to make bombs and how kill somebody without getting caught are for sale on Middle Earth Marketplace . Quantity: This drug dealer based in the Netherlands offers to send 1kg of cocaine anywhere within Europe . Among the hundreds of drug deals on the site was one for a whole kilo of cocaine priced at 154.2 bitcoins (£22,572). Single grams of cocaine were being advertised for 0.36 bitcoins (£53). Meanwhile ten grams of 'Amnesia Haze' cannabis was offered for 0.5839(£85) and five 'Orange Turtle' ecstasy tablets, shipped from the Netherlands were priced at 0.0898 (£13) bitcoins.

Bitcoins were launched in 2008 by the Japanese inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Initially worthless, the currency was still valued at only £1.30 by December 2011. But an explosion in its use saw it peak in November 2013 when a single bitcoin was valued at around £821. Today a bitcoin is worth around £140. Due to this fractions of bitcoins are now used to enable the purchase of cheaper goods with 0.1 bitcoins currently worth approximately £14.

In a recent interview, given anonymously to a darknet news site, one of the administrators boasted that many of the dealers who previously sold their wares on Silk Road have since migrated to Middle Earth. However he adds that unlike Silk Road, Middle Earth draws the line by not offering 'assassination services' - contract killers for hire or child pornography. Pills: Ecstasy tablets are sold in packs of five on the website by a seller based in the Netherlands . Firepower: 9mm ammunition is see for sale of the Middle Earth Marketplace 'dark net' website . Transactions are carried out using the digital currency bitcoin and messages between buyers and sellers are encrypted with ciphers, similar to those used by the Nazis in World War Two, in order to ensure their details can't be traced. Bitcoin is the world's most popular digital currency and while it is perfectly legal to own and use, it is so synonymous with the darknet that following the Silk Road bust in 2013 its value plummeted by 20 per cent. Police forces have been slow to respond to the threats posed by the darknet - but are now setting up specialist units to tackle the problem. In the UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced in December that a team was being set up primarily to hunt down paedophiles using the dark net to share child pornography. And in the US work is underway to create a specialist search engine which can trawl through the darknet and root out illegal websites and their users.","Middle Earth Marketplace sells illegal weapons and drugs of every type .

"Tens of thousands of commuters on San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit system have been warned to be on alert for measles. It comes after an infectious LinkedIn employee took the train during the morning and evening commutes for three days last week. Officials said the patient also dined at E&O Kitchen and Bar, an Asian restaurant in San Francisco, on February 4. Tens of thousands of commuters on San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit system (pictured) have been warned to be on alert for measles after an infectious LinkedIn employee took the train to and from work . The infected person was known to have traveled between the Lafayette station in the East Bay and the Montgomery station in San Francisco during the morning and evening rush-hour commutes on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday last week, BART spokeswoman Alicia Trost said. That ride is 35 minutes long, but health officials said the highly infectious, airborne virus could have remained in the air for up to two hours. Given the BART cars circulate throughout the Bay area, tens of thousands of people could have potentially been exposed, Ms Trost added. The infected rider, a LinkedIn employee who lives in Contra Costa County, also spent time at the E&O Kitchen and Bar last Wednesday evening, potentially exposing others who were in the restaurant between 5.30pm and 7pm, health officials said. Public health officials said they were tracing the movements of the person, who is recovering and not hospitalized, and notifying others known to have had close contact. Officials said the patient also dined at E&O Kitchen and Bar, an Asian restaurant in San Francisco (pictured) Health officials said Wednesday that those without vaccinations who came into contact with the BART commuter are a 'high risk' of coming down with measles. People displaying symptoms are urged to seek medical attention immediately. Symptoms include high fever, runny noses, coughing and watery red eyes and can begin from one to three weeks after exposure. An infected person is contagious for several days before and after the rash appears. Most people recover from measles within a few weeks, although it can be fatal in some cases. Health officials say the risk of vaccinated commuters contracting measles is 'highly unlikely.' People born before 1957 are considered immune. The state Department of Public Health said it does not know how many San Francisco Bay Area residents have measles vaccines. The number of parents declining to vaccinate their children has risen in the region - and the country - in recent years, though the majority is vaccinated. LinkedIn said in a statement it was informed on Tuesday an employee based in its San Francisco office was diagnosed with measles. The employee lives in Contra Costa County . More than 100 people in California and others in several states and Mexico have been infected with measles since an outbreak traced to Disneyland was first reported in December. It is not known how the commuter contracted the disease. 'The measles vaccine is very effective and is a standard part of pediatric primary care,' said Dr. Tomas Aragon, San Francisco Health Officer. 'While we are concerned about the current outbreak in California and its potential to spread, we cannot emphasize enough that the solution is simple and available: be vaccinated.' Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But last year the country had its highest number of measles cases in 20 years. The majority of measles cases have been in California. The CDC has updated its information on the disease's spread and now 18 states are affected .","An infectious worker took Bay Area Rapid Transit system to and from work .

"You know you have to do something about your waistline when it gets so big that you can't even weight yourself anymore. An obese dad has revealed how he shed seven stone in a year after his weight soared past the limit on his scales. At his heaviest, Daniel Boulton, 33, from Swadlincote, Derby, weighed 19 stone and the needle on the scales would rocket past their maximum limit. Father of one Daniel Boulton from Derby lost an incredible seven stone after being shocked to find he could no longer weigh himself on his scales . The manufacturing manager's attitude towards alcohol and junk food saw his weight skyrocket. As well as regular boozy nights out, Daniel relied on processed dinners for his evening meals and would also stuff his face with slice after slice of white bread while waiting for the food to cook. But, after his beautiful daughter Scarlett was born in 2013, he decided to change his diet and eating habits. In just over a year, Daniel shed a gigantic seven stone - over a third of his body weight - and is preparing to run this year's London Marathon. Daniel said that he wanted to lose weight because he didn't want to be the 'fat dad' for his baby daughter Scarlett . A newly-svelte Daniel said: 'When the needle on my scales travelled past it's limit, that was the final straw. 'They topped out at 19 stone and I just couldn't believe I was that fat. Daniel piled on the pounds thanks to a diet of alcohol and unhealthy ready meals . 'I was in complete denial. Looking back at pictures, my clothes didn't fit properly, I was bloated and puffy.' As Daniel worked in a food processing plant, he was surrounded by lovely-smelling but unhealthy ready meals. This led him to constantly crave them, so, despite being brought up on healthy home-cooked meals, coming home at night he would just throw one into the oven. To make matters worse, he would fill the cooking time by eating slices of bread and butter. Daniel said: 'I'd immediately grab a couple just to tide me over. After that, I'd just grab a couple more and then a couple more. 'Then I'd pile my plate high with a massive dinner and scoff that down too. Looking back, I really wasn't kind to my body. I smoked, drank too much and never did any exercise. 'I was constantly tired and exposed my back and knee joints to a lot of pressure from either standing on my feet or driving all day.' Daniel managed to lose five stone from monitoring his calorie and fat intake but as his weight loss stalled, he began to fall back into his own ways and regained all of the weight again. It wasn't until he and his wife Emily welcomed their baby girl Scarlett into the world that Daniel redoubled his efforts to shed the pounds. He said: 'I knew that I had to be there for her in the years to come. I wanted to be able to play and run around with her when the time came. 'I wanted to be able to run up the stairs, without feeling like I had sprinted a 10-second 100 metres, or walk up the hill without losing my breath. 'Diabetes was always in the back of my mind and, quite simply, I didn't want to be her fat dad!' Daniel signed up for the Harcombe Diet for Men after hearing about it on the radio. Daniel is now a keen runner and is planning to run the London Marathon this year . The focus of the three-phase plan is to eat 'real' foods, focusing on meat, fish and vegetables and cutting out fruit and sweet foods in the first phase. These are gradually re-introduced as the diet continues, but no calorie or fat counting is necessary. Daniel said: 'As soon as I heard that I didn't need to just eat fruit, I was in. I followed the book and pre-planned everything, so we could budget for only those things that we needed. 'I stayed on Phase 1 for approximately five months and was losing a stone a month. It just fell off. Emily supported me all the way and would eat everything I ate. 'We ate the same things on the same day for the entire period on Phase 1. I don't think I could have done it without that involvement and support from her. 'It might sound extreme, but now I have so much more confidence in my body image.' Now just over a year after starting the Harcombe diet, Daniel has shed seven stone and regularly runs up to 18km a week in preparation for the London Marathon. Daniel followed the 'workable' Harcombe diet which meant eating a balanced diet . Daniel said: 'I've had a lifelong ambition to run the London Marathon and last year I finally took up running. 'I have never really been a sporty person, but I took to running like a duck to water. Coupled with my better diet, this has helped me keep the weight off. 'I can buy clothes that fit properly and I'm so much more alert to play with Scarlett. I know it's a cliché but I feel like a new man.' Zoë Harcombe, the diet's founder, has researched the characteristics of a 'workable' diet, obesity, eating disorders and food cravings for 20 years. She said: 'Daniel's journey has been fantastic and our other members say his story is a real beacon for them. 'Like all our club members, Daniel has ditched fake foods and just eats real food. 'He hasn't counted a single calorie, point, carb, or starved himself for one or two days a week. 'Daniel's results have been fantastic, and I'll certainly be cheering him on when he finally runs the London Marathon.'","Daniel Boulton from Derby lost seven stone on the Harcombe diet .

"Jodhi Meares' company The Upside has updated their social media the same day the designer's fiance Jon Stevens will front court to respond to an application for an Apprehended Violence Order against him- with a Valentine's Day message for followers. The sports and active-wear brand first posted a Kurt Cobain message reading 'I'd rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I am not' in an apparent reference to Jodhi's situation. A second message,posted an hour later, featured the image of a love letter and a coffee cup, with the caption, 'Valentine's Day is around the corner, did you get your partner what they really want?' Scroll down for video . Calm before the storm: Jodhi Meares and rocker fiance Jon Stevens put up a united front at the David Jones Autumn/Winter launch in Sydney last week. He will face court this week over an AVO application after being accused of assaulting her on Monday . Social media: The brand posted an image of a love letter and a coffee cup,  showing handwritten text . The letter in the image was handwritten and read, 'My love, I know you think roses are romantic, but they wither and die. 'So this year I suggest you'd better spend your money [at] www.theupsidesport.com. 'I'm a medium. Love you!' A second caption on the image reads, 'I'll love whatever you get me... but ideally it'll be THE UPSIDE xo' Message of support? The designer's company posted this quote, which appears to be reference the situation . Day in court: The Sydney socialite and fashion designer faced court in August over drinking driving charges, after she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi in June and recorded a blood alcohol level 0.181. She was banned from driving for 12 months and received a $1,100 fine. No conviction was recorded . Police have confirmed officers arrested a man in his fifties at a Point Piper home in Sydney in the early hours of Monday before charging him with assault. According to Channel Nine, the incident allegedly occurred after the former wife of billionaire James Packer discovered text messages on 53-year-old Jon Stevens' phone. The Daily Telegraph reported the messages were in emails and were from an ex-girlfriend. Jodhi is alleged to have sustained minor injuries on her wrist. Crash: Jodhi collided with three parked cars when she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi on June 21 last year . The New Zealand-born star was released on bail and is reportedly set to appear in Waverley Local Court relating to the incident on Thursday. The Sydney Morning Herald reported police were called to the couple's exclusive Point Piper home after the alleged fight and immediately issued an interim AVO, forbidding the Jezebal hitmaker from going near Jodhi for 28 days. The former INXS rocker was arrested and charged with assault. It is believed the AVO could be dropped. The rocker had been due to play several gigs this week, including Rooty Hill RSL on Friday night and Revesby Workers Club on Saturday night, but the shows have now been cancelled, with concert-goers offered refunds. The assault is the second incident for Jodhi in just eight months after she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi in June last year, recording a blood alcohol level of 0.181. Incident: In court at the time of the hearing to make a decision on Meares' sentence, her lawyer said the former model weighed about 48.5 kilograms and had drunk 'about four and three-quarter' glasses of red wine over four and a half hours and eaten just a small piece of lamb when she got behind the wheel . Bikini babe: Jodhi rose to fame as a swimsuit model, and eventually went on to design them with her label Tigerlily, which she founded in 2000 and eventually sold to Billabong in 2007 for an estimated $3 - $5 million . Idyllic: Jodhi and Jon have been splitting their time between Sydney and Hawaii, where they share moments from their enviable lifestyle on social media (pictured) Jodhi, who formerly founded swimwear label Tigerlily, has worked to create a life for herself with the sportswear label The Upside. She sold Tigerlily, the swimwear label she founded in 2000 during her marriage to Packer, to surfwear giant Billabong in 2007 for an amount reported to be between $3 and $5 million, staying on as a consultant before eventually cutting ties. But her recent court case also shone a light on how her new fashion label is struggling to make money, despite its popularity among style-loving Sydney-siders. Jodhi's lawyer Mr Chris Murphy said she had not made any money from The Upside, had had to pay staff for taking maternity leave and had given any profits to the Cambodian Children's Trust, a Cambodian orphans charity. 'Every garment that is sold by that business, a payment is made to the Cambodian trust,' he said.'In this particular situation she has a business which is in its early stages, but it doesn't make money - but the cheque goes to the Cambodian orphanage ... with the slum children.' The Upside enjoyed a moment in the spotlight at the recent David Jones fashion parade, .

"Earlier this week a security researcher leaked a staggering 10 million usernames and passwords online. He said the move was for research purposes, and details were stripped of certain details to protect the accounts from cybercriminals. Now, a programmer has built a search tool that lets concerned users scour the list for their personal details. Scroll down for video . Earlier this week a security researcher leaked a staggering 10 million usernames and passwords online. Programmer Luke Rehmann has now built a search tool that lets concerned users scour the list for their personal details. He warned that the site may be slow to load during times of peak traffic . The tool was built by Michigan-based student Luke Rehmann. He said: 'Many people expressed an interest to see if their username or password appeared in this dump of 10 million. 'This data dump is a tiny sample of the hundreds of millions of accounts that have been publicly dumped over the years.' He advises people only to search for the first four characters of their details to prevent the username or password being stored on their browser's auto-complete list. And if people do find their information on the database, he said they should change their password information as a matter of course. Avoid favourite sports. ‘Baseball’ and ‘football’ were both in the top 10 worst password list. Birthdays and years of birth are easy to guess with the help of personal information. Common names such as Michael and Jennifer are insecure, with many making SplashData’s Top 50 list, too. Experts suggest using eight mixed types of characters, with seemingly random combinations if possible. They say that passphrases – short words with spaces or other characters separating them – are easy to recall and are relatively secure if seemingly random words are used. Experts also advise having different passwords for different sites, instead of relying on one, which if hacked, could prove particularly serious. He also warned that his site may be slow to load during times of peak traffic. The original list was leaked by security consultant Mark Burnett. Mr Burnett said in a blog post that his decision to publish the data in full - which was gathered from thousands of global incidents over the last five years, instead of a specific hack - was designed to help experts better understand how people pick their passwords. For example, the data could be used to work out how often people include their usernames within their passwords, Ars Technica reported. ‘Analysis of usernames with passwords is an area that has been greatly neglected and can provide as much insight as studying passwords alone,’ he wrote. He said he is concerned that the publication of the data may get him in legal trouble, however. ‘Recent events have made me question the prudence of releasing this information, even for research purposes,’ he said, citing the example of the prosecution of Anonymous activist Barrett Brown. 'The FBI took advantage of him linking to a data dump to initiate charges of identity theft and trafficking of authentication features,' according to Mr Burnett. ‘I think this is completely absurd that I have to write an entire article justifying the release of this data out of fear of prosecution or legal harassment. The original list was leaked by security consultant Mark Burnett. He said that his decision to publish the data in full  was to help experts understand how people pick their passwords. He stripped out necessary data to stop criminal hackers using the passwords and username for unscrupulous means . ‘I had wanted to write an article about the data itself but I will have to do that later because I had to write this lame thing trying to convince the FBI not to raid me.’ In his defence, the researcher said: ‘In the case of me releasing usernames and passwords, the intent here is certainly not to defraud, facilitate unauthorised access to a computer system, steal the identity of others, to aid any crime or to harm any individual or entity. 1. 123456 . 2. password . 3. 12345 . 4. 12345678 . 5. qwerty . 6. 1234567890 . 7. 1234 . 8. baseball . 9. dragon . 10. football . 11. 1234567 . 12. monkey . 13. letmein . 14. abc123 . 15. 111111 . 16. mustang . 17. access . 18. shadow . 19. master . 20. michael . 21. superman . 22. 696969 . 23. 123123 . 24. batman . 25. trustno1 . ‘The sole intent is to further research with the goal of making authentication more secure and therefore protect from fraud and unauthorised access.’ To ensure that the logins could not be used for illegal purposes, he removed the domain portion from email addresses, mixed up data from different leaks so it could not be traced to any particular company and removed keywords such as company names or any data that could be linked to an individual. He also removed information that could be a credit card number and any accounts suspected as belonging to government or military members.","The website was created by Michigan-based programmer Luke Rehmann .

"A masked jewellery store raider takes a tumble midway through an audacious gang heist in this incredible footage. The hapless robber manages to pick himself up and carry on with the raid, in which he and his accomplices made off with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of Indian gold jewellery stuffed into canvas bags. In a shocking sequence captured on CCTV  a silver Mercedes SLK 230 smashes through the front window of Gems Jewellers in Coventry, West Midlands, to kick off the audacious raid. Going, going, gone: One of the raiders slips over on the shiny surface and takes an embarrassing tumble . After he clatters on to the polished tiles, two of his accomplices narrowly avoid running into him as they too struggle to keep their feet in their eagerness to get to the jewellery-laden display cabinets behind . The robber wastes no time in getting back up on his feet and carrying on with the audacious raid . The silver Mercedes SLK 230 smashes through the front window of the jewellers as the heist begins . The gang wielded hatchets which they used to smash the glass of the display cabinets holding the jewellery . Three bandits clad all in black then rush in behind the car, which was stolen and using false plates, while a fourth wielding a hatchet jumps out of the passenger seat of the apparently left hand drive vehicle as its driver reverses it back out again. The thugs are then seen from another camera furiously slipping and sliding on the hard polished floor, with one unable to keep his feet as two of his accomplices narrowly avoid running into him. Two of the raiders then leapfrog the counter and start smashing display cabinets with axes, just before thick white smoke begins to fill the room after the robbers set off a security device. No longer able to see what they are trying to steal, they are forced to flee in a stolen white Audi A3 Sport TDI. The gang still managed to make off with a number of canvas bags stuffed with jewellery. Following the raid, which happened at around 5.20pm on January 29, their getaway driver then sped them off towards Bell Green in the north of the city. Though the men were masked and dressed in dark clothing detectives still believe people will be able to name them from their distinctive walks, combined with possible boasts about their new found wealth. West Midlands Police Detective Constable Lee Buckler said: 'This was an audacious raid carried out just as rush hour traffic will have been starting to build and there were lots of witnesses . Three of the raiders burst charge across the tiled floor through the space where the front window used to be . They were carrying canvas bags which they greedily stuffed with expensive Indian gold jewellery . The masked robbers pile in behind the car and head straight for display cabinets holding what they were after . They furiously hack at the glass cases with hatchets, stuffing what they take into canvas bags . 'The raiders were masked when they committed the crime but having stolen hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of Indian gold jewellery, their new found wealth combined with their unique floor moves will undoubtedly give them away. 'As part of the investigation detectives have trawled hours of CCTV footage from cameras in the area and interviewed dozens of witnesses while forensic experts scoured the store and Mercedes abandoned outside. 'Some may think this is was a victimless crime but I want people to be under no illusion. 'These are dangerous and desperate men who threatened to shoot a man who was passing the store at the time they raided it. 'The driver of the getaway car also drove dangerously through the streets of Coventry to escape the scene. These men definitely deserve to be behind bars.' The owner of the shop was in the store at the time but was physically unharmed. Anyone with information which may help Det Con Buckler find the men responsible should call police on 101. Information can be given anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. The gang were described as 'dangerous and desperate' by police after they threatened to shoot a man who was passing the store at the time they raided it, before making off at speed through Coventry .

"More than £2billion is being claimed in benefits by foreigners every year, including thousands of illegal immigrants, figures reveal. The Department for Work and Pensions announced a fraud investigation last night after it emerged 5,000 illegals claimed handouts worth £42million to which they are not entitled. Ministers acted after the first-ever study of claimants’ nationality, which found 371,000 foreign nationals are on out-of-work benefits. Labour accused the Government of peddling 'dodgy' figures which revealed that benefits were wrongly paid to more than 5,000 migrants who had no right to claim state help . The study by the DWP found 6 per cent of all benefit claimants were foreign nationals when the data was collected in February last year. Of those claiming benefits, 258,000 were from outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 27 EU countries as well as Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. But a follow-up exercise found 2 per cent of all claims by foreign nationals were made by those without the immigration status to justify the payments. The DWP said last night: ‘Two per cent of cases appeared to have no lawful immigration status and the legitimacy of their status for benefit purposes is being investigated. ‘The DWP is co-ordinating with UK Border Agency to review the small number of cases where it appears benefit is being claimed illegitimately. 'Where this is the case, benefit will be stopped and enforcement activity considered.’ Employment Minister Chris Grayling has called the findings 'unacceptable' and has promised to strip immigrants of benefits if they cannot prove their legal status in this country . Employment Minister Chris Grayling said: ‘It is not acceptable that people from other countries can claim our benefits if they have not worked or paid tax in the UK. ‘We will root out those claimants who cannot prove their immigration status and in turn they will be stripped of their benefits.’ Immigration Minister Damian Green said: ‘These findings uncover a worrying issue we have inherited, which is why we’ve ordered urgent work to pursue claimants suspected of abuse and to withdraw their benefits if they cannot prove they are entitled to claim.’ According to the figures, 54 per cent of non-EEA claimants went on to secure British citizenship. But the survey also suggests many are moving to the UK to take advantage of our generous benefits system. Last year £35billion was paid to 5.5million people in out-of-work benefits, including Jobseeker’s Allowance, Incapacity Benefit and its replacement Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Disability Living Allowance, Carer’s Allowance and Bereavement benefit. Of that, 6 per cent, or £2.1billion, goes to foreigners. Under current rules, those given leave to enter or remain in the UK may be eligible for income-related benefits, including anyone granted refugee status, exceptional leave to enter or remain, or Humanitarian Protection. EEA nationals with ‘worker status’ who have left their job but are looking for alternative work are eligible for income-related benefits. Those who can demonstrate they are seeking work are eligible for Jobseeker’s Allowance. Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘With billions at stake the proper controls need to be in place to prevent benefit tourism from swallowing up taxpayers’ money. Taxpayers will rightly worry the rules designed to prevent benefit tourists are steadily being eroded by a meddlesome EU, leaving Britain to pick up a bigger welfare bill than it needs to.’ Sayida Khaliif, wife of Saeed Khaliif, at the £2m house she shares with members of her Somalian family . Somali asylum seeker Saeed  Khaliif was given a £2million home in one of the country’s most exclusive neighbourhoods at the taxpayer’s expense. The 49-year-old was granted housing benefits of almost £8,000 a month to live in the six- bedroom property with his wife Sayida and children. The unemployed couple demanded to be moved to West Hampstead, north-west London, after deciding their home in the Midlands was inadequate. The payments, revealed last year, are among the largest ever given in housing benefit. Their new home has a 90ft garden and has been recently refurbished, with an en suite master bedroom and modern kitchen. It is minutes from West Hampstead Underground station and the neighbourhood is home to comedian Stephen Fry. It is understood Mr Khaliif has up to eight children and lives on benefits. He has not worked since arriving here three years ago. Sought-after: The Khaliffs' new home in West Hampstead . It is understood the family left £600 worth of damage to their old home in Coventry and did not pay the final month’s rent. Housing benefit was recently capped at £400 a week, but the Khaliifs were able to claim more because they moved before the change came into force. According to property sources, the house was being advertised to rent at £7,800 per month.","DWP fraud probe after 5,000 illegal immigrants claim £42m in handouts to which they are not entitled .

"Ticket inspectors who spear tackled a 15-year-old girl after she tried to avoid paying her $2.50 train fare have been slammed for using 'excessive force'. Victorian Ombudsman Deborah Glass wrote in her report of the July 2013 incident that the inspectors' actions breached Victoria's Charter of Human Rights.

She was then held down by three men for more than eight minutes until police arrived at the scene. '(He) picked me up and he threw me on the ground and virtually nearly broke my back,' the girl said, according to the report. 'I couldn't breathe. I couldn't move. I was screaming.' The incident left her with back problems and requiring ongoing counselling, according to the ABC. Victorian Ombudsman Deborah Glass wrote in her report of the July 2013 incident that the inspectors' actions breached Victoria's Charter of Human Rights . Ms Glass' report found excessive force was used by one inspector, and the girl's human rights were 'degraded'. It revealed ticket inspectors only received half a day of practical training in how to use force and recommended that Public Transport Victoria take over recruitment and training them, which the organisation subsequently agreed to do. Two of the officers involved said they picked up restraint techniques on an ad hoc basis. 'It is disappointing that the use of force by authorised officers continues to be an issue despite two previous investigations and repeated recommendations,' the report said. CCTV footage of the Flinders Street Railway Station incident became public last year after Victorian Greens leader Greg Barber obtained it through a freedom of information request . Her critical report came after two internal reviews of the incident, which didn't include interviews with the teenager involved nor any independent witnesses, found the inspectors had done nothing wrong. The outcome was slammed by Victorian Transport Minister Jacinta Allan. Greens leader Greg Barber said ticket inspectors should sell tickets or become regular station staff. 'They have already been given the equipment to take payments for fines on public transport, so should be able to help people buy tickets,' Mr Barber said.","Victorian Ombudsman Deborah Glass slammed the inspectors for using 'excessive force'

"A mother and daughter who claimed they were so disabled they could barely walk stole £50,000 while working in hospitals, a court has heard. Wendy Perry, 66, took £28,500 of taxpayers’ money over five years working as a medical secretary, while her daughter Nicola Manson-Perry, 48, stole £20,400 as an accounts clerk over nine years. Both women, who shared a home in Wednesbury, West Midlands, received thousands of pounds worth of Disability Living Allowance pay-outs after claiming they could hardly walk unaided. Scroll down for video . Fraudsters: Nicola Manson-Perry (left) stole £20,400 of taxpayers’ money over nine years as an accounts clerk, while her mother Wendy Perry (right) £28,500in five years working as a medical secretary . No problems: Perry was caught when Department of Work and Pensions investigators spent four days secretly filming her walking to her car at the hospital in April 2013 . Perry claimed she had to hold onto the wall for balance to ensure she did not fall while walking to her desk at Sandwell Hospital in West Bromwich. She also claimed she had difficulty communicating and filling in forms and even increased the pay-out by stating she needed constant care both day and night. But Perry was caught when Department of Work and Pensions investigators spent four days secretly filming her walking to her car at the hospital in April 2013. The clear footage shows Perry, who even parked in a disabled bay, strolling to her vehicle quickly without any aids and with no sign of a limp. Investigators then widened their probe to include her daughter after it was discovered Manson-Perry was also picking up DLA pay-outs by claiming it took her ten minutes to walk two metres (7ft). Both women were arrested by police at their home in August 2013 - but maintained they were innocent of any benefit fraud. Investigated: The clear footage shows Perry, who even parked in a disabled bay, strolling to her vehicle quickly without any aids and with no sign of a limp . Both women - Perry (left) and Manson-Perry (right) were arrested by police at their home in Wednesbury, West Midlands, in August 2013 - but maintained they were innocent of any benefit fraud . However, they were both convicted of failing to report a change in circumstances after separate trials at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Perry, who has worked for the NHS since 1995, is due to be sentenced on March 6. Manson-Perry was spared jail when she was sentenced yesterday to 34 weeks in prison, suspended for two years. Judge Robin Onions told her: ‘At some stage your mobility significantly increased and I am satisfied you knew that. Two work colleagues said they did not notice any restriction to your mobility. At no stage did you need mobility aids as you walked from your car to the office and walked along corridors to meetings. 'You convinced yourself that because you had other medical problems this, in some sense, justified you in continuing in this unjustified claim. You should now discuss with your mother how you are jointly going to pay back the debt you owe to the state.’ The court heard Manson-Perry, who is married without children, had been employed by the NHS since 2004 and worked as a £22,000-a-year accounts clerk at Birmingham City Hospital. At one stage she claimed it took her ten minutes to walk just two metres but colleagues told the DWP that they never noticed any restriction to her mobility.

The court heard the women’s claims were not fraudulent from the outset but neither reported improvements in their condition that affected their right to the benefit. A spokesman for the Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospital NHS Trust, which runs both hospitals where the women worked, confirmed they had both been suspended. They added: ‘The Trust is aware that two members of staff have been found guilty of offences related to benefit fraud. ‘Upon their conviction both members of staff were suspended whilst formal investigations are ongoing to assess whether disciplinary action should be taken. The formal investigations are expected to conclude in March.’ A DWP spokesman said: ‘Benefit payments should go to those who really need them. ‘We know it’s a small minority of people who commit benefit fraud, but deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime.'","Wendy Perry took £28,500 over five years working as medical secretary .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers wants Saido Berahino to solve his goalscoring problems in January. The Reds boss has identified the West Brom striker as the man he wants to add goals to his misfiring forward line. And Rodgers is pushing for a deal to happen when the transfer window reopens in six weeks. Saido Berahino (right)  has scored seven Premier League goals for West Brom this season .

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (right) wants to add a striker to his squad in January . Rodgers's current crop of strikers have not managed a goal between them in the league this season . West Brom are desperate to keep Berahino, who has scored eight goals already this season, and will demand a high price. Berahino could cost in-excess of £15million, while the Baggies will look to keep the striker by offering him an improved contract. Having spent close to £120million on new talent in the summer, though that was offset by the £75million sale of Luis Suarez, there is doubt over whether Rodgers will be afforded the funds to launch a raid for Berahino. And if a deal is not possible in January, then Rodgers is expected to return for Berahino in the summer.

"Stay-at-home mothers should fight for a slice of their ex-husband’s pension when they split or risk financial strife in retirement, the pensions minister warned yesterday. Steve Webb said there was not enough emphasis placed on valuable gold-plated pensions when couples negotiated their divorce settlement. It means thousands of divorcees – but particularly women who have taken a career break at some point to care for children – face being reliant on the State pension in old age. Divorced mothers have been warned to seek part of their ex-husband's pensions or face financial loss in later life, especially if they have taken time out from their career to rear children, photograph posed by models . Mr Webb said divorce lawyers should be ‘encouraged to always make sure this is properly part of the negotiations and is on the table’. The Liberal Democrat MP said workplace pensions were often ‘an after-thought’, but urged people not to overlook its worth. He said: ‘If you are part of a couple and you do not take out a pension for family reasons – whether that is caring for children or family in later life – and then you split up on the eve of retirement, there is a danger there. ‘It is tempting to think about your immediate needs such as the house and the kids, but it is very important we make sure that pension share issue is at the forefront. ‘There is a risk the pension becomes an after-thought and that people think ‘I will worry about that at retirement’. But a pension, and particularly if it is final salary, is very valuable and that future value is not always easy to grasp’. Earlier in the day, he spoke on the issue at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation think tank, in which he said the impact of divorce on pension income was ‘one of the elephants in the room’. Pensions Minister Steve Webb, pictured, said that pensions were often seen as 'an afterthought' in divorce . He said: ‘We have got a problem with divorce. Many people – women particularly – take career breaks or take time out to have kids and then go back in having missed out [on pension contributions]. ‘If a couple stay together in retirement then, between them they are fine, but what if they split up in their fifties?’. About four in 10 marriages in the UK now end in divorce, according to official figures. Pensions are frequently people’s biggest asset in divorce after the family home and can be split or shared in several ways. Court agreements can be obtained for ‘pension sharing’, which involves signing over a percentage share of the pension to the ex-partner. Alternatively, people can offset the pension against other assets – for example, one may receive a bigger share of the family home in return for the other keeping their pension. Others agree to receive a deferred lump sum when their partner retires. Mr Webb said there were no ‘quick fixes’ for the problem, but called for an increased awareness among divorcees of the future value of pensions. He said: ‘In theory we have pension sharing on divorce and pension splitting. ‘But the reality is that it doesn’t work terribly well. Your average divorce lawyer is focused on the house and, if you have still got kids, are you really going to haggle hard over a share of the pension?’. Family lawyer Marilyn Stowe said the lower-earner was often given immediate capital, such as the house or a lump sum, while longer-term assets such as pensions were often ‘left in the hands of the other party’. She said: ‘I agree that the long-term needs should never be ignored but circumstances tend to dictate an emphasis on immediate needs.’ Mrs Stowe said that law firms and courts would ‘never forget such a valuable asset’ in negotiations, but that couples who came to an informal agreement could make mistakes. She added: ‘With legal aid no longer available for divorce, lots of couples may think they cannot afford a lawyer and could overlook the value of pensions.’ Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘It’s important that everyone is encouraged to put money aside for later life. ‘Age UK believes older people should be offered periodic ‘financial MOTs’ so that they know how resilient they are financially. That includes understanding, if you are part of a couple, what happens to your pension when your partner dies or if your situation changes for other reasons.’","Divorced mothers face financial loss if they fail to secure pension rights .

"Britain's worst speeding offenders have been caught on camera going as fast as 146mph on a motorway – twice the 70mph legal speed limit. And another driver was recorded travelling at 128mph in a 30mph zone, exceeding the area’s speed limit by 98mph. The league table of speeding incidents caught on camera in England and Wales was compiled by the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) who asked police forces across the country to supply the highest speeds recorded in their areas last year. Speed demons: Britain's worst speeding offenders have been caught on camera going as fast as 146mph on a motorway – more than twice the 70mph legal speed limit . The highest overall speed recorded by cameras in 2014 was 146mph and occurred on two separate occasions on the M25. But one of the worst examples of excessive speeding was on the 30mph limit London Road in East Grinstead in West Sussex where one driver was recorded doing 128mph – more than four times the legal limit. The highest figure recorded in a 50mph zone was 120mph on the A631 Beckingham Road and the worst speed caught on a 40mph road was 115mph on the A10 Great Cambridge Road in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. The highest overall speed recorded by cameras in 2014 was 146mph and occurred twice on the M25 – with two vehicles tying for the excessive speed top spot. Fast: Of the 36 England and Wales police forces who responded to the FOI request, all but six recorded top speeds of more than 110mph in 2014 . One offender was caught travelling anti-clockwise around the M25 at junction 5 near Westerham in Kent, while the other was captured on film going clockwise at Swanley in Kent. There were also three more incidents in which drivers were recorded travelling at 140mph or more. These comprised a vehicle hitting 145mph on the M6 Toll road in the West Midlands, a speed of 141mph captured on the A1 northbound at Great Ponton in Lincolnshire, and a car doing 140mph was filmed on the A5 near Crick in Northamptonshire. Of the 36 England and Wales police forces who responded to the FOI request, all but six recorded top speeds of more than 110mph in 2014. London's worst speeder was recorded at 123mph on a 30mph road in the capital by the Metropolitan Police. However, the location has not been revealed as the IAM said it claimed exemption under Section 31 of the Freedom of Information Act. Of the 41 police force areas the IAM requested the information from, 36 responded. All forces recorded at least one top speed over 110mph with the exception of City of London, Cleveland, Greater Manchester, Northumbria, West Midlands and South Yorkshire. Wales’ top speeder was a driver who recorded 136mph on the A5 Ty Nant to Dinmael road in Conway, which has a 60mph limit. The IAM said it supported the targeted use of safety camera systems at collision hot spots, on roads with a speed related crash record and at areas of proven risk, such as motorway road works. But it believes that improving driving skills and attitude is the key to reducing the numbers of people killed and injured on UK roads. It advocates advanced driving and riding tuition to help achieve this. IAM chief executive office Sarah Sillars said: ‘It is disheartening to say the least that some road users are showing such disregard for the safety of all other road users. ‘At speeds of 140mph an individual is travelling at nearly two-and-a-half miles a minute. At that speed it is simply impossible to react to anything that might happen in front of you.’ She added: ‘All these individuals are playing with their own lives and others. They are all accidents waiting to happen and it requires a major shift in the attitudes of these people to think about safety.’","Highest overall speed recorded on two separate occasions on the M25 .

"America's largest reservoir will fall this week to its lowest level since it was filled nearly 80 years ago, according to federal water managers. Lake Mead, Las Vegas’ main water source located on the Colorado River, will fall to about 1,080 feet above sea level due to crippling drought. But US Bureau of Reclamation regional chief Terry Fulp said the record low won't trigger any water restrictions for 40 million people across America's southwest. Lake Mead, a man made lake filled in 1937 and formed by the Hoover Dam, has been losing water for over a decade and is currently at . about 40 percent capacity. Scroll down for video . Projections: The US Bureau of Reclamation expects Lake Mead's water level will drop a record low of about 1,080 feet above sea level this week and continue to drop in the next two years . Shrinking: Drought in America's south west is depleting the vast Lake Mead on the Colorado River to levels not seen since Hoover Dam was completed in 1935. This October 22, 2010, photo shows low water levels in Boulder Harbor in Lake Mead, Arizona . 'We continue to closely monitor the projections of declining lake levels and are working with stakeholders throughout the Lower Basin to keep as much water in Lake Mead as we can through various storage and conservation efforts,' Fulp said in a statement. The lake on Tuesday was just under 1,082 . feet above sea level, and the reservoir was about 39 percent full, said . Rose Davis, a bureau spokeswoman in Boulder City, Nevada. Previously, the lowest levels were about 1,082 feet in November 2010, and 1,083 feet in April 1956 during another sustained . drought. The dropping level since the reservoir was last full in 1998, at just under 1,296 feet above sea level, has left as much as 130 feet of distinctive white mineral 'bathtub ring' on hard rock surfaces surrounding the lake. Davis said the bureau expects a slight increase in water level to about 1,083 feet by January 1, 2015. Historical chart: This graph charts Lake Mead's changing water levels since it was filled in the 1930s .

Change: This NASA satellite image taken in August 2010 shows a dramatic reduction in the size of Lake Mead due to drought . Lake Mead National Recreation Area, 30 . miles east of Las Vegas, is among the federal government's top tourist . attractions. It drew some 6.3 million visitors in 2013, about the same . number as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Boaters . and swimmers have largely ignored the dropping water levels in a place . where splashing in cold fresh water on 100-plus-degree summer days is a . treat. But they've also dealt with marina closures in recent years. Visitors who used to feed scraps to carp from restaurant deck tables may . now need to trek hundreds of yards with sandwiches and beach blankets . to enjoy a waterside lunch. 'We projected this was coming,' Davis said. 'We are basically where we expected to be, given the dry winters in 2012 and 2013.' Lake Mead today stores about 10.2 million acre-feet of water and is managed in conjunction with Lake Powell, the reservoir farther up the Colorado River near the Utah-Arizona state line. Davis said Lake Powell was at 52 percent capacity, holding about 12.7 million acre-feet of water. Water source: The Hoover Dam (photographed in 1999) opened in 1936 and is in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River on the border between Arizona and Nevada . Water officials say an acre-foot is about enough water to supply an average Nevada household for a year. Federal and state water officials have negotiated plans for a shortage declaration triggering delivery cuts to Nevada and Arizona if annual projections for the Lake Mead water level drop below a 1,075 foot elevation. That projection is based on data being compiled by the Bureau of Reclamation. Davis said the 1,075-foot trigger point is not expected this year or next. But last year, after back-to-back driest years in a century, federal water managers gave Arizona and Nevada a 50-50 chance of having water deliveries cut in 2016.","Lake Mead on Colorado River in Nevada expected fall to about 1,080 feet above sea level this week .

"Tensions over the Falkland Islands escalated dramatically last night after two UK cruise ships were refused entry to Argentina. More than 3,250 passengers - 1,000 of them British - were on board the Adonia and Star Princess when they were ordered to turn back by port officials in Ushuaia, the main city of Argentina’s Tierra del Fuego province and the southern most city in the world. Passengers on board the Adonia were informed by the ship’s captain that they had been banned from docking for ‘political reasons’ and were forced instead to head towards Chile to continue their journey. Port problems: The Star Princess, with more than 3,250 passengers on board, was ordered to turn back by officials in Ushuaia in Argentina . The 77,500 ton Adonia, which has . around 700 British passengers on board and 300 crew, left Britain on . January 13, on an 87-night long voyage from Southampton to South . America, and is due back on April 9. Passengers paid up to £30,000 for the round trip. The 109,000-ton Star Princess is on a . 14-night tour of the Americas and set sail on February 18 from Rio de . Janeiro with 2,580 passengers, of which 284 are British, and 900 crew. The Adonia is part of a fleet of ships . operated by P&O Cruises out of Southampton. The Star Princess, . which is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is run by Princess Cruises . from Southampton. Last night, the Foreign Office . condemned the move by Argentina and said its diplomats in South America . were ‘urgently’ seeking to clarify the circumstances surrounding the . incident. A spokesman said: ‘We are very . concerned to hear the Adonia and Star Princess have been refused access . to the port of Ushuaia. There can be no justification for interference . in free and legitimate commerce. ‘British diplomats in Argentina are . urgently seeking to clarify the circumstances surrounding this incident . and we are in contact with the company concerned.’ Refused entry: P&O's Adonia (pictured) was turned away from the Argentine port of Tierra Del Fuego . Ship ban: Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner - pictured with Sean Penn - has cranked up the pressure as the anniversary approaches . Passengers on board both vessels - . which left Port Stanley at the weekend after a brief visit - described . how the routine stop on their itinerary was suddenly thrust into the . spotlight as they prepared for a day-long visit to mainland Argentina. Michael Campbell, 45, who was on board . the Star Princess, said: ‘We have been caught up in what is essentially . a bit of handbags between the two countries. ‘It is pretty immature from . Argentina’s point of view. We are just being used as pawns by Argentina . to make a point. It is ridiculous.’ Ushuaia port president Alejandro . Berola told local reporters he had been ordered to prevent both cruise . liners from docking by regional governor Fabiana Rios. He also revealed Argentine war veterans and port workers had asked him in writing to turn both vessels away. The move followed the passing of a . controversial local law prohibiting ships with a British flag or flag of . convenience that ‘plunder Argentine natural resources’ from docking in . the area. City tourism chiefs last night attacked the ban as ‘economic suicide’ and claimed holidaymakers were being unfairly targeted. Mounting tensions: Prince William is currently in the Falklands, which has upset Argentine president Cristina Fernandez . Marcelo Lieti, President of Ushuaia’s .

"Myleene Klass has boasted about a huge increase in sales of her lingerie collection . Myleene Klass has boasted about  a huge increase in sales of her lingerie collection following a row over a birthday gift donation at her daughter’s private school. The radio presenter revealed that sales of her new Littlewoods underwear range were up 200 per cent after she tweeted extracts of a group email she received from parents at the school. The email, which she branded ‘bonkers’, asked for donations of a ‘suggested £10’ to buy their children presents, including a Kindle, and leave the cash in the child’s school bag. Miss Klass, whose seven-year-old daughter Ava goes to the £5,000-a-term school, posted the extracts last week and was confronted by angry parents who accused the model of ‘betraying’ them. But despite the row, the mother-of-two uploaded a picture of herself posing in a red lingerie set on Instagram on Wednesday and said: ‘O.M.G.!!!!! Girls!!! Sales of my lingerie are up by 200%!!! Please get in quick to ensure you get your order. Xx #littlewoodslovesmyleene @littlewoodsonline.’ Parents at the north London school suggested the 36-year-old may have posted the initial emails, which were later revealed to be a year old, in order to get some publicity. A source told the Daily Mirror last week: ‘It is bang out of order. These are old class emails from a year ago. We have all noticed that the paparazzi are no longer outside the school taking her picture like they used to be every morning. ‘Perhaps she needed to get some attention. The press have certainly all been back here today.’ The headmistress stepped in following the furore and wrote a strongly-worded letter to all parents, which said: ‘If you can’t tweet anything nice, don’t tweet anything at all.’ The row erupted last week after Miss Klass posted a picture of the message which stated: ‘Jane and Hannah would prefer a class birthday gift for their daughters this year. ‘Sarah would like a kindle and Lola a desk (very studious choices!!) so if you would like to join in, please can I collect a suggested £10 from you before the party on Feb 9th.’ The request added: ‘Thanx [sic] and no obligation of course.’ The radio presenter Klass hit the headlines last week after posting two emails received 'from some school mums' detailing the parents' preferences for 'a class gift for their daughters this year' Myleene posted the text of two emails she received from fellow parents, as well as her response . Myleene, pictured, right, with her two young daughters, maintained she was trying to convey a serious message and it was her intention to remind parents, who are under pressure to do the best for their children, of what birthdays should be about . A second email from another parent who offered to collect the cash reiterated that £10 would be a ‘popular amount’ to contribute, but added: ‘feel free to give what you like or indeed, to give your own gift’. Miss Klass, who also has a three-year-old son named Hero, sent a mocking response in which she requested a unicorn for her daughter. The email said: ‘Dear all, for Ava’s birthday, she has requested real, live unicorn. ‘I will be collecting unicorn money via her book bag, in the playground or at www.getwhatyouregivenandendthismadness.com. ‘(Additionally I’d like a Ferrari and Leonardo DiCaprio, so by all means, do feel obligated to contribute to this too).’ She added: ‘If you don’t wish to, please don’t feel any pressure from the countless emails I intend to follow this up with and clog your inbox. Love and thanks!!’","Myleene Klass boasts of huge increase in sales of her lingerie collection .

"An Italian nonna who became an internet sensation after her son filmed her trying to use Siri has left Today host Karl Stefanovic in hysterics after she declared the iPhone app was a 'dummy'. A video of Nonna Paola exploding with rage as she tried to learn how to use her new iPhone was posted online by her son Greg Lachimia, 44, this week. The 78-year-old, who moved to Victoria from Calabria in Italy 58 years ago, reached online stardom after footage of her trying to ask the voice-recognition application for the time in Italy appeared on Daily Mail Australia. 'To tell you the truth I don't know her. But for me, it's very hard. My son is like push the buttons. I try anything but I can't hear answer properly, you know,' Nonna Paola told Karl Stefanovic on Friday. Scroll down for video . A video of Nonna Paola exploding with rage as she tried to learn how to use her new iPhone went viral after her son Greg Lachimia posted it online this week . Nonna Paola left Today host Karl Stefanovic in hysterics after she declared the iPhone app was a 'dummy' 'Because I don't know, she never answer me what I told her. I tell her what time is it in Italy, but she told me different things, a different story.' Nonna Paola struggles to get Siri to answer her questions despite repeated attempts due to her broken English. 'Listen, I no like to say this to her, but for me (she's) like a dummy,' she said after Stefanovic asked if Siri was rude to her. The interview with Stefanovic got a little sidetracked when Nonna Paola was asked about her secret to good Italian pasta. 'To do pasta... everyone, especially Australia people love pasta,' she said. 'My kids no like pasta. They want vegetables, steak... especially my son here Greg. Every night (he wants) vegetables and breast chicken. I say one day breast chicken come in your body.' Nonna Paola even invited Stefanovic over for pasta saying 'any time, no worries'. But not before she flagged an issue with him over the Today show's money giveaway - I Wake Up With Today. 'I ring you up for wake up with you today and you never ring me. I sit down on the chair like a dummy to hear the phone ring, but you never ring,' she said. Greg Lachimia, 44, from Sunshine in Victoria, posts videos of his 78-year-old mother 'Nonna Paola' online . In the latest video Nonna Paola loses as Mr Lachimia tries to teach her how to use Siri on her new iPhone . In the video, Mr Lachimia tells his mother Siri doesn't like her voice - and Nonna Paola loses it. 'Why no like my voice I talk gently!' she yells. 'Because you very experience for this mobile phone, I'm no experience!' She tries again, but Siri has trouble understanding her broken English. 'Hello you can tell me what's time it's in Italy please, thank you,' Nonna Paola asks. Siri replies: 'I value you.' Mr Lachimia then tries to wind up his mother by telling her to tell Siri to 'p*** off'. But Nonna Paola quickly fires back: 'No! I no tell p*** off to the people. 'Shut up, you make me sick! No way! 'Listen you no have to be rude to the people, you understand!' Nonna Paola then makes another unsuccessful attempt at asking Siri the time in Italy. The application responds by saying: 'I see a handful of Italian restaurant in your area.' Nonna Paola and Mr Lachimia burst out laughing when she repeatedly calls Siri 'Sira' by mistake. The iPhone app then responds with a garbled answer, which causes Mr Lachimia to exclaim: 'You confused her, you confused the computer! That's unbelievable!' But Nonna Paola is quick to yell back: 'You know what you drive me mad, you drive me crazy you d***head!' In December, Mr Lachimia posted a video of Nonna Paola blowing up after his 12-year-old son told her he was getting a tattoo . That video got more than 4.5 million views, so he decided to create Facebook fan page for Nonna Paola which has almost 30,000 likes . The video was posted to Facebook fan page for Nonna Paola which has almost 30,000 likes and it went viral after appearing on Daily Mail Australia. Mr Lachimia tried to explain to Nonna Paolo that she was an internet sensation. 'She's a 78-year-old Italian woman - she doesn't get it,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'She's always had the attitude 'so long as she makes people happy'. 'It's all been positive, I've had a cancer patient ring me to say her life has been upside down until she got a hold of mum's page.' Other videos posted to the page include Nonna Paola trying to learn how to use a digital TV remote, trying to do squats, or losing her temper when it is suggested she get a boyfriend.

"Islamic State hostage John Cantlie has told his family to ‘let him go’ and ‘get on with their lives’ - days after appearing on a propaganda video which he ominously warned was the last in the series. In an article released last night for the terror group’s magazine, Dabiq, Cantlie thanks his relatives and fiancee for their ‘tireless efforts’ campaigning for his release. However, he adds: ‘Let it go. Leave it be and get on with your lives, all of you’. In an article released last night for the terror group’s magazine, Dabiq, Cantlie thanks his relatives and fiancee for their ‘tireless efforts’ campaigning for his release . Cantlie - who has previously claimed to have accepted that he is likely to be brutally murdered by the terrorists - said the video released three days ago (pictured) was 'the last in this series' Referring to an interview given by his partner, the photo journalist says: ‘That was my fiancee, whom I hope now has long since forgotten me and moved on. ‘What can the remnants of one family, smashed and emotionally exhausted after two years of campaigning, be expected to do by themselves.’ In the article, Cantlie, 44, has also been made to criticise the international campaign of air strikes against Islamic State, claiming that ‘every bomb dropped in Syria or Iraq serves as a recruitment tool for the Islamic State’. The magazine and video have been released in the wake of the horrific video showing the burning to death of captured fighter pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh by IS fighters and claims by the group that US aid worker hostage Kayla Mueller had been killed in air strikes in revenge for the Jordanian’s shocking murder. There has been concern for the safety of Cantlie since he was captured in Syria in November 2012 together with the now murdered US correspondent James Foley. Eight international hostages, including two Britons, have been executed by the group but during the period of their murders Cantlie has been used for a series of nine expertly-made propaganda videos by IS. Here he is pictured after being forced to interview jihadis for the ISIS propaganda film released three days ago . There has been concern for the safety of Cantlie since he was captured in Syria in November 2012 together with the now murdered US correspondent James Foley (pictured) He is among at least four international hostages believed to be still held by IS in their Syrian headquarters of Raqqa. Two previous videos have shown him in the cities of Kabani and Mosul and, in the most recent one, he was filmed inside the city of Aleppo walking among the rubble caused by years of fighting and air strikes while showing life going on as usual under IS administration. He says the city had been ‘smashed to rubble’ but points to what he calls is a thriving economy. After pictures taken inside a religious school, he tells the camera the children ‘will form the Mujahideen of the next generation.’ The British hostage talks about food supplies, drone strikes, education and sharia law adding in the video, ‘the death of leaders of jihad only emboldens and motivates us upon this path.’ Slick: The documentary-style 12-minute film saw John Cantlie giving a guided tour of the city of Aleppo . The high-quality 12 minute documentary-style production is titled ‘From Inside Habab’, the ancient name for the Syrian city of Aleppo. Dressed sometimes in the black shirt of IS and at othertimes in a brown jacket, Cantlie, who appears well if unshaved, describes the ‘advance and stretch’ of IS as ‘remarkable and breathtaking’. The group, which has a media wing, is reported to be launching its own online TV channel, featuring a series from the Briton and a weekly programme called ‘Time to Recruit.’ Social media accounts linked to the group have begun sharing a so-called ‘teaser’ video, which claimed the channel would broadcast 24 hours a day and be named ‘The Islamic Caliphate Broadcast’. IS already operates a radio station based in Mosul called al-Bayan, as well as a satellite TV station called Tawheed in Libya, but a 24/7 news channel targeting an international audience would be seen as a significant move by the group’s propaganda wing.","ISIS hostage John Cantlie has told his family to 'let him go' in new article .

"Women undergoing hormone replacement therapy face an increased risk of ovarian cancer, a review claims. It found the risk rises by 40 per cent after five years’ use – the recommended maximum – compared to a woman who has never had the treatment. And while the risk decreases after stopping HRT, ten years on it is still slightly raised. Hormone replacement therapy tablets: New research warns that the risk of ovarian cancer rises by 40 per cent after five years' use - the recommended maximum - compared with women who've never had it . The findings come from an analysis of 52 studies involving 21,488 ovarian cancer patients – mostly from America, Europe and Australia. Study co-author Professor Sir Richard Peto, from Oxford University, said: ‘For women who take HRT for five years from around age 50, there will be about one extra ovarian cancer for every 1,000 users and one extra ovarian cancer death for every 1,700 users.’ The effect was the same for the two main types of HRT – containing oestrogen only, or oestrogen combined with a progestogen. Past use of oral contraceptives made no difference, say researchers, even though the pill protects against the disease. Maintaining a normal life: At the height of its popularity, HRT was taken by two million UK women to replace natural supplies of oestrogen which diminish during the menopause . The review was published in The Lancet medical journal and was carried out by the Collaborative Group on Epidemiological Studies of Ovarian Cancer, which compares results from multiple studies of the disease. Co-author Professor Dame Valerie Beral said the findings have ‘implications for current efforts to revise UK and worldwide guidelines’. Existing European advice on HRT does not mention ovarian cancer, although UK guidelines say it might be increased with long-term use. At the height of its popularity, HRT was taken by two million UK women to replace natural supplies of oestrogen which diminish during the menopause. The number has halved since 2002 after a US trial linked the treatment with breast cancer. The findings have since been largely overturned. However despite the latest results, other experts warn that the dangers of HRT should not be exaggerated. Professor Rod Baber from the University of Sydney – who is also president of the International Menopause Society – said a previous large trial found no increased risk of ovarian cancer after five years of HRT. He added that the new analysis found the risk was very low in absolute terms. ‘My advice to women would be that this study at worst suggests a very small increase in risk with use of HRT,’ he said. ‘This is no reason for them to stop taking their HRT. The benefits of HRT in their own individual case should be weighed up against this information and they should discuss this with their own doctor.’ And Dr Simon Newman, head of research at charity Target Ovarian Cancer, added that there is no evidence to suggest that previous cancer patients are at any greater risk of recurrence if they take HRT. Dr Sarah Branch, of the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, said: ‘Our advice has always been that the lowest dose of HRT should be used for the shortest possible time. 'We will evaluate the findings of this study and its implications for shorter term use and update product information as necessary.’ Ovarian cancer affects around 7,000 UK women a year, and leads to more than 4,000 deaths.","Researchers analysed 52 studies involving 21,488 ovarian cancer patients .

"Claire Goodall, from Surrey, appeared on This Morning to talk about her feelings of isolation after having a baby . Many of Britain's new mothers are struggling to cope with the pressures of having a baby. In a new survey, commissioned by AXA PPP healthcare and Netmums, more than a quarter of first-time mums admit to feeling lonely, with 24 per cent also admitting they had no family nearby to help with the workload of caring for a young child. According to health experts, feelings of loneliness leave young mothers more susceptible to mental health problems like post-natal depression. For many women, their social network declines after having a child, with 14 per cent of those questioned admitting said they had lost touch with old friends and colleagues. This number increases to 25 per cent for young mothers aged 18-24. Despite many activity groups tailored to new mothers, more than a quarter of women said they hadn't made any new friends since giving birth. This figure increased again for the age group 18-24, with 38 per cent of those questioned giving that answer. One women who can sympathise with these feelings is Claire Goodall, from Surrey, who suffered crippling feelings of loneliness after giving birth to her first child two years ago. Shortly after giving birth, Claire and her husband relocated to a more rural area with their new baby. The lack of friends in the area and issues with public transport left her feeling lost and alone. Appearing on This Morning to talk about her experiences in an effort to help other new mothers, Claire revealed that after a couple of months, her feelings of isolation meant that her self-confidence took a nosedive. She said: 'I'd mentally prepared myself for it but it turned out to be something out of my control. I didn't expect it to be such a shock to the system. 'I would class myself as very capable, but when you're a new mum and have a baby you don't feel like that.' Scroll down for video . Despite many activity groups tailored to new mothers, more than a quarter of British women do't make  any new friends after giving birth (picture posed by models) Claire tried to join a mother and baby group, but found that she struggled to find anything in common with the other women apart from the fact that they were all mums. To make matters worse, the new mother also had trouble getting her child to breastfeed. She said: 'I spent three months trying to breastfeed... If I didn't open up and say I can't do this any more I wouldn't have been able to do look after my daughter properly.' Eventually, Claire's emotions got the better of her and she started to spend more and more time at home alone,. until she decided to confide in her husband and other new mothers about the way she was feeling. She said: 'I felt a weight come off my shoulders. I felt like I'd been tense for three or four months. 'My husband would say I like to take control in the house, but I wasn't able to do that. 'He knew it was important for me to find people to connect with while he was at work. 'People say ""don't have structure; you cant have structure with babies"", but I need it. 'I thought, right, every day I'm going to do one little thing that my daughter and I will really enjoy. 'I went out and met two people who will be lifelong friends.' Baby blogger Amy Ransom (right), who appeared with Claire (left) on This Morning believes there is too much pressure on first-time mothers . Baby blogger Amy Ransom, who appeared with Claire on the ITV programme, said: 'There's too much pressure on first-time mothers to live up to expectations. 'We need to give ourselves a break. 'When a mother looks like she has it all planned out, you can bet your life she doesn't. 'We need to make it easy to say ""I'm having a difficult time"". 'There are toddler groups, play groups and all sorts of baby classes you can go to. 'But even figuring out how you're going to get there in your car can be difficult - it's a big thing.' More young first-time mothers aged 18-24 don't attend baby classes and also feel more isolated . Psychotherapist Christine Webber said: 'Often, first time mothers are not prepared for the fact that when they gain a baby they also lose a great deal of their former lives in the shape of their freedom, job, figure and sex life. 'It's important that first time mums are familiar with the concept of postnatal depression so that they don't feel too isolated, ashamed or inadequate if it happens to them - and also that they seek help promptly.' 1. Feelings of loneliness and isolation are not unusual. A proportion of new mothers become seriously depressed following the birth of a baby. This probably won't happen to you - but if you are very sad and weepy do seek help earlier rather than later . 2. Get involved with other young mothers via social media and join a mother-and baby group in your area - perhaps a massage baby class - where you will bond with other new mums as they too get used to being parents. 3. If any friends or relatives offer help, do accept it. Of course you want to be seen to be in charge but a couple of hours off to sleep or to go out for a meal with your partner will elevate your mood – and is a responsible thing to do for yourself. 4. Invite friends round. It's easy to lose sight of who you were before you became a parent. Having a laugh and a gossip with good mates is a great way of boosting your mood and helping you to feel more like you. By Christine Webber .

"A mother who took down an armed carjacker when he smashed into her minivan was given a brand new car on Thursday after video footage of her 'mama bear' act went viral Wednesday. Jessica Leismann, who last year lost a young son to illness, wept as she was given the choice between three new rides courtesy of Southwest Kia in Mesquite and chose a 2015 Sedona minivan with an MSRP of $32,000. 'My kids are going to freak when I drive up in this,' Liesmann told Southwest Kia general manager James Seale. 'Mama bear' Jessica Leismann was given a brand new car on Thursday after she became a local hero for taking down an armed carjacker who'd rear-ended her family minivan at the conclusion of a high speed chase . Overwhelmed: Liesmann, who lost one of her sons last year to epilepsy, was overcome with emotion as she accepted her 2015 Kia Sedona . 'My kids are going to freak when I drive up in this,' said Liesmann, whose 13-year-old son was in the car at the time of the crash . The Sedona will replace the 2005 Nissan Quest carjacker Artai Alexander damaged as his high speed chase came to an abrupt end, reports the Dallas Morning News. The chase in Dallas, Texas was happened Wednesday afternoon when carjacker Alexander, 40, slammed into Leismann's van at an intersection. Aerial footage shows the aftermath of the crash, as maternal instinct kicks in and Leismann jumps out of the car, confronts Alexander and then throws him to the ground as police come in for the arrest. Ms Leismann and her boyfriend Charles Cook had just picked up their 13-year-old son TJ from middle school and were on their way to pick up their younger daughter when the accident happened.

Natural instinct: Ms Leismann (left) and her boyfriend Charles Cook were picking up their kids from school when the incident happened. She says the maternal instinct kicked in and prompted her to confront Alexander (right) 'I jumped out the car and said, ""What the hell is wrong with you, you’re in a school zone, what are you thinking?""' Ms Leismann told NBC DFW. After losing her 4-year-old son Jaylen to epilepsy last year, Leismann says she was spurred to action at the thought of another one of her children dying. The chase started Wednesday afternoon around 3:30pm when Drecelus Hunter was carjacked at gunpoint at a convenience store by Alexander. 'I walked up to the car and he pointed the gun at me,' Hunter told WFAA of the moment Alexander stole his white Dodge Challenger. Ms Leismann's 13-year-old son TJ was in the car at the time of the accident and they were waiting at an intersection in a school zone . Robbery suspect Alexander store the white Dodge Challenger at a convenience store and proceeded on a high speed chase for 20 minutes before coming to a stop . Police arrested Alexander and booked him in the Dallas County Jail on charged of aggravated assault and resisting arrest . He allegedly kept telling Ms Leismann to let him go while she was throwing hits at the scene of the crash . Ms Leismann's boyfriend (in striped hoodie) mostly acted as a buffer between his girlfriend and Alexander . Alexander then went on a 20-minute high-speed chase with police that ended at the intersection where Ms Leismann was waiting. Alexander clearly didn't know what he was getting into when Ms Leismann came barreling out of the driver's seat to the car. 'I think he ran up against a mama bear,' an officer at the scene said. Ms Leismann's boyfriend got out of the car as well to confront Alexander but mostly acted as a buffer between the two. 'She was yelling at the dude, ""Look what you did to my car! Look what you did to my car!""' Cook said. 'And I could hear him saying, ""Just let me go, let me go!"" And she was like, ""No, you're not going nowhere! Look what you just did to my car!"" 'I was yelling all kinds of things that I may not remember... but I hope he does,' Liesmann said. Ms Leismann's 13-year-old son TJ (left) says he's proud of his mother. Ms Leismann's 4-year-old son Jaylen died last August after struggling with epilepsy . ms Leismann's boyfriend Charles Cook (right) was also with her at the time of the crash . 'She's a fighter.

'I’m glad he is in jail because to be honest when I was in the car, I thought I died.'

"THE MATHEMATICS OF LOVE . by Hannah Fry . (Simon & Schuster/TED £7.99) Valentine’s Day can feel like the loneliest day of the year if you haven’t yet found that elusive creature, your true love. The Mathematics of Love by Hannah Fry . The cinema is showing nothing but romcoms, every restaurant is crammed with smug couples holding hands and gazing soppily into each other’s eyes and when you visit the supermarket to buy a ready meal for one and a bottle of consolatory gin, you have to fight your way through a thicket of cheap red roses. Unless you are very young (or exceptionally arrogant), it is hard to feel certain of finding love. That special person may well be out there, but how do you begin the search? And if your heart has already been hurt a couple of times, it can feel as though you have missed your chance. A mathematical equation might not seem the most likely answer to the conundrum of romance. But Dr Hannah Fry, a lecturer in mathematics at University College London, is convinced that ‘mathematics can offer a new way of looking at almost anything — even something as mysterious as love’. In her new book, Hannah admits that many people would question the ability of maths to unlock the secrets of the human heart. ‘Human emotions, unlike mathematical equations, are not neatly ordered or well-behaved,’ she concedes. But she argues that maths is the study of patterns, and ‘love — as with most of life — is full of patterns: from the number of sexual partners we have in our lifetime to how we choose to message on an internet dating website’. To show how the maths might work, she uses the story of Peter Backus, a mathematician and long-standing singleton who once calculated that there were more intelligent alien civilisations in the galaxy than potential girlfriends for him to date. In his paper Why I Don’t Have A Girlfriend, Backus used a formula originally devised by scientists to consider why Earth hasn’t yet been visited by aliens to work out how many women would meet his criteria for a girlfriend. In seven stages, he calculated how many women lived near him in London, how many were in the right age range, how many were single, attractive, with university degrees, likely to find him attractive and get on well with him. At the end of his calculations, he came up with a figure of just 26 potential partners in the entire world, so Peter’s chances of finding a date were looking pretty thin. Has Dr Hannah Fry come up with a formula to help those who are unlucky in love? (picture posed by models) But when Hannah ran the calculations again, with slightly more flexible criteria, she came up with a more encouraging 832 possible partners — and it looks as though her sums were right, for she tells us that Backus got married last year. Having increased our chances of finding a partner by keeping our criteria flexible, it is time to move on to the tricky world of online dating. Here, Hannah has bruising personal experience: ‘It didn’t seem to matter how detailed my online profile was . . . I still routinely found myself seated opposite yet another person asking if my red hair tasted like strawberries.’ You might think that the most beautiful people on any dating website would be the most successful at attracting potential partners. But it is not as simple as that. Using a graph to plot the attractiveness of 5,000 female users of the OKCupid dating site against the numbers of messages they received, Hannah found that people whose looks strongly divided opinion received more messages than those generally rated as quite good-looking. Which is good news for Lady Gaga, if not so great for Anthea Turner. While we’re on the fraught subject of hooking up, we may as well pause to consider what Hannah calls the ‘eligible bachelor paradox’. This is the mysterious imbalance between the quantities of beautiful, intelligent thirtysomething (and above) single women, and the peculiar shortage of equally attractive men of a similar age. Game theory provides the explanation: when we choose our life partners, we are influenced not just by their looks and charm, but by how keen they seem on us. Very attractive women may feel confident enough to play hard to get, while their mousier sisters put in more effort and make off with the prize. Which leads us to the most pressing question of all: when is the ideal moment to decide that you’ve kissed enough frogs in pursuit of your handsome prince and that it may be time to cut your losses and settle down with the current frog, even if he is a bit on the green and warty side? Something with the unromantic name of ‘optimal stopping theory’ provides the answer to this, with a formula that apparently ‘has the power to tell you exactly how many people to reject to give you the best possible chance of finding your perfect partner’. Reduced to its simplest terms, the formula says that if you are destined to date an infinite number of partners, you have the highest probability of finding The One if you reject the first 37 per cent of people you date. The problem with that is that none of us knows in advance how many potential partners we might meet. So a more pragmatic version suggests that you should estimate the length of your dating life, play the field for the first 37 per cent of your dating window and then start thinking about settling down. The theory still has some obvious flaws, in particular the danger of meeting someone kind, good-looking and rich early in your dating life and turning them down in the hope of doing better. But if you’re that dim, you probably deserve to be single. On the bright side, according to Hannah the 37 per cent strategy works equally well for all kinds of choices, including buying a house or hiring an employee. With the help of optimisation maths to avoid disasters on the seating plan at the wedding, and some handy equations to help you live happily ever after (something called the ‘negativity threshold’ is the crucial thing, apparently), this quirky little book combines cool science with warm good sense. And it works! At the very end of the book, Hannah writes that she ‘lives in London with her husband Phil, who — luckily — came along at exactly 38 per cent’. I’m sure luck had nothing to do with it.","Lecturer, Dr Hannah Fry, uses maths to look at love in a new way .

"The owners of a swingers club in rural Arlington, Texas, have agreed to move on after a wave of furious backlash from their neighbors. David and Shannon Esopenko have been throwing weekly erotic parties in their 4,860-square-foot leased home dubbed 'Eutopia' since May 2014. But in January, after neighbors complained, city officials ordered an end to the festivities on the grounds that Eutopia is an illegal home-business. Despite initially fighting the claim, the couple have decided to close their lease and take the party elsewhere. 'We're moving on,' Mr Esopenko told The Dallas Morning News. 'The city of Arlington isn't going to get our $14,000 in taxes every year.' Scroll down for video . Moving on: The couple who held swingers parties at their home in Arlington, Texas, (pictured) are moving on . Parties: Since May, David Esopenko (right) and his wife Shannon have been throwing these parties at the 4,680-square-foot house called 'Eutopia' located in an upscale North Arlington neighborhood . The couple currently lease the house for the private parties that see a guest list of up to 200 people, with lawn space for 70 vehicles, according to the Star Telegram. Though the club did not charge guests, party-goers were encouraged to make donations: $80 for couples, $20 for single women, and $80 for single men. The city held that these donations rake in thousands of dollars a night for Eutopia, but Mr and Mrs Esopenko claim all profits are used for snacks and drinks. While some of the neighborhood's residents questioned the morality of the establishment that offers food, drinks, and condoms, city officials said it is a zoning issue. Erotic: The Esopenkos lease the house for the private parties that see a guest list of up to 200 people, and has reportedly had nearly 60 of the erotic parties - some with themes . Features: The three-story Eutopia features playrooms with mirrors, a dance floor, a pool, and a kitchen . Furnished: The home, leased to Esopenko by its owner James Self, is furnished, but no one lives there . Zoning: While some of the neighborhood's residents question the morality of the establishment that offers food, drinks, and condoms, city officials say it's a zoning issue . Favorite: Many praised the operations at the venue calling it 'sensual' and their 'favorite place to play' Friends: Esopenko held that he was simply throwing parties for his close friends . Events are permissible in homes if it only takes up 20 per cent of the property, according to Arlington law. But officials said they believed Eutopia's clientele were partying all over the house. The city also held that Eutopia is a business operating out of a single-family home because of its regular hours of operation (each weekend from 8.30pm to 3am), its promotional advertising, and its services which include a valet for the guests and sometimes laundry service. On Thursday, Mr Esopenko said he spoke with the owner, James Self, and they decided it would be 'mutually agreeable' to move the parties elsewhere. He said: 'We’re still gonna throw parties wherever we move. That’s how we like to spend our free time. 'I know one neighbor who had a burr up his butt is probably doing a dance because we’re leaving, but it doesn’t bother us one bit. 'This had nothing to do with zoning. We could say we’re no longer taking donations. It would not have mattered in the least to the neighbors and the city. 'The city tried to make it out like it was zoning. But we were under no delusions. This was all about morality. They knew it, we knew it. They had to say that for political and legal reason. Everybody knows what it was about.' Officials began investigating Eutopia after receiving complaints from neighbors about noise and weekend traffic. Police allegedly sent undercover officers to investigate the alleged 'sex club' after receiving multiple complaints last summer but the officers reported no illegal activity going on in the residence. According to the Telegram, the three-story Eutopia features several playrooms with mirrors, a dance floor, a pool, and a kitchen area. It is completely furnished but there are no permanent residents. Speaking to WFAA, Esopenko defended the club as a healthy alternative to normal clubs: . 'The average person that comes is a nurse, teacher, fireman, policeman, judge, former Arlington city councilman. 'These are people who don't like to go to normal clubs to hang out because they are too dark, too loud.' And the 'lifestyle venue' has received positive reviews on swinger sites like Swinger Date Club. Many praised the operations at the three-story venue calling it 'sensual' and their 'favorite place to play.' Other reviewers have described Eutopia as a 'clean, beautiful home full of sexy, smart people,' the Telegram reports. One reviewer wrote: 'The only drawback I've found is the mattresses are a little hard, but that won't stop me from having fun there.'","David and Shannon Esopenko were running weekly parties since May .

"Between soaring expectations and a flood of gimmicks, Valentine’s Day can be a costly affair. If you’ve used up all your funds on a glamorous present for your main squeeze, don’t fret: a fast food store on the south-coast of NSW is offering a Valentine’s meal that doesn't dent your wallet. Warilla McDonald's will host the frugally-romantic dinner option - the only store around the country offering the service - which will see black tie waiters serving the standard menu with crockery and glassware. They're even taking reservations. Aleida Moulton and John Dwarte treat themselves to the romantic Valentine's Day table-service at McDonald's . The restaurant is offering the standard menu on crockery, as well as treating diners to candles, romantic music and tables adorned with roses . The restaurant has vowed it will be a ‘genuinely romantic dining experience’, with patrons treated to candles, romantic tunes and tables adorned with red roses. Warilla store manager Michelle Steain told Daily Mail Australia the promotion has garnered an overwhelming response. ‘We've had about 60 reservations so far and the phone is running hot,’ she said. The restaurant has taken bookings from all walks of life, from young families to teens to elderly couples. ‘We were initially appealing to young families, but it has really taken flight. We’re getting reservations from as far as Terrigal, which is several hours away,’ said Steain. Tegan Madruga and John Dwarte are served by a formally dressed waiter, another feature of the Valentine's Day service . Warilla is the only store in Australia to offer the service, after coming up with the idea several years ago. ‘We first ran the promotion back in 2013, and it was covered by media around the world. Last year, stores in America and Britain took a page from our book and offered the same service.’ The service has met with some disapproval on social media, with some taking the restaurant to task. Brendan J Leach wrote on Facebook: 'How much of a cheapskate can you be to take your date to maccas for a romantic date. Trust maccas to try and profit from it.' Diane Brown said: 'No no no no no! Pure Bogan! Fish and chips on the beach is better!' The restaurant manager has vowed it will be a ‘genuinely romantic dining experience’ When asked to outline what diners can expect, Steain said it will be a ‘genuinely romantic dining experience.’ ‘Expect candles, flowers and smooth FM Love Song dedications to set the mood. The prices are the same as normal, so you would be pressed to find a cheaper option for a romantic Valentine's dinner.'

"The eurozone will unravel unless its leaders agree to 'shell out' to Greece, Boris Johnson said last night. The London Mayor, speaking during a tour of the US, risked undermining efforts to persuade Athens to make concessions – insisting it was in a 'strong position'. 'They will shell out in one way or the other,' Mr Johnson said of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other eurozone leaders. 'Everybody in power in Europe basically reckons … they have got to try and keep this thing together so I think they will try to do a deal with [Greek prime minister] Tsipras.' Boris Johnson said the eurozone will unravel unless its leaders agree to 'shell out' to Greece, pictured giving a speech in New York . He also predicted to Bloomberg TV that there would be 'a huge amount of fudge all over the floor'. Mr Johnson joined David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne in urging an end to the 'stand-off' between Athens and the eurozone leaders, warning of the 'huge contagious impact' of Greece crashing out of the single currency. The Prime Minister used his first meeting with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Brussels to urge him to reach a compromise over demands that the conditions of his country's vast bailout are torn up, ending years of austerity. He also suggested eurozone leaders should give some ground. Syriza, the most Left-wing party ever to take power in Europe, is threatening to turn to Russia for help if the eurozone cuts it adrift. Mr Cameron said: 'The British economy is growing but we are affected by the situation on the European continent and the longer this stand-off goes on the worse potentially that could be for Britain.' The Prime Minister used his first meeting with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Brussels to urge him to reach a compromise over demands . German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has sent shockwaves through Europe by declaring that if Athens does not sign up to continue its aid and austerity programme 'then that's it'. The European Central Bank is upping pressure on Greece to extend its bailout deal when its current one expires at the end of this month, or risk a bank collapse. Mr Tsipras insists he has no intention of extending the €240billion EU/IMF package. Yesterday, ECB officials were said to be discussing how long they could continue to keep Greek banks afloat. Mrs Merkel said: 'Europe always aims to find a compromise, and that is the success of Europe. Germany is ready for that. 'However, it must also be said that Europe's credibility naturally depends on us respecting rules and being reliable with each other.'","Boris said eurozone will unravel unless leaders 'shell out' to Greece .

"Eating out is a lottery with as few as half of the food outlets in some areas meeting hygiene requirements, it is claimed today. The warning comes from Which?, who say local councils in some areas are letting the owners of restaurants, cafes and takeaways get away with putting customers at risk. The consumer champion said half a million people suffer from food poisoning every year, yet people eating out are not getting the protection they deserve. It surveyed food hygiene reports submitted by all 398 local authorities in the UK, based on their surveys of eating establishments in their areas, to the Food Standards Agency. Only around half of the restaurants in Enfield were meeting minimum health requirements, with Edinburgh second on the list followed by Lewisham, Harrow, Camden and Brent (file image) Which? said: ‘We found Enfield in London was the poorest performing local authority with only 54 per cent of its medium and high risk businesses meeting hygiene requirements.’ These requirements can range from simple things like ensuring there are proper hand washing facilities and keeping raw and cooked meat separate, to  concerns about rats and mice. ‘The City Of Edinburgh was second to bottom, with five other London councils in our bottom 10 - Lewisham, Ealing, Harrow, Camden and Brent.’ Others criticised for not doing enough to make food outlets clean up their act were the city of Birmingham, along with Falkirk, Perth and Kinross in Scotland. Which? said: ‘Businesses are ultimately responsible for complying with hygiene rules but local authorities are tasked with enforcing compliance. 'More than nine in 10 people said it is important that local authorities ensure compliance with food hygiene rules.’ The watchdog’s executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘Our research reveals a shocking postcode lottery on food hygiene where in some places you may as well toss a coin before deciding which restaurant to trust with your health. ‘Consumers expect local authorities to check that food businesses in their area comply with hygiene standards and rigorously enforce the rules. ‘Local authorities should do more to make the best use of resources, respond effectively to risks across the food supply chain and ensure consumers are adequately protected wherever they live.’ Which? based its rankings on three criteria - the proportion of premises ranked as high or medium risk in a local authority that were compliant with food hygiene requirements; the percentage of premises that had been rated for risk; and the proportion of inspections and other follow ups that were carried out. Cherwell District Council in North Oxfordshire was rated as the best performing local authority for a second year running. It was ahead of Brentwood, Essex, Broxbourne, in Hertfordshire, Basingstoke and Deane, and Hartlepool. Enfield council rejected the Which? findings, saying it had misunderstood the figures. It said the measures used by the consumer group failed to give proper weight to the fact its officials are particularly thorough and more likely than other councils to force the owners of dirty food businesses to take action. The council’s Cabinet Member for Environment and Community Safety, Chris Bond, said: ‘We can say with confidence that their researchers clearly do not understand the figures they have used to rank local authority food safety teams; that their interpretation of the data they have gathered is incorrect and their conclusions are nonsense.’ He said the work of Enfield council was marked down by Which? because they are more likely to find a problem. Mr Bond said this is because they are diligent and it was ‘ludicrous’ to suggest otherwise. ‘Under the Which? assessment criteria, the more businesses you close or prosecute for hygiene failings the worse, the job you are doing, that is clearly a ridiculous suggestion,’ he said. Reasons for failing health requirements could range from simple problems such as not keeping raw and cooked meat separate, to larger concerns about mice and rats (file image) ‘This research is so fundamentally flawed that I would not wrap my chips in the paper it is printed on. We think there are better ways of measuring the performance of food safety teams.’ He said Enfield has the 10th highest number of prosecutions of food businesses in the country, it is 31st for the seizure of unfit food and 33rd for issuing improvement notices to food outlets they are worried about. The Local Government Association said efforts to tackle dirty and dangerous restaurants are being hampered by big cuts in funding from the Government. Its regulation spokesman, Nick Worth, said: ‘Councils are working hard to improve food safety standards and there is some excellent work being done in this area. 'Councils will always try to make the best possible use of the resources they have. However, they are being hamstrung by a 40 per cent core funding cut from government. ‘These figures don’t necessarily reflect the challenges and circumstances that councils in different areas are tackling. 'Most importantly, it needs to be remembered that it is ultimately the responsibility of the outlets themselves to ensure food is produced in a safe environment that complies with the law.’","In Enfield only half of high risk businesses are meeting safety standards .

"A mother has lashed out at vaccine-hesitant parents after being told her 15-day-old son may have measles. Jennifer Hibben-White took her newborn son Griffin, who is too young to be vaccinated, to hospital for a routine check-up in late January. Two days later she received a call from a public health official explaining Griffin had been exposed to the life-threatening disease in the waiting room in Pilkington, Ontario. It comes just three years after Hibben-White's five-year-old daughter Olivia died in her sleep due to an undetected blood infection. Furious, Hibben-White, a vice-president of marketing at a private school, vented her anger in a Facebook post which has been cited as the inspiration for hundreds of parents to get their children vaccinated. Furious: Jennifer Hibben-White and her husband Glenn are furious after being told 15-day-old Griffin could have been exposed to measles while waiting for a routine check-up at an Ontario hospital last month . She and husband Glenn still have to wait three days for a diagnosis, and their three-year-old daughter has only had one MMR jab, which they hope will protect her. In the post, which amassed more than 270,000 shares and 'likes' in just a few hours, White wrote: . 'You think you are protecting them by letting them eat their shovel full of dirt and reducing antibiotics and eating organic? You aren't,' she wrote. 'And you would be the first to line up if you had an inkling of what the death of a child feels like. 'You would be crawling through the streets on your hands and knees, begging, BEGGING to get that vaccine into your precious babies.' She continued: 'You think you are protecting them through extracts and homeopathy and positive thoughts and Laws of Attraction and dancing by candlelight on a full moon? You aren't. 'I PROTECT YOUR CHILD. We protect your child. By being concerned world citizens who care about ourselves, our fellow man, and our most vulnerable. So we vaccinate ourselves and our children.' Since her post, White has received more than 200 messages from across the world - as far as the United Kingdom, Germany and New Zealand. Agonizing wait: The family has to wait three more days to hear if Griffin is infected with the disease . Further fears: Their three-year-old daughter Aurelia only has one MMR jab which they hope will protect her . She told The Star: '(The) messages are saying that you've really made me think about this issue and this issue in my family and I've decided to vaccinate. 'I'm not saying anything that the scientific community hasn't been saying for decades. 'I think (the post) really struck home the repercussions – the potential repercussions – of people's quote unquote choice to vaccinate.' More than 100 people in California and others in several states and Mexico have been infected with measles since an outbreak traced to Disneyland was first reported in December. A Center for Disease Control statement said that it has been dealing with a large, ongoing multi-state outbreak since the beginning of the year. Though the vast majority of cases are in California, 18 states and Washington DC had seen cases as of Tuesday. Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington have seen patients with measles. Political figures have weighed in on the issue of vaccination, with President Barack Obama saying that there is 'no reason' for all parents not to have their children immunized. The year 2014 saw a record number of measles cases, with 644 patients across 27 states. Last year had one major outbreak that consisted of 383 cases in the unvaccinated Ohio Amish community. The US normally sees less than 100 measles cases a year. This is my son Griffin, and he may have measles. On February 9th, I received a phone call from York Region Public Health, informing me that Griffin, alongside my mother and I, was potentially exposed to the measles virus while attending a newborn weigh-in appointment at my doctor's office in Markham on January 27th. Griffin was 15 days old at the time. I was informed that someone who later developed measles sat in the doctor's waiting room between 1 hour before and 30 minutes before we arrived. I was also informed that measles is regarded as 'airborne' and can stay in the air and on surfaces up to 2 hours after the infected person has left. I was then asked if I had had the measles vaccine. I had. Griffin. Griffin had not. Can not. I was advised to not be around small children. If I worked in such an environment I would be written off work. I do work in such an environment; my home. Where I now sit with Griffin and my 3 year old, Aurelia, who has only been able to get one MMR vaccine so far. She is now, technically, exposed too. We are to sit tight and watch for symptoms: fever, cough, runny nose. If we develop any of these we are to call my doctor and arrange to come in under official medical precautions. We are to wait at home, in isolation, until February 17th, after which the 21 days of possible incubation will have passed and we are clear. So, Griffin is now Schrödinger's baby. Simultaneously with measles, and without it. Until he develops symptoms, or until a further 7 days pass. One or other. And I'm angry. Angry as hell. I won't get angry at or blame the person in the waiting room. I would have likely done the same thing...you get sick, you go to the doctor. I have no idea what their story is and I will never know. But I do know one thing: . If you have chosen to not vaccinate yourself or your child, I blame you. I blame you. You have stood on the shoulders of our collective protection for too long. From that high height, we have given you the PRIVILEGE of our protection, for free. And in return, you gave me this week. A week from hell. Wherein I don't know if my BABY will develop something that has DEATH as a potential outcome. DEATH. Now, let's unpack this shall we. All out on the table. You have NO IDEA what this 'potential outcome' means. NO IDEA. I do. Unfortunately, I do. You think you are protecting your children from thimerosal? You aren't. It's not in their vaccine. You think you are protecting them from autism? You aren't. There is no, none, nada, nothing in science that proves this. If you want to use google instead of science to 'prove me wrong' then I am happy to call you an imbecile as well as misinformed. You think you are protecting them through extracts and homeopathy and positive thoughts and Laws of Attraction and dancing by candlelight on a full moon? You aren't. I PROTECT YOUR CHILD. We protect your child. By being concerned world citizens who care about ourselves, our fellow man, and our most vulnerable. So we vaccinate ourselves and our children. You think you are protecting them by letting them eat their shovel full of dirt and reducing antibiotics and eating organic? You aren't. As an unvaccinated person you are only protected by our good graces. WE LET YOU BE SO PRIVILEGED thanks to our willingness to vaccinate ourselves and our children.

The fact is, there was no vaccine for her. Not for her illness. And she died. She died at age five and a half, and she is gone. And I watch these arguments trotted out on Facebook and twitter citing false science and long discredited'studies' that just won't stop and Jenny McCarthy quotes and 'it's MY choice' to not vaccinate...and I think...what would you have done if your child lay dying? Would you give them a scientifically proven, safe and effective vaccine and risk the minuscule likelihood of a side effect? Or would you let them go, knowing that at least they won't develop autism (which they wouldn't even develop anyway because SCIENCE)? And don't you DARE tell me that you wouldn't vaccinate them then. Don't you dare. You have no idea what it feels like to go through what we went through. So, look at Griffin. Tell me why he gets to bear the brunt of your stupidity and reckless abuse of our protection? Tell me. Seven more days until I know that my baby is safe. Seven more days.

"Convicted: Lemar Loveless, 26, is one of four British Army soldiers convicted of attempting to smuggle guns and cocaine into the UK . Four German-based British Army soldiers have been convicted of attempting to smuggle weapons and drugs into the UK. A 'well-planned' operation to bring five guns and cocaine worth £70,000 to Britain from mainland Europe was masterminded by a former member of an elite cavalry regiment, Woolwich Crown Court heard. Police arrested Lemar Loveless, 26, less than a week after he the Queen's Royal Hussars along with former regimental colleague Trave Dyce, 22, as the pair drove BMWs to the UK with the guns and drugs. Officers also found ammunition and silencers when they searched the cars. Police confiscated Loveless and Dyce's phones and managed to find a link with an Italian seller in Germany and a buyer of the goods based in London. Messages recovered from the phones found that the pair went to Amsterdam in Holland via Germany and collected the guns - two German Walther PPKs and three Italian converted pistols - and cocaine. The goods were stored inside a ball of tape lined with curry powder in a bid to fool sniffer dogs. Though the guns were army issue, they were bought from a German-based Italian contact. Piecing together the puzzle, officers worked out that Romone Marshelleck, 24, was to receive the guns to pass on to members of the London criminal underworld. Police raided his Tooting, south London home and found pictures of him on an iPad posing with guns and ammunition. Duran Wright, 28, of the Royal Logistic Corps and Lance Laurent, 26, of the Queen's Royal Hussars, were also arrested after messages linked them to the operation. Another two soldiers could also face questioning. Caught: Trave Dyce, left, is to be sentenced for conspiracy to import firearms and Class A drugs, while civilian Romone Marshalleck, right, has been convicted of conspiracy to import firearms . Police have vowed to continue to investigate after managing to analyse 'secure' phones used by gangsters. Detective Inspector Chris Jones of the Metropolitan Police's Trident Gang Crime Command, told The Independent that the weapons 'would inevitably have been used to commit acts of serious violence on the streets of London.' The four soldiers were convicted of conspiracy to import Class A drugs and firearms while Marshelleck was convicted of conspiracy to import firearms. They will be sentenced on Friday.

"After taking urgent legal action, mining magnate Gina Rinehart will likely be allowed to watch the second episode of the Nine Networks controversial new program, House of Hancock, amid concerns about falsehoods and defamation. Following a desperate bid to prevent the network from airing the second half of the program, Justice Peter Garling said that there was a real prospect the show would air statements that weren't entirely truthful- and perhaps even made up. Justice Garling ordered the Nine Network to hand over a DVD of the episode- due to be broadcast on Sunday- after pointing to remarks made by entertainment reporter Peter Ford that the second episode made Ms Rinehart look like an 'obsessed, vindictive shrew'. Scroll down for video . Mining magnate Gina Rinehart has taken urgent legal action in the NSW Supreme Court in a bid to stop the Nine Network from airing the second half of its program, House of Hancock, on Sunday night. The episode is only allowed to be viewed by Ms Rinehart, her senior and junior counsel and a several solicitors. Ms Rinehart's lawyers must inform the Nine Network if they are going to make an application to stop the broadcast of the show by 9.15pm. Ms Rinehart's barrister Tom Blackburn asked the NSW Supreme Court on Friday to grant an application that would allow her lawyers to view the program before it goes to air on Sunday night. Her lawyers want to see if there are any grounds to seek an urgent injunction and prevent the second part of the series from airing. Mr Blackburn told the court about alleged inaccuracies in the first instalment and said the second episode was potentially malicious and defamatory. He said the action was sparked when Nine's A Current Affair program ran a story promoting the upcoming episode. '(It) gave my client cause for enormous concern about the likely ... honesty of that program,' he said. He said there was real concern about the 'severity of falsehood about to be broadcast'. 'Channel Nine knows that some of it is made up,' Mr Blackburn told the court. The first episode of the two-part series aired last Sunday and dramatises the relationship between Ms Rinehart and her late father Lang Hancock. It focuses on the romance between the Ms Rinehart's father and his Filipino housemaid Rose Lacson, which triggered the breakdown of Australia's Dynasty-style family when she became his third wife in 1985. Described by the Nine Network as a must-see drama event, it features Mandy McElhinney as Ms Rinehart, Sam Neill as Mr Hancock and Peta Sergeant as Rose. More than 1.4 million viewers tuned in for the first instalment last Sunday. Ms Rinehart, pictured here with youngest daughter Ginia, wants to see if there are any grounds to seek an urgent injunction and prevent the second part of the series from airing on Sunday . Mr Hancock and his daughter (pictured here in real life) had a strong relationship in the eighties, but it later deteriorated following his relationship with Rose . Tad Watroba, executive director of Hancock Prospecting, issued a statement to Nine's network boss David Gyngell following the first episode saying it was 'tacky' and 'damaging the memory of good Australians'. He said many of the scenes aired were fictitious, unfounded or grossly distorted. 'I know the facts, and this show has turned out to be a tacky grab for ratings, damaging the memory of good Australians along the way,' Mr Watroba said. 'Since starting promotion of the show, Channel 9 has not bothered to fact-check anything despite repeated offers when people have pointed out mistakes. Scenes from the series showed Hancock (played by Sam Neil) having sex with housekeeper Rose Lacson (Peta Sergeant) and Rinehart discovering their affair. 'You're the subject of dirty old man jokes from one end of Australia to the next,' Ms Rinehart, who was played by Mandy McElhinney, says. The first episode of the two-part series aired last Sunday and dramatises the relationship between Ms Rinehart (played by Mandy McElhinney) and her late father Lang Hancock (Sam Neil) A heated row depicts the father and daughter's explosive relationship when Gina begs: 'You're destroying this family, what will people think, stop it, she's after your money' A heated row depicts the father and daughter's explosive relationship when Gina begs: 'You're destroying this family, what will people think, stop it, she's after your money.' Her headstrong father retorts: 'You're the embarrassment, not me, you've let yourself go since having kids.. Look at the baby elephant you've become,' he barks. Hancock, once Australia's richest man, was smitten with his housekeeper despite the 37-year age gap and pursues the relationship smashing the bond he shared with his only child. What ensues is an increasingly bitter public feud spanning two decades involving murder accusations, drug charges, court cases, illegitimate children and betrayal until his death in 1992, aged 82. Among the alleged errors in House of Hancock, according to Mr Watroba, is the fact Mr Hancock and Ms Rinehart had a loving, father/daughter relationship. Mr Watroba also said Ms Rinehart was very close to her mother and did not continue to holiday or honeymoon in the United States when her mother was dying as the show has suggested. 'Mr Hancock never told Mrs Rinehart that no one could ever love her, or that her husband never loved her. The scene was made up and untrue. Her relationship with Mr Frank Rinehart was very loving, and her mother loved her son-in-law also,' he said. The show depicts Hancock's smitten relationship with his housekeeper despite the 37-year age gap . Described by the Nine Network as a must-see drama event, it features Mandy McElhinney as Ms Rinehart, Sam Neill as Mr Hancock and Peta Sergeant as Rose . Rose was initially hired by Ms Rinehart to help her newly widowed father after her mother Hope Margaret passed away in 1983. She went on to marry her boss two years later in 1985. Ms Rinehart was bitterly opposed to the relationship and made a point of not attending the wedding in Sydney and even opposed Rose's business visa when she her father first began dating. The mining heiress now remains locked in a bitter legal fight with three of her children, John, Bianca and Hope. The trio are trying to remove their magnate mother from the position of trustee of the multi-million dollar family trust, set up by Hancock for his grandchildren in 1988.

"A couple who let their pet dog's hair become so long he could not see from behind his matted fringe have been banned from keeping animals for a decade. Long-haired mongrel Rocky had to be sedated to be clipped after RSPCA officials discovered his dirty, matted fur. His owners Jason Antony Arnold, 43, and Kerry Ann Webber, 31 both pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges at Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court in Dyfed, Wales. Rocky's hair was so long he could not see from behind his matted fringe, according to RSPCA officials . They were ordered to pay £500 costs plus a £60 victim surcharge each and were told they must carry out a total of 130 hours unpaid work. Arnold admitted he did not take steps to ensure the needs of a long haired cross in terms of a suitable environment, diet and access to fresh drinking water. The couple both pleaded guilty to failing to protect him from pain, injury, suffering and disease. RSPCA inspector Keith Hogben said: 'Rocky was so matted the poor dog could not see. He had to be sedated to clip him properly. 'Just brushing him daily and a clip would have sorted this out. It is very sad it had to come to this. If you are not coping just ask for help. 'He is such a nice and friendly dog and will now be rehomed.' Arnold was given 90 hours of unpaid work and Webber was given 40 hours.

"Military chiefs have drawn up plans for a 'show of force' to warn Argentina against hostile action over the Falkland Islands. There are fears of Buenos Aires-sanctioned aggression after March's referendum if islanders as expected, vote in favour of retaining links with Britain. In response, extra troops, another warship and an additional RAF Typhoon fighter jet could be deployed or high-profile military exercises carried out in the South Atlantic as a deterrent. Show of force: Additional military support could be sent to the Falklands to support HMS Edinburgh (pictured), which is currently patrolling the South Atlantic Ocean, as tensions over the islands' future rise ahead of the March referendum . Ours: A British flag is planted at a farm in the Falkland Islands. Residents will vote in a referendum on March 11 about whether they want to remain part of the UK . This could also involve the deployment of the Royal Navy’s Response Task Force Group, a flotilla comprising destroyers, a frigate, a submarine and commandos. Defence chiefs could also dispatch elements of the Army’s 16 Air Assault Brigade — the airborne task force which includes members of the Parachute Regiment — which has just completed a series of demanding exercises in Spain preparing for 'general war'. Islanders will vote on March 11 on whether they wish to remain an overseas territory of the UK. It is expected there will be a 100 per cent 'yes' vote, which intelligence officials have warned the Prime Minister could lead to an aggressive 'stunt' by Argentina, such as planting the country's flag on the island. Warning: David Cameron says he would be prepared to use military force again should tensions over the Falkland Islands escalate further . Other possibilities include the harassment by the Argentine Navy of the Falklands’ fishing fleet and the disruption of British oil and gas exploration. It is feared such a move would escalate tensions quickly if the Royal Navy was ordered to intervene. A senior defence source told the paper: 'Britain needs to be in a situation to respond very quickly to a whole series of threats - that is why we have contingency plans. Our posture has not changed but neither are we complacent. 'There are a number of contingencies to deal with any threat to the Falklands and they are currently being reviewed. No orders have been given to any military unit at this stage but prudent planning within all units who could be deployed in the event of a crisis is taking place. 'That is quite normal. Commanders like to be two steps ahead rather than two steps behind.' It is understood elements of force — such as a 150-strong company group — can be flown to the Falklands via Ascension Island, in a matter of hours if needed. Members of 3 Para recently returned from the islands as part of a routine deployment and would be perfectly placed to brief additional troops deploying at short notice. About 1,500 troops are permanently based on the islands, together with four RAF Typhoon jets and anti-aircraft and artillery batteries. Prince William recently served with the RAF’s search and rescue helicopter unit based at Port Stanley. A Royal Navy destroyer, currently HMS Edinburgh, is always on duty in the South Atlantic, working alongside the patrol ship HMS Clyde, the fleet tanker HMS Gold and the ice patrol ship HMS Protector. One of the Royal Navy’s nuclear powered submarines is always on notice to move to the region if the diplomatic situation deteriorates. Last year HMS Dauntless, a Type 45 destroyer and one of the Royal Navy’s most capable vessels was dispatched to the South Atlantic during the 30th commemoration of the war. Despite hostile rhetoric from Argentine president Cristina Kirchner, the British government believes that Buenos Aries currently lacks both the political will and military capability to recapture the islands. But the Prime Minister has told his cabinet and senior defence chiefs that Britain should not be complacent and must be fully prepared for every eventuality. Soldiers prepare to advance on Port Stanley during the Falklands War in 1982: (L-R) Pte Dave Parr (RIP), LCpl Neil Turner, Pte Terry Stears . Just last week the Mr Cameron insisted that Britain would not shirk from defending the islands if Argentina attempted another invasion. Referring to a recent briefing on the Falklands at a National Security Council meeting, the Prime Minister said: 'I get regular reports on this entire issue because I want to know that our defences are strong, our resolve is extremely strong. 'We have strong defences in place on the Falkland Islands, that is absolutely key, that we have fast jets stationed there, we have troops stationed on the Falklands.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, said: 'Our overall military posture on the Falkland Islands remains unchanged and they remain well-defended. 'The Ministry of Defence has always had contingency plans in place to increase the military footprint in the South Atlantic if required.'","'Britain needs to be able to respond quickly to series of threats'

"At the time it was reported as a moment of triumph, an early success in a campaign to suppress a communist-backed insurgency rising up against British colonial rule. But the killing of 24 Chinese villagers by a patrol of the Scots Guards 64 years ago is one of the most controversial episodes in British imperial history - and it could soon be investigated in an official inquiry. Next month, lawyers for the victims' families will present new evidence in a London court, claiming the villagers were murdered in cold blood and that the truth about the killings has been covered up ever since. They say a full investigation has never been carried out into the incident, which has been described as 'Britain's My Lai', a reference to the killing of Vietnamese villagers by US forces during the Vietnam War. Emergency: At the time of the killings, British forces were trying to quell a growing communist rebellion which mainly involved Chinese insurgents . The case centres on an incident in December 1948 at the height of the Malayan Emergency, the insurgency against British colonial rule in what is now Malaysia. The dead were Chinese labourers working in Batang Kali, a rubber plantation north of Kuala Lumpur, but colonial authorities at the time claimed they were suspected terrorists killed while trying to escape. That claim is likely to be challenged on May 8 when law firm Bindmans brings the lawsuit in the divisional court. New evidence to be presented at the hearing is expected to include information gathered during a Malaysian police inquiry carried out in the 1990s. Details from the police investigation were obtained by Ian Ward and Norma Miraflor, authors of a book about the killings, entitled Slaughter and Deception at Batang Kali. Although a number of the Scots Guardsmen involved in the incident are still alive, the victims' families are not expected to seek criminal prosecutions. But the solicitor leading the case, John Halford, told The Times: 'There is an overwhelming case for a proper investigation, along with an immediate apology and reparation.' The Batang Kali killings have been compared with the My Lai massacre, which prompted outrage over the U.S.military campaign in Vietnam . At the time of the killings, British forces were trying to quell a growing communist rebellion which mainly involved Chinese insurgents. Three British soldiers had been burnt alive by insurgents a few days before, and there were reports of 'bandit' activity in the Batang Kali area. A 16-strong unit of Scots Guards responded on December 11, surrounding the rubber estate at Sunga Rimoh, close to the Batang Kali river. The Chinese men were separated from women and children. One man was shot that night, the remaining 23 the next day. A few of the bodies were mutilated, according to some reports. The village was burnt after the women and children were taken away. No weapons were found and the leader of the Malayan National Liberation Army, Chin Peng, has said that none of the villagers was linked to the insurgency. The case follows legal action taken against the Foreign Office last year by a group of Kenyans who claim they were tortured during the Mau Mau uprising, which ran from 1952 to 1960. The My Lai massacre, to which the Batang Kali killings have been compared, was one of the most notorious incidents of the Vietnam War. Up to 500 unarmed civilians were killed by U.S. soldiers during the episode in South Vietnam on March 16, 1968. Most of the women were children or elderly, and some of the bodies were later found to be mutilated. Details only came to light publicly in 1969, prompting widespread outrage and fuelling opposition to the war. Twenty-six soldiers were charged with criminal offences over My Lai, but only one was convicted - platoon leader Second Lieutenant William Calley. Calley was found guilty of killing 22 villagers and was initially handed a life service, but he served only three and a half years under house arrest. The Mau Mau lawsuit, which is expected to come to court in July, led to the discovery of colonial-era documents in secret Foreign Office archives in Buckinghamshire. The Government has begun releasing sensitive documents removed from the colonies before independence and the first batch, provided last week, included papers relating to the Malayan Emergency. However, the files on Batang Kali are missing. The Guardsmen were cleared by a brief investigation into Batang Kali carried out in 1949, which found the killings were 'a bona fide mistake'. But some of those involved in the inquiry later claimed they gave false evidence to ensure the soldiers were not blamed. A second inquiry began in 1970, only to be shelved by the incoming Tory Government. In the same year, the People newspaper quoted one of the soldiers as saying: 'Once we started firing we seemed to go mad... I remember the water turning red with their blood.' The incident again came under scrutiny in 1992 with a BBC documentary, but the Foreign Office insisted no fresh evidence had been uncovered to justify another inquiry. Last September, the High Court ordered a full hearing into the case.

"Chancellor George Osborne has been accused of rushing through the changes ahead of the election . Hundreds of thousands of savers face pensions chaos because radical new reforms are being implemented too quickly, experts warned yesterday. Chancellor George Osborne was accused of rushing through the changes ahead of the election. Savers aged 55 or over will be allowed to cash in their entire pension pot and invest it how they please from April 6. The move is designed to give them more freedom by ensuring they are no longer forced to buy a poor value annuity locking them into a meagre income for the rest of their lives. But with less than two months before the biggest overhaul of personal pensions in a century, there are growing fears that savers and insurance firms will not be ready for the deadline. Experts fear many savers will squander their nest eggs, while others wanting to take advantage of the changes will be turned down by their pensions firm. Yesterday the boss of one of the UK's biggest insurance companies criticised ministers for setting an 'incredibly aggressive timetable' and warned it could lead to savers making 'poor decisions' with their money. Phil Loney of Royal London said the Government had 'plucked this April deadline out of the air'. He added: 'We wholeheartedly support the policy objective but customers are not ready for the new pension freedoms, which have been thrown into place in an entirely unrealistic timescale. 'I fear that many will make the wrong, often irrecoverable decisions about their retirement and this will result in some very poor outcomes.' Scroll down for video . Insurance company bosses have also criticised the City watchdog for making it impossible for them to prepare for the changes. Firms are still waiting for the Financial Conduct Authority to publish rules stipulating the guidance they should be giving to those wanting to exploit the pensions freedoms. Nigel Green, the boss of financial adviser deVere Group, called the preparations 'alarmingly chaotic' and accused the Government of a 'cynical ploy' to win votes ahead of May's election. He said firms will struggle to update their computer systems in time, meaning thousands wanting to cash in their pots will not be allowed to do so. Experts fear many savers will squander their nest eggs, while others wanting to take advantage of the changes will be turned down by their pensions firm . 'It seems as though this monumental shake-up of Britain's pension landscape is being pushed through to win support from the influential over-55 demographic ahead of the forthcoming General Election,' he added. Under the changes, savers will be able to cash in a quarter of their pension pot tax free – as they can do now. But if they cash in the rest, it will be added to their taxable income for the year – meaning they could lose up to 45 per cent of it in tax. Government adviser Dr Ros Altmann rejected criticism from insurers, saying: 'They have had plenty of time and should stop complaining.' A Treasury spokesman said: 'The Government believes people who have worked hard and saved all their lives should have the freedom to decide how to use their savings.' Act now or risk a fiasco, Money Mail analysis . April 6, 2015, is supposed to be the day pensions receive the biggest shake-up in generations. It is the date when everyone retiring should be handed the power to do whatever they want with their nest eggs. But those hoping to draw down cash from their company pension are facing the stark prospect that they will be refused. Anyone with a private scheme could be forced to move their entire pension to a different company. Insurance and investment companies won’t be ready, and only a few will be able to offer the freedoms that have been promised. It threatens to bring confusion and frustration for millions of retirees. Insurers blame the Government and regulators for failing to help them implement new rules. Those hoping to draw down cash from their company pension are facing the stark prospect that they will be refused . And on this occasion they seem justified in passing the buck. They’ve had less than a year to overhaul a system that has been working in the same way for decades – and largely they have had to do it in the dark. An act of Parliament for pension schemes has not been passed into law yet. Only last week did the City regulator outline how it will be monitoring firms, and even then in the vaguest terms. Savers retiring up to six months from now are already receiving letters from insurers which should be pointing them in the direction of a new free guidance service. But the website for this was only launched on Wednesday, and there is still no phone number pensioners can call for help. Just 300 staff will be on hand to provide this service. And there have been suggestions that helpers giving face-to-face advice will be inexperienced – if they are ready at all. Insurance bosses say they have been pleading with policy-makers for more details on how to implement the rules, but that this has not been forthcoming. Some firms have attempted to launch new types of pensions which will allow people to keep their money invested and pay an income, but also take chunks of their savings when they want. However, these are largely untested. Others have pulled the plug on new schemes because they have found them to be unworkable. It’s a realistic possibility that it will be 2016 before most savers are able to benefit from the pension freedoms. Unless regulators and policy-makers act swiftly, instead of pension freedoms we’ll have a pensions fiasco. And it will leave thousands of savers frustrated, unable to get help, and at risk of making a catastrophic and irreversible mistake with their retirement savings.","Chancellor George Osborne accused of rushing through the changes .

"The Church of England is to allow full funerals for the first time to people who die by suicide. The decision sweeps away ecclesiastical laws which for centuries have said suicide is sinful and those who die by their own hand must be denied the complete rites of Christian burial. The Church’s parliament, the General Synod, voted overwhelmingly yesterday to end the ban on funerals for suicides to signal its compassion for the vulnerable. Synod members also heard that many clergy do give burial services to suicides and have done so for years despite the letter of Church law. Members of the General Synod (pictured) voted by 262 to five to allow a full burial for those who have committed suicide. The practice is thought to be widespread already, despite church law forbidding it . Church officials said the reform will bring the CofE into line with the 1961 Suicide Act, which abolished the idea that committing suicide was a crime. However the move comes at a time of growing political pressure for the legalisation of assisted suicide to allow the desperately disabled or dying help to take their own lives. The declaration of a new liberal Church attitude to suicide is likely to be taken as encouragement by activists pushing for the repeal of the 1961 law, which sets down a maximum 14 year jail sentence for anyone who aids and abets a suicide. The Church’s founding Book of Common Prayer, which dates from the 16th century, says that the funeral service may not be used ‘for any that die unbaptized, or excommunicate, or have laid violent hands upon themselves.’ Suicides were often buried outside a consecrated churchyard or on the north side of the church, without the benefit of the Prayer Book burial service. Current Church law says that a specially adapted funeral service must be used in the case of anyone who has killed themselves who was ‘of sound mind’. However, few bishops have ever produced such services for their clergy to use. Gloucester vicar Canon Michael Parsons told the Synod: ‘We take funerals of murderers, rapists, child abusers and gangsters and we are happy to commit them to mercy of God. But not, it seems, suicides.' Cast out: In the past those who died by suicide were either buried on unconsecrated ground, or on the north side of a church, without a common book of prayer service (file image) He said most clergy disregard the law or are surprised to find they are conducting funerals that break the rules. ‘Passing this motion will be seen as hugely positive pastoral step. Do we want to be part of church that rejects vulnerable people?’ he said. Canon Parsons added in a paper for the Synod that the Church law ‘may lie behind a widespread public perception that suicide is the unforgiveable sin and hence the Church will disapprove. ‘There are public memories of real or imagined Church hostility. Yet pastoral practice has for many years been much more sympathetic and the vast majority of clergy today would wish to minister to the family in every way possible.’ The CofE has long abandoned any official disapproval of suicide. As long ago as 1959 a Church report said that ‘a person who attempts suicide must be in a state of mental distress and therefore needs special sympathy and understanding.’ The Synod voted to change Church law by 262 votes to five, with six abstentions. Senior clergy and officials will now consider how to change the rules. They will also consider whether to allow full funerals for people who have not been baptised. An assisted suicide law which would allow terminally ill people with six months to live the right to deadly drugs, as long as they are of sound mind and settled on their wish to die, is currently being considered in the House of Lords. Some senior judges have indicated they are in favour of allowing the desperately ill to get help to kill themselves.","General Synod votes 262 to five in favour of changing suicide rules .

"Argentina today hit back at ‘verbal attacks’ David Cameron over the future of the Falkland Islands, insitsing the threat of British military action no longer inspires fear. Hector Timerman, Argentina’s foreign minister, accused the UK of behaving in ‘an aggressive fashion’ and having ‘no moral authority’ to lay claim to the Falklands. And he vowed that Argentina will continue to battle to reclaim what it calls the Malvinas, dismissing Britain as the ‘lion roars but does not inspire fear any more’. Attack: Argentina's foreign minister Hector Timerman dismissed threats of military action from Britain as he vowed to step up claims to the Falklands . Tensions between London and Buenos Aires escalated in 2013, despite a referendum of Falklanders in March showing 99.7 per cent wanting to remain a UK overseas territory. The death of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who sent warships the South Atltanic after Argentina invaded in 1982, renewed speculation about whether the UK could mount a similar military defence today. In a Christmas message, David Cameron vowed to counter Argentine claims to the Falklands and attempts to inflict damage on the islands’ economy, adding: ‘Britain will always be ready to defend the Falkland Islands.’ But in a 1,900-word newspaper article entitled 'A peaceful struggle', Mr Timerman claimed the message appeared to forget ‘the peace message that Christmas should inspire’. Argentina's Hector Timerman . Writing in Argentine newspaper PAGINA 12, he accused Britain of flouting international law, issuing counter-productive threats and refusing to enter into negotiations over the future of the islands. And he in a provocative assessment of Britain’s military capability to defend the islands, he added: ‘The verbal and military threats of the colonial power will continue to be met with Argentina’s demand for respect for international law and for UN resolutions. ‘In other words, the United Kingdom’s refusal to sit down at the negotiating table is compelling evidence that, in the question of the Malvinas Islands, the lion roars but does not inspire fear any more.’ Provocative: Mr Timerman dismissed military and verbal threats from the UK, insisting Argentina would use international law to reclaim the what it calls the Malvinas . The article was published to mark the anniversary of Britain reclaiming the Falklands on 3 January 1833. Mr Timerman added: ‘This day, 3 January 2014, marks a new anniversary of the usurpation by Great Britain of Argentina’s Malvinas, South Georgias and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas. ‘A total of approximately 3 million square kilometres that belongs to the Argentine people and the deprivation of which impairs Argentina’s territorial integrity.’ Defiant: David Cameron used his Christmas message to the Falklands to insist Britain would always defend the islands' interests . He even claimed that despite an . ‘escalation of verbal attacks by British officials’, support for . Argentina’s claims to the Falkland have ‘received renewed and vigorous . support the world over, including in Britain’. Argentina last year invoked new laws to punish oil firms seeking to exploit oil fields in the seas around the islands. Mr Timerman said it was designed to ‘prevent foreign powers from continuing to plunder the resources existing in the land and maritime areas illegally occupied for over 180 years now’. But the British Foreign Office insisted the activities were 'wholly legitimate and legal' and entirely under the control of the Government of the island - a British overseas territory. In his festive message Mr Cameron said 2013 would be remembered as a ‘momentous year’ in the history of the Falkland Islands. The referendum sent a clear message that the ‘Falkland Islands are British through and through and ‘the rest of the world has a fundamental duty to respect and honour what you have said so clearly’. Mr Cameron added: ‘We look to 2014, you can count on the British government’s continued support in countering the Argentine government’s campaign to claim the Islands’ resources and to inflict damage on your economy. ‘The British government will remain steadfast in its commitment to your sovereignty and security. ‘The Argentine government will never succeed in any attempt to misrepresent the history of your Islands or question your right to self-determination. Britain will always be ready to defend the Falkland Islands.’","Foreign minister Hector Timerman brushes aside UK's rhetoric .
