"Sitting with their trousers rolled up and their legs dangling in the US Capitol Reflecting Pool, these pictures show TV personality Stephen Colbert enjoying a spot of fishing with Republican Jack Kingston. Colbert, host of the Comedy Central 'The Colbert Report' and Congressman Kingston, were photographed sporting straw hats and reeling in fish from the famous lake. Later on, Colbert was filmed stealing a bust of Abraham Lincoln from a congressman's office before escaping in a roll-away dustbin. During the video for the show, Colbert was aided by Kingston, the outgoing Congressman, who then ran out of the office together. TV host Stephen Colbert (left) and Congressman Jack Kingston (right) enjoy their time fishing in Washington DC . The pair were filmed for Colbert's Comedy Central show 'The Colbert Report' on Friday . With their trousers rolled up and dangling their feet in the lake, the pair were watched by excited onlookers . It was announced earlier this year that Colbert will take over from David Letterman as host of CBS' Late Show . Recently, it was announced that Colbert will replace David Letterman as host of CBS' Late Show. The TV host was catapulted to fame after a video of him making a controversial speech at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in 2006 went viral. Standing a few yards from then US President George Bush, he mockingly said: 'I stand by this man. 'I stand by this man because he stands for things. Not only for things, he stands on things. Things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares. 'And that sends a strong message, that no matter what happens to America, she will always rebound - with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world.' Kingston is the US Representative for Georgia's 1st congressional district in Southeast Georgia, which he has served since 1993. This year, he unsuccessfully ran for the US Senate seat, currently occupied by retiring Senator Saxby Chambliss, when he lost to David Perdue. The youngest of 11 siblings in a family of intellectuals, Stephen Colbert's ability to make himself heard appears to have been ingrained from birth. He was raised Catholic in Charleston, South Carolina, by his doctor-Yale professor father James and homemaker mother Lorna. Colbert has said in past interviews that although he was raised in a devout family, his intellectual parents taught him to be questioning of the Church, a theme which continues to run through his comic routines. In 1974, when he was ten, Stephen's father and two of his brothers Peter and Paul were killed in a plane crash in North Carolina. The tragedy and the family's subsequent move to an urban area of Charleston, led to him becoming an introverted teenager with few friends who relied on the worlds of science-fiction and fantasy. Colbert credits his love of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons for sparking an early interest in acting. By his own admission a slacker in the academic department, he swayed over whether he would attend college. He had a brief stint in a Rolling Stones cover band and saw his dreams of becoming a marine biologist shattered after surgery left him deaf in his right ear. He studied philosophy at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia then transferred to Northwestern as a theatre major. After college, he wound up in an improvised comedy troupe in Chicago where he understudied Steve Carrell and met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello. The trio were offered the chance to do an HBO series which earned positive reviews. The opportunity led to brief writing stints for SNL, MTV and GMA, before he was hired on a trial basis for the Daily Show in 1997. Colbert satirized a news correspondent with little more than a basic grip of the subject he was discussing. His writing on the Daily Show earned him three Emmys. In 2005, his news satire spin-off The Colbert Report launched on Comedy Central. It started with high-ratings and has held its place as one of the network's most-watched shows. On April 10, it was announced that Colbert would be filling the shoes of David Letterman on The Late Show. He lives in Montclair, New Jersey with his wife Evelyn and three children Madeleine, Peter and John.","TV host Stephen Colbert was filmed fishing with Republican Jack Kingston .

"Toulon have apologised to Leicester following incidents involving Martin Castrogiovanni and Delon Armitage at Welford Road on Sunday. Castrogiovanni's expletive-ridden tirade against Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill after Toulon's 25-21 Champions Cup defeat is being investigated by competition organisers European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR).

"Hardy: Truck driver Valery Malkov, 42, despite falling out of a train into the Siberian wilderness in temperatures of -40C . A man has survived after falling off a moving train in Siberia, forcing him to withstand temperatures of -40C dressed in only shorts, t-shirt and a pair of slippers. After leaving his compartment to go for a cigarette, Valery Malkov opened a door that should have been locked, hurling the 42-year-old into the hostile Siberian wilderness. But the hardy truck driver, thought to be from Bratsk in Russia's Irkutsk region, was undeterred by the conditions and began to chase after the train. After racing along the track for seven kilometres (4.3 miles) he eventually stumbled upon a tiny station. Mr Malkov said he was just as amazed as everybody else that he had not frozen to death. He said: 'When I was running I was not thinking . about anything except for to get to the nearest post, station, . anything. 'I don't know myself how I didn't freeze. And no, I never did winter swimming.' When he arrived at minuscule Richard .

"Comic book tycoon and Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal has promised to send a letter of apology to Leicester following Sunday night’s ugly scenes at Welford Road. The French giants are also considering an internal suspension for Italian prop Martin Castrogiovanni, whose expletive-laden outburst at Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill overshadowed a famous 25-21 victory for the East Midlands club. But Toulon have refused to comment on yesterday’s allegations in Sportsmail that former England full back Delon Armitage threatened to ‘take the face off’ a supporter after the final whistle. Mourad Boudjellal has promised to send a letter of apology to Leicester after ugly scenes at Welford Road . Speaking to French media about Castrogiovanni’s foul-mouthed rant, Boudjellal said: ‘I am very surprised. This is not the boy I know; I think he spoke under the influence of disappointment. We will send Leicester and their manager Richard Cockerill a letter of apology. Along with Bernard Laporte, we will call the player and decide whether we do something or not — a sanction is not excluded.’ Castrogiovanni’s comments were in response to claims from Cockerill that he joined Toulon for a pay-rise. The 33-year-old — whose agent, Sportsmail understands, was in Asia last week to discuss a summer move to Japan — has been backed by his Toulon team-mates. All Blacks lock Ali Williams said on Twitter: ‘Finally a man that speaks his heart and truth of what happens between management and players. So much that is untold.’ Martin Castrogiovanni launched an extraordinary personal attack on his former coach Richard Cockerill . Cockerill (above) attempted to diffuse the situation after Castrogiovanni's expletive-laden  outburst . Former Australia playmaker Matt Giteau tweeted: ‘Don’t condone the swearing but good on u @castrito81 standing up for urself & the team!!’ There has been no such support for Armitage, who is at risk of missing out on Saturday’s return leg at the Stade Felix Mayol. A victory would keep Toulon top of Pool 3. With three wins from three, Harlequins are leading the English challenge to dethrone the Top 14 side, who are hoping to win their third successive European crown. Conor O’Shea’s side travel to Leinster on Saturday, but they are likely to be without England captain Chris Robshaw and fly-half Nick Evans for the fixture in Dublin. ‘Chris is doubtful and I wouldn’t say Nick will make it either,’ said O’Shea. ‘We know there’s going to be a huge backlash from them, but we’re not going to sit back. We’ll take the game to them. It will be a war and a physical battle. Delon Armitage allegedly threatened to 'take the face off' a Leicester supporter on Sunday . The Toulon full back (left) exchanged angry words with a Leicester supporter during the French side's loss . ‘To me, Leinster are better than Toulon. Toulon’s coaches have done a brilliant job and they’ve got an incredible record, but playing fantasy rugby versus building something is completely different. Leinster have built an incredible brand since the days I used to play for them in front of 300 people.’ The absence of Robshaw will increase the pressure on rookie captain Joe Marler who, according to O’Shea, put in one of the best performances of his career during last weekend’s 24-18 victory in the first of two fixtures against Leinster. ‘I thought he came of age in every way he could on Sunday,’ said O’Shea. ‘In the way he controlled the team, his individual performance and his decision-making. When I made Chris captain, I said “you are captain to be you, not to be someone else.” The minute you are comfortable with that you can become very good at what you do, as opposed to thinking I have to be like Martin Johnson or Brian O’Driscoll. He will grow and he will get better for that.’","Leicester Tigers beat Toulon 25-21 in European Champions Cup .

"Manchester City playmaker David Silva believes the champions are now in position to turn up the heat on Chelsea. City have hit form in the past month with a run of eight consecutive victories - one short of a club record - in all competitions. That sequence has carried them into the last 16 of the Champions League and wiped out the eight-point advantage Chelsea held over them at the top of the Barclays Premier League just last month. David Silva appears to point towards the bench after scoring his second goal against Crystal Palace . The Londoners do still have a game in hand - at Stoke on Monday night - but after an indifferent spell in October and November, City now have momentum. Silva said: 'Big teams have to get used to this type of pressure, and we need to replicate it until the end of the season and win as many trophies as we can. 'We were eight points behind Chelsea a few weeks ago and now we have the same number of points - at least until they play on Monday - so maybe we can put a bit of pressure on them. 'But we will focus on ourselves and hope they drop some points.' Silva was at the heart of City's latest victory, scoring twice in Saturday's 3-0 defeat of troubled Crystal Palace at the Etihad Stadium. The 28-year-old (right) meets Aleksander Kolarov's cross to double City's lead just after the hour mark . With strikers Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic all injured, the Spaniard played in a central role just behind makeshift centre-forward James Milner. The 28-year-old, for all his attacking prowess and technical brilliance, is not a renowned goalscorer but he seemed to revel in the responsibility. Silva put City ahead with a deflected strike early in the second half and doubled the lead on the hour before Yaya Toure wrapped up the points late on. 'I like to play in the middle, even though I can play on both wings,' said Silva, who was making only his second start after an eight-game lay-off with a knee injury. 'When I play in the middle I get chances to score, and that is why I scored the two goals. 'But I will be happy to help the team when the strikers are back. Diego Costa has scored 12 goals in 18 appearances for Chelsea since joining in the summer . 'I am very happy for the two goals but I am really delighted because I have just come back. What I love most is to play, so I just want to continue playing.' City will hope to keep up the pressure by carrying their form through the Christmas programme. They travel to West Brom on Boxing Day before hosting Burnley two days later. Sunderland are their visitors on New Year's Day with Sheffield Wednesday the opponents in the FA Cup third round on January 4. It is a congested programme but one Silva, signed from Valencia in 2010, is now well used to. He said: 'It's the way the competition is, and in years past I have played on Boxing Day and December 28, and haven't lost a game. Sergio Aguero is just one of a host of strikers missing for Manchester City currently through injury . 'It is difficult to do that and then raise your game again for New Year's Day, but playing here you just have to accept that. We are looking forward to it. 'I will celebrate with my family on Christmas Eve. They always come here and it is nice because I don't see them in the whole year. 'The best celebration would be to win at West Brom. Christmas is better when you win so we are hoping for three points.'","Manchester City are level on points with leaders Chelsea having played a game more than Jose Mourinho's side .

"Burnley boss Sean Dyche is not prepared to speculate on when Sam Vokes might be ready to make his Premier League debut for the club. The striker, one of the stars of the Clarets' promotion campaign last season, has been sidelined for eight months by a serious knee injury. But he is closing in on full fitness and made a goalscoring return to action this week with Burnley's under-21 side. Sean Dyche does not want to speculate on when Sam Vokes will make his first Premier League start . Vokes scored 22 goals in the Clarets' promotion season last term before suffering a serious knee injury . Asked if he was hoping Vokes would be available before Christmas, Dyche said: 'No. I'd be hopeful he'll be available when he's ready. 'He's been going well, his injury timelines are good. And to get him on the grass in a game, albeit a reserve game, is fantastic. 'He looked nice and healthy and sharp and now it's about progressing from that, building his physical power and stamina in order to play for longer, and also his mental alignment, to make sure he's feeling good and he's feeling right about himself, because that's a massively important thing.' Dyche admitted the 25-year-old, who scored 22 goals last season, is desperate to test himself again at top-flight level after making a handful of Premier League appearances for Wolves earlier in his career. 'Absolutely, it's taken him long enough,' said Dyche. Dyche's side have earned themselves back-to-back wins in the Premier League after a struggling start . 'He's been out on the grass with us training and each step gives you a boost. He slowly edged into training, now he's been in full training for a couple of weeks so that's another step forward, and he gets half a reserve game and another step forward. 'But we'll build that up slowly. There'll certainly be no rush from our point of view. We want to make sure he's almost over fit. 'He's a big character, he's an important character around the group, let alone his playing ability, so I think the squad are delighted for him as well.' The goals of Vokes and Danny Ings were crucial to Burnley's promotion, and the latter now appears to have found his feet in the Premier League with three goals in his last four games. The 22-year-old's brace at Stoke last weekend helped Burnley to a second successive win while he also netted twice for England Under-21s in their victory over Portugal at Turf Moor earlier this month. Ings has been impressive for Burnley so far this season - scoring three goals in his last four appearances . Ings' form has led to him being linked with a senior England call-up, but Dyche is not expecting that to come any time soon. He said: 'It quickly accelerates. I suppose the thinking behind that is, with the numbers of European and world players playing in the Premier League and not so many home-grown players, then it would be fair to say he is looked at probably more seriously than 20 years ago as a young player. 'They do get accelerated to certain levels very quickly. I know (England assistant manager) Ray Lewington very well having worked with him at Watford and I would think if there was anything in it he'd probably drop me a line. 'All players are ambitious, all players want to play at the best level they can, and these players have earned the right to play at this level and beyond possibly. 'We'll have to wait and see. The main thing for Danny is to keep enjoying his football. I've said it all along, he's at his best when he's enjoying what he's doing and he's certainly enjoying it at the moment.'","Burnley have secured back-to-back wins in the Premier League .

"Dave Whelan has found himself an ally in Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston, who insists his Wigan counterpart is not a racist. The 77-year-old is under investigation by the FA after remarks made when trying to defend the Latics’ decision to appoint Malky Mackay as their new manager. Whelan claimed that Jewish people ‘chase money’, also referring to the Chinese community as ‘chinks’. Karl Oyston has backed Wigan Athletic owner Dave Whelan by claiming he is no racist . Whelan (left) is under investigation by the FA over remarks last week when defending Malky Mackay (right) He had been trying to take the heat off his new boss by playing down the racist, sexist and homophobic texts sent and received by the Scot while he was at Cardiff. And while Whelan – who has promised to resign if he is found guilty of misconduct - has been widely condemned, Oyston moved to back him up. The Seasiders’ chief told the Blackpool Gazette: ‘I think it’s horrendous how people can twist and not take into the context Dave Whelan’s comments. ‘I’ve known him on a personal level for the past 10 years and that man is not a racist or a bigot. He says things as he sees them and is from a different generation but he’s certainly not a racist. ‘I think it’s the sickening sections of the gutter press – vultures who are waiting to swoop and have taken someone apart who clearly doesn’t deserve it.’ Mackay himself is still under investigation by the FA for his part in the text scandal uncovered by Sportsmail in August. Whelan tried to back down from his comments when contacted by Sportsmail last week. Whelan, 77, caused a stir over his appointment of Mackay as the new Wigan manager last week . Whelan was seen crying as Wigan fans sang his name before they faced Middlesbrough on Saturday . He said: ‘I don’t know how it’s come across but it’s unfair if it’s come across like that. What I said is this: Malky criticised somebody and called them a name. We all get called names. We get called Limeys, Brits. The Scots get called Jocks. And we don’t take a blind bit of notice. I don’t know what all this is about. ‘There’s a big difference if you criticise a black person because that is something I would never ever do or agree to. ‘I would never even dream of that. That is something that is totally taboo. Everybody on the planet is equal and everybody who plays football is equal and I believe in that. I go to Barbados a lot. ‘I have friends, black people, white people, everybody is the same and everybody should be treated the same on the planet and that’s all I have to say on the subject.

"Emmanuel Adebayor could feature when Spurs host Burnley on Saturday, a match manager Mauricio Pochettino admitted was a ‘must-win,’ for his side. The striker returned to training after being granted a week leave for ‘personal reasons’ to travel back to Ghana. He has not featured for his club since November 9th when they were beaten 2-1 by Stoke at White Hart Lane. The Togo international later directed his ire at home fans, claiming home fans’ booing was damaging players’ confidence. Out-of-sorts striker Emmanuel Adebayor could feature for Tottenham in their upcoming game against Burnley . However fellow Spurs striker Harry Kane has been in great scoring form for the north London club . Manager Mauricio Pochettino is expected to reward Kane's prolificity by letting him keep his place in the team . Pochettino was coy about whether Adebayor would play a part in the Burnley match after he missed the 4-0 League Cup victory over Newcastle on Wednesday. ‘Adebayor is available and after we will see if I pick him or not,’ said Pochettino, ‘I am happy with Ade and all the players, maybe he’s in the squad or maybe not. It is my decision of how we play tomorrow and which players to pick. ‘He’s getting better, maybe not 100 per cent. He needs training and to improve his physical condition but he’s getting better.’ Spurs, who have lost four times in front of their home fans this season, will be strong favourites to overcome Burnley, who are hovering just above the relegation zone. Burnley's Ashley Barnes celebrates his valuable goal during his side's 1-0 win against stalling Southampton . Barnes bundled the ball home from close range to give Burnley the three points against the Saints . Pochettino said confidence levels are high after the victory over Newcastle and a Premier League win at Swansea last Sunday. But Sean Dyche’s side are in a rich vein of form, too, having taken 11 points from a possible 18 in their last six games. ‘Burnley are a very consistent and physical team,’ said Pochettino, ‘They have a lot of good players. Every game need to win more. In our mind, we have to get the three points and keep the performance on Wednesday in our heads. ‘There’s a very good spirit and mood after Newcastle victory. I feel the relationship between the players and supporters is good. It’s important to create this relationship between supporters and the team. After that only good and positive things come.’ Pochettino said he will still opt to pick Nabil Bentaleb despite the fact the midfielder soon depart for the Africa Cup of Nations, which starts of January 17, with Algeria. ‘We know that Bentaleb has to go to the African Cup of Nations but I believe he’s the best player to play tomorrow,’ said Pochettino, ‘I don’t think about afterwards.’ Algeria and Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentaleb will be absent during the African Cup of Nations next month .","Emmanuel Adebayor returned to Spurs training following a week's leave .

"EuroMillions winner Angela Dawes used to live in this £85-per-week two-bedroom static caravan with her ex-husband, it emerged today. The 43-year-old - who won £101million with her new fiance Dave Dawes - now plans to leave her old life behind and buy a luxury property in Chelsea with her winnings. Home for the EuroMillions winner used to be this 32ft Sherwood static caravan in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, which she shared with her former husband John Leeman, The Sun revealed. Rags to riches: The caravan where Angela Dawes lived with her ex-husband and son before scooping the EuroMillions jackpot . Ms Dawes, a mother-of-one, 'traded up' for a £70-per-week one bedroom apartment with her new partner Dave just a few miles away. The multi-millionaire one-time former taxi driver kicked her husband John, 44, and their son Steven, 17, out of the mobile home as her marriage collapsed. She eventually moved out around four years ago. A source at the caravan park told The Sun: 'I . remember Angela when she used to live here. I think her and her husband . split up and it was a bit messy.' Her estranged son Steven has claimed that his mother sneaked a string of lovers into her home while his father was out at work. He alleges she waited for John Leeman to go out on night shifts before inviting the men round behind his back. And he says he was . ordered to stay in his room while late night visitors spent hours in the . family home before leaving in the early hours. All smiles: Angela Dawes with her former husband John and son Steve during a trip to Paris during 2000 . Sweet and sour: Dave and Angie Dawes' celebrations were marred by allegations that she had thrown her husband and son out of the family home after a string of affairs . One, he claimed, was Dave Dawes, now his mother’s partner of four years with whom she shared last Friday’s £101million jackpot. ‘When Dad was away working I would be sent to bed as early as 8pm and told to stay in my room,’ said Steven, who was 12 at the time. ‘I realised it was because she had different men coming into the house and I would hear them in the bedroom or in the living room. A few times I came out to use the bathroom or to get a drink late at night and saw a man in the house. ‘She would ask me what I was doing and tell me to get back to bed. ‘Sometimes she even told me to put the volume up on my TV so I couldn’t hear what they were doing.’ Steven said he saw Mr Dawes in the family home three times late at night. Another visitor was a man his mother knew from her work at the time. The teenager, who lives with his father in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, previously complained that his mother, now 43, abandoned him after leaving to be with new love Mr Dawes, 47. Humble: Dave and Angela Dawes share a one bedroom £70 per week flat in this block in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire . Bitter: Steven Leeman and his father John claim that lottery winner Miss Dawes kicked them out in 2006 . The bitter allegations emerged within hours of the couple going public about their lottery win, the third biggest in Britain. Mr Leeman, a lorry driver, said he was thrown out of the family home when he confronted his wife about her alleged affairs. He claimed he came home one night to find his clothes dumped outside in bags. His son added he was told ‘if I didn’t like it I should go’ when he came back from a school trip to France to find his father gone. Since then, father and son claim, Miss Dawes – who plans to marry her partner next year but has already changed her surname by deed poll – has ignored her son. Former soldier Mr Leeman said: ‘I knew something was up as she would wear matching lingerie and dress herself with make-up when she was going out. This went on for about eight or nine months before I was thrown out. ‘Then neighbours started saying they saw different men rushing into the house late at night after hiding in the back seat of her car or even in the boot. ‘It’s not right as a mother to be carrying on like that when your 12-year-old son is sleeping in the next room. It’s unbelievable.’ The couple and their young son lived in a rundown caravan in a trailer-park on the outskirts of Wisbech for ten years until 2006. They then moved into a modest rented house and it was then, Steven claims, the after-dark visits from men began. Towards the end of the year the couple’s relationship broke down when Mr Leeman confronted her about the visitors and he was thrown out of the two-bedroom house. The 44-year-old said his ex-wife also . left him £20,000 in debt after she splashed out on designer goods, . nights out and furniture for her ‘love nest’ with Mr Dawes, a shift . supervisor. ‘It has not been easy raising a son . alone and with all those debts,’ he said. Steven, who has said he is not . interested in his mother’s fortune, added: ‘When she made me leave she . gave me some numbers and an address so I could contact her but they were . all false. Leafy: The posh London area of Chelsea where Euromillions lottery winner Ms Dawes wants to set up home . ‘I was very young and had no way of . contacting my mum. I couldn’t understand it. Since then I haven’t heard . anything. No Christmas cards or birthday cards. Nothing.’ Charity shop volunteer Miss Dawes declined to comment last night when contacted through Camelot. A Camelot spokesman reissued a . statement she released after the first allegations emerged, which said: . ‘I’m saddened by these reports. 'A lot of what has been said since my . divorce has been untrue and very hurtful. I’ve always wanted to be in . contact with my son, who I love dearly, and very much still want to . rebuild our relationship.’ On Tuesday, Miss Dawes and her . partner – who live in a £70-a-week one-bedroom flat in Wisbech – said . they had drawn up a list of 15 to 20 friends ‘that we’re going to sort . of make millionaires’. It emerged yesterday that former Premier Foods shift supervisor Dave Dawes was adopted as a child and he is set to make his . foster parents and natural father millionaires as well. He only found his birth father two years ago.","Caravan park neighbours reveal split from her former husband was 'messy'

"Tottenham Hotspur's Benjamin Stambouli has lavished praise on his team-mates after they booked their place in the Capital One Cup semi-final with a 4-0 win over Newcastle at White Hart Lane. Goals have been few and far between for Mauricio Pochettino's men of late - they have found the net just twice in their last four matches in all competitions. However, despite making several changes, goals from Nabil Bentaleb, Nacer Chadli, Harry Kane and Roberto Soldado ensured Spurs secured an emphatic victory over the in-form Magpies.

Stambouli liked what he saw on Wednesday night, and was equally pleased with helping his side secure a cleansheet. 'I think it was a perfect performance. We were focused on our opponents, we had that willingness to score and it came naturally,' Stambouli told BBC Sport. 'It is never easy even if you are winning 2-0, but we focused on our defending and then our attackers took their chances. Spurs have not enjoyed themselves on their own turf this season, having picked up more points away from White Hart Lane (14) than at home (10). Fans have made their feelings clear on several occasions this season, but Stambouli is hoping that cup success will win over the doubters on the terraces. 'All the club and all the fans are very happy,' Stambouli added. 'We will do our best to win this trophy.'

"Scientists at a Rio de Janeiro research institute have found what they call a new 'super-bacteria' that is resistant to antibiotics in the waters where sailors will compete in the Olympic sailing events in 2016. The bacteria is normally found in hospital waste and can cause urinary, gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections, officials with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation said on Monday. They discovered the bacteria in water samples taken at three spots along the Rio Carioca, a small river that runs into the Guanabara Bay, where the sailing events will take place. Scientists at a Rio de Janeiro research institute have found what they call a new 'super-bacteria' that is resistant to antibiotics in the waters where sailors will compete in the Olympic sailing events in 2016 . The bacteria is similar to other known strains but is resistant to the usual drugs, said Ana Paula D'Alincourt Carvalho Assef, the coordinator of the study. 'There is the risk of contracting diseases, which are not more serious that those caused by other micro-organisms,""' Assef said, adding that no cases have yet been reported. 'The problem is that in case of infection it is possible that treatment involves hospitalisation.' Small boats sit on the polluted shore of Guanabara Bay in the suburb of Sao Goncal . Sailors who visited Rio for test events ahead of the Games criticised the state of the water, with some describing it as 'filthy'. More than half the water that flows into the Guanabara Bay is sewage and organisers have vowed to reduce that amount by 80 percent by the time the events start in Aug. 2016.","The bacteria is normally found in hospital waste .

"Custard creams have long been a staple of British teatime. So the news that Tesco has released a new custard cream spread priced at £1.99 was a big moment among biscuit-lovers across the country. A picture of one of the new pots was uploaded to Twitter yesterday, prompting a flurry of activity on the social networking site. Tesco has launched a custard cream spread for £1.99 and the news prompted a flurry of activity on Twitter . Fans of the biscuit were over the moon about the announcement, with many unable to contain themselves. One person wrote: 'Tesco is now selling custard cream in a jar #heaven'. However some biscuit lovers were not impressed. Stephen Pearce said: 'Just ruins a biscuit, wouldn't feel right on bread.' Although they are grabbing most of the attention today, custard creams are not the only biscuit to have been made into a spread by Tesco recently. Another retro teatime treat - the Bourbon has also been made into a paste. The supermarket also created a cookies and cream spread and a cookie spread.

Specialist dietitian Nichola Whitehead who runs the blog nicsnutrition.com said: 'The ingredients are biscuits then oil and sugar. 'Far from nutritious and not a product that I would promote to adults or children at all. 'You'd be better off eating a couple of biscuits than eating this spread on toast. 'I would suggest sticking with a 100% nut butter as a healthier type of spread. 'You can always add a touch of cocoa for a chocolate boost or banana for a naturally sweet addition.

"A portable toilet delivery driver who posed as a dashing airline pilot to worm his way into the lives of unsuspecting women he later defrauded has been jailed. Timothy Giles, 46, targeted victims on dating websites, telling them he was either a police officer, firefighter or commercial flyer with Australian airline Qantas. Giles, from Blunsdon, Swindon, Wiltshire, embellished his lies with a photo of a pilot in uniform that looked like him and pictures of exotic holiday locations that he downloaded from the internet. Jailed: Timothy Giles, 46, (right) posed as an airline pilot on dating websites to worm his way into the lives of women, embellishing his lies with a photo of a pilot, unconnected to the case, that looked like him (left) Exeter Magistrates’ Court heard women were taken in by his fake 'grandiose' lifestyle and entered into relationships with him, unaware he was a portable toilet delivery driver who was stealing money from his various dates. One even allowed Giles to move into her home in a Devon village, and become a 'father figure' to her two young children, the court was told. She was persuaded into lending him £320 after Giles claimed he had 'fallen into difficulties' despite working for Qantas - believing his position meant he could pay it back. Police arrested Giles at her home on on December 30 last year after it emerged he had used his delivery firm employer’s fuel fob to fill his Land Rover Discovery with £978.65 of fuel. Unsuspecting: Giles with one of his victims. He managed to persuade one of the three women that he was a pilot for Qantas, convincing her to lend him £320 after he claimed he had 'fallen into difficulties' He also failed to pay Children’s Hospice South West £65 in sponsorship for completing a cycle ride for the charity. District Judge Stephen Nicholls told Giles his actions had devastated his victims and required an immediate prison sentence of 84 days. Giles, who admitted six counts of fraud by false representation, one of theft and one of breaching bail conditions, was ordered to repay his victims £785. 'I accept you were somebody who was facing a difficult set of circumstances, having some time ago found yourself at the end of a long marriage and in a situation where you were out of work,' the judge said. 'You effectively created havoc amongst everybody else that you came into contact with. You purported to be someone that you were not. 'You pretended that you were a police officer. You told one woman that you were an airline pilot. 'You knew in putting forward these false set of circumstances the effect this was having on the people who you were committing the offences against.' Giles first pretended to be a firefighter to attract one woman, who helped him raise money for Children’s Hospice South West through a cycle ride in April 2013. Her friends, family and work colleagues sponsored Giles for the ride, which he completed, but he failed to hand the money to the charity. In July last year, Giles attracted another woman through a dating profile picture of a police officer with an automatic weapon strapped across him. He described himself as an armed response officer for Devon and Cornwall police and, after gaining the woman’s trust, used her bank card details to pay his £225.45 phone bill. Fabrication: Giles, pictured with one of his victims, was arrested on December 30 last year after it emerged he had used his delivery firm employer's fuel fob to fill his Land Rover Discovery with £978.65 of fuel . Giles was arrested in September 2013 and handed a conditional discharge for the offence at Taunton Deane Magistrates’ Court after repaying the money. But in October 2013, he met another woman through the same dating website, this time purporting to be a Qantas pilot. Christopher Bittlestone, prosecuting, said: 'She was in a vulnerable position, she was a lady with two small children. 'He made certain representation to her that he was an airline pilot working for Qantas who had fallen into difficulty, with all sorts of excuses given to her about why he was short of cash.' The woman, who Giles moved in with, agreed to loan him £120 on October 29 and a further £200 on December 23. 'Her world came crashing down on December 30 when the police eventually caught up with Mr Giles,' Mr Bittlestone said. 'She came to realise very shortly that everything she had been told about him was simply a lie.' Between August and September of last year, Giles used his employer’s fuel fob to fill his Land Rover with £978.65 of fuel, the court heard. Giles had been given the fob as part of his job picking up portable toilets from building sites but it was not for personal use. Nicholas Bradley, representing Giles, said his client was in a new relationship and had found employment. Ruling: Giles, who admitted six counts of fraud by false representation, one of theft and one of breaching bail conditions, was ordered to repay his victims £785 by a district judge at Exeter Magistrates' Court . 'He is in a place in terms of his life to go forward to the future back on the same side of the path that he was on previously,' Mr Bradley said. 'He is a man who is capable of working and supporting others, capable of contributing to society rather than damaging it.' He said his client, save for the conditional discharge last year, had only one previous offence from 1990. Giles looked shaken as he was led to the cells. Speaking after Giles’ conviction, his most recent victim said: 'His story was that he was an airline pilot working for Qantas and had been doing so for 10 years. 'He said his parents lived in Australia where he used to work but he had moved to the company’s English base. 'He then moved to Devon and would stay at mine a lot and leave at silly o’clock to say he was driving back to Heathrow. I now know he was going to see another woman. 'He had details about his job, parents, house and past life. He had a complete life mapped out but it was all just a fabricated mess. 'He would send me photos of where he was in the world. He would text me his ‘current view’ of a hotel or beach in the Indian ocean. 'But it was all just downloaded off the internet - just like the photo he initially sent me in a pilot’s uniform. 'I never suspected anything - he seemed so genuine. He had an answer for anything and everything.'","Timothy Giles, 46, from Swindon targeted his victims on dating websites .

"A child's genes have a far greater impact on exam results than the quality of their school or the efforts of their parents, researchers claim. Analysis of 11,000 teenagers’ GCSE results suggests that DNA is twice as significant as environmental factors such as school choice in determining educational success. The study, published by researchers at King’s College London, will go some way towards swaying the course of the great nature vs nurture debate. A child's genes have a far greater impact on exam results than the quality of their school or the efforts of their parents, a new study by King's College London has revealed. File picture . It will also bolster the stock of London Mayor Boris Johnson, who last month provoked anger by suggesting that some people, ‘like cornflakes rising to the top of the packet’, reach powerful positions because they are naturally more intelligent than others. The new study suggests that each child’s genes make, on average, a 58 per cent difference for their results in the core subjects of English, maths and science. Environmental factors such as school, neighbourhood and the family home, are said to have an impact of just 29 per cent. Other factors unique to each individual account for the remaining 13 per cent, the study suggests. Genetics appear to have a bigger influence on results for science subjects than for humanities such as media studies, art or music – 58 per cent compared with 42 per cent. Study leader Nicholas Shakeshaft said: ‘Children differ in how easily they learn at school. Our research shows that differences in students’ educational achievement owe more to nature than nurture.’ Mayor of London Boris Johnson provoked anger last month when he linked success in life to a person's IQ . However, he warned against assuming that educational achievements are ‘genetically predetermined’. Instead, recognising the predispositions of each child may help improve learning, he said. He said a personalised education that took account of children’s differences would be better than a ‘one size fits all’ system which ignores genetics. The paper, published in the journal PLOS One, said the findings may come as ‘an uncomfortable realisation’ to those in education. Many teachers and politicians fear that a genetic approach to education may lead to less intelligent children being written off. But Professor Robert Plomin, who co-wrote the paper, said: ‘It means that educational systems which are sensitive to children’s individual abilities and needs, which are derived in part from their genetic predispositions, might improve educational achievement.’ The researchers compared the GCSE results of identical twins – who share 100 per cent of their genes – with those of non-identical twins, who share only 50 per cent of their DNA. By subtracting the environmental impact, the scientists could disentangle nature from nurture and determine the impact of genes on the school results. Most of the genes that contribute to educational success have yet to be identified, although a 2010 study discovered small variants linked to mathematical ability. Mr Shakeshaft said: ‘Once we understand more about how the genetic influences work, or once we can identify potential problems early on, we’ll be better able to target specific interventions to help those individuals who might otherwise struggle.’ Pugh cartoon . However other scientists warned that the study should be treated with caution. Dr Simon Underdown, of Oxford Brookes University, said the research cannot show that intelligence is the product of one or two simple genes. ‘Rather it is managed by an intricate process that relies on genetic factors and environmental influences. The nature-nurture debate is not over yet,’ he added. Sarah Norcross, director of the Progress Educational Trust, said the idea of tailoring education based on genetics should be treated with a ‘great degree of scepticism’. Mr Johnson was accused of ‘elitism’ last month when he said some people would always find it easier to get ahead than others. ‘Whatever you may think of the value of IQ tests, it is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an IQ below 85, while about 2 per cent have an IQ above 130,’ he said. He suggested that competition was good because it meant that those with natural ability would be pushed to work harder.","Study reveals a child's genes have greater impact on exam results than the quality of their school or efforts of their parents .

"Everton centre-back John Stones has resumed full training and could return to the side to face QPR on Monday. England international Stones suffered ankle ligament damage in Everton's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United in October which required an operation. However, the 20 year-old's rehabilitation has gone well and Toffees boss Roberto Martinez revealed he is on the verge of a return. John Stones has not played for Everton since being stretchered off against Manchester United in October . Stones needed surgery on his ankle ligament injury, but is now on the road to recovery . 'John's trained once with the team and he came through that well,' he said. 'It's about introducing him into a competitive game. Its' great to have him back. 'John is ahead of schedule, probably two or three weeks but I would expect that because he's a quick healer. He hasn't stopped one second to make sure he gets back. 'He is desperate to get back on to the football pitch. He started the season well, and sometimes at that age it's difficult to maintain that level. 'Now he is ready to step up the level. He's a phenomenal character. 'We will assess John as well as James McCarthy, Steven Naismith and Darron Gibson before QPR. They are different stages but all four have a chance of being involved.' Roberto Martinez confirmed that Stones was back in first team training and will be assessed ahead of QPR . Martinez admits QPR will pose a significant threat to his side even though they have struggled on the road this season. He added: 'I know QPR have Charlie Austin missing but they are in a good moment, we respect them. I admire Harry Redknapp hugely. 'I think everyone knows QPR have had good results at home, and they have been well deserved, away from home they have been unlucky. 'It's an important period for us. Every game is difficult.

"A lovelorn New Zealand man who asked the Internet for help finding the American girl he met in Hong Kong last year on New Year's Eve has found her - and she doesn't seem too happy about it. Reese McKee, 25, gained thousands of followers when he posted a picture of 'Katie' and his story of dancing the night away with her last December. She left him only with a first name, a hint that she lived 'in D.C.' and the alluring request: 'find me.' He has now revealed that online sleuths did, indeed, find her. And they mobbed her with so many messages that she deleted every single one of her social media accounts within hours. 'The Facebook thing was getting out of hand. They were starting to infringe on other people. They tracked down every Katie in the DC area, which is a bit much,' Mr McKee, from Wellington, told the New Zealand Herald. Who is she? Reese McKee, right, has launched a Facebook search for a woman named 'Katie', left, whom he met in Hong Kong on New Year's Eve. When they parted, she said: 'Find me' 'We found the girl. She is from DC, she's not there at the moment, but she's sorta taken all her public profiles offline for a little bit.' Mr McKee says he hasn't reached out to her yet - he's waiting for the online furor to die down. But, as one slightly horrified blogger points out, it's likely she has no desire to to speak with Mr McKee now. Their romantic night took place nearly one year ago. 'A year is enough time for someone to get married, go through several relationships, or even have a child,' blogger amiantos writes. 'Or . maybe it’s just enough time for some lonely guy to work himself into a . delusional fantasy that she’s waiting on the other side of it for him.' Even Mr McKee seems a little sheepish about his quest to be reunited with the girl he had a chance meeting with a year ago. He told the Herald that he has turned down multiple media interview requests - including from ABC's Good Morning America. Shortly after Katie was found, he deleted his Facebook profile and the Facebook event that invited fans to help find her. Search: He launched a Facebook search to find her - but so far he has not discovered who she is . Mr . McKee says he was wandering around admiring the lights as he welcomed . in 2013 when he spotted a girl crying at the side of the road and . approached her. 'She was lost. She'd lost all her friends,' he told the New Zealand Herald. 'I just cheered her up. I sort of have this undeniably bad sense of humor that no one can resist laughing at.' The . pair spent the night dancing, drinking and chatting until 6 a.m., when . she reconnected with her friends and they parted ways. Before . she vanished into the night, she told him her name and that she lived . in 'D.C'. She posed for a photograph and left him with a bold request: . 'Find me.' On a . Facebook campaign, he explained that the next morning he woke up and . discovered the picture on his cell phone - 'and the good memories came . sweeping back'. But he had . few clues to track her down and when he tried to find her email address - . he had some recollection of it containing the words 'kitty cat' - he . had no luck. He spent months looking for her and asked for help in a similar way on Facebook in June. 'But the timing wasn't right,' he told the Herald. 'I think this time of year people have hope for the magic [of Christmas].' And it seems that people are catching on - with more than 4,000 people offering their support to him before he removed the Facebook page. But while the story has gathered . international attention - as well as questions over whether or not it is . a hoax - the mysterious Katie has yet to be identified. Before removing the Facebook page, McKee explained why he was looking for her. 'I was hurt a long time ago,' he wrote. 'The . hopeless romantic in me was locked away when he got hurt because it was . too much. For too long, this has effected my relationships, and I've . failed people. Chance meeting: The pair met at New Year fireworks in Hong Kong (pictured) when he spotted her crying alone and befriended her. They went on to dance and party before saying goodbye . 'Somewhere along the line my romantic soul went silent, and this is a step towards putting that right.

"Roma's rise over the past eighteen months has been remarkable, the appointment of Rudi Garcia in June 2013 the first step in a huge transformation of the Italian club's fortunes both on and off the field. Despite initial fears after being drawn in Group E with both Bayern Munich and Manchester City, the Giallorossi now stand on the verge of a place in the knockout stages, easily capable of notching the win they need over the reigning Premier League Champions. Not only is their destiny in their own hands, it is also highly likely after yet another disappointing showing in the competition from Manuel Pellegrini's side. Roma will qualify for the knockout stage of the Champions League if they beat Manchester City on Wednesday . Manager Rudi Garcia has transformed Roma during his 18 months in charge of the club . Garcia's attacking brand of football is the perfect formula for overcoming Manchester City . Roma play an exciting and entertaining brand of attacking football that is both rarely seen on the peninsula and ideal for exploiting the weaknesses City have shown. The pace and width that domestic opponents have proven ill-equipped to cope with has set new club records for most points (85), wins (26) and clean sheets (21) in a season and is also the perfect formula for overcoming Wednesday's opponents. As CSKA Moscow showed at the Etihad last month, Gael Clichy remains a liability, committing errors from which the Russian side scored both their goals in an embarrassing 2-1 win. With Gervinho in the kind of form that makes him unrecognisable from the forlorn figure seen at Arsenal and Juan Manuel Iturbe a similarly frightening prospect, Roma's wingers will give the French defender another torrid evening. Gervinho is unrecognisable from the player who endured a difficult time at Arsenal . Gervinho and Juan Iturbe possess pace on the wings to trouble City's backline . Francesco Totti retains his sharpness and intelligence and Roma's play is dictated by the classy forward . His two seasons in England saw him ridiculed constantly, but a reunion with former Lille boss Garcia has seen Gervinho deliver at the level which saw Arsene Wenger invest over £10 million in him back in 2011. In fifty games for Roma, he has netted fourteen goals and the same number of assists, a vital part of that impressive attacking trident based around the timeless talent of Francesco Totti. As he showed in the first meeting with City, the club captain retains the sharpness and intelligence that has always typified his performances. A well-taken goal saw him embarrass a sluggish defence, and his team-mates are perfectly set-up to continue that in Wednesday's crucial final encounter. Their 4-3-3 formation is built upon an excellent midfield, the likes of Daniele De Rossi, Miralem Pjanic and the returning Kevin Strootman possessing the quality needed at this level. 'We have a good chance of winning,' Florenzi said this week, 'because we're a good team capable of putting City in difficulty.' Manchester City will be without star striker Sergio Aguero, who injured his knee against Everton on Saturday . Yaya Toure will also be absent for the Premier League champions through suspension . With Yaya Toure suspended and Sergio Agüero injured, Roma firmly believe they can overcome the reigning Premier League champions. They remain unpredictable, a point highlighted by their two previous home games in the competition in which they despatched CSKA Moscow 5-1, but were then demolished 7-1 by Bayern Munich. With the Stadio Olimpico always a tough place for visiting teams, Roma play a style which the crowd in the capital city loves, seeing the volume raise even higher in appreciation of the players representing them. It is into that atmosphere that City will be treading on Wednesday evening, and the Giallorossi should be more than good enough to secure the point they need to progress.","Roma take on Manchester City in a crucial clash on Wednesday .

"Roma coach Rudi Garcia has cast his side in the role of underdogs against Manchester City, saying that his team should already have been knocked out of the Champions League. The Italian league runners-up need to beat the Premier League champions on Wednesday to reach the last 16 while a draw could be enough depending on the result of CSKA Moscow's match at Bayern Munich. Using somewhat curious logic, Garcia suggested that, after being placed in pot four of the draw for the Champions League group stage, Roma had done more than expected.

'This match will be special for me and the club, it will be like a final,' he added. Roma have had contrasting fortunes at the Stadio Olimpico, beating CSKA Moscow 5-1 but slumping to an extraordinary 7-1 defeat by Bayern. A win would take Roma through to the last 16 at the expense of Manchester City and CSKA Moscow . 'We need to make the most of every moment....a win would be incredible,' Garcia said. 'We know that City are a good side. It will be very tough tomorrow but I'm sure we can do it. We can only decide our own fate with a win.

"Former winger Robert Pires believes Arsenal would be 'crazy' to sack under-pressure boss Arsene Wenger. It is ten years since Wenger's ""'Invincibles"" secured a place in the history books by going an entire Premier League season unbeaten. Pires, who has come out of retirement to take to the field for FC Goa in the inaugural Indian Super League, was a key component of that illustrious line-up, with some fantastic goals and mesmeric skills helping Arsenal to their last league crown. Robert Pires (right) in action for FC Goa in the Indian Super League in New Delhi last month . Pires talks with Nacho Monreal, Mikel Arteta and Santi Cazorla after the 2014 FA Cup final at Wembley . Two FA Cups are the only silverware to be added to the Gunners trophy cabinet since, and the growing frustration on the terraces is starting to reach breaking point. Ill-feeling towards the Arsenal supremo is palpable around the Emirates, with a large section of their support calling for change in the dugout, despite all Wenger has achieved in his 18 years in north London. A vociferous group of travelling fans confronted the French manager at Stoke train station as the team headed home after last weekend's defeat at the Britannia Stadium. Pires understands their concerns but insists that Wenger should stay at Arsenal. 'I understand the fans, I really do. I want to see Arsenal do better,' says Pires, who spent three years out of action before coming out of retirement to play in India. 'But Wenger is the man for Arsenal, 100%. It would be crazy for the board to let a manager go who has made Arsenal into what it is today. Pires (right) on the Arsenal training ground with manager Arsene Wenger in September 2013 . 'I do not like to think of what Arsenal would be without him as manager. 'He has spent a lot of money, and I can see that the results should be better. 'This club (Arsenal) changed my life, in particularly Arsene Wenger. 'Arsene is like (Alex) Ferguson, he is part of the club. 'Look at what has happened to Manchester United since Ferguson left? 'Worse could happen at Arsenal.' The 41-year-old enjoyed six years in north London, and still lives with his family in the capital. After achieving so much and playing alongside multi-faceted talents such as Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp, Pires admits it is hard not to look back, yearning for a repeat of the incredible football the ""Invincibles"" produced. Gunners boss Wenger pictured at the London Colney training ground during a session on Friday . 'It was a privilege to play for that team,' adds Pires, who is the oldest outfield player to be taking part in the Indian Super League. 'For me, it was simply an honour to play alongside such quality players. 'Will it (the unbeaten season) be repeated? Who knows, football is crazy. But we will be remembered. 'The goals we scored, the way we passed the ball, it was just incredible.' The Arsenal ""Invincibles"" celebrate with the league trophy at the end of the 2003-04 season . One humorous incident stands out from Pires' time at Arsenal, and the French veteran is already laughing when the subject is first mentioned. 'I have not considered doing it again, no,' Pires adds, referring to the penalty routine he and Henry got disastrously wrong against Manchester City in 2005. 'It was my error, but it is Thierry Henry that gets all the questions. We still laugh about that more than anything. 'Now we can laugh, but not so much then.

"Football legend Stanley Matthews's 1953 FA Cup winners' medal could fetch up to £60,000 when it goes under the hammer next month - almost three times more than the price its TV presenter owner paid in 2001. The medal - won by Matthews in the FA Cup final which now bears his name - was bought by television personality Nick Hancock for £23,500 at Sotheby's 13 years ago. The Queen presented Matthews with the winners' medal after his stand-out performance brought his Blackpool side back from 3-1 down to take a 4-3 victory against Bolton Wanderers. Stanley Matthews (left) was instrumental in Blackpool's comeback to win the 1953 FA Cup final against Bolton Wanderers at the old Wembley Stadium . His medal was sold at auction in Sotheby's in 2001 to television presenter Nick Hancock for £23,500 . The win meant the winger finally got his hands on the trophy after losing two FA Cup finals in 1948 and 1951. The 'Matthews Final' went down in history as one of the greatest matches at the old Wembley, featuring one of the England international's most memorable performances. In 2001, a year after Matthews, who also had two spells at Stoke City, died, his medal was sold at auction to They Think It's All Over presenter Mr Hancock. Speaking to the Telegraph in 2010, Stoke City fan Mr Hancock said owning the medal brought him joy, despite the fact Matthews was not playing for his team when he won it. He said: 'I am a massive Stoke City fan and a lover of sporting memorabilia. So it made perfect sense to buy Sir Stanley Matthews's FA Cup-winning medal from 1953 as he was the club's greatest ever player. Nick Hancock, a keen collector of football memorabilia, is selling the medal, which could fetch up to £60,000 . 'It cost me about £20,000 and was money well spent as it brings a lot of joy. I don't actually have it but have given it to Stoke City to put on display at the stadium. 'I have also bought one of Gordon Banks' England caps for £5,000, although I've never worn it.' The medal is to be resold by Mr Hancock through sports memorabilia specialists Graham Budd on November 11. At the same sale, Ray Wilson's England 1966 World Cup winners' medal, sold at Christie's in 2002, is expected to sell for up to £120,000. The medal, which was awarded after England's 1966 win against West Germany, is inscribed with the words: 'FIFA. World Championship Winners, Jules Rimet Cup, Ray Wilson, In England, 1966.' It is the second time the medal has been put up for sale. It was previously sold for £80,750 in 2002. The 1953 FA Cup Final, known as the Matthews Final, has gone down in history because of the brilliant performance by the winger - and because of his two previous FA Cup final defeats. Matthews's Blackpool side were down 1-0 to Bolton Wanderers within two minutes, with Nat Lofthouse the first on the scoresheet for Bolton. Blackpool and England forward Stan Mortensen was able to score an equaliser, but with 22 minutes to go until full-time, Matthews's side were 3-1 down. In one of the greatest individual displays seen at the old Wembley, Matthews miraculously inspired Blackpool to victory. Mortensen got a second, but, with one minute of time left on the clock, they were still losing 3-2. Mortensen then scored a third from a free kick - making him the only player to score a hat-trick in a Wembley FA Cup final. Minutes later, Matthews put a cross into the penalty box, which Bill Perry hammered home to win the trophy. Even though he did not score, the match became known as the Matthews Final. Blackpool's all-time record apperance maker Jimmy Armfield explained why. He said: ‘The nation just loved him. He had suffered in previous finals and they just wanted him to win. ‘I don’t think we have ever had a player like him before or since. He was unique. He played from the age of 15 until nearly 50. Amazing.'","Stanley Matthews's 1953 FA Cup final medal could sell for up to £60,000 .

"Sam Burgess has excited Bath colleague Dave Attwood with how quickly he has adapted to rugby union. Code-switcher Burgess will make his eagerly-awaited first start on Friday night when Bath take on Montpellier in the European Champions Cup at a sold-out Recreation Ground. It will be an early acid test of how far the 25-year-old has come after just two substitute appearances, but England forward Attwood believes the former rugby league star is showing signs that he can live up to his huge billing. Code-switcher Sam Burgess will start his first game for Bath  on Friday against Montpellier . Dave Attwood bursts through the challenge of Sebastien Bezy of Toulouse in a recent European tie . ‘Sam has come in and soaked everything up like a sponge,’ Attwood told Sportsmail. ‘He’s got a great opportunity and we’re all very excited to see what happens when he gets his hands on the ball. He’s a very physical specimen. He’s big, quick, holds on to the ball well and frees his arms up. ‘He has all the natural ability you would want to see, but the most exciting thing is his yearning to get better. We were walking off the pitch the other day and he was saying, “I can’t wait to get my first turnover in a ruck”. He’s well-spoken and down to earth. He doesn’t talk unnecessarily, but when he does talk he does so effectively.’ Burgess replaces Kyle Eastmond at inside centre in a game Bath must win to stand a chance of qualifying from Pool Four. Springbok flanker Francois Louw starts in the back row with Attwood at lock. Yorkshireman Burgess shattered his cheekbone seconds into his last game of rugby league in October — when he inspired the South Sydney Rabbitohs to victory in the NRL Grand Final. Burgess (centre) came on as a substitute in Bath's 30-5 victory at Montpellier on December 5 . Burgess, pictured tackling Montpellier's Benoit Paillaugue, will start against the French side on Friday . He has been eased into his new code with appearances off the bench against Harlequins a fortnight ago and Montpellier last week but Attwood believes that, in time, the big-money signing has the potential to break into the international set-up. ‘Let’s walk before we can run,’ said Attwood. ‘We’re still not sure where he’s going to end up playing but he’s done everything very well so far. Let’s support him and get him playing. If we can get that to bed together, then I’m sure he’s got all the attributes to succeed at international level. ‘Having guys like him around the Bath squad is beneficial to everyone: the young guys coming up and the old guys who have maybe put their feet up a little bit.’ Bath forwards coach Neal Hatley added: ‘We have to take a leap of faith and increase Sam’s game-time to see how quickly he is grasping the game. ‘But if his training is anything to go by he is really getting to grips with it. We couldn’t have had a more willing student.’ Sam Burgess and Greg Inglis of the Rabbitohs celebrate victory during the 2014 NRL Grand Final .

"Billy Vunipola admits it wasn't just his body left battered and bruised from England's below-par autumn internationals but his ego too after losing his place in Stuart Lancaster's starting XV. He may have seen Gloucester No 8 Ben Morgan move ahead of him in the England pecking order in November but his autumn snub and subsequent injury has made Vunipola hungrier than ever to nail down his international jersey ahead of next year's World Cup. Heading into the autumn Tests the England No 8 shirt seemed firmly in Vunipola's grasp, but things began to unravel in the November opener against New Zealand, the world champions teaching Vunipola a thing or two about ball retention as he managed just four carries as the All Blacks won at Twickenham. Billy Vunipola did not have a good autumn international series in an England shirt . Things failed to improve as South Africa also left Rugby HQ triumphant the following weekend, with Vunipola dropped altogether for England's win over Samoa. In an effort to force his way back in Stuart Lancaster plans while back with Saracens; Vunipola suffered a concussion against Northampton Saints which again meant he played no part as England signed off from 2014 by putting Australia to the sword. While Vunipola was on the sidelines Morgan was staking his claim to be Lancaster's go-to man for the England No 8 jersey. The Gloucester man scored against Australia en route to being named man of the match – but Vunipola insists he is not giving up without a fight. 'The autumn was certainly a massively frustrating time for me but at the same time it was also a huge learning curve,' he said. Vunipola is hoping to impress for Saracens to win his England place back ahead of the World Cup . 'I think heading into the autumn I maybe got carried away with my form for Sarries and maybe I was just a bit too over-confident, not necessarily on the pitch but perhaps more off it with my religion and faith and everything. 'But maybe being dropped will actually benefit me and turn out to be a good thing because I have learnt so much off the back of it. 'I have never been in a situation like that, just for whatever reason I couldn't transfer my club form over to my country, but sometimes it goes like that and you need to get back on the horse and I am excited about doing that. 'I am still learning and I have a long way to go but I am determined to win back my place and I will do all I can to do exactly that.' Being dropped is more than enough motivation for Vunipola to once again reach the heady heights he hit when he burst on to the international scene last year. Vunipola knows he has work to do if he is to secure his place in the England side for the World Cup . But just in case he needed it, a fast approaching Six Nations followed by a World Cup on home soil is giving the former Wasp that extra boost. 'One lesson I learnt from the autumn is that you can't think too far ahead, you have to take each game as they come and focus on that,' he added. 'I know I have to play well to even be included in the squad for the Six Nations but I do keep thinking about what playing a World Cup game at Twickenham would be like. 'I would love to play in a World Cup in England, in an England shirt, and that gives me extra motivation to get back in the side. 'Ben Morgan is a very good player and he showed that last month and it is great that we can push each other on. 'We both want to play but only one can so we will both be trying our hardest to make sure we are the ones with the shirt in time for the Six Nations.' Billy Vunipola is a Land Rover Ambassador.

The powerful midfielder scored what turned out to be the winner in Sunday's 2-1 home victory over Celtic who — as revealed by Sportsmail earlier this month — have reignited their interest in adding him to the Parkhead squad. But McNamara, experiencing his first win over his former club as United manager, said: ‘We would want the going rate. We don’t need to sell, we’re debt free, everything is good. Stuart Armstrong heads the ball past Celtic keeper Craig Gordon in Dundee United's win on Sunday . ‘If the right offer came in, I’m sure the chairman and the rest of the board would look at it. But the most important thing is to keep them here, let them progress and learn. ‘We would like to have done that with Andrew (Robertson) and Ryan (Gauld) in the summer — but there comes a point when it is too good to turn down, not just for the club but for the kids themselves. Of course, silly money changes everything. ‘It was the same in the summer with Andrew Robertson. You don’t want to sell him — but there comes a point when you have to accept it. ‘Every team in Scotland is a selling club. Celtic is a selling club, so you could try to sell some of their players for the next few weeks. ‘Speculation has been part of it since I came here. And it will be until the end of January when the window closes. ‘I’m hopeful I will still have the same squad, maybe one or two players coming in, instead of going out. As revealed by Sportsmail earlier in the month, Celtic are interested in signing the central midfielder (right) ‘It is a compliment to the players, it is always nice for them to be linked (with other clubs). ‘But, for the manager, it doesn’t help. Last year, it wasn’t one or two, it was six or seven. ‘And we lost a couple mentally for a few weeks because of that. We sent Ryan Gauld and John Souttar away on holiday. Because of that, they took a little dip (in form). ‘Armstrong was linked, Nadir Ciftci was linked, Gary Mackay-Steven was linked. ‘Hopefully, it is not as many this year — and there were no signs of losing focus against Celtic today. ‘No doubt, as we get closer to the transfer window, everybody will be linked with somebody.’ McNamara heaped praise on his team for getting the job done at Tannadice, singling out Ciftci — who was booked inside the opening minute, scored the opener and then provided a brilliant assist for Armstrong’s goal — as a player worth all the effort to curb his volatile temper. ‘When Nadir is on it, he is a handful. Not just his goal but his set-up play for Stuart to score as well.’ said McNamara, whose team were made to sweat by Leigh Griffiths’ late counter for Celtic. Dundee boss Jackie McNamara insisted the club will not sell Armstrong unless a decent offer comes in . The striker, who came on as a 78th-minute substitute for Nir Bitton, also saw another effort bounce back off the post, whilst what appeared to be a perfectly good goal from Celtic’s Stefan Scepovic was ruled out for offside. McNamara added: ‘We have said all along Nadir is a fantastic problem, who has taken a lot of hard work behind the scenes. ‘When he got booked after 30 seconds, that is part of it! But I have said all along that he is worth the hassle at times because of what he can give to the team, the ability he has.’ Armstrong also lived up to his pre-match billing, Celtic manager Ronny Deila having described him as a ‘Thomas Muller type’, player who can cause damage to any opposition. His winner will have done little to lower the Norwegian’s opinion of him. The question is whether Deila will have been impressed enough to pay a hefty transfer fee for a really promising footballer who has 18 months left on his Tannadice contract. Dundee sold Ryan Gauld (above) to Sporting Lisbon and Andrew Robertson to Hull City last summer . ‘It’s a compliment more than anything,’ said the 22-year-old of the continued interest, adding: ‘It gives you a bit of confidence and it is nice to hear of interest there. It helps in your game for Dundee United. ‘Everyone has dreams and ambitions but I like to focus on where I am at the moment and doing my best. ‘I didn’t see that Muller comparison. It is quite a compliment. He is a World Cup winner — and not a bad player! ‘Yes, it’s nice to hear him paying those kind of compliments. It wasn’t in my head today. ‘I always enjoy playing against Celtic. They are a good team, they pass the ball really well and it’s good to compare yourself with the best quality in the country. Everyone put on a good show today.’ Meanwhile, McNamara insisted his team, who move into second place in the table, should not be considered title contenders, arguing: ‘It is still too early to say that. We have to be more consistent.’","Dundee beat Celtic 2-1 in the Scottish Premiership on Sunday .

"One month ago, Manchester City languished eight points behind Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League and appeared to be on the point of Champions League elimination. Some supporters might have wondered about the future of their likeable coach Manuel Pellegrini. Fast forward, however, and Sergio Aguero’s last-minute winner against Bayern Munich is beginning to resemble the season-defining moment many suspected it might be. Manchester City players celebrate as they move level on points with Chelsea at the top of the table . City manager Pellegrini congratulates goal-scorer David Silva as he is substituted . A routine 3-0 victory against Crystal Palace on Saturday — achieved without a recognised striker — was ominous in its simplicity and City now sit level on points with Chelsea at the top of the table. Pellegrini was pithy in his assessment, saying: ‘I know three weeks ago we were many points behind, close to elimination in the Champions League and we were a team that depends on Sergio Aguero. So maybe this is a miracle. But the miracle has a name — and that is work.’ The modern City do not disappear quietly. Ask Brendan Rodgers, whose Liverpool team were nine points clear of City with four weeks left of the last campaign. ‘We’re Man City, we fight till the end,’ was the defiant chant at the Etihad Stadium. Silva opened the scoring with a deflected shot during Manchester City's win against Crystal Palace . Silva (right) struck his second goal after the interval to send the champions right back into the title race . City have been wearing their ambush paint again in recent weeks and this time it is Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea who must concentrate their formidable energies on keeping their noses in front. It will not be easy, with City on a run of eight victories, six in the Premier League. It is a streak that features four consecutive clean sheets — mostly without Vincent Kompany, Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic. On Saturday, the goalscoring mantle was taken up by David Silva. With James Milner as the frontman, the Spaniard was typically graceful, conducting the attack with Samir Nasri. The two have struck up a fantastic understanding and, at times, looked to be operating on their own clock. Yaya Toure completed the rout with his side's third goal from a thunderous strike late in the game . Chilean manager Pellegrini insisted his side's revival this season is the result of hard work . Palace, it should be said, were limited in the extreme and it is now only one victory in 11 league games for Neil Warnock’s side. They are trying to strengthen at the back and have offered £2.5million for Lille and Senegal left back Pape Souare. It helps City to have Milner, that Swiss army knife of a footballer who produces accomplished displays wherever he is asked to perform. ‘He is a complete player’ was Silva’s glowing verdict on Milner, who laid on the pass for Yaya Toure to seal the victory. Silva is sure Chelsea will be tested at Stoke this evening and also in imminent visits to Southampton and Tottenham. A defeat for Mourinho’s team tonight would see City overtake them and grab first place for Christmas. ‘It will be a tough game for Chelsea,’ added Silva. With fixtures against West Brom, Burnley and Sunderland on the horizon, there is optimism in East Manchester that the pendulum is swinging City’s way.","Manchester City beat Crystal Palace 3-0 in their Premier League clash .

"Roma were held to a goalless draw at home to 10-man AC Milan as their Serie A title bid took a blow in the final round of the year on Saturday. The result means Juventus will spend the winter break three points clear of Roma after the league leaders beat Cagliari 3-1 on Thursday. Milan remain seventh ahead of the rest of the weekend's fixtures, two points behind third-placed Napoli in their duel for the final Champions League spot. AC Milan's Pablo Armeo is challenged for the ball by Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi . Phillippe Mexes and Mattia Destro get into a physical battle during the first half . Milan started the brighter but it was Roma who had the better opportunities, and Rudi Garcia's men should have won the match after Pablo Armero was sent off following a second yellow card. Garcia was also left fuming after Roma were denied a penalty for handball by Milan midfielder Nigel de Jong. 'It's two points lost,' Garcia said. 'We had chances but we lacked creativity in the absence of (Miralem) Pjanic. 'It also needs to be said that there was a clear handball in their area. The referees behind the goal need to take responsibility, or we shouldn't have them anymore.' Roma keeper Morgan De Sanctis does enough to put off Milan attacker Jeremy Menez . 'Nevertheless, we could have done better. But we were faced with an ultra defensive Milan side.' Earlier, a stoppage-time equaliser saw relegation-threatened Cesena rescue a 1-1 draw at Sassuolo. Milan almost took the lead with less than two minutes on the clock as Roma goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis was called into action to first parry Keisuke Honda's strike, and then block Andrea Poli's follow-up. Roma should have broken the dealdock on the half hour mark following a great run from Gervinho, but his shot was easily saved by Diego Lopez. There was controversy moments later as Gervinho's header went wide but the ball appeared to hit the hand of De Jong, who had jumped with his arm raised in the air, with Roma appealing furiously for a penalty. AC Milan and Roma player are involved in a heated dispute during the Serie A match on Saturday . Elsewhere, Philippe Mexes almost scored a screamer from 40 yards but De Sanctis pulled off an equally fantastic save to fingertip it over the bar. Tension started to mount at the Stadio Olimpico and Armero was sent off, although referee Nicola Rizzoli took a long time to pull out his book following the handling offence, and did so only after fierce Roma protests. Gervinho almost snatched a win for Roma after another mazy run through the Milan defence in stoppage time, but Lopez again pulled off a stunning save.","Roma drew 0-0 with AC Milan in Serie A clash on Saturday .

"Tory plans to strip European judges of their power to enforce human rights in Britain have been point-blank rejected by Strasbourg today. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said a future Conservative government would pull Britain out of the European Court of Human Rights if it did not accept that Parliament had the final say on UK law. But the Council of Europe – the continent's top human rights body – said the proposals were 'not consistent' with the European Court of Human Rights. It added that it was 'inconceivable that the UK as a human rights leader and founding country of this organisation would leave.' The remarks leaves British membership of the Strasbourg court hanging by a thread. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said Britain should not be bound by European court rulings . It comes amid a growing row over Mr Grayling's radical proposals, announced today following this week's Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who was removed at the last reshuffle, said the proposals were 'almost puerile'. He added: 'I also think they are unworkable and will damage the UK's international reputation.' Mr Grieve said the plan contained a series of factual 'howlers' and were not properly thought through. Mr Grayling also came under fire from his own Liberal Democrat colleague Simon Hughes, the justice minister, who accused him of playing politics with the issue because of the rise of UKIP. Mr Hughes said: 'The Conservatives don't care about the rights of British citizens, they care about losing to Ukip. These plans make no sense – you can't protect the human rights of Brits and pull out of the system that protects them.' Under Mr Grayling's blueprint, a future Conservative government would issue an ultimatum to Strasbourg that it must accept being merely an 'advisory body' to British courts - or face the UK withdrawing from the system altogether. The party would scrap the Human Rights Act introduced by Labour in 1998 to enshrine the European Convention on Human Rights in domestic law. Instead there would be a British Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, which would include the principles from the convention, which was originally drawn up by British lawyers after the Second World War. That legislation would make clear that the judges of the Supreme Court were not obliged to take European Court of Human Rights' rulings into account when coming to decisions. Mr Grayling said that if the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe refused to accept the new arrangements, Britain would simply leave the convention. He said critics of his plan were ‘just plain wrong’, adding: ‘What we’re doing is going back to a convention that we’re part of, to our partners in that convention and saying “Look, this doesn’t work for us anymore”.’ The Justice Secretary added: ‘I think the public of this country are frustrated with the way human rights laws have evolved.’ He said the Strasbourg court had a ‘blank cheque to go where it wants with human rights laws’, adding: ‘Our parliament can do nothing about it.’ Mr Grayling said the Government was ‘absolutely prepared’ to pull Britain out of the court - adding that he had consulted on his plans with the current attorney-general, Jeremy Wright, who had considered them 'fine, viable and legal'. The European Court of Human Rights based in Strasbourg enforces the convention on human rights set up after the Second World War and signed by a almost all European countries. It is separate to the EU . But the Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable, speaking on a visit to Edinburgh, said: ‘It's a very retrograde step. ‘We do value human rights in our society - it's what our democracy is all about - and we also value a system of law in which judges rather than politicians make the final decisions, and it's very important that we retain that core and that framework. ‘We would see a gradual decline in the credibility of our legal system because, essentially, in order to score cheap populist points, the legal system is being undermined and judges are being undermined.’ Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry accepted that the European Court of Human Rights was not perfect but insisted Britain could not ‘pick and choose’ the laws it wanted to abide by. She told BBC Radio 4's World At One: ‘In the end, if we sign up to the convention, we sign up to the convention. ‘If we want to amend the convention in the way the Tories want to then I'm quite sure that Armenia and Ukraine and Russia would be very happy to do so. ‘But I think the rest of civilised Europe would be outraged and simply wouldn't allow us to ... which I think would then mean that we would need to withdraw.’ She accused the Conservatives of going ‘far too far’ and suggested it was a ‘backdoor way’ of trying to leave Europe. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve said leaving the European Court of Human Rights would damage Britain's international reputation . Instead she called for judges to be improved and for the reduction of the backlog of cases at the European Court. But Justice Minister Lord Faulks, who is responsible for human rights in the justice department, defended the plans, saying they would bring human rights back to UK. He added: ‘We are reasserting the sovereignty of Parliament. ‘We are not giving any comfort to dictators. We have a very proud history of protecting human rights in this country. ‘I have rather more faith in Parliament and our Supreme Court than some people seem to do. ‘The very rights that are contained in the convention are going to be replicated in our British Bill. ‘We would like to remain a party to the convention but we want ultimately to have the right to override the decision in those rare circumstances where we think the Strasbourg court gets it wrong.’ He insisted that the Tories were not playing electoral politics, saying that discontent had existed for a long time. The barrister also said he had personally seen the problems the Human Rights Act causes ‘every day’ in the domestic courts. He went on: ‘It's an irony that the Labour Party said, when bringing in the Human Rights Act, that they were bringing rights home. In fact what they were doing was sub-contracting them to Strasbourg.’","Tories want to strip European court of power to enforce human rights in UK .

"There's plenty of fish in the sea, but this one has come a very long way. Sustainable fishing campaigners have described the extensive international journey of a Coles crumbed dory fillet from the ocean to the supermarket shelf as 'ridiculous'. According to the packaging, these dory fillets were caught in New Zealand, then crumbed in China and then shipped back to the south Pacific, where they were packaged in Australia. At a rough estimate, the fish would have travelled at least 17000km - possibly more - before it finally arrived on Australian supermarket shelves. Scroll down for video . This crumbed Coles fillet has travelled a very long way to arrive on supermarket shelves . A black oreodory fish . A Coles spokesman told Daily Mail Australia the company is committed to sourcing food from Australian suppliers, including '100% of our fresh meat, 100% of fresh salmon and around 96% of fresh produce.' 'We try to source our seafood from Australia wherever and whenever possible, however, in order to ensure that we give customers choice, we source seafood from overseas when it is not available locally,' the spokesman said. The fish's extravagant travel provoked intense commentary on the social media site Reddit, with some commentators asking 'WTF' and quipping: 'Fresh to you daily!', while others defended it as a common practice. More than 70 per cent of fish on Australian plates is imported from overseas, according to former chef Matthew Evans. He told Daily Mail Australia on Thursday that the flathead, barramundi, Pacific dory and prawns sold to Australians are often sourced from South America or Asia. Greenpeace Oceans campaigner Nathaniel Pelle praised Coles for providing more information than is necessary on the packaging, but noted it had travelled absurdly far. Rough estimate: This is how far the fish would have travelled if it began its journey in Auckland and ended in Sydney . Former chef and food critic Matthew Evans says much of Australia's fish is imported from overseas. Flathead often comes from South America . Fish often labelled 'pacific diary' often comes from New Zealand . 'The ridiculous distance this fish has travelled, and the carbon miles involved in its transportation, is another good reason to choose locally caught fish,' Mr Pelle said. Mr Evans said it was evidence of a strange and unsustainable food system. 'It's quite a bizarre food system we have where it's cheaper to ship things across the world and back rather than pay someone to do the work locally,' he said.","This is the extravagant journey of a Coles crumbed dory fillet .

"Three men have admitted to a pitch invasion stunt which forced a Tottenham match to be temporarily halted last month. Nathaniel Thompson, 23, Helder Gomes, 22, and Daniel Jarvis, 26, were arrested after bizarre scenes during Spurs' Europa League match against Partizan Belgrade on November 27. The match had to be suspended shortly before half-time after the men ran on to the pitch at the north London club, one after the other. Three men were charged over a pitch invasion during Spurs' Europa League clash with Partizan Belgrade . The first pitch invader was on the field for five minutes and managed to take a selfie with Kyle Naughton . Gomes and Thompson were detained by stewards and Jarvis was tackled on the White Hart Lane pitch by a player. All three men pleaded guilty at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court to a charge of going on to a playing field without a lawful excuse or authority. Although they were all wearing BassBuds T-shirts, the court heard that the stunt was not sanctioned by the headphone manufacturer. Rather, defence lawyer Altaf Mohammed said, the trio were handing out headphones to crowds outside the match as part of a promotion. Striker Roberto Soldado grabbed hold of one of the pitch invaders and pulled his shirt off him . Benjamin Stambouli scored the only goal of the game as Tottenham beat the Serbs . They were given tickets to the game and made a spur-of-the-moment decision to storm the pitch. 'They were basically doing voluntary work - it's only once they entered the stadium that they decided to do what they did,' he said. He added that all three were 'ashamed' of their behaviour.

"Nabil Bentaleb regrets missing out on Tottenham Hotspur’s League Cup semi-final but insists he has a duty to represent Algeria in the Africa Cup of Nations. The 20-year-old scored the first goal as Spurs cruised to a 4-0 victory over Newcastle on Wednesday to set up January’s last-four date with League One Sheffield United. Bentaleb, though, will be in Equatorial Guinea with Algeria, the country of his parents’ origin. Nabil Bentaleb celebrates scoring the opener for Tottenham in the 4-0 rout of Newcastle at White Hart Lane . And the France-born midfielder says he could not refuse the call to appear at his first Cup of Nations. ‘It's a really bad thing to miss the semi-final but it's my country and I made the choice to play for them and I have to assume it now,’ said the former France youth international who played for Algeria at the World Cup. ‘I have always felt a connection to Algeria. When people ask me why I chose Algeria over France, I say when I was younger and France lost, I was not crying in front of my TV, whereas when Algeria lost I was crying and I was getting angry. Algeria's Bentaleb (right) tracks Tottenham team-mate Nacer Chadli during the World Cup in Brazil . ‘That's the reason why I chose Algeria because my heart always wanted Algeria.’ Bentaleb could be missing for up to four weeks should Algeria progress to the final. However, he does not fear losing momentum at Spurs. ‘I have found my position at Tottenham but you are never safe – that’s football,’ he said. ‘You can get injured. I got injured and I came back into the team and you have to fight again. ‘Maybe next week I won't be in the team and I have to fight again.

Bentaleb caught the eye when former manager Tim Sherwood elevated him to the senior set-up following his appointment 12 months ago. And the midfielder will never forget Sherwood’s faith and influence. ‘I owe him a lot,’ said Bentaleb, who has been at Spurs’ academy since 2013. ‘He was the first one to trust me and put me in the team. Most of the credit I have is for him. I will be forever grateful to him. ‘I have developed, I have grown as a player. I know I still have a lot to learn but I'm listening to all the advice I get from everywhere. I'm like a child.

The artwork does not represent a particular race, he said, but was a compilation of faces that were black, brown and white. 'Diversity is the backbone that makes this country great,' he said. 'This is a great way of celebrating that.' The striking artwork, which can apparently be seen from space, is a staggering six acres in size and required 2,500 tons of sand and 800 tons of topsoil in materials . The artist used GPS technology to mark 10,000 points with tiny pegs on an empty field and then linked them with twine to create precise lines for the portrait made of dirt. Rodriguez-Gerada has created similar pieces in the past in Amsterdam, Belfast and Barcelona, including an image of President Barack Obama. The soil and sand - all of which was donated - will eventually be reused to improve the National Mall's turf, park officials said. By November, the portrait will start to disappear. 'A lot of my work is ephemeral,' Rodriguez-Gerada said, 'because I want to talk about living in the moment.' The piece is entitled 'Out of Many, One,' the translation of E pluribus unum from the US seal. It is the first such artwork commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery .","The six-acre artwork of a young man's face is called 'Out of Many, One' and can be seen from space .

"Queensland beachgoers are being warned to keep a sharp lookout for poisonous sea snakes during this time of year. The Australia Zoo Rescue Unit found five sea snakes washed up on beaches across the Sunshine Coast this week and were taken to the wildlife hospital. Four sea snakes including two elegant sea snakes from Kawana, an olive headed sea snake from Coolum and a yellow bellied sea snake from Peregian were spotted on Tuesday. The Australia Zoo Rescue Unit found five sea snakes washed up on beaches across the Sunshine Coast this week and were taken to the wildlife hospital . Sea snakes, also known as coral reef snakes are venomous elapid snakes that inhabit marine environments for most or all of their lives. Symptoms of envenomation include muscle pain and stiffness, drooping eyelids, drowsiness and vomiting, and a serious bite can lead to total paralysis and death. Anyone suspected of being bitten by a sea snake should seek medical attention immediately, even if the bite appears trivial (sea snake bites are initially painless and show no sign of swelling or discolouration). These species has caused fatalities overseas, however none have been recorded in Australia. Source: Australian Museum . The team found another olive headed sea snake from Peregian on Friday. But before the hospital could treat them, one of the elegant sea snakes and a yellow bellied sea snake died from injuries. Australia Zoo Rescue Unit manager Toby Millyard told Sunshine Coast Daily that he is encouraging people to be aware that these reptiles were common during this time of year. 'Sea snakes can fall victim to large, strong swells causing them to wash ashore,' said Mr Millyard. 'Sometimes they are found to be ill or injured and require veterinary treatment however those that wash up from exhaustion often require a check-up and time to recover before they're released back to the wild. 'You can tell a sea snake from a land snake due to their paddle-shaped tails and if found, it's important not to pick them up as they are venomous - call the Rescue Unit for assistance,' he said.

Initially Owens was not going to face criminal responsibility. However the occupants changed their mind when their landlord became involved in the incident.

But it also creates the environment in which Balotelli is feted, feeding his ego. The players will notice it, too, and perhaps come to resent this unmerited adulation in time.

"A panel beater who shot dead a burglar during a break-in should have grabbed his phone, not his gun, a court has heard. Wade Vandenberg's family have spoken of a life cut short because Ivan Joe D'Angelo took the law into his own hands. Mr Vandenberg was shot in the head and killed when he was one of three men trying to break into D'Angelo's Melbourne panel beating shop one night in March 2013. Ivan Joe D'Angelo arrives at the Victorian Supreme Court on Tuesday where he was told he should not have taken the law into his own hands . Mr Vandenberg's mother, Patricia Vandenberg, told D'Angelo he had other options. 'I know he wasn't perfect, but he was to us,' she said, reading her victim impact statement to the Victorian Supreme Court. 'You had no right to be judge, jury and executioner for what he may have been doing.' D'Angelo, 39, was acquitted by a jury of Mr Vandenberg's murder but he pleaded guilty to manslaughter. His trial heard D'Angelo lived at his Thomastown shop and was under the influence of marijuana and alcohol when he was woken by the three burglars. The court heard he grabbed his legally-owned rifle, loaded a magazine with two bullets but did not realise there was another already in the chamber when he accidentally pulled the sensitive trigger. D'Angelo's lawyer Peter Faris QC told Tuesday's plea hearing his client was remorseful. 'He is terribly sorry for what happened,' Mr Faris said. 'He understands as best he can what a tragedy it's been for the family.' Mr Faris said D'Angelo was responding to the 'grossly illegal' conduct of the three men.

"As he posed for a holiday snap on the beach, six-year-old Nick Wheeler paid no attention to the little girl making sandcastles a few yards away. It was only when he showed his fiancee Aimee Maiden the photograph 20 years later that she pointed at the five-year-old in a swimsuit and shrieked in astonishment: ‘That’s me!’ The pair lived hundreds of miles apart when the picture was taken in 1994, yet fate determined that they would meet and fall in love at sixth form college, 11 years later. Scroll down for video . Nick Wheeler (circled right) was on holiday in Mousehole, Cornwall, where his now wife Aimee (circled left) was brought up. They had no idea they had first met when they were five and six until they found the picture . The couple pictured in the very same spot now ahead of their wedding at a nearby church in Mousehole . Teacher Miss Maiden grew up in the seaside village of Mousehole in Cornwall, while Mr Wheeler lived in Kent but was on a family holiday there. The pair spent the day building sandcastles just a few yards apart but their two families were strangers and never spoke. Mr Wheeler, a soldier, moved to Cornwall a year later but it wasn’t until they were to the same sixth form college in Truro that they finally met. It was only when they got engaged last year that they decided to leaf through old holiday photographs at Mr Wheeler’s grandparent’s house. As they came across the shot of Mr Wheeler building a boat in the sand with his sister and cousin Miss Maiden suddenly recognised herself as one of the young girl’s in the background. The couple married on Saturday and will be heading to Florida for their honeymoon . She said: ‘The photo was taken by Nick’s grandad. Nick is sitting front right in the boat with his sister and two cousins and his family, his mum, uncle and nan are to the right and behind them. ‘To the left and behind his cousin I’m in the blue swimsuit with my mum, dad and sister. ‘What makes it even more significant was that, although I was brought up in Mousehole, Nick and his family didn’t even live in Cornwall at the time. ‘He and his family were down on holiday from Kent and didn’t move down permanently to Newlyn until a year later.’ After their college years Mr Wheeler joined the army while Miss Maiden trained as a teacher. They moved in together three years ago and got engaged last year, where they hosted a party and showed off the photo to friends and family. The couple married on Saturday at Gulval Church in Mousehole, 20 years after the photo was taken and just a minute’s walk from the same spot. They are heading to Florida for their honeymoon and plan to frame the treasured picture as soon as they get back. Miss Maiden added: ‘It’s probably something we should do. The honeymoon is a great chance for a bit of quality time together. ‘Nick is often away for months at a time on tours of duty in places like Kenya and Jordan, and as soon as we get back from honeymoon he is off to Canada for two and half months.’","Aimee Maiden, 25, and Nick Wheeler, 26, had no idea they had met before .

"She made her debut as a fresh-faced ingénue in a long-since departed British 'bodice ripper' drama when she was just 23. And as actress and producer Trudie Styler prepares to celebrate her 60th birthday next month, she admits there is a ‘paucity’ of roles in Hollywood for women over 40. The evergreen blonde, married to rocker Sting, has most recently produced movie hit Filth and in an exclusive interview with MailOnline, she says: ‘Look at George Clooney…I’m a huge admirer of his, but when he plays a leading man in a love story, his love interest is always 10 years his junior. Unfair: Actress and producer Trudie Styler says male stars like George Clooney will always have love interests 10 years younger - as Hollywood 'always wants to rose tint everything' Happy New Yorkers: Trudie Styler and Sting attend an opening night party for her new play, The Seagull, in New York in October . ‘Why not have an actress the same age . as him?  Hollywood always wants to rose tint everything, but this . doesn’t even reflect real life. ‘In life, you see younger men and older women and the majority of marriages don’t have such a huge age gap as we're used to seeing in films.’ Oscar winner Clooney, 52, has appeared in movie hits over the past few decades with a string of female stars.

Mother-of-four Trudie - who made her TV debut on 1970s period drama Poldark - adds: ‘My . daughter Mickey is an actress and I tell her women need to make their . own films, they should always be looking for stories to develop . themselves and go to acting class – not that she needs much prompting in . that! ‘It’s just important that actresses should realise that acting isn’t their only string. ‘We . see that for an actress in her early 40s, there is a paucity of roles, work does become thinner as opposed to what you are offered in your 20s . and 30s. ‘Leading women are being replaced by younger actresses.’ In . 2011, Trudie set up Maven Pictures alongside business partner Celine . Rattray, who won a Golden Globe – as well as an Oscar nod - for . producing 2010 hit The Kids Are All Right, starring Julianne Moore and . Annette Bening. And asked whether she felt helped or hindered by her . marriage to one of music’s most famous men – and a reputation that has . not always been so glowing, Trudie, who will celebrate her milestone birthday on January 6, replies: ‘It’s an interesting . question… . ‘The Trudie Styler that is spoken of is extremely privileged in life and feels that privilege. ‘I’m . a very lucky woman and have been extremely fortunate in the way that my . life has been for nigh on 30 years, with my husband looking after me . beautifully. ‘We love each other and we are loved by our children, I . don’t have any room at all for any complaints, there will always be . detractors, that's just the way of the world.

Female-driven:  Maven Pictures this year produced Girl Most Likely starring Bridesmaids break-out star Kristen Wiig and Annette Bening . But with the success of Filth, Trudie laughs as she . admits: ‘Look at Filth – it’s quite misogynistic! I was in Lock, Stock . and Two Smoking Barrels and I like my bad boy movie movies. ‘And I really love Irvine Welsh and what he’s done for guilty pleasures, he makes us think and his novels provoke and stimulate. ‘It . is a modern tragedy that James is so brilliant in and I hope he will . garner laurels and win something this weekend and get a BAFTA nod. ‘The cast have done us proud, we’re very proud of Shirley and Eddie – and I’m very proud of it as I was so hands on with it. In October, Trudie made an acting comeback on Broadway in Chekhov’s The . Seagull and reveals: ‘I did get bit by the acting bug again, it was a . four-act Chekhov play and I don’t think I’ve played that kind of role . before, it was very challenging and ultimately very gratifying. Then: Sting and Trudie in the Eighties . Now: 32 years later, Trudie said 'I love him more each day' Advice: Trudie Styler says she has told her actress daughter Mickey to make sure she has more than one string to her bow. The pair are seen at the Girl Most Likely screening in New York in July . Accompanied by Sting at the opening night party in the city where the couple have made their home, Trudie told The Times they prefer living in the U.S. after being 'treated unkindly' in their home . country. She said: 'I don't want to criticise . my country but there are times I feel Sting and myself have been treated . unkindly. I feel much more relaxed here, not having to second guess . myself.' She added: 'Rock stars' wives have never been given an easy time. They weren't nice about Linda McCartney until she died.' Strong women: Oscar favourite Cate Blanchett has signed up to star in Maven Pictures' Cancer Vixen: A True Story, while Amy Adams will star in their adaption of Steve Martin's novel,  Object of Beauty . And now Trudie is planning another theatrical jaunt, this time alongside her friend Sean Mathias, planned for next year. Written by the late British playwright Pam Gems,called Savage Love, Trudie says: 'It’s about an aging Arthur and Guinevere. Guinevere is on trial for her life for her adulterous, long-term affair with Lancelot and meanwhile, Arthur is living at court with all his bastard children, and she ain’t gonna take it lying down. So it’s a bit of a face-off and a portrait of their marriage, really. And it’s a very brilliantly written piece about women’s rights and relationships.' And with that, Trudie adds defiantly: ‘People will say what they want to say, but I don’t really answer my critics.’","Actress and producer says there's a 'paucity' of roles for women over 40 - adding 'Leading women are being replaced by younger actresses'

"A California Highway Patrol officer is off the streets as he faces accusations of stealing nude pictures from a DUI suspect's phone and sending them to his own device as the woman was booked into a county jail. The unidentified 23-year-old woman who's made the shocking allegations claims officer Sean Harrington went through her phone after she was pulled over on Interstate 680 in August. She claims she gave him her password so he could find a phone number for her to contact someone about her booking. The unidentified 23-year-old woman claims officer Sean Harrington went through her phone and stole nude photos of her while she was being booked in county jail . He sent as many as six images of the young woman to his own cell phone. She discovered the invasion of privacy when her iPad, which was synced to the phone by the iCloud service, showed a record of the images being sent to an unknown phone number in the 707 area code during the hours she was in custody. Her attorney says that number was later identified as belonging to Harrington's cell phone. 'She's tremendously distraught,' her attorney, Rick Madsen, told ABC 7. 'We don't know at this point, although we're gratified by the extent of the investigation by the Contra Costa District Attorney's office, the extent to which they've been transmitted, either to other individuals perhaps other law enforcement officers.'

The district attorney's office will decide whether to press criminal charges once their investigation is complete. Harrington is on desk duty while the investigation continues into next week. 'We've been investigating this for quite some time, the investigation is coming to a conclusion and we expect to make a charging decision this week,' deputy district attorney Barry Grove told The Contra Costa Times News. Grove would not comment on the possibility that other officers would be implicated.

"EXTREME by Emma Barrett & Paul Martin (Oxford, £16.99) What kind of people are drawn to spend time in extreme environments? Not you or I, obviously. We’ll read about such places, but we don’t want to go there. But who are the men and women who climb the highest mountains, explore the poles, dive to the bottom of oceans and spend months on space stations? Not to put too fine a point on it, are they all halfway round the bend? This isn’t actually a frivolous question, and psychologists Emma Barrett and Paul Martin have seriously attempted to answer it in this rich and often compelling book. Lionel Greenstreet (left) with his beard frozen during the Shackleton expedition and Apsley Cherry-Garrard (right) who was a member of Captain Scott’s Antarctic back-up team, and described polar exploration as ‘the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised’ Test pilots, round-the-world yachtsmen and deep-cave explorers are not like the rest of us: they cannot be. So what psychological and emotional qualities does a person need to survive, even thrive, in such circumstances? Some cannot prepare enough. Apsley Cherry-Garrard was a member of Captain Scott’s Antarctic back-up team, and described polar exploration as ‘the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised’. The winter before Scott walked to the South Pole — and his death — Cherry-Garrard and two companions were sent off into the Antarctic wilderness to collect Emperor penguin eggs. It was pitch dark, temperatures hit minus 60c and each man needed rescuing after falling into deep crevasses. The cold was so intense that their teeth started to split. They even became frostbitten in their sleeping bags. Five weeks later, they returned with three penguin eggs, but a decade later, Cherry-Garrard said that the expedition ‘had beggared the language: no words could express its horror’. Tom Wolfe said people with endurance had 'the right stuff' You may have what Tom Wolfe called ‘the right stuff’. In 1952, a test pilot called Bill Waterton took off in a jet aircraft minutes after seeing a fellow pilot die in a horrific crash. ‘Waterton, who still had burn marks from a crash he had survived nine days earlier, was forced to taxi along one edge of the runway to avoid the smouldering wreckage of his friend’s plane. The ability to overcome fear and manage anxiety is a prerequisite for coping with extremes.’ A chapter on loneliness is followed by a chapter on the difficulty of dealing with other people. Even this isn’t as simple as it sounds. The traveller Wilfred Thesiger was never lonely while walking barefoot across the Arabian deserts, perennially thirsty, baking through the day, freezing at night. But put him down in a European city where he knew no one and he was miserable. ‘The worst loneliness,’ he wrote, ‘is to be lonely in a crowd.’ Anxiety, meanwhile, afflicts even the best of them. Brendan Hall, skipper of the yacht that won the gruelling Clipper Round The World race in 2009-10, attributed his success, in part, to meticulous planning. ‘But thinking about all the potential dangers gave him sleepless nights before the start of every leg of the race.’ Some experience such anxiety in real life they turn to extreme activities as a way of managing it. Here’s Vera van Schaik, a cave diver known for chasing depth records: ‘My personal life was this world of confusion, stress and fear in which I struggled on a daily basis to cope. Diving was a place of peace and calm in which I excelled.’ Many people go looking for excitement and find, instead, monotony. Eugene Cernan, who went to the Moon with Apollo 17, later wrote: ‘Funny thing happened on the way to the Moon: not much. Should have brought some crossword puzzles.’ Eugene Cernan, who went to the Moon with Apollo 17, later wrote: ‘Funny thing happened on the way to the Moon: not much. Should have brought some crossword puzzles.’ So when Nasa built the Skylab space station in the early Seventies, it brought in the industrial designer Raymond Loewy for advice on habitability. Many of his suggestions are now standard in confined environments: moveable furniture, varied colour schemes, plants for you to water. For Skylab, his most controversial suggestion was a window for the astronauts to look out of. Nasa resisted. It seemed frivolous. But for the mental health of the astronauts, it turned out to be essential. As one said, ‘all the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18ft by 20ft and leave them together for two months’. People do indeed fall out. In 1959, a Soviet scientist killed another scientist with an ice pick after an argument over a game of chess. The USSR’s response was to ban chess at its Antarctic stations. And what of the loved ones all these maniacs leave behind? The climber Robert Macfarlane argued that mountaineers who keep on taking big risks are ‘either profoundly selfish, or incapable of sympathy for those who love them’. One climber’s wife even admitted to feeling an instant of relief when she heard her husband had died, because at least she wouldn’t have worry about him dying any longer. It will probably be no surprise that there isn’t one sort of person who is drawn to these exploits, or one sort of person who excels at them. As in real life, it takes all sorts. The climber Robert Macfarlane argued that mountaineers who keep on taking big risks are ‘either profoundly selfish, or incapable of sympathy for those who love them’ There’s only one kind of individual you really want to avoid.

"The retiring Democratic Iowa Senator has urged voters not to support candidate Joni Ernst, saying 'I don't care if she's as good looking as Taylor Swift'. Senator Tom Harkin said the Republican representative would not be right for Iowa despite the fact that she seems 'attractive' and 'sounds nice' on campaign adverts. Ms Ernst is vying to become the first woman to represent Iowa in the Senate by defeating Democrat Bruce Braley in a contest which could decide which party controls the Senate. Scroll down for video . The retiring Democratic Iowa Senator has urged voters not to support candidate Joni Ernst (right), saying 'I don't care if she's as good looking as Taylor Swift' Speaking at a Democratic barbecue last week, Mr Harkin said: 'In this Senate race, I've been watching some of these ads. 'And there's sort of this sense that, 'Well, I hear so much about Joni Ernst. She is really attractive, and she sounds nice.' 'Well I got to thinking about that. I don't care if she's as good looking as Taylor Swift or as nice as Mr. Rogers, but if she votes like Michele Bachmann, she's wrong for the state of Iowa.' The crowd burst into applause after his speech. Harkin spent Sunday campaigning with Mr Braley, a day after a Des Moines Register poll showed the Democrat trailing Ernst by seven points in a race he was once expected to win handily. Senator Tom Harkin said Ms Ernst would not be right for Iowa despite the fact that she seems 'attractive' and 'sounds nice' on campaign adverts . The poll suggested that the Republicans may win a race deemed critical to the party's takeover of the U.S. Senate. J. Ann Selzer, who conducted the poll, said 'This race looks like it's decided.' More than 51 percent of likely voters support Ms Ernst, the poll found, the biggest lead the Iowa state senator and former military leader has received so far. Ms Ernst has served a combined 21 years in the United States Army Reserves and the Iowa Army National Guard. Ms Ernst has served a combined 21 years in the United States Army Reserves and the Iowa Army National Guard and her current role is Lieutenant Colonel . She spent 14 months mobilized and overseas in Kuwait from 2003-2004 as a company commander at the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In her role as a Lieutenant Colonel, Ms Ernst currently commands the largest battalion in the Iowa Army National Guard. Michele Bachmann is a congresswoman best known for her conservative Tea Party politics, and her candidacy for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. American voters will decide which party controls the U.S. Senate in tomorrow's elections and at least 10 competitive races are still considered too close to predict a winner. Around 36 of the 100 Senate seats are at stake in the midterm elections, which are held halfway through the four-year presidential term. Republicans must pick up six more seats from Democrats to reclaim a majority. All 435 seats are up for election in the House of Representatives, where Republicans are expected to expand their majority, and governors will be chosen in 36 states.

"An undercover newspaper investigation found doctors had apparently agreed to terminate pregnancies based only on the baby's sex, with 'no questions asked' A decision not to prosecute two doctors who agreed to fix illegal abortions for women based on the gender of their baby has been criticised by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. The Crown Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to bring the cases to court ‘with a realistic prospect of conviction’, but that doing so was not in the public interest. Mr Hunt criticised the decision last night and asked the Attorney General ‘for urgent clarification’. Last year an undercover newspaper investigation found doctors had apparently agreed to terminate pregnancies based only on the baby’s sex, with ‘no questions asked’. Some were recorded admitting they were prepared to falsify paperwork to arrange the abortions and one likened the practice to ‘female infanticide’, it is claimed. Andrew Lansley, who was health secretary at the time, said he was ‘extremely concerned’ about the allegations and referred the cases to police to investigate whether an offence had been committed. It is illegal for a pregnancy to be terminated on the basis of the baby’s gender, and the CPS concluded there was sufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution. But it said that the cases should be dealt with by the General Medical Council – which has no criminal powers – because it ‘would not be in the public interest’ to prosecute the doctors. It noted that no abortion actually took place. Mr Hunt voiced alarm about the decision. He said last night: ‘We are clear that gender selection abortion is against the law and completely unacceptable. ‘This is a concerning development and I have written to the Attorney General to ask for urgent clarification on the grounds for this decision.’ As part of the Daily Telegraph investigation last February, reporters accompanied pregnant women to nine clinics across the country, two of which said they were prepared to abort the baby because of its gender. But after a 19-month inquiry the prosecution service decided that the doctors will not face criminal charges, even though there is enough evidence to prosecute for an attempted breach of the 1967 Abortion Act. Health Secretory Jeremy Hunt criticised the decision last night and asked the Attorney General 'for urgent clarification' Jenny Hopkins, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, said: ‘Taking into account the need for professional judgment which deals firmly with wrongdoing, while not deterring other doctors from carrying out legitimate and medically justified abortions, we have concluded that the cases would be better dealt with by the GMC rather than by prosecution. ‘In coming to this conclusion, we have also taken into account that in these cases no abortion took place or would have taken place.’","CPS said 'enough evidence to bring cases to court' with hope of conviction .

"When Clark Kent  wanted to transform into Superman, it was a fairly simple task. He would step into a phone box, spin around and the switch would be complete. But Herbert Chavez's change into the comic book hero has taken a bit longer - through 16 years of plastic surgery. Is it a bird? Herbert Chavez in his full Superman regalia, showing off years of gruelling plastic surgery . Change: Herbert Chavez underwent 19 surgeries over 16 years to look like Clark Kent. Here is how he changed between 1995 and 2012 . The 35-year-old, from Calamba City, . Philippines, has had nose jobs, skin whitening, lip liposuction, jaw . realignment, pec implants and even abdominal implants to become a . real-life Clarke Kentafter falling in love with the TV programme aged five. He has splashed around 300,000 Pesos (£4,400) on his obsession - a fortune compared to the average 90p hourly wage in the Philippines. Mr Chavez regularly takes to the streets around his home dressed in full Superman regalia, with his hair gelled in distinctive curly fashion. He aims to teach kids good morals while also brightening their days. Citizenship: Mr Chavez goes out in the streets wearing his full costume and signature gel-covered hair to promote good morals to local children . Hero: Herbert Chavez, 35, strikes a pose which would make his idol, Clark Kent, proud . He said: 'I feel like a Superhero whenever I pull on the costume, but my mission is not to save the world but to help in my own small way and bring a smile to the faces of local children. 'I don't have any regrets at all. People come up to me in the street all the time and want their picture taken with me. 'They are all really excited to see a real-life Superman in the Philippines.'

Avid fan: In June 2013 Guinness recognised Herbert for having the largest collection of Superman memorabilia with 1,253 items . But his distinctive look has not come easily, with Herbert going under the knife repeatedly to copy every last feature of the super hero he worships - right down to his chiselled chin. And Mr Chavez admits it is tasking trying to keep up with such a 'perfect' person. He added: 'If you talk about super heroes, the expectation of people is that they are flawless, they do not get hurt, they do not die.

Powerful pose: Mr Chavez stands in front of a collage of Superman artwork with rays of light beaming from behind him . 'But as human beings, we can only copy their looks. Especially as a Filipino, I have very Asian features and did not look like the caucasian Superman. 'So when I was able to save enough money to alter my features, I chose to copy those of Superman. Youngster: Herbert Chavez pictured before he had received any plastic surgery . 'It is hard living up to people's expectations as a living superhero. That is the reason I have had so many surgeries because I undergo maintenance procedures that need performing. 'For example, my cleft chin is formed of hydrogel, but it does not always appear balanced. The more dehydrated you get the smaller it gets, so you have to keep adding to it. 'I am such a good customer of my surgeon, Tito Garcia, he does all the work for free as part of a part-exchange deal. 'I help publicise his practice in return.' Herbert now plans to keep improving his look with more operations to make him taller and surgery to beef up his abdomen and bum. But he acknowledges that there may be a day when he has to halt the extensive surgeries. Mr Chavez said: 'I totally don't have any regrets. What is there for me to regret? Everything that has happened in my life has been positive and because of Superman. 'When my body says it can not endure it anymore or when my doctor says that my body can not handle it because of age, then I will stop.'

In June 2013 Guinness recognised Mr Chavez for having the largest collection of Superman memorabilia with 1,253 items - ranging from life-size dolls, to posters and rings worth thousands of pounds. But he says his collection is actually closer to 5,000 items and plans to increase it to around 10,000 pieces - and has even moved home in order to accommodate the influx of comic book clutter. Now famous across his native country thanks to numerous TV appearances, Mr Chavez's friends and family are supportive of his unusual hobby. Him mum Linda said: 'I remember when he was a kid, he was already fond of Superman figures. He would be very happy when I bought him shirts with Superman pictures on them. 'At school they held drawing competitions, and he would always draw Superman pictures. 'As parents we are happy because though he is small, he has become the Filipino Superman. He has become well known in our community - he has become people's idol.'

"Time may be running out for Andrew Culliford. But ask him whether he'd rather meekly give in to the illness that's killing him or risk taking an unlicensed drug that might stave off its devastating effects, and his answer is unequivocal: he'd take the drug - without a second's hesitation. The 37-year-old fire officer and father-of-one was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) in July 2011 at the age of just 34. He was told he had just two to five years to live. There is no cure for the disease, which affects the motor neurons - nerve cells that control muscles - in the brain and spinal cord. The muscles gradually waste away, affecting the patient's ability to walk, talk, eat, drink, swallow and eventually breathe. Andrew, who was diagnosed with MND in June 2011, with wife Donna and daughter Isla, 4 . Within a year of his diagnosis, Andrew started losing the strength in his right arm and hand. His speech became slurred, and in 2012 he and Donna married while he could still say his vows. 'Now I have to feed Andrew because the muscles in his tongue and throat have weakened,' says Donna. 'His speech is very slurred so I often have to interpret what he says to other people. He can't use his arms and is starting to find walking more difficult.' The only treatment for MND on the NHS is riluzole, which offers just three extra months of life after it's been taken for a year. But there are other drugs that might help. Through his own research, in late 2012 Andrew came across aimspro, which was being tested for neurological conditions such as MND and multiple sclerosis. Former Rugby Union player Joost van der Westhuizen was taking it for his MND after travelling the world looking for a cure. 'We figured he'd be getting the best treatment for the disease, so Andrew wanted to try it,' says Donna. New drugs undergo three stages of testing. In the first, the drug is given in small doses to healthy patients to check for side-effects; then it's given to a larger group of people who have the disease it's been developed for; finally, some patients are given larger doses, while others are unknowingly given a placebo. The 37-year-old fire officer and father-of-one was diagnosed with motor neurone disease . Aimspro has undergone an 'open label' clinical trial, a version of this last stage, where patients know they are taking the real drug, not a placebo. But it could still take ten years for it to be licensed and prescribed to patients - time that desperately ill patients such as Andrew do not have. What they want is access to drugs such as aimspro before they are licensed. However, drug companies are reluctant to allow this, even to dying sufferers, for fear of being sued if patients experience adverse effects or die as a result of taking them. Aimspro is available for 'named patient compassionate use', meaning a doctor can prescribe the drug where no other is available, although it is still considered experimental and has to be paid for privately. Furthermore, the doctor bears the risk of being sued, so many are reluctant to do this. Andrew was able to find a doctor who would prescribe the drug, but had to sign a disclaimer to waive his rights to sue if something went wrong. He's since spent all his savings and money raised by well-wishers - a total of £50,000 - having the £180-a-day drug injected. 'I was able to carry on working, albeit in a more administrative role, at the fire station. I even ran the London Marathon this year,' says Andrew, speaking through Donna. But the drug could only slow progression of the disease, and by summer he couldn't use his arms, meaning everyday things such as making a cup of tea were out of reach. 'But he still believed the drugs were helping,' says Donna who lives with Andrew and their four-year-old daughter Isla in Poole, Dorset. However, his money has now run out and he's had to come off the drug - and in the three months since he stopped taking it, he has gone considerably downhill. 'The muscles in my throat and tongue that help me speak have deteriorated,' says Andrew. 'My speech was slightly slurred before, but now it's worse. 'Walking isn't coming naturally any more - I have to concentrate on how to do it. Andrew with wife Donna . 'We were recently at a wishing well and Isla threw a coin in and wished I had new arms. 'I'd love to pick Isla up and cuddle her - it's what I long for. 'It's been soul-destroying knowing there's a drug out there that would help me, but I can't have it.' Now it seems that a new law could soon make Andrew's wish a reality. Yesterday it was announced that a Bill which would allow terminally-ill patients to be given untested drugs had received government backing. The Medical Innovation Bill, which will go before the House of Lords on Friday and is due to be considered by MPs in December, would allow doctors to treat people with terminal illnesses - and who have exhausted standard treatment options - with drugs that are unlicensed or have not been tested for their disease. The Bill would give legal protection to doctors so long as they obtained agreement from another specialist to prescribe drugs or surgery which wouldn't normally be given for a patient's condition. This would apply to NHS and private doctors, meaning that funding would come down to local health authorities, now known as Clinical Commissioning Groups, as is the case with standard treatment. If passed, the Bill could become law in England and Wales by March. The Bill was proposed by the Conservative peer Lord Saatchi, who has led a campaign to change the law after his wife, author Josephine Hart, died from ovarian cancer, aged 69, in 2011. He argued that current rules are impeding medical progress, forcing doctors to stick to traditional treatments which don't always work. 'Doctors know if they divert from these well-worn treatment paths and attempt an innovative treatment, and then something goes wrong, they will be found guilty of medical negligence,' he has said. As he told Good Health yesterday: 'I want every patient who is facing a terminal diagnosis to be able to ask their doctor: 'Have you tried everything?' And for this Bill to allow doctors to say, confidently: 'Yes.' Proportion of people with cancer who take part in clinical trials . 'No patient should die thinking more could have been be done, but wasn't for fear of the law. No husband, wife, son, daughter, mother or father should be forced to say goodbye to a loved one with that doubt hanging over them.' Donna Culliford says she and her husband, who have spoken previously in the Mail about the need for the law to change, 'support this Bill 110 per cent'. 'Doing nothing is not an option for us. Sitting here waiting for the Grim Reaper is not an option. We know aimspro works for Andrew, so that's the drug we want to try.' Another patient who could benefit 'hugely' from the proposed legislation is six-year-old Jack Johnson. He has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a terminal and incurable condition that causes muscles to weaken, and he is slowly losing the ability to walk and lift things. Andrew in 2011 with two-year-old Isla . His mother says there are 43 drugs in development for Jack's condition, but none has yet been approved. 'Jack will die from Duchenne, but he could have treatment,' adds Alex, 30, who lives with her husband Andy, 40, their two-year-old son James and Jack, near Chorley, Lancashire. 'This new Bill would change all that. 'I'm not some crazy parent. We want to discuss these untested drugs with doctors and make a decision together. We'd be willing to sign a waiver if they would just give us access to these drugs. 'As a mum, I see these promising drugs dangling in front of me and we can't use them. Jack has said to me: 'Mummy, when are my legs going to get better?' All I can do is tell him Mummy and Daddy are working hard to find new treatments.' 'I would try these drugs on Jack. I know that might kill him. But the risk, for me, is doing nothing. My son is going to die anyway.' Yet some clinicians don't think the Bill is the way forward. Michael Baum, professor emeritus of surgery at University College London, said yesterday: 'Changing the law is not going to accelerate innovation in cancer therapy, but might, endanger our patients by uncontrolled experimentation.' And Ammar Al-Chalabi, professor of neurology and complex disease genetics at King's College London, has warned: 'Licensed drugs have to go through rigorous trials. Even if an unlicensed drug works in some way, it might kill you in another way or cause problems.' But many patients don't accept this argument. In August the World Health Organisation said people with Ebola should be allowed untested drugs; Andrew believes the same should apply to other people facing death. 'I know we can't compare having MND to the Ebola outbreak, but for those of us with a terminal illness, we're facing a crisis every day. 'I'd welcome being used as a guinea pig for untested drugs. It might make a difference to others and it would give me a sense of purpose, rather than just fading away.'

"Geoff became ill and ended up in hospital . Geoff Paul suddenly found himself being asked if he'd been working out or was following a new fitness regimen. However, he didn't take this as a compliment. The Thames Water manager, who is just over 5ft 9in, had dropped from 13st to 10½ st in just a year, despite making no changes to his diet or exercise routine. 'I was petrified I had cancer,' says Geoff, 43, who lives with his wife Nicole, 36, a teacher, and their children James, seven, and Jacob, two, in South-East London. After developing extreme fatigue and thirst, as well as needing to use the loo at night, he went to his GP. The doctor thought his symptoms pointed to diabetes and checked Geoff's blood sugar. The reading was 13 (a normal reading is four to seven) and he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the body isn't making enough of the hormone insulin or the insulin it is making isn't working properly. Insulin mops up sugar - or glucose - in the bloodstream, so it can be used by the cells for energy. Geoff's age put him in the 'at risk' category for type 2 diabetes. As well as being over 40, other risk factors include being overweight, a family history of the condition or coming from South Asian or black communities. Geoff was given metformin, which cuts blood sugar levels by reducing the amount of glucose produced and released by the liver, and a meter to monitor his blood sugar daily. But his levels remained high and he continued to feel exhausted. Despite repeated visits to his GP, it wasn't until two weeks after his diagnosis when he was hospitalised with dangerously high blood sugar that doctors realised he didn't have type 2 diabetes - he had type 1. With type 2 diabetes, the body produces less insulin; with type 1, the body produces none at all. This is because type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system malfunctioning and attacking beta cells, the insulin- producing cells in the pancreas. Around 400,000 people in Britain have type 1 diabetes, with one in five diagnosed over the age of 40. However, because the condition is traditionally thought to begin in children and younger people, doctors may be missing cases in adults. When Home Secretary Theresa May was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes last year aged 56, doctors first thought she had type 2. Geoff  was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes because usually younger people have type 1 . Geoff, too, had been told by his GP that he was the wrong age to have the condition. Experts warn this is a common mistake and can have serious consequences. The only way type 1 diabetes can be treated is with regular insulin injections or an insulin pump. People with type 2 diabetes are offered insulin only if other treatments stop working. The risk is that patients who are misdiagnosed with type 2 end up with dangerously high blood sugar and can be put at risk of the life-threatening condition diabetic ketoacidosis. Without insulin, the body cannot use glucose in the blood for energy, so it breaks down fat and muscle for fuel instead. The by-products of this process are ketones, poisonous chemicals, which can build up and make the body acidic and cause dehydration. This can cause heart problems, kidney failure and even swelling of the brain, leading to coma and death. The lack of awareness about late-onset type 1 diabetes may be leading to some patients becoming seriously ill, according to a study earlier this year by the Royal Gwent Hospital. The study's co-author, Professor Peter Evans, highlighted the case of a 77-year-old female patient who suddenly developed diabetic ketoacidosis due to type 1 diabetes. Geoff also suffered from this complication and spent four days in hospital. One possible cause of late-onset type 1 is a group of viruses called coxsackie B viruses. Most of us get these as children, but they can be caught in adulthood and cause illnesses from colds and mild gut problems to myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscle). The viruses seem to trigger the body's immune system to malfunction and start slowly attacking the insulin- producing beta cells in the pancreas. 'This can sometimes happen quickly, bringing on type 1 diabetes within weeks, but for most the beta cells are killed more gradually,' says Libby Dowling, a clinical advisor to Diabetes UK. 'Physical or mental stress - such as another virus, exam stress or surgery - can tip the body over the edge (because the stress requires a surge of glucose to repair damaged cells in the body) and suddenly type 1 diabetes occurs.' But even without stress, type 1 diabetes is inevitable because the virus has led to the beta cells being destroyed. Geoff Paul, who has type 1 diabetes but was diagnosed, with wife Nicki and sons Jacob, 2, and James, 7 . Another risk factor for late-onset type 1 diabetes may be having other auto-immune conditions, says Dr Parijat De, an endocrinologist at NHS City Hospital, Birmingham and BMI Priory Hospital. Geoff suffers from a number of auto-immune conditions - rheumatoid arthritis (inflammation of the joints), ulcerative colitis (inflammation of the lining of the colon) and vitiligo (this causes loss of skin pigment). 'When I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at 30 I was warned I may develop other auto-immune conditions,' he says. 'But my GP didn't consider that when diagnosing type 2 diabetes.' Doctors should always investigate weight loss, says Libby Dowling: 'Alarm bells should ring with GPs if patients with high blood sugar have lost a lot of weight, even those over 40. 'Type 1 symptoms come on over weeks and months while type 2 manifests gradually over years.' Dr De suggests type 1, not 2, should be considered if patients aren't overweight. It was a sudden drop in weight that lead to Sandra Johnson being diagnosed. The 51-year-old administrator was diagnosed in February 2011 after she lost a stone in just three months without dieting. She also suffered from thirst and lethargy, and developed leg pains, a less common symptom that occurs because high blood sugar can damage the nerves. The proportion of hospital beds in England occupied by patients with diabetes . She was admitted to hospital after her GP tested her blood sugar levels - at 27, they were alarmingly high. 'The doctor at the hospital wasn't sure if I had type 1 or 2, saying usually younger people had type 1, so it was less likely I'd have it at my age,' says Sandra, who lives with her husband Karl, 45, a structural engineer, in Derby, and has two grown-up children. 'I knew type 2 was linked to diet, so I just thought I'd eaten too many sweets and cakes.' She stayed in hospital for four days to stabilise her blood sugar and was diagnosed with type 1 two weeks later. 'The doctors were surprised due to my age. I was shocked, especially when they explained I'd need insulin for life.' Doctors said a virus may have been to blame - she'd recently had a cold. To ensure that all patients receive the correct diagnosis, Dr De recommends that where high blood sugar levels are accompanied by sudden or unexpected weight loss (or where the patient is not overweight), the GP should talk to a diabetes specialist. They should also consider testing the patient's blood for immune GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) antibodies. These attack the beta cells during an auto-immune reaction. 'Type 1 patients are more likely to have these, so this can indicate if an older person has type 1 or 2,' says Libby Dowling. 'Another blood test checking for C-peptide, a breakdown product created when insulin is produced, is also useful to determine what type of diabetes patients have.' The presence of C-peptide suggests it might be type 2. Geoff and Sandra want GPs to listen to this advice. Geoff, who monitors his blood sugar levels and injects insulin daily, says: 'There's a mindset that type 1 diabetes affects only young people and that's why I was fitted into the type 2 category - but this could have cost my life.'

"A gardener who lied to his girlfriend about being mugged to avoid getting into trouble for buying his friends drinks has been jailed for wasting police time. Christopher Kimberley, 24, blew £150 on drinks on a group of friends including his boss, landscape gardener Jamie Cox, during a night out in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. When asked by his girlfriend where the money had gone, he panicked and told her Mr Cox had taken his card and pin number and stolen money from his bank account. Christopher Kimberley, 24, was jailed for six months yesterday after admitting lying to police over money he spent on beer . Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that Kimberley’s girlfriend and father contacted police, and he kept up the story when he was questioned by officers. As a result of Kimberley's lies, Mr Cox was eventually arrested and held in a police cell for 12 hours while questioned before he told police Kimberley must have made up the story to avoid getting in trouble with his partner. Further checks with the bank revealed £100 had been withdrawn on the ‘stolen’ card before it was alleged to have been taken, and Kimberley was arrested. He was jailed for six months yesterday after admitting intending to pervert the course of public justice and fraud. Sentencing, Judge Paul Glenn criticised ‘time-wasting’ Kimberley for persistently lying to the emergency services. He said: 'The man you named was arrested, interviewed and held in custody for almost 12 hours, and he was on bail for a couple of months before your lies came to light. 'You wasted a significant amount of police time and the time of an ambulance team who came out to see you when you complained of your injuries. Kimberley had been drinking with friends in the Stoke-on-Trent suburb of Hanly (general view pictured) 'What motivated this was covering up money you spent that day socialising.' Prosecutor Paul Farrow said Kimberley spent 25 April working for Mr Cox but later went drinking in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, and spent cash buying Mr Cox and others drinks. The following day Kimberley told . police £150 had been withdrawn from his account.  In a second statement . he said £140 was taken in two withdrawals of £100 and £40. 'The lie snowballed.  It just escalated.' - Paul Cliff, defending Kimberley . Mr Farrow added that as a result of the allegations, the bank refunded him with £112.82. Paul Cliff, defending, said Kimberley, who has learning difficulties, had been out with Mr Cox and two other men. He said: 'He had with him a wad of cash.  He bought most of the drinks. 'Eventually his girlfriend contacted him and he had to explain where the money had gone.  He gave her an account of the money and the card being taken as to why he could not afford to get a taxi... 'The lie snowballed. It just escalated.' The court heard Kimberley has since apologised to Mr Cox. A spokesman for Staffordshire Police said: 'We will not tolerate individuals who abuse public services and this result sends a clear message out to anyone who thinks they can get away with making false reports - you face arrest, conviction and ultimately prison - which will impact on the rest of your life.'","Christopher Kimberley, 24, bought drinks for friends and boss, Jamie Cox .

"An estate agent to the rich and famous is celebrating after selling £3billion worth of property - on the same London street. Trevor Abrahmsohn has cornered the market on one of the world’s wealthiest roads, The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead Garden Suburb, north London - known as ‘Billionaires’ Row’. Over the last 35 years he has handled 150 house sales on the street at an average value of £20million at today’s prices. One of his pads: Estate agent Trevor Abrahmsohn is celebrating after selling £3billion worth of property - on the same street . Quite a portfolio: Mr Abrahmsohn recently made a map of all the homes he has sold on The Bishops Avenue in North London. He has sold many more since . His clients have included Bernie Ecclestone, Ringo Starr, Joan Collins and Britain’s richest man Lakshmi Mittal. Jonathan Ross and his wife Jane Goldman also have a home in the leafy area. Mr Abrahmsohn, 58, has just sold a 1.5-acre plot of land with planning permission on the leafy street for a staggering £25million. It takes his completed deals on The Bishops Avenue to 150 - having sold a number of the 66 homes and plots numerous times over. City pad: Mr Abrahmsohn sold one house, Toprak Mansion, for a record £50million in 2008 and then threw a party to celebrate. Former Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev flew in especially to attend . 'Perfect for an oligarch': Heath Hall on The Bishops Avenue could be yours... for £100,000,000 . Eye-watering amount: Jersey House, could be yours for £39,950,000 .

And the view from the house: It's not often a house in London has its own long drive, but Caravilla does . Not your average home brochure: Caravilla's details come in a hard back book . Large double bedroom: Additional facilities at the house include: a cinema, games room, leisure centre with swimming pool, separate staff  accommodation and off-street parking for more than 10 cars . Grand: Just one of the living rooms at Caravilla, on The Bishops Avenue . 'Whenever there has been an explosion . of wealth from natural resources or if there is a political uprising . people look to buy in The Bishops Avenue. 'This has happened with the oil and gas booms in Nigeria and Eastern Europe and when there was the Islamic uprising in Iran. 'The . road is perfectly located, has two golf courses, you can land a . helicopter in the garden and you’re only 20 minutes from the centre of . London. 'Over the years I . have dealt with royal families, politicians, leading industrialists. I’ve sold 95 per cent of the houses on the street and 98 per cent of . sales come through us.

"While porn has long been blamed for a rise in risky sexual behaviours among teenagers, those who watch it weekly are more likely to have sex without protection, a new study shows. The research on sexual health has found that young people who watch pornography at a young age are more likely to engage in sexual behaviour early on. And watching pornography weekly was significantly associated with inconsistent condom use with casual partners, engaging in anal intercourse and sexting. Watching pornography weekly was significantly associated with inconsistent condom use with casual partners . The Burnet institute's Centre for Population Health found Australians who viewed adult material at a younger age have a significantly earlier sexual debut. Lead researcher Dr Megan Lim said while sexual behaviour is incredibly complex, there is a strong co-relation between watching porn and sexual behaviour. ‘What we found is there is an association, so that young people who watch porn are also more likely to engage in certain behaviours,’ Dr Lim told AAP. ‘Young people who are more interested in a variety of different sexual things, a bit more sexually developed, are the ones who watch porn more.’ Young people who watch pornography at a young age are more likely to engage in sexual behaviour early on . ‘The people who watch porn are the same people who don't use a condom.’ More than 70 per cent of surveyed Australians aged between 15 and 29 indicated that they viewed pornography, with 14 being the average age of first viewing the material. An associated study found that there is an alarming disconnect between teenagers' perceptions of sexting and the actions they take. While 77 per cent of respondents agreed that 'it should be illegal to pass on a sext without permission', a third said that they 'might show a sext' they received to friends. Dr Lim said a higher percentage of homosexual Australians regularly watched porn compared with heterosexuals. The research will be presented at the 2014 Sexual Health Conference in Sydney on Thursday.","Young people who watch pornography at a young age are more likely to engage in sexual behaviour early on .

"'Unfit to teach': Eppie Sprung Dawson, 27, was found in a car with 17-year-old Matthew Robinson . A teacher who was found half-naked in a parked car with a teenage pupil could be back in the classroom in just two years. Eppie Sprung Dawson, 27, admitted having sex with Matthew Robinson – who was 17 at the time of the offence – and was found ‘unfit to teach’ by a disciplinary panel. Although the English teacher was placed on the sex offenders’ register after admitting her wrongdoing in court and has now been banned indefinitely from her profession, she can apply to be reinstated to the teaching register in two years. Last night, the teenager’s mother said Sprung Dawson had been given little more than a ‘slap on the wrist, not a punishment’. Sheree Robinson, 44, added: ‘If she is potentially allowed to go back to teaching after two years, what is to stop her from doing something like this again? ‘She should not be allowed to teach again, in my family’s view. I think this comes back to double standards and you have to wonder if she were a male teacher whether the door would be left open for her to teach again. ‘She should not be allowed to teach children of any age ever again as she clearly has problems which caused what happened with my son.’ Sprung Dawson was just four years into her career when she seduced the dyslexic teenager after offering extra help with his lessons. They were caught having sex in the front seat of her car in a layby after she had driven the boy out to the countryside from a school dance that they had both attended. A passing police patrol spotted condensation on the car windows, and when officers approached they saw Sprung Dawson and the boy naked from the waist down. The teacher lost her job at the Catholic St Joseph’s College in Dumfries, southern Scotland. Her three-year marriage to her lecturer husband Ranald – the 32-year-old son of the former Solicitor General for Scotland Lord Dawson – also ended. Mr Robinson, now 18, has since moved out of his family’s farmhouse in Dumfries and in to the shamed teacher’s marital home in the Scottish market town. Studying joinery, he has told his mother and father, Jonathan, 45, that he is just friends with his former teacher. Outcome: Sprung Dawson (right) was ordered to complete a course of psychosexual counselling and place on the sex offenders' register for six months after admitting to having sex with Matthew (left) Sprung Dawson lost her job at St Joseph’s College and split from her husband of two years, Ranald (right) after being found with Mr Robinson (left) The Robinsons have previously accused . Sprung Dawson of ‘buying’ their son with gifts such as Xbox computer . games and rugby shirts. They . told the Daily Mail in September that they believed the couple had been . having sex for up to four months before they were caught. Mrs Robinson said she did not believe her son’s claim that he was no longer sleeping with his former teacher. Sprung . Dawson, who is now said to be working in a bar, was struck off by the . General Teaching Council For Scotland (GTCS) in Edinburgh. She was not . present at the hearing, but in a statement read to the GTCS panel, she . agreed to being struck off and admitted having sex with Mr Robinson four . days before Christmas  last year. When . a teacher appears before the GTCS, it can either take no action, issue a . reprimand, grant conditional registration or remove the teacher from . the register. In removal cases such as this, teachers can be banned from applying for reinstatement for a maximum of two years. A . source familiar with the process said it was ‘rare’ for a teacher to . apply for reinstatement, and suggested that Sprung Dawson would struggle . to have her ban overturned because of the sexual nature of the case. 'Got away with it': Matthew's family said they feel Sprung Dawson, above, has not been punished for her crime . Sacked: Eppie Sprung Dawson lost her job as an English teacher at St Joseph's College in Dumfries, above, after being found to have had sex with 17-year-old student Matthew Robinson . The . Scottish Government will now decide whether to put her on a list . excluding her from working with children or vulnerable adults. Sprung . Dawson pleaded guilty in July to sexual activity with a person under 18 . while she was in a position of trust as his teacher. She was spared jail after Dumfries Sheriff Court heard how she had been abused as a teenager by a man 29 years  her senior. She . was told to complete a course of psychosexual counselling as part of a . six-month community payback order, and placed on the sex offenders’ register for the same period. Mr Robinson is understood to be one of a string of young lodgers who have stayed at Sprung Dawson’s home. She slammed the door without commenting when the Daily Mail visited last night. Sprung Dawson’s parents, Alan Sprung and Margaret Holdsworth, 64, from Coventry, also declined to comment.","Eppie Sprung Dawson was caught with student Matthew Robinson, then 17 .

"They have been linked to UFOs and hallucinations and thought to be harbingers of doom. Now scientists claim to have unravelled more details about a family of mysterious floating orbs, known as 'earthquake lights' The lights, which take many forms and appear before or during earthquakes, could provide an early warning sign. Scroll down for video... Mysterious floating orbs of lights are harbingers of an imminent earthquake, scientists claim. These lights were seen before the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China . For instance, seconds before the 2009 L’Aquila, Italy earthquake struck, pedestrians saw 10cm high flames of light flickering above the stone-paved Francesco Crispi Avenue in the town’s historical city centre. In 1988 a bright purple-pink globe of light moved through the sky along the St. Lawrence River near the city of Quebec, 11 days before a powerful quake. And in 1906, about 100km northwest of San Francisco, a couple saw streams of light running along the ground two nights preceding the devastating earthquake that destroyed much of the city. The rare earthquake lights are more likely to occur on or near a rift, an elongated depression or trough in the Earth’s crust bounded on both sides by normal faults, than other faults. VIDEO: Earthquake lights seen 30 minutes before 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China . . An earthquake light is a rare and unusual luminous phenomenon that . appears before or during earthquakes but rarely afterwards. They are more . likely to occur on or near a rift - an elongated depression or trough in . the Earth’s crust bounded on both sides by normal faults - than other . faults. Stress-activated mobile electronic charge carriers, termed positive holes, flow swiftly along stress gradients. Upon reaching the surface, they ionise air molecules and generate the observed light. Many sightings have confirmed that they have shapes similar to those of the auroras, with a white to bluish hue. Scientists are still unsure why more earthquake light events are related to rift environments than other types of faults. Stress-activated mobile electronic charge carriers, termed positive holes, flow swiftly along stress gradients. Upon reaching the surface, they ionise air molecules and generate the observed light. Continental rift environments now appear to be the common factor associated with earthquake lights. Looking back at 65 of the best recorded incidents earthquake lights were recorded in American and European documents dating from the 1600s, 85 percent appeared spatially on or near rifts. And 97 per cent appeared adjacent to a type of fault known as a subvertical fault . Intraplate faults are associated with just five per cent of Earth’s seismic activity, but 97 per cent of documented cases of earthquake lights. Geologist Robert Thiriault of the Ministry of Natural Resources in Quebec said: 'Earthquake lights as a pre-earthquake phenomenon, in combination with other types of parameters that vary prior to seismic activity, may one day help forecast the approach of a major quake. Scientists are still unsure why more earthquake light events are related to rift environments than other types of faults. However, they believe they can help warn of earthquakes in the future . 'The numbers are striking and unexpected. We don’t know quite yet why more earthquake light events are related to rift environments than other types of faults.' The earthquake lights described varied in shape and extent, though most commonly appeared as globular luminous masses, either stationary or moving, as atmospheric illuminations or as flame-like issuing from the ground. Because they occur before or during the quakes it is suggested the processes responsible for earthquake lights formation are related to a rapid build-up of stress prior to fault rupture and rapid local stress changes during the propagation of the seismic waves. Continental rift environments now appear to be the common factor associated with earthquake lights. This image of an earthquake light was taken in El Salvador . Eyewitness reports and security cameras captured a large number of light flashes during the 2007 8.0 magnitude earthquake at Pisco, Peru. Together with seismic records obtained on a local university campus, the automatic security camera records allow for an exact timing and location of light flashes that illuminated a large portion of the night sky. The light flashes identified as earthquake lights coincided with the passage of the seismic waves. The study was published in Seismological Research Letters.","These strange lights can appear before earthquakes but rarely afterwards .
They often occur near rifts caused by movement in Earth's tectonic plates .
Scientists believe the tension during this process creates an electronic charge, which turns into light when it reaches the surface ."

"When meeting someone for the first time, many of us make instant judgements about their personality or their interests based on how they look and act. And now new research claims these judgements are made before we have even had time to form and gather our thoughts. Researchers from Melbourne claim they can predict how someone feels when looking at an image from their brain waves – even when the participants weren’t conscious of this judgement. Researchers from Melbourne used electroencephalography technology (EEG) to measure the electrical activity of people’s brains while they looked at different pictures. From the results, the researchers said they could predict, from a participant’s brain activity, how exciting they found a particular image to be . Researchers from Melbourne used electroencephalography technology (EEG) to measure the electrical activity of people’s brains while they looked at different pictures. The pictures displayed images of food, social scenes or status symbols like cars and money. After the EEG, researchers showed participants the same pictures again and asked questions about each image, such as how exciting they thought the image was or how strongly the image made them think of either the present or the future. A statistical ‘decoding’ technique was then used to predict the judgements participants made about each of the pictures from the EEG brain activity that was recorded. The researchers said they could predict, from a participant’s brain activity, how exciting they found a particular image to be, and whether a particular image made them think more about the future or the present. The findings are particularly useful in establishing why and how people make impulsive decisions, and how in control of these decisions they are. The research was carried out by lead authors Dr Stefan Bode, from the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, and Dr Carsten Murawski from the University of Melbourne Department of Finance. They used electroencephalography technology (EEG) to measure the electrical activity of people’s brains while they looked at different pictures. The pictures displayed images of food, social scenes or status symbols like cars and money. After the EEG, researchers showed participants the same pictures again and asked questions about each image, such as how exciting they thought the image was or how strongly the image made them think of either the present or the future. A statistical ‘decoding’ technique was then used to predict the judgements participants made about each of the pictures from the EEG brain activity that was recorded. ‘We have found that brain activity when looking at images can encode judgments such as time reference, even when the viewer is not aware of making such judgments,' the researchers said. ‘Moreover, our results suggest that certain images can prompt a person to think about the present or the future.' In particular, the researchers said they could predict, from a participant’s brain activity, how exciting they found a particular image to be, and whether a particular image made them think more about the future or the present. The pictures displayed images of food (pictured) social scenes or status symbols like cars and money. After the EEG, researchers showed participants the same pictures again and asked questions about each image, such as how exciting they thought the image was or how strongly it made them think of the present or future . Results were true even though the  activity (stock image) was recorded before participants knew they were going to be asked to make judgments . This was true even though the brain activity was recorded before participants knew they were going to be asked to make these judgments. The authors said the results contributed to our understanding of impulsive behaviours, especially when those behaviours were caused by ‘prompts’ in the world around us. For example, it could reveal what happens in the brain of a person who is trying to stop gambling, when they are shown a gambling advert on TV. ‘Our results suggest that even if this person is trying to ignore the ad, their brain may be unconsciously processing it and making it more likely that they will relapse,’ Dr Bode added. Co-author Daniel Bennett said just as certain prompts might cause impulsive behaviour, images could be used to prompt people to be more patient by regulating impulse control. ‘Prompting people with images related to the future might cause processing outside awareness that could make it easier to think about the future. ‘In theory, this could make people less impulsive and more likely to make healthy long-term decisions. 'These are hypotheses we will try to test in the future,’ he said. The research was completed in collaboration with the University of Cologne, Germany, and the findings are published in the journal PLOS One.","Researchers from Melbourne studied the electrical activity of people’s brains .

"A British aid worker kidnapped in north east Afghanistan last month has been freed after a dramatic SAS rescue mission authorised by Prime Minister David Cameron. Helen Johnston, 27, a nutritionist from Stoke Newington in London, Kenyan national Moragwe Oirere and two Afghan civilians were rescued during an early morning raid by members of the elite special forces unit. All four hostages work for Medair, a humanitarian non-governmental organisation based near Lausanne, Switzerland and were kidnapped on May 22 in Badakhshan province. Rescued: Helen Johnston, 27, was freed during an early morning SAS rescue in Afghanistan . Badakhstan: The hostages were held in a mountainous region close to the border with Tajikistan . Heroic: The SAS were helicoptered to the cave where the hostages were being  held and stormed it, killing the kidnappers and releasing all four captives alive . The dramatic raid took place at 1am in Shahr-e-Bozorgd district, in a large forested area near the Tajikistan border called Koh-e-Laran. According to the Daily Telegraph, SAS soldiers, working with the ISAF's Joint Special Forces Group, were transported by helicopter to the cave where the hostages were being held. They then stormed the cave and freed the hostages. Mr Cameron confirmed all four . hostages were rescued safely, no British troops were injured and five . Taliban and hostage-takers were killed. A spokesman for the Foreign Office confirmed: 'They are all now safe. Helen and Moragwa are receiving support from British Embassy staff in Kabul. 'The two Afghan aid workers are returning to their families in Badakhshan.' It was recently revealed the SAS would stay on in Afghanistan after British troops withdraw in 2014 . Dead of night: Troops stormed the cave at 1am, in a bid to surprise the hostage takers while they were asleep . The Prime Minister spoke to Ms Johnston shortly after she arrived at the British Embassy in Kabul following the successful rescue attempt. During their brief conversation she thanked Mr Cameron for efforts of all those involved in bringing her to safety. The Prime Minister was told the operation had been a success at around 2am. He then stayed up to speak to military commanders on the ground and thank them for what they had done. This morning he also spoke to the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Commander and Deputy Commander of ISAF in Afghanistan to thank them for their efforts. The Special Air Service (SAS) is an elite special forces and counter terrorism unit of the British Army. Based in Hereford, England, 'The Regiment' is widely regarded the best of its kind, the SAS has become the model for a number of special forces across the world. It was constituted in 1950 and has been involved in every major conflict that Britain has taken part in since. The SAS were first deployed in Afghanistan in 2001 . and have carried out covert work uncovering Taliban bomb factories and . identifying the location of key enemy figures for air and ground . attacks. Their weapon of choice is the Canadian-made C7 rifle, which replaced the M16, and is ideal for close quarters combat. Last month it was revealed the SAS . will stay in Afghanistan after British troops withdraw in 2014, to . conduct counter-terrorism operations against the remnants of Al Qaeda. Speaking . after learning of her rescue, Miss Johnson's parents Philip and . Patricia said: 'We are delighted and hugely relieved by the wonderful . news that Helen and all her colleagues have been freed. 'We . are deeply grateful to everyone involved in her rescue, to those who . worked tirelessly on her behalf, and to family and friends for their . love, prayers and support over the last twelve days. 'We greatly appreciate the restraint . shown by the media since her abduction, and ask that they continue to . respect our privacy at this special time.' The . Prime Minister gave the go ahead for the rescue mission to take place, . and said today such decisions were 'extraordinarily difficult' and . 'never rushed into'. But he said he decided the risks to the workers' lives were getting greater. He revealed he had spoken Ms Johnston's parents and brother, and the aid worker herself, adding: It's just a huge joy that they are finally going to be re-united and they are all healthy and all well.' Mr Cameron also paid tribute to British troops involved in the rescue. Revealing the mission involved a 'long route march"" without being discovered, he said: . 'It was an extraordinarily brave, breath-taking even, operation that our . troops had to carry out.' 'I pay tribute to their skill and dedication.' 'Above . all, on this weekend of all weekends, we should say a enormous thank . you to the incredibly brave forces that took part in this operation. 'We . will never be able to publish their names but the whole country should . know we have an extraordinary group of people who work for us who do . amazingly brave things.' Relieved: David Cameron gave the go-ahead for this morning's rescue of Helen Johnson, who had been working for a Swiss-based aid organisation . He added that the rescue should serve as a warning to terrorists across the world who take British citizens hostage. 'They should know if they take British citizens as hostage we do not pay ransoms, we do not trade prisoners,' he said. 'They can expect a swift and brutal end.' The aid workers were abducted by a group of armed men during a visit to relief project sites in Badakhshan, Medair said. A British hostage was killed in Nigeria in March when an attempted rescue involving UK special forces ended in tragedy. Chris McManus, working in the country as a building firm contractor, was killed alongside an Italian colleague as Nigerian troops and British Special Boat Service commandos launched a failed mission in west Africa. The UK national had been held by terrorists associated with Islamist extremist group Boko Haram since May last year after being kidnapped from his apartment by gunmen. Prime Minister David Cameron was criticised when it emerged that Italian authorities were not notified about the covert operation until it was under way. Aid worker Linda Norgrove died during a mission to rescue her from hostage takers in Afghanistan in October 2010. Ms Norgrove, 36, was killed by a grenade thrown by a US soldier during the operation, although Wiltshire coroner David Ridley did not blame him or his comrades for the tragic mistake. Three Afghans captured with her were released unharmed a few days later. Since the kidnapping, the charity kept a lid on publicity which it felt could jeopardise efforts to secure a release. Spokesman Aurilien Demaurex said the aid workers would now be reunited with their families. 'We are really, really happy,' he said. 'Medair . is relieved that our colleagues are safe. We are immensely grateful to . all parties involved in ensuring their swift and safe return. 'The staff members are on their way . to be reunited with their families. We ask the media to respect the need . for the privacy of our employees and their families. 'Medair . would like to thank everyone for their encouragement and support during . this very difficult period. We are also very grateful for the . overwhelming messages of support from local Afghan communities.' According . to its website, the organisation has worked in Afghanistan since 1996, . providing relief to vulnerable and isolated communities. Despite . recent events, a spokesman said the charity was committed to continuing . its work 'which relies on us working safely within local communities, . wherever they may be.' Before she was posted to Badakhshan, Miss Johnson studied at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine before her posting to Badakhshan. She was interviewed by the Evening Standard last November about her work in the region. Describing life in the region as 'gruelling' and physically tough, she said: 'It can be frustrating and hard, but there is no doubt that there is a . fundamental need for us to be here. Too many children are suffering for . us not to be.' General John R Allen, commander of the International . Security Assistance Force, said the rescue mission showed the coalition's . commitment to defeating the Taliban. 'First, I would like to thank the Afghan Ministry of . the Interior and Minister Mohammadi for their tremendous support throughout . this crisis,' he said. 'Second, this morning's mission, conducted by coalition . forces, exemplifies our collective and unwavering commitment to defeat the . Taliban. 'I'm extremely grateful to the Afghan authorities and . proud of the ISAF forces that planned, rehearsed, and successfully conducted . this operation. 'Thanks to them, Ms Helen Johnston, Ms Moragwe Oirere, . and their two co-workers will soon be rejoining their families and loved . ones.'","David Cameron authorised dramatic early morning cave rescue .

"A high-flying executive avoided paying almost £43,000 in train tickets for his daily commute into London - and paid back the dodged fares in just three days after being caught. Over five years, the hedge fund manager dodged the £24.50-each-way fare while travelling from his home in the sought-after village of Stonegate, East Sussex to his place of work in the city. The unnamed man, who is believed to be the biggest fare dodger in history, exploited a loophole that allowed him to pay only a third of the actual cost of his 1hour 22minute journey. Rural: The hedge fund manager, who dodged £43,000 in rail fares over five years, began his journey into London at Stonegate train station in East Sussex, which has no ticket barriers . He caught the commuter train from Stonegate - a rural station with no barriers or ticket machine and only a part-time ticket office - without purchasing a fare. Once in London, the executive was then able to pass through the barriers at Cannon Street by simply 'tapping out' with an Oyster Travelcard paying just £7.20. But his scam was finally exposed by a ticket inspector and, in an out-of-court settlement, he paid Southeastern trains back the £42,550 in dodged fares and £450 legal cost within three days. The cost of a standard-class single fare from Stonegate - where the average home cost half a million pounds - to London is £24.50 while an annual season ticket costs £4,548 . According to a report in the Sunday Times, the senior executive is believed to have travelled into London without buying any ticket and avoiding detection from 2008 until the end of last year. Free pass: He would arrive at London Bridge station and transfer to another platform, for a service to Cannon Street, while avoiding the barriers . He was able to get off his train at London Bridge and cross a platform to catch a service to Cannon Street - again avoiding having to go through any barriers. At Cannon Street, he used an Oyster card to exit the barriers, paying the then maximum £7.20 fare incurred when a passenger taps out without having tapped in. But on November 25 last year a ticket inspector standing next to the barriers spotted he had paid £7.20 and not the £2.30 for a single ticket. After being challenged, the passenger later admitted to dodging the correct fare on five journeys between London Bridge and Cannon Street. However, suspicious investigators for Southeastern discovered that the man had for a number of years up until 2008 been purchasing an annual ticket from Stonegate. Final destination: He would reach Cannon Street in Central London, only paying £7.20 - a third of the rail fare . And within five days of being caught out at Cannon Street, the executive renewed his season ticket, leading Southeastern to believe he had been dodging the fare for his commute for five years. Despite never admitting to this, the executive offered to settle the matter out of court and paid up within three days of being notified by the train operator the total owed in dodged tickets. Southeastern, who has not named the man, said all passengers have the option to avoid prosecution and settle out of court. The train company told the Sunday Times that the executive wanted to protect his identity because he was concerned about the impact it would have on his job. Cheating the system: The unnamed commuter would only 'tap out' his Oyster card once on his journey . A spokesperson added: 'All customers have the option to settle out of court and in this case he chose to pay the settlement fee that we put to him. 'The customer wanted to protect his identity and did not admit to evading fares for five years at any point during the process.' However, crtiics have questioned why the fare dodging executive was allowed to escape being prosecuted and remain anonymous. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said in the report: 'It is not only extraordinary that the biggest fare dodger in railway history got away with it for so long, but has also now escaped criminal prosecution as well.'

"Mr Johnson claims that incomes from tolls on new roads, passengers on new railways and airport charges would help create returns of up to 8 per cent for pensioners . All the pension schemes in the public sector should be merged into one giant pot to be invested in transport infrastructure, Boris Johnson has said. The 39,000 funds for public sector workers could be amalgamated to cut out ‘extraordinary’ waste from relying on thousands of pension managers, trustees and advisers, the Mayor of London suggested. A single fund could be used to create a ‘Citizen’s Wealth Fund’ to boost the economy and improve roads, rail and airport links. Mr Johnson argued in the Daily Telegraph that incomes from tolls on new roads, passengers on new railways and airport charges would help create returns of up to 8 per cent for pensioners who invested with them. He calculated local authority pension funds alone could hold assets of more than £180billion, while combining all public sector pensions would yield ‘hundreds of billions’. Mr Johnson said: ‘There are more than 39,000 public sector pension funds in this country – each with its own trustees, managers and advisers and accountants. The waste is extraordinary. ‘Think of all those advisers and investment managers taking their fees – their little jaws wrapped blissfully around the giant polymammous udder of the state. Think of the duplication. ‘But it is worse than that – because this country is missing a huge opportunity, and one that is being exploited by more sensible governments around the world.’ Mr Johnson highlighted how huge public sector pension funds from Canada, Holland and Singapore are already investing in new housing and infrastructure in London and elsewhere in Britain. ‘We welcome that investment, of course. We are grateful,’ he said. ‘But is it not absurd that we are not able to call upon British pension funds to perform the same function?’ He predicted pension fund managers would try to stand in the way of any change. A single fund could be used to create a ‘Citizen’s Wealth Fund’ to boost the economy and improve roads, rail and airport links, Mr Johnson said . Mr Johnson said: ‘The little pension funds will fight for their independence; they will make all sorts of spurious arguments about the need for “localism” in managing this dosh, when of course the advice is all subcontracted to the same legion of investment managers, and when what they really care about is their fees and their tickets to Wimbledon…and their golf-club bragging rights. ‘The vested interests must be ruthlessly overridden. It is time for Britain to have its own Citizens’ Wealth Fund, deploying our assets in a useful way, helping us to bolster pensioners and cut pointless public expenditure at the same time.’ Mr Johnson’s plans go further than proposals already suggested by the Government to move towards Dutch-style collective pensions from 2016.","Johnson argues that income from tolls and tickets would help create returns .

"The chances of beating cancer in England still lag behind those elsewhere in Europe, official figures revealed yesterday. And although survival rates for many common cancers are improving, for some types of tumour they have slid backwards despite millions of pounds being invested in research and treatments. Data from the Office for National Statistics show that in 2012 the percentage of patients still alive five years after diagnosis had improved for nearly all cancers, compared to the situation in 2011. Cancer survival rates are improving, including breast cancer which has risen from 85 per cent to 85.8 per cent, prostate from 81.7 per cent to 83.6 per cent and bowel from 57.3 per cent to 57.6 per cent . This includes breast cancer, which rose from 85 per cent to 85.8 per cent, and prostate cancer, up from 81.7 per cent to 83.6 per cent. Overall, for 19 of the 24 most common cancers, patients saw improvements in survival rates thanks to earlier diagnosis and advances in treatment. Yet for five types they stalled or got worse, including bladder cancer in women, thyroid cancer in both sexes, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma in women and mesothelioma in men. There is no explanation as to why – and in all cases it has only been a very small decline. However, waiting times for vital tests to diagnose cancer have gone up recently as the NHS struggles to cope with the rise in patients coming forward. Campaigners said that, despite the overall improvement, England is still well behind France, Germany and Scandinavia in its survival rates. This has been partly blamed on GPs missing warning signs, and patients not making an appointment when they first experience symptoms. Experts say this is because women are more likely to see their GP early with symptoms whereas men ignore them and hope they’ll go away. ‘Cancer is not yet fixed, we can – and must – be trying to save more lives. Nick Ormiston-Smith, head of statistical information at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘This increase in survival shows the power of research - thanks to better treatments, earlier diagnosis and greater awareness more people are surviving cancer than ever before. ‘But the story's not so positive for all types of cancer - lung, pancreatic, oesophageal cancer and brain tumours still have relatively low survival rates, partly because they tend to be diagnosed at a later stage when they're much harder to treat. Over the summer, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt pledged to name and shame GPs who were missing cancer on the NHS Choices website. He wants surgeries which don’t sent patients urgently for scans to be identified with a red-flag. Although cancer survival rates are improving, Britain still lags behind many other European countries. For example, breast cancer survival rates in France and Sweden are 86 per cent . It follows an initiative by the Government in 2011 to invest an extra £60 billion in giving GPs better access to scans. Lung cancer has one of the survival rates and only 10.7 per cent of men and 14.1 per cent of women are alive five years after diagnosis. This has slightly improved compared to 2012 when they were 9.7 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively.","Survival rates for 19 out of the 24 most common cancers have improved .

"The anguished family of a soldier who was killed by his comrade in a vicious attack at their barracks after a late-night drinking session have branded his murderer 'dishonourable and cowardly', after he was sentenced to life in prison. Afghan veteran Corporal Geoffrey McNeill, 32, was murdered by 23-year-old Lance Corporal Richard Farrell at Clive Barracks, Tern Hill, Shropshire, in March. Farrell had always denied killing his fellow member of the Royal Irish Regiment but was found guilty by a jury after a four-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court. After  Farrell was sentenced to life in jail, the victim's family said the sentence was 'not comparable' to the 'immeasurable, unforgettable and indefinite' devastation caused by Corporal McNeill's brutal murder. Lance Corporal Richard Farrell (left) has been jailed for life for strangling Corporal Geoffrey McNeill (right) to death at their barracks after a night of heavy drinking . In a statement, they said: 'While we are pleased that justice through the courts has prevailed, there remains a void in our lives that will never be filled. 'The sentence received by Richard Farrell is not comparable to the sentence carried by those who knew and loved Geoff, for which there is no limit. 'The actions of Richard Farrell have significantly impacted on Geoff's family and friends, including his colleagues within the Army. 'The devastation caused is immeasurable, unforgettable and indefinite.' The family, who sat throughout the proceedings, added that Cpl McNeill was a man of 'ambition, drive and potential', whose life had been stolen along with an 'opportunity to have children and settle down'. 'We would like Geoff to be remembered for the legend that he was and not for the dishonourable, cowardly and brutal way in which he was taken from us all,' they added. Corporal McNeill was found dead in his room in March this year, after Farrell raised the alarm. The pair had been out drinking in Market Drayton the night before and Corporal McNeill had punched Farrell while they were in a pub. Farrell had told jurors how he stumbled upon McNeill's battered body the next morning. But the court heard there had been three-and-a-half hours earlier that morning where Farrell's movements could not be accounted for. Jurors had been told how Corporal McNeill's neck was broken in three places during the brutal attack. He was also punched in the head, stomach and genitals. Sentencing, Judge Melbourne Inman QC told Farrell he had carried out a 'very severe assault' on Cpl McNeill in his room. The judge said: 'That is not however how you killed Mr McNeill. You killed him by sustained pressure to his neck with either a ligature or manually, like some form of arm hold.' In the course of the strangulation, the judge added, Cpl McNeill had dug his fingernails so hard into his own neck in a bid to break whatever hold was on him, it had left marks. Judge Inman added he was satisfied there had been 'premeditation' in the attack, and that having killed Cpl McNeill, Farrell then 'left his body'. The attack took place at the Royal Irish Regiment's Clive Barracks in Tern Hill, Shropshire, in March . The family of Lance Corporal McNeill, pictured outside court, have said they want him to be remembered for his 'drive, ambition and potential' rather than the brutal way in which he was killed . 'I am satisfied that there is no sensible possibility you went looking for Mr McNeill for purely peaceful reasons and only reacted with such violence as a result of something that passed between you.' Despite Farrell's denial, the jury at Birmingham Crown Court agreed with the prosecution case that the 23-year-old soldier, from Dublin, had murdered Cpl McNeill by 'inflicting a series of heavy blows' and breaking the older man's neck in three places. He was ordered to serve a minimum 15 years behind bars. Farrell had claimed he remembered nothing of the night's events, having drunk at least a litre of Disaronno liqueur. The court previously heard there was 'no history of ill-feeling or animosity' between Corporal McNeill and and Farrell, who served in a different company in the regiment. During the trial, jurors were told how Farrell went alone to Corporal McNeill's room at about 9.15am on March 8 this year and, apparently then finding him dead, raised the alarm. Talking about the night before, Christopher Hotten QC described an incident in the town's Clive and Coffyne pub, where an 'annoyed' Farrell complained some soldiers were 'acting ""like maggots"".' Later that night, as CCTV from inside the nearby Sandbank Vaults pub showed, Cpl McNeill floored Farrell with a right hook, cutting his own knuckle and the young lance corporal's lip in the process. Witnesses later told how Cpl McNeill had claimed the younger man was 'trapping off' before he landed the punch. Farrell would also later tell colleagues he had been 'gobbing off' to the corporal, said Mr Hotten. The prosecutor said that punch 'could provide an explanation for a later attack carried out by Mr Farrell, as revenge for what had happened'. After the fracas, both men left separately, returning to barracks within minutes of each other at about 3am. Superintendent Neil Jamieson, who handled the case, read a statement on behalf of the victim's family . Farrell's movements could not be accounted for between his arrival back at base, and 6.30am, when he was discovered asleep on the floor of the guard room. The last time Corporal McNeill was seen, he was sitting outside the accommodation block housing his third-floor room on the base just after returning to the barracks. Between 4am and 4.30am that morning, a soldier whose room was opposite Cpl McNeill's thought he heard 'bumping noises' and a male voice say '""Geoff - calm down"", two or three times,' said Mr Hotten. That soldier got out of bed but only to lock his door from the inside, and did not look out onto the adjoining corridor to see what was happening. Mr Hotten said Farrell awoke in the base's guardroom, then went back to his room to shower, washing his clothes at the barracks' laundry. He asked one soldier '""where's McNasty's room?"" - in reference to Cpl McNeill, saying he couldn't remember anything, and wanted to apologise,' added the prosecutor. Farrell got to Cpl McNeill's room at about 9.15am, and said he found the other man lying on the floor in just his underpants. 'According to Farrell he made vigorous attempts at resuscitation, and that would have led to a significant transfer of DNA,' said Mr Hotten. Farrell would later tell police he squeezed Cpl McNeill's testicles 'to see if he was conscious, as part of Army training he had received', he added. Describing Cpl McNeill, from Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, the judge said it was clear he was 'obviously a hugely well-liked and respected soldier' and 'a loved and trusted comrade' much missed by his family. Mr Inman said he had read 'very moving statements' from Cpl McNeill's family. 'As a family, it will clearly take a very long time for them to come to terms with Mr McNeill's death and the circumstances of it,' he added. 'No one reading their statements could remain unmoved.'","Lance Corporal Richard Farrell attacked Corporal Geoffrey McNeill in March .

Dry-plate photography made it possible for photographers to go into the wilds of native USA and document everyday life. The iconic portrait of Sitting Bull was taken eight years after his legendary victory over General Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1886. In a bloody battle that would be seared into folklore, the chief led a united force comprising Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho Native American warriors to defend their camp against an invasion by the U.S. army.

Custer launched a three-pronged attack against Little Bighorn, but was cut off and surrounded by Sitting Bull's larger army leading to a stand off that became known as Custer's Last Stand. Custer and all his troops subsequently lost their lives. Little Bighorn also is, to some Native Americans, as the Battle of the Greasy Grass. The United States prevailed in the Indian Wars, but Sitting Bull became, and remains, a hero to his people. Later in his life, he may have taken up -- the point is disputed -- the 'ghost dance' movement, which foretold that dead Indians would return to life and that white domination would end. This spooked U.S. authorities. They went after Sitting Bull, who had settled back at Standing Rock. He was killed in a battle with Native American police and U.S. soldiers on June 15, 1890.

"Probe: Michael Gove is said to have told Ofsted inspectors to fail any schools that appear to be involved in the 'takeover' Fifteen schools are now being investigated over an alleged plot by hardline Muslims to teach extremist beliefs to children. Michael Gove is said to have told Ofsted inspectors to fail any schools that appear to be involved. Following accusations of complacency from MPs, the Department for Education last night confirmed that 15 schools in Birmingham are being inspected. The results – to be published next month – are expected to show conservative Islamic views being taught, it is claimed. The Education Secretary is said to . have told inspectors to fail schools where ‘religious conservatism is . getting in  the way of learning and a  balanced curriculum’. It means headteachers and governors judged inadequate on these grounds can be immediately dismissed. If . enough schools are rated inadequate, Mr Gove will call for further snap . inspections. The allegations surfaced last month in a leaked letter . referring to a ‘Trojan Horse’ plot to take over schools. The . letter’s authenticity is unclear, but it led to a flood of claims from . parents and staff, including takeover of governing bodies by . fundamentalist Islamists, harassment of non-Muslim headteachers, female . staff being bullied and gender segregation in lessons. A DfE official . told the Sunday Times: ‘Extreme religious conservatism often acts as an . entry to later problems. ‘A . child who is brought up, age eight, nine, ten, believing that you should . segregate the sexes and hand out Islamic textbooks is more likely to be . radicalised in later life.’ Ofsted inspectors were sent into Park View school last month after documents identified it as being targeted by extremists, but now 15 more schools are being probed . Lindsey Clark, the headteacher of Park View school, said she was not aware of any plot but welcomed the investigation and said she would act against anyone plotting against the school . One of the schools being investigated over extremist infiltration cancelled its annual visit from Father Christmas last year. Teacher Vicky Hubble, who organised the event at the secular Ladypool Primary School, was allegedly told to cancel it by the new Muslim headmaster, Huda Aslam. He is said to have told her there would be no presents and ‘no mention’ of Jesus being the son of God. According to a fellow teacher, Mr Aslam wanted to reduce festivities to little more than sing-alongs to songs such as Jingle Bells, but was forced to reinstate the Christmas assembly by Birmingham Council. However, Santa remained banned. David Cameron has promised ‘swift action’ to ensure schools are not used to spread terrorist ideology. Birmingham . city council froze appointments of any new school governors last week. But MPs said change should have come sooner. Liam Byrne, Labour MP for . Birmingham Hodge Hill, which covers several of the schools, said the . probe was moving at ‘glacial’ speed. Tristram Hunt, Labour’s  education spokesman, said Mr Gove had shown ‘a shocking degree of complacency’. Birmingham . MP Khalid Mahmood said that the council has known of the claims for . ‘eight years at least’ but had failed to act for fear of ‘appearing . anti-Muslim’. Fresh claims . have also emerged in Manchester and at two schools in Bradford, . Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College and  Carlton Bolling . College.

"Lisa Harnum, above, died after falling from the 15th floor of an apartment in Sydney, Australia in 2011 . This is the stunning girlfriend who fell 15 storeys to her death, moments after being filmed grappling with her 'controlling and abusive' fiancé. Lisa Harnum was allegedly heard yelling, 'please help me, God help me' as she fought for her life on the balcony of the flat she shared with Simon Gittany in Sydney, Australia, on the night of July 30 2011. But nobody came. Moments later she was lying dead, her body 150-feet down on the footpath below. And today it was revealed the . 30-year-old's terrifying last moments were captured on the very pin-hole . camera Gittany set up to spy on her every . move. Gittany, 37, has pleaded not guilty to murdering his Canadian-born fiancée, claiming he was trying to save her from suicide before she fell. He has been regularly accompanied to his trial by his current girlfriend. A neighbour, however, claims he saw a topless man 'fist-pumping' on the terrace after something had gone over the edge, 9News reported. Another witness walking past . The Hyde apartment block in the heart of the city told police he saw a . topless man holding what appeared to be black luggage horizontally over . the balcony before it fell to earth. 'Of course, it was not a piece of . luggage, it was Miss Harnum wearing black clothing,' Crown prosecutor . Mark Tedeschi QC said today at Gittany's murder trial. Gittany was so jealous, Mr Tedeschi claimed, that he had banned her from seeing friends, . forbade her from taking a job as a hairdresser and even hired a personal . trainer to come to their home so she wouldn't go to the gym where he . thought she would be ogled by other men. Terror: His hand clamped over her mouth to stifle her 'bone-chilling' screams for help, a shirtless Simon Gittany wrestles fiancee Lisa Harnam - minutes before she plunged 15-storeys to her death. The footage was captured on a pin-hole camera that he set up in the flat to spy on her . Describing Gittany as 'controlling and abusive', Tedeschi said he made her become Catholic, do her hair and dress exactly how he told her. '[He believed] it was her function in life to submit to his will as the male in the relationship,' Mr Tedeschi said. But his vice-like grip over her life was still not enough, the court heard. Mr Tedeschi told jurors Gittany even set up a network of mini cameras around the apartment to keep tabs on her and secretly read her emails and text messages. At court: Gittany, 37, denies murdering Canadian-born Miss Harnam on July 30, 2011, claiming he was trying to stop her from jumping . It was because of this forensic campaign of surveillance that he caught wind of her plan to leave him with the help of two friends, the court heard. As a result he allegedly abused one of them over the phone, advising them to stay away. In the months leading up to her death, the court heard, Miss Harnum had become so fearful of her fiancé's jealous rage that, when she did venture outside, she only ever stared at the ground or into his eyes for fear he might accuse her of looking at other men. 'The deceased's confidence became more and more diminished,' Mr Tedeschi said. Giving evidence, Miss Harnum's . mother said told the court: 'She told me he was always very controlling . and wanted to always know where she was, what she was doing, who she was . with, what she was wearing.' She . said when Miss Harnum plucked up the courage to tell Gittany she was . leaving him, he threatened to destroy her chances of getting permanent . Australian residency - a dream she had harboured since moving to the . country. Gittany's defence barrister Philip . Strickland SC said Miss Harnum was a 'conflicted, complicated and . confused woman' prone to over-reacting when she didn't get her own way. Mr . Strickland said Gittany only monitored her text messages via a computer . programme because she had told him she had a secret that she couldn't . disclose to him. 'The secret ate into their relationship,' he said . Her fingerprints were not found . on the glass or metal rail of the balcony onto which he said she climbed . before she fell. Reign of fear: In the months leading up to her death, the court heard, Miss Harnam had become so fearful of Gittany's jealous rage that, when she did venture outside, she only ever stared at the ground or into his eyes for fear he might accuse her of looking at other men .

"A lorry driver has been cleared of causing the death of an 18-year-old woman in a crash between his truck and a coach carrying a hen party. Kevin Ollerhead, 45, of St Helens, Merseyside, was found not guilty of causing the death of Bethany Jones by dangerous driving. Ms Jones was among a group of 20 women travelling to the hen party in Liverpool in April last year when their coach was hit on the M62 in West Yorkshire by an articulated vehicle driven by Mr Ollerhead. She died after suffering multiple injuries. All of the other passengers on the coach, who were from the Pontefract area, were injured, some severely. Bethany Jones (left) died after suffering multiple injuries in the crash on the M62. Kevin Ollerhead (right), 45, has been cleared by a jury of causing her death . The jury of eight women and four men took just two hours to find Mr Ollerhead not guilty at Leeds Crown Court. He was also cleared of an alternative charge of causing death by careless driving. The coach driver, James Johnson, 64, of Bradford, pleaded guilty to causing Ms Jones's death by dangerous driving at an earlier hearing. He will be sentenced on November 14. Gasps could be heard from the public gallery as the jury foreman announced the unanimous not guilty verdicts. Family members and friends of Ms Jones sobbed as Judge Guy Kearl QC thanked the jury. The court heard that the collision happened on April 26 last year after the 24-seater coach suffered mechanical problems and came to a 'near standstill' on the motorway. Pictured, the fatal crash on the M62, West Yorkshire that killed Bethany Jones . The coach left South Elmsall, near Pontefract, at 11.06am to travel to Liverpool for a hen do ahead of the wedding of Stefanie Firth. The passengers on the bus very quickly became aware of signs of mechanical failure, including a smell of burning, and asked Johnson to stop the vehicle. Johnson did stop the coach, which had a badly burnt-out clutch, and made a brief examination but said he could not find a problem and continued the journey. The speed of the coach gradually slowed to a crawl until it was travelling at just 5.5mph in the nearside lane of the M62, just after junction 32, near Pontefract. Mr Ollerhead, who was driving his lorry at 52mph, crashed into the back of the bus, shunting it 50 yards along the road and into a crash barrier, leaving it lying on its side across an exit sliproad. He told the court he was a professional driver and there was nothing he could have done to avoid the accident.","Kevin Ollerhead found not guilty of causing the death of Bethany Jones .

"Brendan Rodgers has vowed to make Liverpool stronger and insisted there are no regrets about sanctioning Luis Suarez’s sale to Barcelona. Suarez’s £75million move was confirmed on Wednesday but his four-month stadium ban for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup means he could not be unveiled by head coach Luis Enrique and sporting director Andoni Zubizaretta. While Enrique and Zubizaretta were fielding questions in Spain about the Uruguay striker’s character flaws, a shadow Liverpool squad lost their opening pre-season game 2-1 against Brondby. Belief: Brendan Rodgers (above) has vowed to make Liverpool stronger after losing Luis Suarez . Afterwards, Rodgers was eager to bring closure to the Suarez affair. It has been argued that Liverpool’s ambitions will be compromised by losing the 31 goals which Suarez scored last season. But Rodgers countered that they are not a one-man team and believes the four signings he has made — with the promise of more to come — will maintain their progress. ‘In my short career as a manager I have lost people who I thought would be key players,’ said Rodgers. ‘But then you go away, reflect and ensure you bring in the right replacement. Always, after that, my teams have been better teams. ‘Luis missed a lot of our games but we still won a lot of those games so we just have to move on. We have loved working with a fantastic player, but a player who obviously benefitted from our work at Liverpool. New look: Liverpool line up for their first pre-season friendly in Denmark . On the move: Liverpool's star striker Suarez (left) has left for Barcelona . ‘He’s gone and we won’t dwell on it. This is Liverpool, not a small club but one of the great ones in world football. We had great service out of Luis but it’s one we can’t worry too much about now. 'There is a lot of work going on to get in the right player. We have every confidence in the group we have, plus we will bring in more signings. Hopefully they can improve to the levels Luis Suarez improved.’ Rodgers has signed Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Lazar Markovic and Emre Can, who missed the defeat to Brondby after turning his ankle. The next target is Ben Davies. Tottenham have had a £10million bid accepted for the Swansea left back but Liverpool will match it and are confident Davies will choose Anfield. This will be a summer of change at Anfield, with other targets including QPR’s Loic Remy and Southampton defender Dejan Lovren, but there is no question there will be a period of adjustment following Suarez’s exit. Bad start: The Reds were beaten in their first pre-season match of the season . Rodgers was forced to tackle a number of contentious issues because of Suarez’s behaviour but there was no sense that Liverpool’s manager felt relieved to see a man who was voted PFA and FWA Player of the Year depart. ‘I have great respect for Luis as a person and player, I know him deeper than most,’ said Rodgers. ‘He was a good man, great performer for Liverpool and hopefully I have played a part in his progress. ‘He’s gone to Barcelona, a club he wanted to play for, and now we’ll move on. Believe me, it will be a really exciting season for us.’ Stoke believe they can sign on-loan Liverpool winger Oussama Assaidi for £4m up front.

"A banned driver who was chased by police when they spotted him driving recorded a 'selfie video' at the wheel documenting the high speed pursuit. Salim Shah raced through the streets of Burnley pursued by police and recorded the last 33 seconds of the chase on his mobile phone. The 23-year-old, who is recorded saying goodbye to a female friend, says into the camera: 'As you can see, I am being chased by police..' He added: 'I love you. I'm going to prison now. Will probably be out in about six months or something.' Scroll down for video . Stills from the video selfie recorded by Shah show him behind the wheel and with the blue lights of police cars apparently behind him as he records the final 33 seconds of the high speed police chase, lasting 17 minutes . The chase through Burnley lasted 17 minutes and started after police spotted him on the Eastbound M65 near Burnley at about 9.45pm. Pursuit-trained officers tried to stop it on Blackburn Road, Accrington, but Shah carried on and the chase ensured, with police using their emergency lights and sirens. The car stopped with the front seat passenger getting out and the person in the back seat falling out of the car and close to the back wheels. The chase then continued, with Shah racing through 30mph at up to 60mph, driving through three sets of red traffic lights and Give Way junctions. He almost hit other vehicles and then went down a small, narrow alleyway at speed, making very sharp turns on blind bends. Police had to slow to 10mph to make these bends. Shah then dumped the car and tried to run off but was found hiding in nearby undergrowth. He then said to officers: 'It was a good chase, wasn't it.' Shah, who had been banned from driving, recorded the 33 second video as he sped through Burnley . Shah was given a suspended sentence for disqualified driving, just two months before. At a hearing at Burnley Crown Court he admitted dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, no insurance and possessing cannabis. Shah, who has previous convictions for banned driving, taking a car without consent and driving without due card and attention, was disqualified for two-and-half years and must take an extended retest. Salim Shah recorded the video during a police chase . He was sentenced to 16 months behind bars. Kimberley Obrusik, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant's mobile phone had been used during this incident to make a 33 second video. The phone was held in a cradle on the dashboard and the defendant's face can be seen clearly within it, still driving. It was the final 33 seconds of the chase.' Shah later told police he had borrowed the car from a friend and his actions had been a spur of the moment thing. He claimed his driving was careless rather than dangerous as the roads were 'quite quiet.' The court heard in July, he was given 12 weeks in prison, suspended for 18 months and banned for 18 months, after being convicted of driving while disqualified and failing to stop after an accident. Laura Barbour told the court that Shah had been given bad news on the day of the incident, September 16. He had been on his way to see the woman involved. Miss Barbour said the offences showed 'an enormous amount of immaturity'. She added: 'He has had the opportunity to do a little growing up. He has now spent nearly six weeks in custody and he has found that a very difficult experience. It has sharpened his mind.' Shah claimed he smoked cannabis to self-medicate as he suffered from arthritis. Shah, who had created a detailed business plan in custody, intended to start a small business when he was out of prison. Shah was spotted by police driving on the M65 Eastbound near Burnley when he had been banned previously . Shah was sentenced to 16 months in prison at a hearing at Burnley Crown Court where he admitted dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualfied, without insurance and possessing cannabis which was found in the car . He had a job offer as an assistant manager of a company which supplied fresh produce. Miss Recorder Suzanne Goddard, QC, said Shah knew perfectly well what he was doing. She added: ' It was a quite deliberate course of driving. The word stupid runs immediately to mind.'","Salim Shah was spotted by police in Burnley driving despite being banned .

"Loic Remy has been banned from driving after he admitted being one-and-a-half times the drink limit. When the France striker’s Porsche Cayenne was stopped by police in Newcastle in March, a test showed he had 56mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath. The limit is 35mg. The 27-year-old QPR player was on loan to Newcastle United at the time. Done: Loic Remy has been banned from driving after he admitted being one-and-a-half times the drink limit . Away from home: The 27-year-old QPR player was on loan to Newcastle United at the time . He is now subject to speculation that he could move from Loftus Road to another Premier League team for between £8.5 million and £15 million. Wearing ripped designer jeans, a black T-shirt, a gold chain, and carrying a backpack, Remy appeared before District Judge Jane Hamilton at Newcastle Magistrates’ Court. He was driving on the A696 dual carriageway at 4.15am towards his home in Darras Road, Ponteland, Northumberland, on Sunday March 9 when he was pulled over. Newcastle United, for whom he was top scorer last season, had been due to play Everton that day but the game was rearranged some weeks previously. The judge banned him for 14 months and fined him £3,750, plus £200 costs and a victim impact surcharge of £120. Jonathan Dunkley, defending, said the footballer had not hired a 'very expensive lawyer to try to find a loophole' in the case. Mr . Dunkley said: 'He said to me ""Look, I have clearly made a mistake here, . a very costly mistake, a very public mistake. I was out socialising . with some friends. I thought I had carefully monitored what I had to . drink, at the end of the evening I felt perfectly sober to drive myself . and my friends back to my home in Ponteland. Woe: The Arsenal target was part of the France team to crash out of the World Cup against Germany . '""If I thought for one millisecond I was over the limit, I would have paid £20 and got a taxi to take us home"".' His solicitor added: “This is a man who is a professional footballer, as you are probably aware, and he recently represented his country in Brazil. “He sets himself incredibly high standards and he is very disappointed he has fallen short of those high standards today.” The district judge warned Remy that if he ignored the ban it would be a serious offence and asked if he understood. 'Yeah, I know,' he replied. The player did not comment to reporters as he got into a taxi and was driven away from court.

"Queens Park Rangers will kick off their summer transfer business by securing the free transfer signing of Rio Ferdinand. At first glance it may seem like the Loftus Road club are falling into the same traps that characterised their previous ill-fated stint in the top-flight. Paying top dollar for over-hyped stars, only in London for one last pay day. For this read Jose Bosingwa and Chris Samba. Out with the old: Rio Ferdinand left Man Utd on a free transfer this summer following 12 years service . Done it all: Ferdinand enjoyed a trophy laden career at United, including winning the 2008 Champions League . But with the capture of Ferdinand, you'll have to dig a little deeper. Yes, Ferdinand is 35-years-old, and yes he has very little to prove after a trophy-laden career at Manchester United. But where Ferdinand differs from Bosingwa et al is that he actually actually cares. Can you see Ferdinand laughing as he trudges off the pitch just minutes after his side were relegated from the Premier League? Not a chance. His long-lasting relationship with manager Harry Redknapp would see to that. Ferdinand knows he owes much to Redknapp for giving him his chance at West Ham as a teenager. And now the pair are reunited at the twilight of his career, Ferdinand has the chance to repay Redknapp for giving him his big break at Upton Park. In Ferdinand, Rangers have someone who will make every single member of the squad a better player. Not only by what he does on the pitch on Saturday, but simply by just being there. Flops: Chris Samba (left) and Jose Bosingwa could not help prevent QPR getting relegated in 2013 . No laughing matter: Bosingwa was caught laughing seconds after QPR were relegated from the Premier League in 2013, as Hoops boss Harry Redknapp followed . Having someone of Ferdinand's stature in and around the club's Harlington HQ will only serve to enhance their training sessions. For instance, if QPR's pursuit of Cardiff central defender Steven Caulker proves successful, then who better than Ferdinand to help nurture the former Tottenham man's talents? Ferdinand's a leader in every sense of the word, and QPR will only benefit from his experience. It is, of course, unlikely that Ferdinand can play an entire 38 game Barclays Premier League season. With a string of injuries and over 700 career appearances to his name, playing twice a week maybe be a stretch too far. But when he is available, rest assured QPR's back-four will be better for it. Mutual respect: Redknapp helped start Ferdinand's professional career while manager at West Ham . Back in the big time: Redknapp guided QPR back into the Premier League at the first opportunity after winning the Championship play-offs in May . While Redknapp has been desperate to push through his move for Ferdinand for weeks, there has been some hesitation from the powers that be at Loftus Road about his signing. That's understandable. Once bitten, twice shy and all that. They still have lingering reminders of the over-spending that has threatened the financial stability of the club. Loic Remy, who earns £80,000-per-week, is still contract to the club; as are Shaun Wright-Phillips and Julio Cesar, who both earn in excess of £60,000-per-week. But taking a former England international, Premier League and Champions League winner on a free transfer, for 12 months on a basic wage of around £50,000-per-week seems pretty low risk business. And this time next sure Rangers' money men will be laughing over their reluctance to complete Ferdinand's transfer.","QPR set to make Rio Ferdinand their first signing of the summer on free transfer from Man Utd .

"One woman's motivation to lose weight came when her size forced her to be wheelchair bound on a simple day out with friends. Linda Silverton, 55, discovered she was too large to walk around Coventry Cathedral in March 2012 and had to resort to using a wheelchair despite having nothing physically wrong with her. Linda, of  Wembley, who weighed in at 21st 9lb at the time, decided she had to stop eating large portions and go on a diet. She took up the Cambridge Weight Plan and has since lost 9st 7lb in just 18 months, now weighing 12st 4lb. Linda went from 21st 9lb (left with husband Jeff) to 12st 4lb (right) after her size began to increasingly impact her health . She said: 'Everyone who succeeds in losing weight has that one moment in time where you are so embarrassed, so upset that it gives you the strength and motivation. For me, my moment was in Coventry - at the Cathedral.' 'We had planned a fun visit with some of my closest and oldest friends to see the Cathedral and the Transport Museum. 'It should have been a lovely weekend but I was miserable. While my friends were walking round the cathedral admiring the stained glass windows, I just about managed to hobble round. Breakfast - Three croissants and a coffee on her way to work . Lunch - Sandwich, crisps and chocolate bar . Afternoon snack - Chocolate bar/cake . Dinner - A 'proper' meal - VERY large portion . Evening snack - Chocolate bar . Breakfast - Cottage cheese with a rice cake . Mid-morning snack - Cambridge bar . Lunch - Soup . Dinner - Chicken and vegetables (small portion) Linda's size saw her diagnosed with a lupus-like syndrome and arthritis in several joints . The change in her appearance has been so extreme that her son, who lives abroad, didn't recognise her when he came home to visit . Linda said: 'Everyone who succeeds in losing weight has that one moment in time where you are so embarrassed, so upset that it gives you the strength and motivation. For me, my moment was in Coventry - at the Cathedral.' Linda says the diet has changed her life and that even her own son didn't recognise her . 'By the time we got to the transport museum I couldn't manage another step. 'My friend didn't want me to be left out so went and hired a wheelchair to push me round - it was terrible. I had become too fat to walk.' Linda, who is married to Jeff, has lived in Wembley for more than 30 years. She said: 'I had always been on the large side of normal. 'Growing up, my mother always emphasised that children shouldn't waste food and should always clear their plate. 'I often started diets but never did them for more than a couple of days. I felt fine. 'Whenever I'd go to the doctor, she would tell me that I should lose weight, but 'for my size' I was in good shape. 'During my late forties, I was diagnosed with a number of health issues, including lupus-like syndrome and arthritis in my knees and various other joints. 'Where previously I enjoyed a wander round a car boot sale or a walk around the shops on the weekend, slowly this became more difficult. ' I had little energy and even small things became exceptionally difficult. 'All the doctors I saw told me that if I lost some weight, my symptoms may improve. 'I smiled and agreed that I would do something about it.' Linda says the diet has changed her life and that people don't recognise her. She said: 'I knew the diet had really changed my life when I went to visit my son, who lives abroad. 'We had arranged that he would meet me at the airport and when I came out he looked straight through me - not recognising me. 'I knew then that I really was a new person and my life had changed in every way.'","Linda weighed nearly 22st at her heaviest .

"The lesbian daughter of a Hong Kong billionaire who has offered HKD$1bn (£80million) in 'dowry' to the man who married her, has told him that she will marry a man when he does. Gigi Chao, 34, previously laughed off her father's scheme to find a man for her, but has now gone public with her plea for him to understand that she is gay, and that if it is as easy as he thinks to change her sexual orientation, he should lead by example. Earlier this month, Cecil Chao Sze-tsung, a 77-year-old property magnate, insisted that Gigi was 'still single', despite the fact that she married her long-term partner Sean Eav two years ago. Scroll down to read the letter in full . Daddy-daughter day: Gigi Chao has written an open letter to her father Cecil Chao Sze-tsung, who offered HKD$1bn(£80million) in 'dowry' to any man who marries her, asking him to accept that she is lesbian . Happy couple: Gigi, right, asks her father to 'not be terrified' of her partner Sean, left, whom she married in a civil ceremony two years ago, and to 'treat her like a dignified human being' Following the publication of an open letter to her father, Ms Chao went even further saying she will enter a straight marriage, when her father enters a gay one. 'Since Dad thinks it's so easy for me to switch from gay to straight, I should just leave it for him to demonstrate. I think I'll marry a man when he marries a man,' the told The Times. In the letter published by South China Morning Post, Ms Chao reaches out to her father, asking for him to come to terms with the fact that she is a lesbian. In the letter, which starts 'Dear Daddy', Ms Chao explains that although her love for him has not changed, the time has come for her father to accept her sexual orientation and her partner, Sean Eav, whom she has been with for nine years. 'I must have misled you to hope there were other options for me,' she writes. Definitely not single: Gigi Chao, right, and her partner Sean Eav, have been together for nine years and married in Paris in 2012 . In denial: Hong Kong billionaire Mr Chao, who claims to have slept with 10,000 women, still wants his daughter to marry a man - although he won't force her . 'I know it’s difficult for you to understand how I could feel romantically attracted to a woman; I suppose I can’t really explain it either. It just happens, peacefully and gently, and after so many years, we still love each other very much. 'Now, I’m not asking you to be best of friends; however, it would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her [partner Sean Eav], and treat her like a normal, dignified human being.I understand it is difficult for you to understand, let alone accept this truth.' 'I’ve spent a lot of time figuring out who I am, what is important in my life, who I love and how best to live life, as an expression of all these questions. 'I am proud of my life, and I would not choose to live it any other way (except also figuring out how to be gentler on the planet). 'I’m sorry to mislead you to think I was only in a lesbian relationship because there was a shortage of good, suitable men in Hong Kong. 'There are plenty of good men, they are just not for me.' Deal: Ms Chao offered to comply with the terms, as long as the man in question donated a large part of the 'reward' to her charity, and did not mind that she already has a wife . VIDEO: Gigi reads some of her marriage proposals... yes, she's still close with her father... Ms Chao married her long-term partner . Sean in a church ceremony in Paris in early 2012, but it was not . until news of their union was printed in the Hong Kong tabloids that her . father promised the million HKD fortune to any potential male suitor . able to walk Gigi down the aisle. Ms Chao had already told her father about . her wedding, and said he was ‘surprised and unpleasantly shocked,’ but . urged her not to make it public. When the plea for a man for Gigi spread over the world, the offers came pouring in. ‘War veterans from the US, someone . from Ethiopia, from Istanbul, South America, Portugal, really just from . all over the world,’ Ms Chao said. 'One American suitor wrote: ""I’m interested in the offer. I am a male person, who also happens to be gay"".' Ms Chao, an executive director at her father’s . property development company, part-time pilot, and founder of anti-poverty charity Faith . in Love Foundation, has maintained throughout her father's persistent . quest that she knows he is only doing it out of love and concern. 'I . understand that he loves me, it’s just he’s from another time and it’s . difficult for him to understand the plight of the LGBT. 'At the office . it’s business as usual. At family gatherings we hug and dance. And we . just agree to disagree on what marriage is and family is.' Dear Daddy, . I thought the timing was right for us to have a candid conversation. You are one of the most mentally astute, energetic yet well mannered and hard-working people this humble earth has ever known. Your confidence, quick wit, and charisma brightens any room you enter. I love you very much, and I think I can speak for my brothers also, that we have the utmost respect for you as a father and role model in business. I am sorry that people have been saying insensitive things about you lately. The truth is, they don’t understand that I will always forgive you for thinking the way you do, because I know you think you are acting in my best interests. And we both don’t care if anybody else understands. As your daughter, I would want nothing more than to make you happy. But in terms of relationships, your expectations of me and the reality of who I am, are not coherent. I am responsible for some of this misplaced expectation, because I must have misled you to hope there were other options for me. You know I’ve had male lovers in the past, and I’ve had happy, albeit short-lived, relationships. I found myself temporarily happy, buoyed by the freshness, the attention, the interest, of someone physically stronger than myself. But it was always short-lived, as I quickly lost patience, and felt an indescribable discomfort in their presence. It usually made me frustrated, and I would yearn for my freedom again. I’ve broken a few hearts, hearts of good, honest and loving men, and I’m sorry that it had to be so. But with Sean, a woman, somehow it was different. I am comfortable and satisfied with my life and completely at ease with her. I know it’s difficult for you to understand how I could feel romantically attracted to a woman; I suppose I can’t really explain it either. It just happens, peacefully and gently, and after so many years, we still love each other very much. My regret is that you have no idea how happy I am with my life, and there are aspects of my life that you don’t share. I suppose we don’t need each other’s approval for our romantic relationships, and I am sure your relationships are really fantastic too. However, I do love my partner Sean, who does a good job of looking after me, ensuring I am fed, bathed and warm enough every day, and generally cheering me up to be a happy, jolly girl. She is a large part of my life, and I am a better person because of her. Now, I’m not asking you to be best of friends; however, it would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her, and treat her like a normal, dignified human being.I understand it is difficult for you to understand, let alone accept this truth. I’ve spent a lot of time figuring out who I am, what is important in my life, who I love and how best to live life, as an expression of all these questions. I am proud of my life, and I would not choose to live it any other way (except also figuring out how to be gentler on the planet). I’m sorry to mislead you to think I was only in a lesbian relationship because there was a shortage of good, suitable men in Hong Kong. There are plenty of good men, they are just not for me. Wishing you happiness. Patiently yours, . Your daughter, Gigi.","Property magnate Cecil Chao offered a HKD$1bn 'dowry' for daughter .

"When Jonathan Kokontis, 25, and his girlfriend were arrested, he told her in the back of the patrol car that he would be going to jail for a long time. Melissa Schneider, 27, started crying at the thought, so he knew there was only one, desperate option - an escape. A bizarre 30-minute video released by the sheriff's department in Seminole County, Florida, shows how the pair then tried to figure out the best ways to get out of the vehicle. Kokontis, who was picked up by officers after breaking into a home armed with a pickaxe, first told his girlfriend to try and reach through the bars and open the door. He then got her to take off an ear ring which he then used in a failed attempt to unlock his handcuffs. Scroll down for video . Caught: Jonathan Kokontis, 25, told his girlfriend Melissa Schneider, 27 that he would be going to prison for a long time minutes after they were arrested and put in a patrol car in Seminole County, Florida . Emotional: She leans her head into his chest and starts to cry, prompting Kokontis to consider the best way to get out of the car . Their efforts that were shown on WESH are however thwarted by the deputy, who asks Kokontis why he has the ear ring, to which Schneider replies: 'It fell off when he was hugging me.' The officer then tells Kokontis to put his hands in front of him. But the felon conjured up one more plan to flee, and asked the deputy to loosen his cuffs. Kokontis then got up from his chair and pushed passed him, leaving the officers running after him. However it only took minutes for the cops to track him down and put him back in the vehicle. He was snared by cops after he allegedly broke into a home armed with a pickaxe. He was then brought down by a K-9 unit. Schneider was arrested for drug possession and aiding a felon and drug possession. Minutes after being put in the car, Kokontis tell his girlfriend: 'They say it's going to be a burglary of an occupied dwelling' implying that he is likely to receive a long sentence. Escape bid: His first idea is for her to try and reach through the bars in the window and open the door lever. But she says she can't do it . Plan B: Kokontis then takes his girlfriend's earring and tries - and fails - to pick the lock on his handcuffs. To hid the jewelry he puts it in his mouth, but then spits it back out . Thwarted: The deputy then opens the door and asks about the earring. He believes Schneider's excuse . She then leans her head on his chest and starts to cry, screaming: 'Oh my baby.' He then asks her: 'If you can reach your hand through one of those bars you can grab the outside lever and you can open the door. Let me see how far your hands slide up.' Twisting and turning in her seat, Schneider tells him she can't. However Kokontis manages to get his arms under his feet and in front of him. He then takes her earring and tries to pick the lock, but fails, so he puts it in his mouth in order to hide it. The deputy then opens the door and asks the pair about the earring. He believes Schneider's excuse. Kokontis then shuffles to the door of the car and holds out his hands, asking the deputy to loosen his handcuffs. Then, in a final bid for freedom, he pushes past the officer and runs away. He was picked up a short time later and put back into the car. Desperation: Kokontis then leans out of the door and asks the officer to loosen his cuffs after all other attempts have failed .

"A seaside town has been crowned one of the country's prettiest resorts thanks to a dying banker who left it £2.3 million in his will - to be spent on a million flowers. Canadian Keith Owen, 69, made his fortune in the financial industry and travelled the world but always returned to his favourite place - Sidmouth in Devon. Mr Owen was born nearby and spent most of holidays in the coastal town admiring its beach, blooms and Regency architecture. Sidmouth has been named one of Britain's prettiest towns - thanks to a generous donation by a fan of the town . Keith Owen left £2.3m in his will to ensure Sidmouth remained 'beautiful', with some of the flowers planted at right . But when Owen was told he was suffering lung cancer and had just eight weeks to live he left the parish his retirement fund, pension and a string of properties. Owen's massive £2.3m estate - £1,5m in cash and £800,000 from properties - was handed over with a stipulation it had to be spent on keeping Sidmouth 'beautiful'. Before he died he also told officials some of the money should be spent on planting one million flower bulbs in the town. Owen, who was divorced with no children, left all the money to the Sid Vale Association (SVA), Britain's oldest civic society. The group decided to honour one of Owen's specific suggestions in August last year by planting the first few hundred thousand bulbs in verges, gardens, lawns and flowerbeds. The daffodils, snowdrops and crocuses have since erupted into an explosion of colourful blooms, helping Sidmouth claim the prestigious Silver Gilt at the finals of the 50th Britain in Bloom. Sidmouth received the Silver Gilt award at the Britain in Bloom awards . The first few hundred thousand flowers have been planted, with the total to go up to a million . Mr Owen was born not far from Sidmouth, and although living in Canada, he enjoyed visiting the town . Sidmouth missed out on the top award in Britain in Bloom to St Peter Port, Guernsey (botanical gardens pictured) Judges from the Royal Horticultural Society praised the resort for mobilising hundreds volunteers to plant more than 150,000 flowers in Owen's name. Sidmouth in Bloom chairman Lynette Talbot was disappointed the town missed out on gold to St Peter Port in Guernsey but thrilled to claim silver for the first time ever. She said: 'We have naturally have loved to win but knew our opponents were two gorgeous towns. We thank Sidmouth for its fantastic support.' Owen was born in Totnes in Devon and became an RAF pilot, leaving the service in 1976 to start a new life and career in finance in Canada. He moved to Ottawa and became a Canadian citizen but returned for regular visits to Sidmouth where his mother had retired. After her death he regularly stayed in her small flat and described Sidmouth as the picture perfect English resort. Canadian Keith Owen left the money to the Sid Vale Association (SVA), Britain's oldest civic society, to preserve Sidmouth . Connaught Gardens and The Clock Tower in Sidmouth are a real thing of beauty . Sidmouth missed out on the gold award to St Peter Port in Guernsey at the Britain in Bloom awards . Canadian Keith Owen described Sidmouth as the picture perfect English resort . The remaining 850,000 bulbs will be planted in waves, as Sidmouth strives to maintain its beauty . But on one trip in October 2007 he was told he had cancer and Owen, a member of the Rotary Club and supporter of the Sid Vale Association, urgently gathered together civic leaders to discuss the massive gift before changing his will. His will stated that the capital should remain untouched but each year the estimated £120,000 interest should be spent on schemes to spruce up Sidmouth and the neighbouring villages of Sidford and Sidbury. The remaining 850,000 bulbs will be planted in waves, with the next scheduled dig on November 1.","The seaside town in Devon received Silver Gilt at Britain in Bloom .

"One year ago, Pamela Doyle was busy preparing for her fairytale big day, which would be held in a stunning Scottish castle. But with just weeks to go before her wedding, she was dumped by her fiance and lost her £2,000 deposit - all because of her weight. At size 24, Pamela, 31, tipped the scales at a massive 17 stone. But the Glaswegian call centre worker has had the last laugh. Not only has she lost seven stone and slimmed to a size 12, her ex has been left 'stunned' by her dramatically changed appearance. Svelte: Pamela, 31, has lost seven stone in just one year and now tips the scales at 10 stone . Toned: Slimline Pamela lost the weight by hitting the gym with a personal trainer and cutting out unhealthy food . 'He ended the relationship because of my weight and the issues surrounding it,' said Pamela of her former lover  - a serving soldier who she does not want to name.  It was making him miserable.' Devastated by the split, Pamela finally decided to do something about her dreadful diet, which included lashings of curry, . burgers and crisps plus two litres of Irn-Bru a day. 'I was devastated but it was just the thing I needed to spur me on to lose weight,' she says. 'When I was 17 stone I had no confidence and I was very unhappy. 'I used to hide away and I wouldn't go out. I even did my shopping online because I couldn't face people. 'Now I feel amazing. I have regained my confidence and I don't think my ex could quite believe his eyes when he saw me.' Unhealthy: Pamela's former diet used to include huge portions of curry, burgers and lashings of  crisps . Pamela and her boyfriend first became a couple when they were 17, when she was a size 14. She explained: 'I steadily put on weight throughout my teens and my twenties and things got gradually worse. 'On a typical day I would have macaroni cheese and chips for lunch, snack on crisps and chocolate, then have curry followed by ice cream for tea [supper]. 'I was comfort eating because my boyfriend was in the forces and he was often away for long periods. 'I would eat large Big Mac meals and drink two litres of Irn-Bru a day. My weight made me feel very depressed. 'I was moody and when my boyfriend came back I would hide myself away and not come out of the bedroom. 'He kept on at me about eating healthily and he tried to help me but I was difficult to be with. 'He proposed to me in 2009. I was still about 17 stone then and I made token efforts to control my weight. I'd go to one or two classes, lose a couple of stone and then give up.' The couple were due to wed last August at Airth Castle in Sterlingshire, Scotland. Shock: Pamela says that being dumped at the altar proved to be the wake-up call she needed . Fizz fighting: One of the easier parts of Pamela's new eating regime was cutting out the Irn Bru . Pamela said: 'We'd put deposits down on the venue, the band and even a piper. But last March he came to me and said he wanted to end the relationship. I have to admit I was difficult to be with and I don't blame him. 'I was absolutely devastated but it was the spur I needed to finally do something about my weight problem.' Pamela contacted personal trainer David Wilson of Rapid-Hypno Fitness, who uses a combination of hypnosis, psychology and gym training. David said: 'We did hypnosis to work on her mental attitude because when she came to me she was very emotional and had a lot of negative thoughts. 'We worked on that before making a start on the physical side. She has been doing interval training - 30-minute sessions five or six times a week. It involves cardio-vascular exercise - bikework and treadmill training. 'Pamela really is an inspirational example of what can be achieved. A lot of people come to me wanting to lose a lot of weight and they don't think it's possible. 'But Pamela has shown that with hard work, determination and a change of mindset from negative to positive, you can achieve great things.' Pamela, who now weighs just under 10 and a half stone, is still in touch with her ex-boyfriend and said she has not ruled out a reconciliation.","Glaswegian Pamela Doyle dropped from a size 24 to a size 12 .

"Firefighters worked to protect hogs in one building as a fire burned through another, killing over 4,000 baby pigs at a North Carolina farm. Emergency responders arrived at 700-acre Deerfield Farms in Eagle Springs around 11 p.m. Wednesday to find the nursery already in flames. Aberdeen Times reports that 10 emergency teams were on the scene working to put out the blaze as well as keep it from spreading to other structures or setting nearby propane tanks on fire. Factory: The USDA categorizes farm structures with more than 1,000 animals as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs (file photo) Water needed to be shuttled onto the farm  down the mile of dirt road where the farm is located because there was no sufficient water source on the farm itself. Though fire officials said the fire was eventually controlled, about 4,200 pigs housed in the nursery were killed. The pigs ranged from 14 to 45 pounds.The animals are not considered hogs until they reach about 120 pounds and are ready to be butchered at about 220 pounds. 'It smelled bad,' said Eagle Springs Fire Department Chief Marshall Nall. 'It didn't smell like what you're going to eat at a restaurant.' 'When you have animals confined indoors they're not able to escape from problems like this,' said Gene Baur, president of Farm Sanctuary, a non-profit that opposes factory farming. The USDA categorizes facilities that house more than 1,000 animals for more than 45 days in a year to be a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation, or CAFO. According to officials, the pigs were valued at $400,000 and the structure was $600,000. Officials are still investigating the cause of the fire.","The nursery at Deerfield Farms was already in flames when firefighters arrived at 11 p.m. to start putting out the fire and keep it from spreading to other buildings .

"Scott Calder led a drugs gang who tracked rivals' cars using surveillance technology before raiding cannabis farms and making off with the drugs. He was jailed for three and a half years this week . A bodybuilder nicknamed 'The Demon' has been jailed for leading a drugs gang which used tracker bugs to follow cannabis growers and raid their factories. Scott Calder, 23, and his accomplices planted surveillance devices on the cars of their rivals so they could follow then to their hideouts and steal cannabis. Police swooped on the gang after Calder and his mother were shot and wounded in a gangland hit as he was picking her up from bingo. Fearing gang warfare was about to erupt, officers stopped a car driven by one of Calder's accomplices and found evidence that nine trackers had been used during the course of an underworld 'taxing' operation against local dealers. During the various searches of the suspects' homes, officers seized tracking devices and software, a meat cleaver, a sword, machetes, drugs paraphernalia and mobile phones. Calder, from Moston, Manchester, admitted conspiracy to burgle and was jailed for three and a half years at the city's crown court this week. The thug was said to be notorious in his neighbourhood after calling himself 'The Demon' on Facebook and posting warning messages. One read: 'Stab me in the back, I'll blast ur spine.' Others said: 'In this game there's only one don' and 'Even if I died young who cares.' Last January, Calder and his 56-year old mum, Marie, were caught in a hail of bullets after being ambushed by two gunmen as she got into his car outside the Gala Bingo Hall at a shopping centre in Harpurhey, Manchester. They managed to get themselves to hospital with gunshot wounds to the arms but miraculously neither were seriously injured. Calder was known as 'The Demon' by locals  and boasted online that he did not care if he died young . He also posted pictures of himself enjoying expensive bottles of champagne and getting into a sports car . Police investigating the shooting mounted a major operation after discovering Calder and his gang were involved in a criminal plot to track known drug dealers to cannabis farms and then steal the plants and growing equipment. It emerged the gang would carry out surveillance outside a shop which sold equipment used for growing cannabis and planted GPS trackers on visitor's cars, so they could follow them without being spotted. The gang also acted on tip-offs from other criminals who knew the whereabouts of cannabis farms being grown by Vietnamese gangsters. One victim who found a tracker hidden on his vehicle was ordered to return it or 'his head would be blown off.' In one raid, the gang were chased off by a cannabis farmer who set his guard dog on them. Two days later they raided another grower and escaped with a duvet cover full of cannabis plants. In April, Calder, who had by then recovered from his gunshot wounds, was arrested after police bugged his car before stopping him and finding a combat hunting knife. Ryan Hayes (left) was jailed for two years and eight months and Paul Andrews (right) got three years and nine months for their parts in the conspiracy . Dale Hall (left) was given four years in prison and Jack Biernat (right) received a three-year sentence for their parts in the conspiracy . The following month, officers seized a silver Skoda used by the gang. When it was searched, police recovered a laptop which was forensically examined and led police to the tracking company. The gang were then rounded up one-by-one. Dale Hall, 29, Jack Biernat, 27, both of Chadderton, near Oldham and Paul Andrews, 25, and Ryan Hayes, 26, both of Moston, all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle. Hall was given four years, Biernat three years, Andrews three years and nine months and Hayes two years and eight months. Sentencing the five men, Judge Patrick Field QC said it was a 'sophisticated and well-planned scheme'. Speaking after the case, Det Con Wes Knights of Greater Manchester Police said: 'These men were involved in a criminal plot to ""tax"" cannabis farms - in other words, steal the plants from known dealers and farmers and reap the rewards for themselves. Calder - known locally as 'The Demon' - posted scores of pictures of himself online in a trademark pose . He showed off by posting pictures of himself riding a quad bike around Moston on his Facebook page . As well as boasting there was 'only one Don', he posted a photo of this expensive watch and jewellery . Detective Knights added: 'The indiscriminate nature of their tactics left innocent members of the public at risk, which is something we as a police service cannot tolerate. 'The theft of cannabis plants, known among the criminal fraternity as ""taxing"", is a very dangerous one. 'Not only does it continue to propagate the market for illegal drugs to be sold and people to suffer serious harm as a result of consuming those drugs, but it creates rivalries and bad blood between gangs that leads to other criminality. All too often, innocent people are caught up in this. 'That is why taking this gang off the streets is a fantastic result not just for us but for people who are fed-up with cannabis dealers operating in their area. 'We have effectively cut out a major supply route for cannabis getting onto our streets and also taken a dangerous group of criminals with access to weapons and tracking devices out of the game.' Police said Calder's gang's plan of 'taxing' local dealers would have created bad blood between crime groups . The investigation into his activities was sparked when Calder and his mother were shot outside Gala Bingo in Harpurhey, Manchester and police feared a gang war was about to break out . Calder admitted conspiracy to burgle after police moved in on his gang to prevent further carnage .","Five-man gang fitted tracker bugs to cars of suspected dealers, court heard .

"The mother charged with poisoning her  son to death with a massive dose of salt is now telling investigators the 5-year-old may be to blame and she had nothing to do with it. Lacey Spears, 26, told Westchester County authorities the boy 'would once in a while play with his feeding tube and could have put something in it.' Documents filed Friday reveal that police now believe Spears not only poisoned her son's feeding tube with salt, but did so over the course of several days, reports the Westchester Journal News. Sick: The youngster (pictured in hospital with his mother, Lacey Spears, just days before his death), was diagnosed with hypernatremia - a condition that sees high salt levels in the blood - prior to his first birthday . Police also appear to believe, according to these newly filed documents, that Spears poisoned her son while he was being treated at Valhalla Medical Center. Police who interview Spears just before her son died said she 'looked visibly distraught but showed no sign of tears.' I was previously revealed that Garnett was treated for high levels of sodium as a baby, but no seemed to point the finger at Spears. Garnett Spears, from Chestnut Ridge, New York, was diagnosed with hypernatremia - a condition that sees elevated salt levels in the blood - prior to his first birthday, according to an official  report. But despite his condition, staff at an Alabama hospital apparently failed to report it as possible abuse to the authorities. Tragic: Garnett Spears, five, who was allegedly poisoned to death with salt by his mother, was treated for high levels of sodium as a baby, it has emerged. Above, Garnett shortly before his death (right) and as a baby (left) Garnett died on January 23 this year in Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla after his sodium levels rose to an extremely dangerous level with no medical explanation. His mother Lacey Spears, 26, who documented her son's persistent illnesses online, has been charged with killing him by administering salt through a feeding tube in his stomach. The newly-released fatality report, obtained from New York State officials by The Journal News, reveals that staff expressed concern for Spears's 'emotional stability' when Garnett was a baby. The mother, who is nicknamed the 'mommy blogger', was believed to suffer from Postpartum Depression and Manchausen Syndrome by Proxy. Case: Despite Garnett's condition, staff at an Alabama hospital apparently failed to report it as possible abuse to the authorities. Above, Spears, 26, has been charged with killing Garnett by administering salt via a tube . Denial: The mother, who is nicknamed the 'mommy blogger', pleaded not guilty in June to charges of depraved murder and first-degree manslaughter. Above, she is pictured during her latest court appearance . The condition is a psychiatric disorder which makes a parent purposely hurt their child for attention. When Garnett was only five weeks old, Spears 'verbalized she wanted to harm him', the report said. Around a month later, she was referred to medical social services for 'interpersonal conflict, stress and dysfunction'. The document does not state what the outcome of the referral was. Barry Spear, a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Human Resources, said he had no record of hypernatremia being reported to the authorities when Garnett was a baby. Mother and son: Garnett (pictured with his mother) died on January 23 this year in Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla after his sodium levels rose to an extremely dangerous level with no medical explanation . Charged: Spears, who shared her son's hospital room, documented his persistent illness in detail online . Spears, who shared her son's hospital room after he was brought in suffering from vomiting and seizures, pleaded not guilty in June to charges of depraved murder and first-degree manslaughter. Depraved murder is a count often used in cases that suggest extreme recklessness rather than intentional killing. It carries the same maximum sentence, however - 25 years to life. Spears, who fled to Kentucky following Garnett's death, is being held without bail at Westchester County jail, where she has been placed on suicide watch. Findings: When Garnett was only five weeks old, Spears 'verbalized she wanted to harm him', the report said . Earlier this month, her lawyers filed motions seeking to have her previous medical records, including her suspected Manchasuen, removed from the trial. The judge is expected to rule on those motions at the next hearing on October 15. Munchausen by Proxy, is a psychiatric disorder which makes a parent purposely hurt their child - to get attention. 'It is so counter-intuitive to all our ideas of what parenthood is supposed to be,' said Dr. Marc D. Feldman who has written extensively about Munchausen syndrome. 'But medical child abuse can and does occur.' Feldmen told USA Today that this case has at least four distinct red-flags for him that indicate the possibility of abuse. 1) Garnett had a feeding tube for unknown reasons. In case of Munchausen by proxy the child will be sick enough to have a feeding tube or intravenous line that gives the abuser access to the body internally.'That's an avenue for medical chaos,' Feldman said.

"A devoted couple celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary have revealed the secret to their long and happy marriage - regular arguments. Robert and Betty Timms, 91 and 92 respectively, from Swindon, believe a good row helps clear the air and say they never 'run away' from their disagreements. Clearly, the tactic has paid off as the couple have now reached their platinum wedding anniversary. Bob and Betty Timms married on October 14, 1944, at St Mark's Church in Swindon before a reception at the nearby Cross Keys Hotel . Bob's advice (pictured above with wife of 70 years, Betty): 'The most important thing is to talk to each other.

"It has been revealed over the past two days that Canadian gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was a career criminal and drug addict, but it seems that was not the case just a few short years ago. In his high school yearbook photo from 2000, taken while he was a senior at Ecole Secondaire Saint Maxime in Laval, Quebec, the teenager is seen smiling and happy. In fact, it seems he was both personable and popular judging but what his fellow students said about the young man. Scroll down for video .

Schhol: These comments were made when Zehaf-Bibeau was a senior at Ecole Secondaire Saint Maxime (above) in Laval, Quebec . 'Mike is a sociable and intelligent guy,' wrote on his friends in the yearbook, obtained by the National Post. 'He loves to laugh, and his smile wins over the girls.' They then added, 'He will go far in life.' Zehaf-Bibeau did not go far however, and shortly after graduating was arrested for the first time, convicted of possessing a false credit card and impaired driving at the age of 19 in 2001. From there, numerous drug arrests followed, as well as ones for robbery and a weapons charge. Soon he was homeless, living in shelters, and he eventually converted to Islam. Not far: A little over 10 years after he was described as smiling and personable, Zehaf-Bibeau killed a man and opened fire on Parliament . Even then, with the religion's strict stance on drugs, he would continue to fall back into his addictions, so bad that in 2011 he actually begged a judge to put him in jail so he could kick crack and become clean. Soon, his mosque even asked him to leave, after he began sleeping there without permission. Then, on Wednesday, the 32-year-old killed a young solider, Corporal Nathan Cirillo, as he stood guard at the National War Memorial, before opening fire on Parliament. He injured three more before he was eventually shot dead.","Michael Zehaf-Bibeau seems like a much different man based on quotes from his friends in his high school yearbook .

"Jailed: John Fesler Lane II has served 20 years for spats over his former home - and 10 days ago he ended up back in jail for threatening its owners . A couple held a 73-year-old man at gunpoint after he allegedly threatened to 'take back' their ranch, which he had lost during a 1979 divorce. Police arrived at the home in Florence, Montana on September 15 to find the couple, Lucinda and Lee Hayne, focusing their guns on John Fesler Lance II as he knelt outside the house. Lance, who previously served 20 years in prison over previous spats over the property, pleaded not guilty to felony intimidation and violating a protective order in Hamilton on Wednesday. He remains in jail with a bail set at $200,000. His court appearance comes just months after he was released in March following more than 20 years in prison for intimidating judges, attorneys and others involved in the divorce case. Then in April until July, he was back in prison for violating a protective order the Haynes had filed. Lance lost his Florence-area ranch in a default judgment for failing to answer his wife's petition seeking a divorce, County Attorney Bill Fulbright said. Fulbright said Lance was convicted of threatening the judge who made the ruling, an attorney who prosecuted and others he perceived as being involved in his loss of the ranch. He served more than 20 years in the state prison so he could be released without being on parole, - but the day after his release, he was spotted loitering outside Lucinda Hayne's workplace. He was arrested and sat in jail until his July trial where he was convicted of violating a permanent restraining order and sentenced to time served, Fulbright said. Over the past several months, the Haynes or their attorney received correspondence from Lance threatening to use any force necessary to 'take the ranch back,' including kidnapping the Haynes and holding them for ransom, court records said. Property: He lost the ranch (left) in 1979 when he failed to answer his wife's petition seeking a divorce . Earlier this month, the Montana Supreme Court rejected Lance's attempt to overturn a permanent order of protection the Haynes were granted against him. On September 15, Lance called attorney William Jones from Missoula, distraught, and said he was going back to his ranch. Jones contacted authorities. Lucinda Haynes told officers that she was outside tending to her horses when she saw Lance's scooter driving towards the house. She went inside and retrieved her pistol. When she went outside, she asked him who he was and he responded: 'This is John Lance', the Missoulian reported. She pointed her gun at him and ordered him to get to his knees, and when her husband heard a commotion, he joined his wife and pointed his own gun at her. The Haynes said that while they waited for deputies to arrive, Lance rambled on about the ranch, told them they were trespassing and he had the right to use force to evict them. The couple told officers they were forced to drastically change their lives after Lance was released from prison, including always having someone stay on the property and not having visitors, charging documents said. The county attorney's office has filed for persistent felony status in the case, which means, if convicted, Lance could receive a minimum prison sentence of five to 100 years.","John Fesler Lance II went to his former Montana home and threatened to take it back - but the owners pulled their guns on him and waited for cops .

"A young British volunteer has died in South East Asia – just days after revealing he had caught a life-threatening tropical disease. Richard Cann, 24, had been working with the Orangutan Health Project on the western Indonesian island of Sumatra. Ten days ago he wrote on Facebook that he had caught dengue fever, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. Scroll down for video . Richard Cann, 24, was working at the Orangutan Health Project on Sumatra, Indonesia, when he fell ill . He posted a message saying: ‘Had dengue fever last week. Slept solidly for four to five days, now feeling on the mend.’ He also revealed he had been ‘sitting in 45C heat with no doctors and no air con, hot water for the joints and a cat for cuddles’. He added: ‘Should be fine next week. I’m made of tougher stuff.’ However the university graduate, from Winchester, collapsed and died following a seizure on Monday. It is still unclear whether his death was linked to his fever. His parents, Kate and Chris, have flown out to the island. Dengue is a common viral infection spread by mosquitoes. It is common in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, with Brazil having the highest number of cases. Symptoms include: . - A high temperature that can reach up to 41ºC . - Headache . - Pain behind the eyes . - Bone, muscle and joint pain . An infected human is bitten by the mosquito, the infected mosquito then bites another human and the cycle continues. The condition is widespread in areas with a high mosquito populations. Dengue usually clears up by itself within two to three weeks. There are no specific medications to treat the disease but symptoms can be managed using paracetamol. A number of people will go on to suffer a more serious form of the illness, known as 'severe dengue'. It is a potentially fatal complication which can lead to shock, bleeding and organ damage.","Richard Cann caught dengue fever while working on the island of Sumatra .

"Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus misused a key rigging component in a hair-hanging stunt, causing a fall that seriously injured eight acrobats, federal workplace safety regulators said Tuesday. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited the company for a serious safety violation and proposed the maximum fine, $7,000, for the circus' parent company, Feld Entertainment. It concluded circus staff had improperly loaded a carabiner clip. The company disputed the finding and was deciding whether to contest it, said Stephen Payne, a spokesman for Feld Entertainment. Dangerous act: Performers seen hanging during an aerial hair-hanging stunt at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus on Friday, May 2 in Providence, R.I. - days before it went wrong . OSHA investigators said the company attached two rings to the bottom of the carabiner, rather than one, in violation of what it said was industry practice and of the manufacturer's instructions. Investigators said that caused the clip to be overloaded. Payne disputed that, saying the clip was carrying a lower load than it was rated to hold. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health, called it a 'catastrophic failure,' and said it demonstrates the circus industry needs professional engineers to develop, evaluate and inspect the structures it uses in performances. 'We can never put a price on the impact this event had on these workers and their families. Employers must take steps to ensure this does not happen again,' he said. Caught on camera: Smart phone footage captured by a member of the audience shows a platform - from which a number of performers were suspended by their hair - crashing to the ground . Emergency: Eleven people were admitted to hospital after the platform collapsed in front of crowds . Payne said safety of its workers and audience are the company's top priority, and it is making the necessary changes. The eight acrobats were attached by their hair to a chandelier-like apparatus and suspended in the air. They had just begun their act on May 4 when the carabiner clip snapped, sending them plummeting to the ground 15 feet below. A ninth worker on the ground was hit and was also hurt. Most of the women were severely injured. Some were unable to walk as of June, and they have collectively gone through dozens of surgeries. Critically injured: Circus acrobats Julissa Segrera, second from right, of the United States, and Dayana Costa, right, of Brazil, were two of the performers involved in the accident . Several of the women hired a lawyer and at that time said they were planning to sue the company. The lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment on Tuesday. One of the women, Samantha Pitard, has returned to the circus, but the others have not and are being covered by workers' compensation insurance, Payne said. The hair-hanging act has not returned to the circus. Payne said they haven't decided when it will return or what it will look like.","An acrobatic stunt went horribly wrong on May 4 during a performance by the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Rhode Island .

"When looking for advice on how to add value to your home, the first place to go is right to the top. Sound opinion can be hard to come by, so Daily Mail Australia asked one of the leading experts in the industry for an insight into the often murky waters of property improvement. Kevin McCloud, host of lauded series Grand Designs, has a vast and impressive knowledge base when it comes to exactly what makes a property stand out. Iconic Australian architectural elements include the use of a verandah, whether this is a wraparound or just on one side. 'They [verandahs] have become an instant calling card for Australia. In architecture the sun is often a conscious design element, where the sun is shaded from the inside of the building,' McCloud said. 'There's a big push in the UK for houses that are influenced by Australian architecture,' McCloud said. Kevin McCloud, host of lauded series Grand Designs, has a vast and impressive knowledge base when it comes to exactly what makes a property stand out . The British designer, writer, and housing developer is currently in Australia for the launch of Grand Designs Live Home Show, and took some time out with Daily Mail Australia to reveal his tips for adding value to your home. The event is the ultimate home show for those who are looking for ideas and inspiration for all areas of your home, whether the focus is small spaces or complete overhauls, something McCloud has seen up close for over 25 years. McCloud, a giant in the world of architecture and design, said that Australia offered a veritable array of climates and environments, making it a unique and exciting country to build in. 'I think first of all, that Australia is such a varied place to be,' said the designer. 'It's not one climate and one place. From the country to the city, from Queensland to Tasmania, there is so much difference.' 'Some will have a much cooler climate and have sea breezes, and then another will have mountain temperatures. This means that the architecture is so radically different depending on where it is.' The property in Balmoral, Queensland, makes use of the shade element of Australian architecture the country's design is well known for . Shade house in Byron Bay: 'It's not one climate and one place.

'Some will have a much cooler climate and have sea breezes, and then another will have mountain temperatures. This means that the architecture is so radically different depending on where it is.' McCloud said he is envious of Peter Maddison, the host of Grand Designs Australia, because of the amazing landscape and unique elements that the country has to offer for potential designs. 'It's hard to identify one style of design in Australia. There isn't one quality I could pinpoint, and there are such wonderful quirks to the country.' 'Travelling around cities like Sydney and Melbourne I was very struck by how the conventional typography was so different.' McCloud identified elements such as deep masonry and overhanging verandahs as quite iconic Australian design elements. 'They have become an instant calling card for Australia. In architecture the sun is often a conscious design element, where the sun is shaded from the inside of the building.' 'This extends to contemporary 1960's and modern architecture. There's a big push in the UK for houses that are influenced by Australian architecture,' McCloud said. An art deco property in Caulfield, Victoria. The designer said that architectural movements such as art deco are experiencing a resurgence in Australia, and was a 'badge of Australian' architecture, as well as appearing in pockets all over the world such as Miami, Prague, Portugal and South American and South Asian countries. 'It's such a rare and beautiful and odd thing,' McCloud said of the art deco movement, which influence the architecture of this Sandringham property in Victoria . 'The UK didn't get to expand on [art deco] in the same way as Australia- and in New Zealand there are whole towns modeled on the style. It's got a really strong foothold in this part of the world,' said McCloud . 'I have a lot of people saying, 'Oh I want my house to look like this house from Australia,' and there's a real fascination with tiny shacks, and corrugated iron sheds. Transient materials from which so much of Australian architecture is made from historically.' McCloud said that British-born Australian architect Glenn Murcutt, who has won international awards for his designs, drew heavily upon these influences. The designer said that architectural movements such as art deco are experiencing a resurgence in Australia, and was a 'badge of Australian' architecture, as well as appearing in pockets all over the world such as Miami, Prague, Portugal and South American and South Asian countries. 'It's such a rare and beautiful and odd thing,' McCloud said. 'It's a style of architecture that Australia can certainly claim to have taken to heart and made their own,' 'Art deco in the UK was born into such a dismal and dim time, in the recession period after the great war.' 'The UK didn't get to expand on the style in the same way as Australia- and in New Zealand there are whole towns modeled on the style. It's got a really strong foothold in this part of the world.' Zero carbon houses, like this propery in Campbelltown, Adelaide, are the future of Australian design, said McCloud. Sustainability is going to be a strong focus in design in the next decade, said the designer. A 'shed house' on the Sunshine Coast: 'I have a lot of people saying, 'Oh I want my house to look like this house from Australia,' and there's a real fascination with tiny shacks, and corrugated iron sheds. Transient materials from which so much of Australian architecture is made from historically,' said McCloud. The future of Australian architecture is going in a vibrant and dynamic direction, according to McCloud. 'As a visitor in this country it can be hard for me to put my finger on the pulse of design, but more increasingly the direction of the 'shed design' is cropping up. There are great experiments of modernism from the 60's enjoying a revival in the hands of much younger architects.' Sustainability is going to be a strong focus in design in the next decade, said the designer. 'We you start to design in a country like this, because sustainability naturally focuses on using the local environment to cool and draw energy from, you are going to get a much wider variety of designs being created because of the different climates.' And what are the key ways to improve the value of your house? McCloud identified five steps for prospective property sellers to ensure you make the most of your property. 'The first is to employ good people- from designers to architects, from builders, project managers, and carpenters. Whatever the scale of your project, employ people who see the world the way you do,' he said. 'Secondly, don't get too hung up on price, but do pay attention to personal recommendations. Get friends or people you know to tell you who is worth hiring, and use local people.' 'Next, spend money on the bones of the building. Focus on the structure, the airtightness, the quality. You can always revisit the plumbing or kitchen, and most people do, but to revisit the structure is very tricky.' 'Spend money on things you touch. We live in a very visual world, and we forget that we really judge the quality of things through our fingers. It's like dining in a fine restaurant, you want it to be a pleasure. Focus on door handles, switches, tiles. Make sure they are durable, a pleasure to use and move.' 'Lastly, whatever you do, do with conviction.' With these timeless gems of advice, McCloud said, adding value to your house is much simpler. For more advice, the Grand Designs Live Home Show has design and styling options for all projects, and is running at the Sydney Exhibition Centre from the 24th - 26th October. McCloud said that British-born Australian architect Glenn Murcutt, who has won international awards for his designs, such as the above property, drew heavily upon these influences. 'Whatever you do, do with conviction,' said McCloud.","Verandahs, art deco architecture, shade houses and 'shed' inspired designs are all iconic design elements .

"Australian first home buyers are getting older as skyrocketing house prices and dwindling government grants force them to save longer and cut back harder on other things so they can pull together a deposit. A new report by realestateVIEW.com.au shows the largest group of first home buyers is now people in their thirties or forties. And just one in ten first home buyers are younger than 30, the report says . The main reasons include rising house prices and a lack of government grants, according to the report. People are also forgoing big ticket items like cars and are happy to cut back on buying clothes, computers and going away on holidays to help save a deposit. The age of first home buyers in Australia is stretching with most people now in their thirties or forties before they purchase a property, according to a new report . 'When we think of first time buyers we think of singles or couples in their twenties, but the reality is the road to achieving home ownership is longer and harder than it once was,' General Manager of realestateVIEW.com.au, Petra Sprekos, told Daily Mail Australia. 'More people want to save 20 percent deposit and pay more than their mortgage repayments require, so they are spending at least three to five years saving for a deposit. 'People view buying property as biggest achievement so they’re cutting other expenditure to support dream.' The First Home Buyer Report is based on a national survey of more than 1,000 Australian first home buyers, first home owners and non-buyers. The First Home Buyer Report is based on a national survey of more than 1,000 Australian first home buyers, first home owners and non-buyers . Half of first home buyers and more than 60 per cent of first home owners have children - an indication Australians are taking longer to enter the market . Over a third of those surveyed haven't bought a property yet because they think house prices are too high. 'Over the last 12 months in particular we've seen house prices rise and it's putting pressure on people's abilities to fund mortgage repayments,' Ms Sprekos said. 'Demographic changes are also behind it. We used to see people buy a house and then have kids, but it's actually happening the other way now. It's just taking people a little bit long for people to buy now. People are also forgoing big ticket items like cars and are cutting back on clothes, computers and holidays to help save a deposit . Over a third of those surveyed haven't bought a property yet because they think house prices are too high . Half of first home buyers and more than 60 per cent of first home owners have children, the report found. Ms Sprekos says the government is to blame for challenges facing first time buyers. 'The reduction in first home buyer concessions is a big challenge. We saw a real stimulation in the market when the federal government brought in the grants,' she said. The report found only one in four people surveyed just didn't want to get into the market at all . 'There's no incentive there now... and the government needs to start looking after the next generation of buyers. Age has progressively increased so some intervention is required.These trends are going up and affordability is becoming an issue.' The report found only one in four people surveyed just didn't want to get into the market at all. 'They're shunning the market. 75 percent of those people believe they can't afford those mortgage repayments and 25 percent say they just want to spend their money in other ways.'","Just one in 10 first home buyers are under 30, a new report has found .

"A migration agent who has been banned for five years after he allegedly groomed a client to act gay so that he had more chance of getting an Australian visa has vowed to clear his name. Sydney based lawyer Issam Sam Issa is reported to have taken a wannabe migrant to Oxford Street and Kings Cross, areas of the city popular with the gay community, and advised him to tell a tribunal that he was homosexual. However, Mr Issa told Daily Mail Australia he is launching an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the Migration Agents Registration Authority's ruling. ‘I obviously deny that allegation,’ Mr Issa said, highlighting that he believes the whole story has not been told. His solicitor Adrian Joel added: ‘We are preparing an appeal urgently. We are beyond appalled by the nature of the allegations that have been presented, they are gravely defamatory.’ A migration agent has been banned from practising from five years after he allegedly took a wannabe migrant to Oxford Street (pictured) and Kings Cross and advised him to tell a tribunal that he was homosexual . In a court appearance, involving a man who wanted to live in Australia named Mr E, it was alleged that Mr Issa ‘advised and assisted him to apply for a protection visa based on fabricated claims of being homosexual’. To support the claims for his visa application, Mr E claimed that Mr Issa took him to Oxford Street and Kings Cross. The client was interviewed by the Migration Agents Registration Authority on 17 December 2012. However, Mr Issa stated that Mr E’s complaint was motivated by personal gain. In another tribunal involving a man named as Mr C, it was also alleged Mr Issa advised him to apply for a protection visa based on fraudulent claims of being homosexual. In other complaints about the migration agent, protection visas were also lodged on religious grounds. Eight complaints were made against the migration agent by his clients, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the NSW Legal Services Commissioner . MARA said in total they received eight complaints about the agent’s conduct and the immigration assistance he provided to protection visa applicants between November 2011 to June 2013. These complaints were from individual clients, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the NSW Legal Services Commissioner. ‘The complaints alleged that the agent encouraged and assisted his clients to lodge applications for Protection visas with claims that were fabricated,’ a ruling on the MARA website says. In response to an official warning notice from MARA, Mr Issa said ‘there is no evidence to substantiate the allegations of fraud’. He also claimed the alleged ‘unusual similarities’ attached to the homosexual lifestyle of his visa applicants ‘do not establish any element of causation of fraud’. In some cases he called his clients ‘self-confessed liars’ and questioned the validity of their claims against him. It was alleged that Mr Issa 'advised and assisted [a client] to apply for a Protection visa based on fabricated claims of being homosexual' Mr Issa first registered as a migration agent on 9 February 1995 and records show he mainly practices in relation to Protection visas. Protection visas allow migrants to live and work in Australia as a permanent resident but to qualify for them you must be a refugee as defined by the Refugees Convention. Or you may also meet the Complementary Protection criteria in the Australian Migration Act 1958. In some countries being gay is a crime and thus homosexuals can be granted refugee status in Australia if they face persecution in their home countries. For example, in Uganda this year the president approved a new law that imposes life sentences for homosexuality; he also made it a crime to fail to report someone for breaking the new law. Protection visas lodged inside Australia cost $35 and are far cheaper than other visas, such as a Skilled Migration Visa which starts at $3250. To be granted a Protection visa you need to be either a refugee as defined by the Refugees Convention: . Refugees Convention: . The term ‘refugee’ is defined  as a person who owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. Or you must meet the Complementary Protection criteria in the Australian Migration Act 1958: . Circumstances where there are substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of a non-citizen’s removal from Australia to a receiving country, there is a real risk the non-citizen will suffer significant harm. The MARA investigated a sample of Mr Issa’s client, departmental and tribunal files – a total of 73 files - and found ‘a pattern of poor practices which breached the Code of Conduct’. ‘The Office of the MARA found that the agent prepared and submitted applications containing generalised information not supported by instructions from his clients; he included misleading and inaccurate statements to enhance the prospects of success of the visa applications; and failed to provide frank and candid advice to his clients about the prospects of success of their visa applications. ‘As a result of the investigation the Office of the MARA was satisfied that the agent had breached multiple provisions of the Code of Conduct and was not a person of integrity, and not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance,’ the ruling states.","Sydney based lawyer Issam Sam Issa has been banned from acting as a migration agent for five years .

"From the opening seconds, when Demba Ba clattered a shot into the woodwork almost directly from the kick-off, it was clear that this might be a European play-off containing a little more peril than normal for Arsenal. Aaron Ramsey’s late red card for two bookings summed up their discomfort. Besiktas, and Ba in particular, seemingly on a mission to prove Chelsea sold the wrong striker, were not about to bow down and shower Arsene Wenger and his team with rose petals as they waved them into the group stages of the Champions League for the 17th successive year. Slaven Bilic had them revved up and Wenger’s team performed, as they did against Crystal Palace on Saturday, with spirit and resistance but little fluency.

When they did pierce the Turks, they were not clinical in front of goal. Olivier Giroud was more wasteful than most. After an hour of pressure, Alexis Sanchez sprinted down the right and cut the ball on to his foot but the centre forward miscued. Moments later, when Sanchez found Giroud, and accelerated into the penalty area he looked up to find possession had again been surrendered. There would be no precious away goal and captain Mikel Arteta hobbled off early in the second half, but Arsenal should be relieved to head back to London with the tie level, knowing they could be stronger at the Emirates next week. In recent years, Arsenal have turned this hurdle into something of a formality. Regularly, they have been drawn in an awkward-looking tie but each time they have breezed through, be it against Fenerbahce, Celtic, Udinese or whoever. Not only have they advanced to the group stages, but they have actually won all 12 legs of their previous six play-off ties. So, perhaps avoiding complacency was Wenger’s biggest challenge as he prepared for a return to Istanbul, where his team have scored eight goals on their last two visits, both against Fenerbahce. His team were certainly slow off the mark, although they were jolted into life when Ba went for goal from the kick-off and almost caught Wojciech Szczesny out. The audacious effort bounced on to the bar, after the slightest of touches from the goalkeeper. It was an early warning. Bilic is an aggressive manager who throws players forward and attempts to attack first. His players were far more smoothly into their rhythm than the Londoners, on a pitch which was heavily watered but not as slick as Arsenal are used to in the Barclays Premier League. Nine minutes later, Ba, who scored a hat-trick in the last qualifying round against Feyenoord, was in again. This time, he collected a cross from former Arsenal trainee Oguzhan Ozyakup and hit the target but Szczesny sprung to his left to beat it away. Ba, who almost joined Arsenal on loan from Chelsea last summer, was highly motivated and seemingly intent on reminding English football what he does well, which is threaten the goal and make centre halves uncomfortable. It is only three months since his goal at Liverpool proved so influential in the destiny of the title. You can Like our dedicated Arsenal Facebook page here. New surroundings: Ba (right) joined Besiktas in a £4.7million deal from Chelsea this summer . Close but no cigar: Olivier Giroud nearly gave Arsenal the lead but was unable to get a clean strike when supplied by Alexis Sanchez . Frustrated figure: Giroud endured a disappointing evening for the Gunners in his first start of the season . Here he was again, reminding the Premier League they have no automatic right to four places in the Champions League proper. Wenger’s team were at full stretch and the Turkish fans turned up the volume. It must have been quite an introduction to European football for Calum Chambers. In the main, he handled his early tests with maturity belying his teenage years, but was caught out two minutes before half-time when Ba jinked past him and Nacho Monreal. The striker ought to have found the net but pulled a drive horribly off target. Szczesny also saved from Veli Kavlak in the first half and yet in between these Besiktas raids there were flickers of encouragement for Arsenal. Sanchez and Santi Cazorla were enjoying space on the wings and used it effectively. Sanchez found Giroud in front of goal but Pedro Franco smothered the danger as he tried to work an effort on goal. Cazorla dashed across goal, left to right, but dragged his shot wide and Jack Wilshere, after bouncing a pass off Giroud, was denied by Tolga Zengin as he tried to curl a left-footer around the goalkeeper.

Sour note: Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta (second left) had to be replaced due to injury in the Ataturk Stadium . Inches away: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) came inches away from giving Arsenal a late win when his left-footed strike hit the post . Whatever Arsenal did during the interval, they were unable to alter the pattern of Besiktas dominance. Arsenal lost Arteta, hurt in a midfield tangle with Ba. On came Mathieu Flamini. Besiktas remained positive and opened up another clear chance soon after the restart. This time it was Olcay Sahan who was released on the left, and cut inside on to his right foot, only to drift his shot wide of the far post. On the touchline, Bilic became more agitated, taking umbrage with Chambers for a tackle that went unpunished and then reacting angrily when Ramon Motta was booked. Referee Milorad Mazic gave him a warning. Bilic briefly retreated but was soon back on the edge of his large technical area. Perhaps what he said had the desired effect, as Ramsey, Wilshere and Monreal were soon shown yellow cards, cautions which can accumulate quickly and come back to bite in European football. That proved the case with Ramsey, ejected soon after. Serbian referee Milorad Mazic tried to calm the Croatian down. Bilic briefly retreated but was soon back on the edge of his large technical area, his antics as manic as ever. He went crazy at the fourth official when Mazic stopped play for Mathieu Flamini to receive treatment when the ball smacked him in the face and the Besiktas boss was sent to the stands in the final seconds of the game, applauded all the way by the home fans. Ramsey was dismissed 10 minutes from time for a pull on Oguzhan Ozyakup in midfield, his second such foul in the second half and the game ended with a bottle hurled at Wenger as he stalked down the tunnel. It missed. Another pitfall avoided by the Arsenal boss.","Aaron Ramsey is sent off as Arsenal endure stalemate at Turkish opponents Besiktas .

"A police chief has been forced to issue a shameful apology to the family of a father-of-two who died in a cell while officers who should have been monitoring him watched porn. Lloyd Butler, 39, was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and incapable on August 4 2010 - and died in custody three hours later after suffering a cardiac arrest. An inquest held in June heard officers should have taken him to hospital for monitoring but instead brought him to Stechford Police Station in Birmingham and dumped him in a cell. Scroll down for video . Watching porn: West Midlands Police officers were seen on CCTV viewing porn websites and Sky Sports on their computers while Mr Butler died of a cardiac arrest just feet away . And rather than keeping a watch every 15 minutes on Mr Butler, officers from West Midlands Police viewed sex websites, and watched Sky Sports on police computers. Shocking footage taken at the time showed a group of police officers laughing and swearing while Mr Butler died just feet away in a custody cell. CCTV also showed officers earlier dragging him out of a police van by his legs causing his trousers to fall down. The three members of staff involved were all allowed to keep their jobs despite being found guilty of misconduct. Vulnerable: Lloyd Butler, 39, was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and incapable and should have been taken to hospital for monitoring (pictured in the cell he died in, above) Toady Chris Sims, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, issued a an apology to Mr Butler's mother Janet and said lessons had been learnt from the tragedy. At a Strategic Police and Crime Board meeting attended by Mrs Butler, he said: 'There is nothing more important than looking after people in our custody. 'I would like to extend my personal condolences to Lloyd Butler's mother.' Sorry: Chris Sims, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police (left), has apologised for the behaviour of his officers - including PC Dean Woodcock (right) who used the internet and made phone calls while Mr Butler died . Dumped in a cell: Mr Butler (above) was 'failed miserably' by police, said his mother Janet, who has branded the officers involved an 'an absolute disgrace' Devastated: Janet Butler, centre, said if 'correct procedures were carried out her son would be alive today'. Also pictured outside today's hearing, Mr Butler's ex-partner Cheryl Alexander (L) and friend Jo Haile (R) A damning Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report found staff had 'disregarded human decency' in their treatment of Mr Butler. The chief constable told the meeting the force had since adopted 'six areas of learning' recommended in the IPCC report. These included constant observation of detainees, the availability of internet access in custody suites as well the inclusion of CPR masks. Assistant Chief Constable Gareth Cann told the meeting that the last time a drunk and incapable person had been taken into custody was in August 2012. He added that there were now 'gateway checks' in place to ensure that drunk and incapable suspects are now taken to hospital instead. Too late: The officers, pictured finally checking on Mr Butler after he had died, all kept their jobs . Police officers had earlier joked about Mr Butler's condition and made insulting remarks about him . He said 'a lot had changed' in custody since Mr Butler died, including structures of command, training of staff and both the numbers and quality of facilities. In a narrative verdict at Birmingham Coroner's Court in June, a jury decided that Mr Butler, from Tile Cross, Birmingham, died from a cardiac arrest related to underlying alcohol problems. They found that he should not have been in a cell after watching CCTV footage of officers failing to watch over their prisoner. Birmingham coroner Louise Hunt said a 'change of culture' was needed in West Midlands Police and she submitted her report to the force to prevent future deaths. Tragic: Father-of-two Lloyd Butler, 39, died in 2010 . Speaking after the inquest Mr Butler's distraught mother Janet, 64, blasted the officers - branding them 'an absolute disgrace.' She said 'They failed Lloyd, the failed him miserably. 'They failed Lloyd in their duty of care to him and I feel they assisted in his death. 'It's very clear from the evidence we've seen over the last week-and-a-half that police officers were not carrying out procedures. 'If those procedures had been carried out, my son would have been alive today. 'Their behaviour was an absolute disgrace.' A misconduct hearing in January 2013 found two officers who dealt with Mr Butler guilty of misconduct, . PC Dean Woodcock, who arrested Mr Butler, surfed the Internet and made personal calls rather than monitoring CCTV footage of Mr Butler's cell. He and a civilian employee, Detention Escort Officer Darren Wall, joked about Mr Butler's condition and made insulting remarks about him. The officer was found guilty of misconduct and had to undergo further training and development. Mr Wall was also found guilty of misconduct and received a written warning and management advice. Custody sergeant Mark Albutt faked records to make it appear officers were checking Mr Butler more often and more thoroughly than was the case.

"No touchline bust-ups for Uwe Rosler, but he carried the look of a man who wouldn’t need much provoking after this defeat. Wigan’s night was best summed up when Martyn Waghorn had the freedom of the six-yard box at 1-0 down with 20 minutes remaining. He barely connected with his attempt at a volley. Rosler looked unimpressed; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer quite relieved. They are good friends so there was no repeat of Rosler’s little tussle with Charlton’s Bob Peeters last weekend, but perhaps Wigan could have used a spark from somewhere. Opener: Cardiff frontman Nicky Maynard shoots towards goal to give the Bluebirds the lead against Wigan . On his knees: Maynard slides on his knees after giving Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men the lead on 53 minutes . Cardiff (4-4-2): Marshall 6; Brayford 5.5, Connolly 6.5, Morrison 7, Fabio 6.5; Daehli 6 (Pilkington 46, 6.5), Adeyemi 6, Gunnarsson 6, Whittingham 5.5; Jones 5.5 (Guerra 88), Maynard 6 (LeFondre 80). Subs not used: Moore, Hudson, Cala, Eikrem. Scorer: Maynard, 53. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 6 . Booked: Adeyemi . Wigan (3-5-2): Carson 6; Perch 6, Boyce 6.5, Ramis 6, Kiernan 6, Taylor 6.5 (Tavernier 76); Cowie 6.5, McArthur 6.5, Huws 6; McManaman 6.5 (Waghorn 61, 5.5), Fortune 5.5 (Riera 61, 6) Subs not used: Al Habsi, Caldwell, Espinoza, Barnett . Uwe Rosler 6 . Referee: Robert Madley 6 . Att: 20,622 . MOM: Sean Morrison . Instead it came after the final whistle, again from Rosler, who said he would have been ‘devastated with a point’, such were the chances Wigan created. Nicky Maynard’s second-half strike ensured they got nothing and Rosler was clearly furious as he considered a third game without victory, highlighting in particular the need to find striking reinforcements from a ‘destroyed market’. ‘You think there will be more teams who dominate here like this?’ Rosler said. ‘I don’t think so. We were dominant for 90 minutes apart from putting the ball in the net.’ He added: ‘When you see our last three games and especially here, everybody knows we have to do something on that part (in attack). ‘We have players who are very good, but I think we need more pace and more Championship experience up front. That is what we will try to get. I know the market is more or less destroyed in the Premier League and Championship.’ Waghorn’s miss was poor, while Marc-Antoine Fortune and Oriol Riera were also wasteful. But to say Cardiff were lucky would be unkind and not entirely accurate. This is a team that, unlike Wigan, has started the season rather well, taking seven points from three games. Unlike Rosler, Solskjaer carried a grin as the punters left the ground. ‘When a football club starts winning games it creates a better atmosphere in the ground, the offices, the stadium, in the pubs,’ Solskjaer said. ‘We didn’t play well know we can improve.’ Battle: Cardiff new boy Sean Morrison attempts to get the better of Wigan attacker Marc-Antoine Fortune . The Norwegian has had the benefit of ‘a hell of a lot of money’, as Rosler pointed out. And with it he has built a strong, if unbalanced squad. His defence worked well last night, barring the conceded chances that sent Rosler into a spin, but if this promotion bid falls flat it will likely be down to the depth of the back line. The departure of Kevin Theophile-Catherine on loan to Saint Etienne this week has heightened those issues, with Solskjaer admitting: ‘We really would have wanted to keep him but he wanted to go back to France for different reasons. Sometimes you have to answer the boy’s prayers. It has left us a little unbalanced in that position.’ But otherwise, Cardiff are in good shape, even if they are yet to find their upper gears. Gunnarsson drew an excellent save from Scott Carson inside two minutes and Maynard then fluffed his lines after a dreadful pass from Carson landed at his feet in the 21st minute. The striker had a clear path to goal but dallied and allowed Don Cowie to challenge. Hot pursuit: Cardiff striker Kenwyne Jones and Wigan defender Kieran Lee race for the ball . Callum McManaman caused Cardiff some early issues at the other end, most notably when he left Fabio da Silva on his backside and also when he drew a fingertip save from David Marshall with a header.

"'They should have cut me off!': Mark Johnston says the Dowtown Grand in Las Vegas took advantage of his drunken stupor when they gave him a $500,000 loan . A California man who lost $500,000 during a Las Vegas trip over the Super Bowl weekend is suing the casino for his losses because he was blackout drunk. Retiree Mark Johnston is suing the brand new Downtown Grand for loaning him the money and allowing him to play while he was inebriated. Nevada law bars casinos from allowing visibly drunk patrons to gamble and from serving them comped drinks. 'I feel like they picked my pockets,' Johnston told MyNews3. 'I feel like they took a drunk guy...like a . drunk guy walking down the street, and you reach in his pockets and grab . all his money.' According to Johnston's complaint, he drank at the airport and on the way to the hotel. He and his friends at at a restaurant, then things get fuzzy for Johnston. 'After that, I don't remember anything,' he said. But memory or no, Johnston appears to have had quite the time in Sin City. So much so that he took out a loan with the hotel for $500,000. And promptly lost it all. And therein lies their claim, said Johnston's attorney Sean Lyttle. 'You certainly arent't to issue half a million dollars in markers to someone who's intoxicated,' he said. The state Gaming Control Board is investigating. The . Downton Grand does not comment on pending litigation but Lyttle says . the Grand, which opened late last year, is countersuing Johnston for . trying to shirk his gambling debts. Johnston says this all boils down to responsibility and, not surprisingly, he blamed the casino. 'They . should have cut me off,' he said. 'The bottom line is the casinos are . supposed to not gamble to you and not overserve you in alcohol. That's . gaming regulation.' Just opened: The Downtown Grand had only been open for a couple of months when Johnston visited there from California in February. The casino is counter-suing Johnston for shirking his gambling debt .","Mark Johnston says the Downtown Grand should have cut him off and certainly should not have loaned him the $500,000 .

"President Obama may have had a tough couple of weeks, but newly-released images will remind him of his more carefree days. A high school friend has shared photographs of Obama at his prom night with TIME magazine - as well as a very friendly note he penned in her yearbook, in which he calls her 'sweet and foxy'. The images from 1979 show a grinning 17-year-old Obama in a white suit . with his arm around his date, Megan Hughes, before they headed to the party at Punahou . School in Honolulu, Hawaii. They were joined by two other teenagers - his best friend Greg Orme and date Kelli McCormack. Date night: President Obama is pictured on his high school prom night with his date, Megan Hughes (right), and friends Greg Orme and Kelli Allman. The images appear in the new issue of TIME . McCormack - now Kelli Allman - told TIME that the group sipped champagne before enjoying an evening of photos, dinner and dancing. 'It was a really fun, happy time,' she said. 'We were all cracking up, and everyone was smiling.' She also shared a complimentary note that Obama had written in her high school yearbook. 'You are extremely sweet and foxy, I . don't know why Greg would want to spend any time with me at all!' Obama . wrote in the lengthy yearbook note. 'You really deserve better than clowns like us; you even laugh at . my jokes! I hope we can keep in touch this summer, even though Greg . will be gone.' He then wrote down his number, encouraging Allman to give him a call, and signed off 'Barry Obama'. Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . Today: Kelli Allman, who now lives in Los Angeles, described Obama as 'very intelligent and witty' Allman said that she thought highly of Obama, who was 'very intelligent and witty'. 'He and I really clicked,' she told TIME. 'We had great vibes between us.' Happy memories: Allman said the group enjoyed champagne before dinner and dancing . While Obama's prom photographs have never been seen before, details have previously emerged about his high school years. Last year, a book delved into his teenage years and claimed that Obama and his friends formed The Choom Gang - slang for smoking marijuana - in which he invented inhaling techniques and rode a car called the Choomwagon. With his friends, he would drive the Choomwagon, a Volkswagen microbus, to Mount Tantalus, biographer David Maraniss wrote. Once parked, they 'turned up their . stereos playing Aerosmith, Blue Oyster Cult and Stevie Wonder, lit up . some ‘sweet-sticky Hawaiian buds’ and washed it down with ‘green bottled . beer’ (the Choom Gang preferred Heineken, Becks, and St. Pauli Girl).' High school star: Obama, pictured at high school, was known on campus for his basketball skills . Younger years: Barack Obama is pictured at his high school graduation in 1979 after his prom night . Obama . was also known on campus for his basketball skills, and was sometimes . called 'Barry O'bomber' for his jump shot. Coaches have recalled how he . never went anywhere without a ball. After . high school graduation Obama went to Columbia University and then . Harvard Law School, where he met his future wife, Michelle. The photos and interviews are in the new issue of TIME, which is out on Friday. After Obama's prom date with Megan Hughes and before settling down with Michelle during his time studying at Harvard, President Obama seriously dated two women: . Alex McNear . Alex McNear was a 20-year-old literature lover he met at Occidental College in 1981 before he transferred to Columbia in his junior year. They got back in touch when she visited New York in 1982, before continuing a long-distance relationship that eventually fizzled out, according to his biographer David Maraniss. After their relationship, she went on to marry a Serbian Boxer named Bob Bozic who once tried to rob $60,000 from a bank. They divorced after seven years of marriage and have a daughter. Genevieve Cook and Obama . Genevieve Cook, an elementary school teacher, and Obama met at a Christmas party in the East Village in 1983. Cook, who was 25, and Obama, then 22, dated for 18 months, passing their time discussing books and cooking. 'The sexual warmth is definitely there,' Cook wrote in her journal. 'But the rest of it has sharp edges . 'Tho he speaks sweet words and can be open and trusting, there is also that coolness - and I begin to have an inkling of some things about him that could get to me.' When she told him she loved him, he responded with 'thank you', according to Maraniss, and they broke up in May 1985. Cook wrote that she saw his perfect woman as 'very strong, very upright, a fighter, a laugher, experienced - a black woman I keep seeing her as'.",Images show Obama ahead of his prom night in Honolulu in 1979 .
"Rangers are set to make moves aimed at dispensing with Ally McCoist as manager after Monday’s annual general meeting at Ibrox. An announcement is expected to be made of Mike Ashley’s intent to underwrite the new £8million share issue, approval for which must be granted by shareholders in order to keep the club operating beyond the end of next month. With that availability of fresh funding and newly-appointed chief executive Derek Llambias at the controls, Ashley and his lieutenant can begin to impress their stamp on Rangers. VIDEO Scroll down to see Ally McCoist in a tough Rangers press conference . Ally McCoist could have manager Rangers for the final time against Livingston on Saturday . It’s understood the Ibrox board could be prepared to stave off the wave of unrest at the potentially stormy meeting with a solid declaration of Ashley’s commitment and financial way forward. And the Newcastle United owner could be painted as the stricken club’s saviour if loans of up to £3m already handed to Rangers by him were to be written off. All of which could mean yesterday’s 2-0 victory over Livingston becoming one of McCoist’s last, if not his final game, in charge of Rangers. Following a midweek meeting with football board chairman Sandy Easdale and Llambias, McCoist remained as manager for the Championship game at Ibrox. But, if bolstered by a guarantee of cash, Rangers can tackle negotiations over the terms of McCoist’s notice period within the next fortnight in a bid to reach a settlement. Attention would then turn to his backroom staff, including assistant manager Kenny McDowall, first-team coach Ian Durrant and goalkeeping coach Jim Stewart, as work begins on establishing a new football structure. That would be preferable to the new men in charge than prolonging the agony of McCoist remaining in control of the squad until as long as next December. Billy Davies remains a prominent contender to replace McCoist in the hotseat. Mike Ashley is keen to impress his stamp upon Rangers as soon as possible . Those manoeuvres will raise the stakes in Rangers’ imminent disciplinary clash with the SFA. Last Monday, the governing body issued Ashley and the club notices of complaint for allegedly breaching rules related to his increasing influence in Rangers’ day-to-day running. Ashley steered clear three months ago when then chief executive Graham Wallace went to the market and raised an emergency £3million. Instead, the Newcastle supremo struck a deal with Hargreave Hale for their investment in order to strengthen his shareholding to 8.92 per cent. However, he will ensure his shareholding is no more than 29.9 per cent following any flotation, otherwise he would be legally-bound to make a bid to buy the entire company. Meanwhile, it has emerged Mark Hateley was advised by formerteam-mates to be careful about courting a relationship with the Easdale brothers, Sandy and James — he sat beside them at the recent games at Alloa and Palmerston — months before this week’s revelation of his fall-out with McCoist. Hateley had phoned Nacho Novo and tried to speak to one current player in a bid to extract information about McCoist’s coaching methods. The Rangers manager blanked attempts by Hateley in midweek to mend the broken relationship, furious that his old team-mate appears to have joined the boardroom camp of those who are opponents of the McCoist tenure.","Rangers set to prepare moves aimed at dispensing with Ally McCoist .

"Roy Hodgson will name his first England squad since the World Cup a week on Thursday. Calum Chambers should be in it. Even if he is only there for the ride, to train in an environment with established internationals, this outstanding young talent needs to get a feel of what is to come. He doesn’t need to play and there is no pressure to cap him, but training with England’s elite can only benefit him. Arsene Wenger has, quite rightly, formed a human shield around Arsenal’s young central defender. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Calum Chambers take his bib off while doing keep-ups . Young Gun: Calum Chambers impressed on his Champions League debut against Besiktas . Standing strong: Calum Chambers helped Arsenal keep a clean sheet in their goalless draw in Turkey . Standing tall: Chambers (left) has a word with teammate Laurent Koscielny during the match . But when you play like this, with composure and class, in a Champions League qualifier against Besiktas in Istanbul, there is point trying to hide him away. This was another special night. At the age of 19, the £16m recruit from Southampton has been Arsenal’s best player in their opening two matches. Think about that for a moment. In a team laced with talent, from the former Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez to Jack Wilshere to the match-winning midfielder Aaron Ramsey (sent off last night), Chambers has topped the lot. He shows remarkable composure, reading the game like an old pro during a tasty and sometimes fiery battle with Demba Ba in the Ataturk Stadium. The former Chelsea striker thought he could pick on him, seeking him out in the opening minutes of this Champions League qualifier. Chambers was more than ready for him. It comes to something when Chambers was pushing his more experienced team-mate Laurent Koscielny around, talking him into position when Besiktas broke forward. Raising the Ba: The Arsenal youngster competes in the air with former Chelsea striker Demba Ba . Protest: Chambers (left) talks to Serbian referee Milorad Mazic as Demba Ba (right) looks on . There were shades of Alan Hansen about his block tackle on the edge of the area 35 minutes in, waiting for the right moment to stop Ba bulldozing his way into the box. His positioning is first class, always alert as he makes his first steps at the very highest level. They are anything but tentative. This wasn’t a faultless performance, but that would be asking too much of a player who has spent his entire career at Southampton playing at right back. Still, he learns fast. There will be mild frustration with his failure to clear properly, exposed at the back when Ba was breathing down his neck on the stroke of half-time. Experience will tell him to clear the decks, but he miscued and allowed Ba to make his way into the penalty area. He will learn to never go to ground, but the Besiktas forward fired wide. Kid's play: Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane won the Champions League last season aged 21 . At 19, Chambers is thriving in the environment at Arsenal and learning, quickly, to accept the challenges of being a player at the top level. At Real Madrid, the young France central defender Raphael Varane won his first La Liga title two years ago and played a full game in the Champions League victory against Atletico Madrid at the age of 21. Varane already has 11 caps for France and he is being used carefully and considerately by his club manager Carlo Ancelotti. Wenger has, quite rightly, promised to throw a protective cloak around Chambers and he will be due a rest when Per Mertesacker is fully fit after returning from the World Cup. Take a bow: Chambers was arguably man of the match on his league debut against Crystal Palace . Teenage kicks: The 19-year-old has impressed his Arsenal teammates with his ability . Remember the days leading up to Euro 96, when the former England coach Terry Venables called Rio Ferdinand, then 18, into his squad to acclimatise him to a long and distinguished international career. Chambers is already an established Under-19 international, but his progress is so dramatic, so rapid, that he should leapfrog Gareth Southgate’s Under-21 team. We are witnessing the future of English football, someone to get excited about after the pain and despair of those three depressing group games in Brazil. Chambers already has given us reason to hope. If you are good enough, you are old enough and all that. CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW!

"Sami Hyypia has former Liverpool team-mate Steven Gerrard to thank for his first league victory in English football. The Brighton boss spoke to Gerrard about 21-year-old Reds playmaker Joao Teixeira last week and the Portuguese duly headed south on a season-long loan deal. Teixeira – signed from Sporting Lisbon for £830,000 in 2012 – made his first start at Elland Road last night and was on target as he inspired Hyypia’s pointless side to a much-needed win. Jumping for joy: Joao Teixeira celebrates after giving Brighton the lead against Leeds at Elland Road . Leeds: Silvestri, Byram, Pearce, Cooper, Warnock, Austin, Bianchi, Tonge, Murphy (Cook, 81), Sharp (Poleon, 80), Smith (Ajose, 45). Subs not used: Taylor, Wootton, Bellusci, Norris. Booked: Warnock, Pearce, Cooper, Austin, Murphy. Brighton: Stockdale, Calderon, Greer, Dunk, Chicksen, Saltor, Agustien (Lua Lua, 59), Forster-Caskey, Holla (Ince, 75), Teixeira (Hughes, 90), Mackail-Smith. Subs not used: Ankergren,  Toko, McCourt, O'Grady. Booked: Holla. Scorer: Teixeira, 5, Lua Lua, 84. Referee: James Adcock (Nottinghamshire) The ex-Liverpool defender was already under pressure having opened the season with back-to-back 1-0 losses against Sheffield Wednesday and Birmingham. A conversation with Gerrard, however, helped change that and, on this evidence, Teixeira could well have a first-team future at Anfield when he returns next summer. And Hyypia said: ‘Joao is still young and can improve and hopefully we are the stepping stone to the first eleven at Liverpool. He showed tonight he can really play football. ‘I’m grateful that Liverpool let him come here and hopefully it works both ways – we’ve got a quality player on our hands and we hope he can play many games - that would also suit Liverpool. ‘He would not have got much time on the pitch (at Liverpool). He needs to play games to improve. I’m very happy to have him here.’ The game was only five minutes old when livewire Teixeira broke the deadlock, Bruno Slater springing him clear and he defied a narrow angle to slide across Marco Silvestri and into the bottom corner. At the double: Kazenga Lua Lua (centre) celebrates after doubling the Seagulls advantage . Aerial duel: leeds left back Stephen Warnock gets the better of Brighton defender Inigo Calderon in the air . The Portugal Under-21 youngster was at the heart of everything good about his side during the early exchanges and, after wriggling free of two white shirts inside the area, he teed up Craig Mackail-Smith only for his shot to cannon into a defender. The Seagulls should have doubled their advantage before the break but the unmarked Inigo Calderon headed over at the far post having been located by Adam Chicksen’s left-wing delivery. That chance – effortlessly fashioned by Brighton – drew boos from a frustrated home crowd. But Leeds should have been level after the break when the energetic Sam Byram - a reported target of Liverpool - broke clear down the right and drew back to Billy Sharp, lurking on the penalty spot. The former Southampton man had the whole goal to aim at but fired straight at the sliding Calderon, much to the angst of the Elland Road fans. That allowed substitute Kazenga LuaLua to make sure of Hyypia’s first points of the season when he smashed home a late free-kick. And Hyypia - appointed in June having been sacked by Bayer Leverkusen in April – reflected: ‘We showed what we can do, especially in the first half. ‘But we had to dig in and keep our concentration on the defensive side. I was very happy that we kept a clean sheet. ‘If you want to play football you need good footballers on the field. I was a defender so I don’t know if it’s strange I want to play this way, but that’s what I like. ‘I think we can take a lot of confidence from this performance and I hope we can play our way out of the Championship. I think the players will enjoy playing this way.’ Meanwhile, Leeds manager Dave Hockaday said: ‘I can’t tell you how disappointed I was with the first half. We didn’t work together and we gave the ball away cheaply. ‘We gave it a go in the second half but lacked a cutting edge.’ Challenge: Broghton frontman Craig Mackail-Smith attempts to get the better of Leeds new boy Liam Cooper .","Brighton achieve first Championship win of the season with 2-0 victory against Leeds .

"Relive Sportsmail's coverage of the Champions League as Arsenal travelled to Istanbul for the first leg of their play-off against Besiktas. Both teams had chances in an open game, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hit the post late on. The visitors were playing the latter period of the game with ten men after Aaron Ramsey was sent off for two petulant yellow cards. Besiktas: TBA . Arsenal: TBA . Host commentator . Final whistle goes, sorry about the lack of goals... Arsenal probably had the best of the chances tonight, hitting the post late on, but after Aaron Ramsey's sending off will have to take a draw away from home. They'll be back at the Emirates next week, and will be eager to make the group stage. 90mins: Late sub for Arsenal, who will be happy with this scoreline now, despite that near miss. Credit to Mathieu Debuchy, who has been brilliant going forward, and in defence on the right. 88mins: That was absolutely brilliant from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Dribbling in from the right-hand side, the midfielder unleashes a shot on his weaker foot which the goalkeeper does well to tip onto the post. 83mins: Arsenal understandably sitting back now, its Besiktas' time to attack. Kerim Frei, formerly of Fulham, is on for Ozyakup who seemed to be losing his temper. 80mins: Well this makes things interesting... Aaron Ramsey picked up a cheap first yellow for tugging back his opponent, and he makes the same mistake. Tugs back Ozyakup after losing possession, and now the visitors have a real challenge on their hands. 72mins: Second sub for Arsenal, as the hugely promising Alexis Sanchez goes off. Like for like swap with the Ox coming on. 68mins: Finally Arsenal burst into life into the second half. Great passing down the right between Sanchez and Debuchy, and the right-backs pull-back finds Giroud... but his shot is blocked. Approaching the 70th minute, Wenger has the likes of Rosicky, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joel Campbell available should he wish to change things up. 66mins: Monreal joins Ramsey and Flamini in the book for Arsenal as he catches Mustafa late as the midfielder tried to play Demba Ba through. 59mins: Neither team committing too much at the moment. Few shots from long range here and there, but little else. You would think Besiktas would have to come out and attack, being the home team. 55mins: It's almost like his job is collecting yellows. Mathieu Flamini goes into the book, a flurry of sorts at the moment. 53mins: Lots of challenges going in so I'm surprised that's the first booking of the game. Motta cynically takes out Alexis Sanchez on the halfway line as the Chilean broke past him. Minutes later Aaron Ramsey pulls back Ozyakup and earns himself a cheap yellow. 50mins: Worry for Arsenal with Everton up next, skipper Mikel Arteta hobbles off with a knock. Flamini replaces him, while Koscielny takes the captain's armband. Arsenal made it into half-time for refuge but the second-half has exactly the same feel. Besiktas quicker and sharper to the ball, more aggressive. Arsenal would probably take the 0-0 if it were on offer at the moment. 47mins: Arsenal carved open. Olcay is played in down the left with so much space to run in to - he cuts inside, opens up the shot into the far corner, but Szczesny will be relieved to see that one curl just wide. Away we go again. No shot from kick-off this time. So much for entertainment, Arsenal... Well that was different, eh? The Champions League is back, and it was so nearly back with a bang with Demba Ba's five-second shot off the bar from kick-off. It's been end-to-end in Istanbul, but both teams can't quite execute their final ball. Alexis Sanchez has looked lively for the visitors, while Olivier Giroud should really have opened the scoring. 45mins: Oh dear. It hasn't been Olivier's half. A beautiful chipped ball finds the Franchman but he misses his left-footed volley completely. 44mins: Rare lack of composure from Calum Chambers. The youngster attempts a crossfield pass to his centre-back partner, but it's intercepted by Ba. The striker twists and turns and his shot wrong foots Szczesny, but it's just wide. Athletic Bilbao have just taken a surprise lead away at Napoli, Iker Muniain with that goal. Seems to be a thriller in Copenhagen too, with Bayer Leverkusen leading 3-2. 38mins: Great effort from Jack Wilshere. The midfielder plays a one-two with Giroud, and after looking up to see no one in front of him, curls towards goal from 25 yards. The keeper does well to dive and save and hold. That was heading towards the top corner. 30mins: Slight appeal for a penalty there for Besiktas. Chambers tracks Veli and doesn't get the ball, but the player wasn't going for it himself. Right decision from the referee. Chambers so full of composure for Arsenal at the back. This is his first Champions League game and he is clearly enjoying himself out there. Everything about him is measured and controlled. 25mins: Plenty of whistles as Arsenal try and build attacks. Giroud, who has been somewhat sluggish so far, nearly picks out Alexis Sanchez with a dinked cross. Arsenal in the ascendancy as the hosts sit back. 18mins: This game settling down after a fast and frenetic start. Alexis Sanchez really does look in the mood, while Calum Chambers has started well at the back for Arsenal. Seems they just have to be patient. 13mins: But this is much better from Arsenal now. Sanchez again involved, his cut back finds Santi Cazorla, whose shot zips past the post from a tight angle. Arsenal have a holding midfielder on the bench in Mathieu Flamimi and it looks like they could do with him in the early part of this game. Arsenal’s midfield being over-run in the opening spell. 12mins: Seems to be so much space for Arsenal on the right. This time Aaron Ramsey tries to break clear but the referee doesn't play advantage after a trip on Sanchez. 10mins: Great ball from Ozyakup over the top of Calum Chambers to find Ba. The Senegalese striker connects well with his left foot on the volley, but the goalkeeper does well to palm it away. Looking really dangerous here, the hosts. But here's Arsenal on the break! Sanchez bursts clear but his cross is deflected and Giroud can't quite get it out of his feet. 5mins: All over the place at the minute Arsenal. The hosts are playing nice quick football on this 'questionable' surface. Arsene Wenger's side struggling to get going. Away we go! And off the bar immediately! A shot straight from kick-off troubles Wojciech Szczesny. What a start... Demba Ba with the effort. And the atmosphere is incredible in Istanbul. Arsenal will surely be happy enough with a draw here. Can they start on the front foot? Speaking to ITV before the game: 'It's windy and pitch is not the best at all, we will have to adapt.' Arsenal fans will hope they do that quickly... Worryingly also, he says Koscielny declared himself fit: 'Koscielny has inflamation but he has declared himself fit, you have to trust the player.' We know what Arsenal can bring, but what about Besiktas? One player to look out for is Oğuzhan Özyakup who is a former youth product in North London. Wenger said: 'I always thought he could make a career but at our club he had big competition in front of him and that is why we let him go. 'It is good to see he has made it to the top level and is now an important player in Turkey.' Arsenal have won all 12 of their previous Champions league play-off matches. That's some record. They have also scored eight goals in their last two games in Istanbul, against Fenerbahce and Galatasaray. It may be tough tonight though at the Olympic Stadium. Perhaps they should ask Liverpool for some advice... Demba Ba has spoken this week about how Jose Mourinho stopped his move to Arsenal last summer, and he now believes he didn't play for Chelsea as he wasn't a star name. ‘Sometimes when you are at a club with a lot of big stars, the name counts for more than the statistics. Unfortunately, it was like that in my case,’ he said. Time to prove your point! As expected Demba Ba starts for the hosts, looking to build on his two goals in five games against the Gunners. For Arsenal, Olivier Giroud comes in for the injured Yaya Sanogo, and similarly Nacho Monreal replaces Kieran Gibbs. Alexis Sanchez will be looking to score his first goal for the club, and don't forget about Aaron Ramsey... Szczesny; Debuchy, Koscielny, Chambers, Monreal; Arteta, Ramsey; Cazorla, Wilshere, Sanchez; Giroud. Subs: Martinez, Bellerin, Miquel, Flamini, Rosicky, Oxlade-Chamberlain & J.Campbell. Tolga, İsmail, Motta, Ersan, Pedro, Olcay, Veli, Necip, Oğuzhan, Mustafa, Demba Ba . Concrete information should arrive shortly, but we can gather certain aspects about Arsenal's line up. Calum Chambers is expected to make his Champions League debut after impressing in recent weeks, while it will be interesting to see whether Alexis Sanchez starts. The Chilean struggled somewhat in the 2-1 victory against Crystal Palace at the weekend, and could be rested for this weekend's trip to Everton. Hit them where it hurts! Lukas Podolski may not be here (though there is still Wojciech Szczesny), but Besiktas manager Slavan Bilic says his side will be battling on the pitch... not taking pictures. 'We are not here to take selfies with Arsenal on the pitch, we are here to battle to the end,' Bilic said at his pre-match press conference. Hello and welcome to Sportsmail's coverage as Arsenal travel to Istanbul to play Besiktas tonight.

"An adviser to the Polish president accused U.S. authorities on Monday of 'absolute ignorance' in seeking the arrest of film director Roman Polanski, a Holocaust survivor, while he was in Poland last week for the opening of a Jewish history museum. The comments underline the dilemma of Poland in the face of continued attempts by the U.S. to seek Polanski's arrest on 1977 charges of having sex with a minor. Poland is a close US ally. But the Polish political class has shown a strong aversion to arresting and extraditing the Oscar-winning Polish-French filmmaker, who made his first films in Poland and is admired as a representative of Polish culture. Scroll down for video . Roman Polanski, 81, traveled to the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw and US authorities asked the Polish to arrest him . Polish officials acted angrily to the American request and refused to detain the filmmaker. The Polish-French Polanski is seen as a hero in Poland . 'I think that Polish citizens, especially in cases of crimes whose statute of limitations have run out, should not be subject to extradition,' Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz said when asked about the Polanski case. There is no statute of limitations on Polanski's case because he has already pleaded guilty to the charges. Polanski, 81, who lives in France, attended the opening of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw on October 28 before traveling to Krakow, his childhood city. Polish authorities questioned him there because of the US request, but refused to arrest him. Tomasz Nalecz, adviser to President Bronislaw Komorowski, said he felt it was inappropriate to seek the arrest of a 'child of the Holocaust' in Poland during the opening of the museum, which highlights Poland's role as a safe haven for Jews for centuries before the Holocaust. 'From the point of view of Polish history,' the US official who requested the arrest 'showed absolute ignorance,' Nalecz said. The U.S. Embassy didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Polanski, who has Jewish origins, lost his mother at Auschwitz. He survived the war assuming a non-Jewish identity. Samantha Geimer, aka Samathan Gailey, (pictured in the 1970s at left and in 2008 at right) was sexually assaulted by the director when she was just 13 . Polish media say Polanski has been seeking guarantees that Poland won't extradite him as he plans to direct a new film in Poland next year on the Dreyfus affair, the early 20th century French spy scandal. US officials have been trying to convince European nations to arrest Polanski and extradite him to America ever since he fled the country in 1978. Samantha Gailey was just 13 years old when Polanski raped her after luring her behind closed doors for a photo shoot.

"The mother of a 19-year-old allegedly killed by an Indiana serial killer has spoken of her grief at discovering her daughter had been murdered. Afrikka Hardy's body was found Friday in a bathtub at a Motel 6 in Hammond, 20 miles southeast of Chicago. Darren Vann, 43, a convicted sex offender admitted to murdering  Hardy, and according to police confessed to a murderous spree that dates back 20 years. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Lori Townsend, the mother of Afrikka Hardy, a 19-year-old allegedly killed by an Indiana serial killer has spoken of her grief at discovering her daughter had been murdered . Close: Lori Townsend said: 'We were best friends. She was a fighter from the time she was born' Today her mother Lori Townsend told ABC News: 'We were best friends. She was a fighter from the time she was born.' She told how her daughter had left home in Colorado only three months ago to start a new life. She said she tried to use FaceTime to video chat with her daughter about an hour before the time that police said she died. Serial killer? Darren Vann, 43, a convicted sex offender admitted to murdering Hardy . 'I can't tell her I love her anymore,' she said. 'I can't give her hugs, I can't give her kisses.' Police said Hardy was involved in a prostitution ring, but her mother said she did not know about this and it was probably a way for her daughter to make money. She said she thought that  Backpage.com  - the website where Hardy had advertized her services as a prostitute, was the issue. 'That's the real story behind this,' she said. 'These girls get caught up in this industry. It's good money.' Vann was charged Monday in the strangulation death of Hardy - he also was charged with murder in commission of a robbery and robbery causing great bodily injury. A probable cause affidavit said police identified Vann from surveillance video outside the motel. Hammond Police Chief John Doughty said Vann confessed to Hardy's slaying and directed police to six bodies in abandoned homes in nearby Gary. Charges in those cases are expected this week. Today the coroner identified one of the woman  as 36-year-old Kristine Williams of Gary. Williams’ family has been notified, Coroner Merrilee Frey said, and her identity was confirmed, reports NBC Chicago. An autopsy was performed Monday, but the manner and cause of her death are pending. Now the Lake County coroner is asking for the public's help in identifying two of the women. Murdered: Afrikka Hardy's body was found Friday in a bathtub at a Motel 6 (pictured) in Hammond, 20 miles southeast of Chicago . One unidentified woman was found Sunday in the 400 block of 43rd Avenue in Gary. The woman was wearing a silver linked bracelet with “Best Aunt” on top, a silver ring with a heart shape and a silver ring with scalloped engravings. The woman was approximately 5ft 3. The other was found Sunday in the 4300 block of Massachusetts in Gary. She was wearing a pair of blue jeans by RUE21 and white Nike gym shoes. The individual was approximately 5 feet tall. Doughty said Hardy was involved in prostitution and had arranged to meet Vann at the motel through a Chicago-area website. Police were called by someone who attempted to reach Hardy but received text message responses that made no sense and that she believed came from the suspect. Police took Vann into custody Saturday afternoon, and during interviews the suspect confessed to Hardy's killing, told investigators where the Gary bodies could be found and hinted at other victims since the 1990s, Doughty said. Victims: Police in Gary, Indiana, named Anith Jones, 35, (right) as one of the deceased and Afrikka Hardy (left) as another of the seven found so far . Determining whether others have fallen prey to Darren Vann, 43, a former Marine convicted of sexual assault in Texas in 2009, could take years, a former high-ranking agent at the FBI's Chicago office said. Investigators 'have concerns' that Vann  could have victims in other states, according to Bob Ramsey, the supervisory special agent for the FBI office in Merrillville, Ind, reports the Chicago Tribune. 'We are looking beyond Lake County and he has been cooperative,' Ramsey said, adding that local police have built a 'great rapport' with Vann. 'He is talking, and what we're looking to do now is to verify some of the information that he has been providing.' That some of his alleged victims may have been prostitutes or had fallen through society's cracks could also complicate the investigation. 'It does make it difficult. It indicates he preyed on individuals that might be less likely to be reported missing,' said Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson. Police in Gary and Austin, Texas, said they are reviewing missing person reports and unsolved cases to determine whether any might be connected to Vann after he indicated during interviews that he had killed before. Former FBI agent Joseph Ways Sr., now executive director of the Chicago Crime Commission, a non-governmental watchdog group, told The Associated Press that such investigations can stretch into years. Investigators will trace Vann's footsteps, down to examining gas receipts and toll both records, to learn where he traveled. House of horrors: An abandoned home at 2200 Massachusetts in Gary, Indiana, where police found the one of  six women's bodies over the weekend . Discovery: Police investigating the slayings of seven women whose bodies were found in northwestern Indiana say the suspect has told them that he may have killed people going back 20 years . Ways said teenagers or adults who maintain close contact with their families are typically reported missing quickly, but that's not always the case for those engaged in prostitution, he said. 'If one of them goes missing for days or weeks, it might be that nobody notices,' he said. 'It's a shame.' The backgrounds of the other victims weren't immediately revealed. 'It could go back as far as 20 years based on some statements we have, but that has yet to be corroborated,' Doughty said. The Gary slayings appeared to have happened recently, he said. The body of one victim, 35-year-old Anith Jones of Merrillville, Indiana, was found Saturday night in an abandoned home. She had been missing since Oct. 8. More victims? Police in the town are investigating the possibility that a serial killer has been loose for weeks before he was arrested on Friday . Record: Darren Vann's sex offender registry which outlines his crime committed in 2003 . Five more bodies were found Sunday in other homes. Doughty identified two of the women as Gary residents Teaira Batey, 28, and Christine Williams, 36. Police have not determined the identities of the other three women, including two whose bodies were found on the same block where Jones' body was found. Austin police on Monday said they would review potential related cases based on information provided by Indiana police. Vann is registered as a sex offender in Texas, where the Department of Public Safety listed his risk of attacking someone again as 'low.' He did not register in Indiana. Court records in Travis County, Texas, show Vann served a five-year prison sentence, with credit for the 15 months he was in jail awaiting trial, after pleading guilty in 2009 to sexually assaulting a woman at an Austin apartment two years earlier. The woman told police that she went to Vann's apartment, where he asked if she was a police officer. After she told him no, he knocked her down, strangled her, hit her several times in the face and told her he could kill her. He then raped her. Vann allowed the woman to leave and she called police the next day. The circumstances of that case had similarities to Hardy's death, according to the victim's mother and court records. Lori Townsend said police told her that Vann asked her daughter to perform a certain sex act, and 'when she said `no' and put up a fight, he snapped and strangled her.' Vann told police Hardy began to fight during sex and that he strangled her with his hands and an extension cord, the probable cause affidavit says. 'This man is sick,' Townsend said from her home in Colorado.","Afrikka Hardy's body was found Friday at a Motel 6 in Hammond .

"A former children's nursery worker who stabbed her 'smitten' younger lover 24 times during a drunken argument is facing life in prison after being found guilty of murder. Petite blonde Michelle Mills, 31, used so much force when she attacked Edward Miller, 20, that the knife penetrated nine inches into his body and the blade broke away from the handle. She then waited 20 minutes before raising the alarm as her partner lay dying on the living room floor of their cottage in the upmarket village of Scalford, Leicestershire. Guilty: Former children's nursery worker Michelle Mills, who stabbed her 'smitten' younger lover Edward Miller 24 times, is facing life in prison after being found guilty of his murder . Mills, just 4 feet 11 inches tall and described as 'angelic looking', claimed she feared her boyfriend , who was nearly a foot taller and weighed almost 18 stone, was about to attack her. The court heard both had a drunken argument and Mills texted a previous boyfriend saying: ‘I still love you and always have. I’m sorry xx.’ In a second text she wrote: ‘I wish I’d never let you go xx.’ Moments later she took a kitchen knife and repeatedly stabbed Mr Miller to death. Today, a jury at Lincoln Crown Court rejected Mills’ story that she knifed Mr Miller after hearing voices in her head and found her guilty of murder. Flanked by two security guards, Mills burst in to tears as the jury returned their guilty verdict after a day of deliberations. Judge Michael Heath warned Mills there was only one sentence he could pass but told her he wanted time to reflect on the length of her sentence. As she left the court Mills blew kisses to family members in the public gallery. Murder: The couple had been seen acting affectionately towards each other at the King's Arms pub in the upmarket village of Scalford before the stabbing . Remanding her in custody until next . Tuesday, Judge Heath told her: 'The jury have convicted you of murder . and there is only one sentence I can pass in relation to that, that is . of course life imprisonment. 'I have to decide the minimum sentence you must serve before you can be released.' The . jury heard Mills had previously had a vivid dream in which she killed . Mr Miller, known as 'Eddie', and was so convinced that it was reality . she woke him up to check he was still alive. She admitted 'I had a dream that consisted of me killing Eddie. It was on a night when I was in bed with him. I woke him up to check he was still breathing. He was and he was still alive. I felt cruel when I realised it was just a dream.' The court heard how Mills had attacked two previous partners with a knife and had also threatened Eddie Miller with a blade during their tempestuous two year relationship described by a psychiatrist as 'an explosive combination'. She was Eddie’s first serious girlfriend whereas Mills admitted to the jury that she had over 70 previous sexual partners. Brutal: Michelle Mills, 31, used so much force when she attacked Edward Miller, 20, that the knife penetrated nine inches into his body . Mills claimed she was the victim of domestic violence during the relationship but the jury heard that they were 'each as bad as each other' and Eddie, who lived with his mum before moving in with Mills just two months before his death, had suffered assaults at her hands. The jury heard that Eddie , a management trainee at the upmarket Scalford Hall hotel, died after the couple argued following a visit to a Bonfire Night party at the village pub. Miss Yvonne Coen QC, prosecuting, said 'What happened to Eddie wasn’t a one-off. It was part of a pattern of behaviour with her partners reaching for a knife when she was extremely angry with them. 'She is a dangerous, manipulative, unpredictable and angry woman who reaches for a knife when she is angry.' Miss Coen said that during the . evening Mills texted one of her previous partners, . saying she still loved him and wished she had never let him go. 'After . Eddie, on her account, had grabbed her and pushed her on the sofa she . got away from him. It could have stopped,' Miss Coen told the jury. “All he wanted to do, it seems, was to sit having a drink. It would seem that she wasn’t going to leave it there. 'She . wasn’t going to let him ignore her so she took it to the next level by . taking a knife to him repeatedly perhaps to punish this young man for . what may have happened between them before but clearly to hurt him very . severely and during the course of it she actually broke the knife. ' The attack left Eddie bleeding to death on the living room floor. Mills dialled 999 but despite the efforts of paramedics Eddie was pronounced death after being taken to the Queens Medical Centre at Nottingham. He had knife wounds to his chest, back and abdomen. Miss Coen added: 'Michelle Mills was considerably older than her boyfriend and obviously had a good deal more life experience. 'He would have been 18 years old when he met Ms Mills. She was Eddie Miller’s first serious girlfriend. It seemed to outside observers they appeared to be completely smitten with each other. 'They were coming to this relationship from very different positions. This was his first ever grown up relationship with a woman. She was an older woman.' Convicted: A jury at Lincoln Crown Court, pictured, today rejected Mills' story that she knifed Mr Miller after hearing voices in her head and found her guilty of murder . The jury heard that Mills had attacked two previous boyfriends with a knife but neither suffered any serious injury and did not press charges. Eddie also told his dad, Colin Miller, that Mills had previously pulled a knife on him. Mr Miller said: 'He said ""Look at the size of her. What could she do to hurt me? It was only a small knife anyway.’ The couple got together when Eddie was just 18 and had already talked about marrying. Eddie’s mum Sara Westle said: 'She (Mills) was never shy in saying Eddie was the one. We spoke about weddings and wedding dresses. She was convinced Eddie was the one.' Mills wept as she told the jury she loved Eddie and did not mean to kill him. She claimed the domestic violence she suffered triggered memories of being sexually abused as a child causing her to fly into a rage. She told the jury that voices in her head told her to 'just do it'. Mills said 'I have no memory of picking up the knife but I remember using it to stab Eddie. As I walked back into the living room he came towards me. 'I thought he was going to attack me. I stabbed him because I thought he was going to kill me. I stabbed him a second time in the stomach. 'I killed him but I didn’t mean to kill him. I didn’t want to kill him.' Mills, 31,  of  Scalford, Leicestershire, denied murder on November 6 last year.","Michelle Mills, 31, attacked Edward Miller, 20, following a drunken argument .

"Women who suffer from obesity when treated for breast cancer are more likely to relapse . Obese women treated for breast cancer are more likely to suffer a relapse than slimmer patients. A study has shown for the first time that overweight women have worse outcomes from the most common form of the disease. It found women who are obese when diagnosed have a higher chance of dying prematurely. Researchers believe the causes  are hormonal. Their results suggest that extra body fat causes hormonal changes and inflammation that may drive some cases to spread and recur, despite treatment. Previously, it has been suggested that a greater risk of the disease returning in heavier women might be due to under-treatment with chemotherapy drugs. It was feared they may have been receiving doses aimed at slimmer sufferers because their body size had not been taken into account. The latest study of almost 7,000 female patients was led by Dr Joseph Sparano, of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine’s Montefiore Medical Center, in New York. ‘We found that obesity at diagnosis is associated with about a 30 per cent higher risk of recurrence and a nearly 50 per cent higher risk of death, despite optimal treatment,’ he said. ‘Treatment aimed at interfering with hormonal changes and inflammation caused by obesity may help reduce the risk of recurrence.’ The study compared the health outcomes of obese and overweight patients with others who took part in three trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Participants had to have normal heart, kidney, liver, and bone marrow function, excluding patients with other significant health problems. As a result, researchers were able to disentangle the influence of obesity from other factors. Losing weight after diagnosis may reduce insulin which may be effective in cutting the risk of recurrence of breast cancer . The researchers found that increasing body mass index – or BMI, the relationship between weight and height – significantly increased women’s risk of cancer recurrence and early death. This was despite optimal treatment including chemotherapy and  hormonal therapy. There was a stepwise relationship between increasing BMI and poor outcomes only in women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. This is the most common type and affects two-thirds of sufferers. Dr Sparano said it was ‘biologically plausible’ that increasing weight leads to greater risk of recurrence via higher insulin levels. It was uncertain if losing weight after diagnosis could cut the risk of recurrence, but some studies suggest it reduces insulin levels, which ‘might be effective’, he added. Catherine Priestley, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care said: ‘We know a healthy weight is beneficial for reducing the risk of a range of health conditions. ‘So, while this study may be useful, it’s important to put this into perspective. There are a number of key features of breast cancer that will influence the risk of it coming back and each person’s predicted outlook will vary. ‘For those who have been diagnosed, there is emerging evidence that maintaining a healthy weight, as well as being physically active may help reduce the risk of the  disease returning. ‘However, this can be really difficult as weight gain can be a common side-effect of treatment.’ Dr Stuart Griffiths, head of commissioned research, Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘The findings provide further evidence that obesity can have a detrimental effect. ‘Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the risk of breast cancer, particularly after menopause. ‘Obesity can also affect the chances of survival for those with the most common type of breast cancer, so it is vital patients are given support on how to control their weight.’ The findings are published online in CANCER, a journal of the American Cancer Society.",Study in New York show weight loss after treatment may help decrease risk .
"Women across the country took off their tops and exercised their right to bare breasts yesterday. Some two dozen women took to the streets of New York wearing shoes, shorts, and not much more. Elsewhere in the country, scantily-clad participants had posters and pamphlets. The revealing events were part of what participants called ‘National Go-Topless Day,’ to draw attention to inequality in topless rights between men and women. Scroll down for video .

Nearly naked: Robert Burck, centre, also known as the Naked Cowboy, performs for the women as they marched in Times Square . Family friendly? Two activists pose in the heart of Times Square with a person in an Elmo costume while the press swarms around them . Some two dozen topless women protested in a New York City park on a hot, sweaty Sunday as part of National Go Topless Day, a non-profit U.S. organisation founded in 2007. There were topless men in the park, too, but nobody paid them much attention, a disparity, organizers said, that demonstrated the need for the event. The topless women drew crowds of onlookers who took pictures and video with their cell phones. 'We say there is nothing wrong with the female nipple,' Karen Heaven, an organizer of the event, told the crowd that quickly formed around her in Manhattan's Bryant Park. She was wearing white pants and a purse over her shoulder. 'My dog has six, I have two, but I can be put in jail for showing my nipples. It's 2012 – what are we thinking?'

Reuters as he thumbed through photographs and video he had just taken on . his phone. 'They're topless.' Several women waved signs saying: 'Equal Topless Rights For All.' After the speeches, a guitarist led the crowd in a reworking of The Beatles' song 'Let It Be.' Similar protests were scheduled in about 30 U.S. cities and 10 around the world, organizers said.In Phoenix, another two dozen men and women marched down Central Avenue to promote their rights. Disappointing: About a dozen women bared their breasts in Asheville, North Carolina this year, dozens less than the year before . Organiser Jenna Duffy, 27, told The Arizona Republic that the demonstration ‘can bring us closer to gender equality by showing that they are not objects, they are part of us that we are not ashamed of.’ Though dozens more in the Arizona capital looked on, Duffy said that was a large part of the problem, saying: ‘Gawkers…should be walking with us.’ In the march was a self-described ‘stay-at-home grandma’ who said: ‘If there were more opportunities to be naked, I’d be part of it.’ In Asheville, North Carolina, there were hundreds of gawkers, but only a dozen or so participants. The disappointing turn-out could have been in part by a City Council public statement that asked for residents and gawkers alike to avoid the rally. Canadian pride: A woman in fairy wings protested in Toronto, Canada . Earth angels: The women in Toronto showed up in all white . Strength in numbers: In Seattle, men wore bikini tops while the women went bare-chested . Police said about 2,000 people turned up to watch or show their solidarity with the cause, according to the Asheville Citizen Times. The annual Go-Topless Day was established in 2007 by a former sports car journalist called Rael, who founded a religion called the Raelian Movement after he said he was visited by a space alien in a French volcano park who told him life on Earth was created by extra-terrestrial scientists, according to an account on his website. According to the organisation’s website, it is legal to be topless in cities like Asheville, Austin, Boulder, Colorado, Columbus, Honolulu, Madison, Portland, Oregon, and Washington. In other states, it is illegal to go topless.","Women across the country turned out for National Go-Topless Day .

Helen Jackson gave the prison four stars for the 'lovely food' and balanced her review as she added 'rooms very small but comfortable.' Ellis Hamer wrote: 'Amazing hotel. Great food, very luxurious rooms and highly skilled and attentive staff. Highly recommended for a weekend break or a longer stay.' Meanwhile, Kenny Baker said it was a 'Great little hotel', while Paul Hilton hailed the 'great' food and staff. Some posts offered the balance seen in many reviews, criticising the 1855 prison's 'dated' accommodation . Another post poked fun at the 'unruly' nature of the occupants of the prison . One poster suggested popping into the jail for a 'cuppa' with the 'great staff' of the jail . John McDermott wrote: 'Great staff, great food and above you can do as you please open all year round. Call in for a chat and cuppa. But, just like with any hotel, there are some downsides. Karen Regan wrote: 'I hope not to repeat my vacation there, as so many have done before me. 'I will be writing a strongly worded letter about the total and utter shoddinness of Walton and I will be also be informing the editor of my local newspaper and imploring them to please make their readers, who may have considered a vacation at Walton, aware of just how deplorable the conditions there are.' Reviewers have given the prison ratings out of a maximum five, with it achieving a 3.1 star aggregate score . The prison is yet to issue a TripAdvisor style response to the criticism, but the reviewers wait in anticipation. HMP Liverpool was built in 1855 and has a capacity of 1,247. It holds prisoners convicted of category B and C offences - such as kidnapping, arson and racially-aggravated assault. It has come under criticism for its conditions, with a report earlier this year finding that prisoners felt unsafe and that overcrowding was a problem.

"The arrest of a 94-year-old alleged sex offender at his retirement home in Michigan proves that it's never too late to go to jail. William Bricker, 94, was arraigned on Thursday in Grand Traverse County after a warrant for his arrest was issued in Wyoming for the sexual assault of two boys for whom he was a live-in counselor at a Jackson Hole Youth Camp called Teton Valley Ranch Camp. Upnorthlive.com reports that William Bricker was arrested at his retirement community, the Tendercare Health and Rehab Center in Garfield Township, on September 23. Arrested at 94: William Bricker was arrested at his retirement community in Michigan for the alleged sexual assaults of two young boys in 1962 and 1985 at the summer camp in Wyoming where he was employed . 'On Tuesday, Sept 23, 2014, we (Tendercare) were contacted by the local police department inquiring about an individual who was residing at our center. The individual was arrested, removed from Tendercare Traverse City and is in the custody of authorities,' says Debbie smith, an Administrator of Tendercare Traverse City. 'We are cooperating with authorities as they continue their investigation of this situation,' she added. In the court files, one of the now-grown accusers alleges Bricker molested him when he was his live-in camp counselor at Teton Valley Ranch Camp during the summer of 1962. The other accuser alleges Bricker molested him during a four-day stint at the camp during the summer of 1985. Teton County Wyoming authorities learned of the alleged abuse when one of the victims reported the incident to the Boy Scouts of America at an undisclosed time. Jackson Hole News & Guide reports that the 1962 victim was 13-years-old at the time of abuse and says that 'more than once' Bricker entered his sleeping bag and touched him 'in all the wrong places,' including his genitals. The 1985 victim says he was molested up to six times by Bricker who also touched his genitals and 'forced him to ejaculate.'

"Samantha Geimer is now on email terms with Roman Polanski, she has revealed. Here she is pictured at the premiere of 'Roman Polanski: Wanted And Desired' at The Paris Theatre in New York City in 2008 . Nearly 40 years after she accused film-maker Roman Polanski of raping her in the jaccuzzi at Jack Nicholson's house, Samantha Geimer has revealed the pair are still in touch. Polanski, who was 44 at the time, fled the the US the day before he was due to be sentenced in 1977 and has been exiled ever since. Over the past few years Ms Geimer, who was just 13, and Polanski have written to each other by email. In one of the emails to Ms Geimer, Polanski expressed concerns at a rumour that the title of the French version of the memior she will publish next week would mention the word 'rape'. She replied, assuring him that it would not. The scandal shocked highfliers in the film world and destroyed Polanski's career in Hollywood. It turned him into one of the country's most high profile fugitives. Now she regards him as an ally, according to The Times newspaper in London. She tells the paper: 'People are still coming after both of us. We're both still being treated unfairly. It makes sense to be on the same side.' She adds that both of them have been abused by the media and the US justice system. Ms Geimer talks in detail about the attack. She was picked up by Polanski in his hired Mercedes and driven to Nicholson's house for a magazine shoot. He wanted to take pictures of her. The story has been written many times since the day in 1977, but Ms Geimer goes on to say Polanski, now a father of two, gave her 'four or five' glasses of champagne and part of a sleeping pill before the shoot. He told her to strip and she claimed he had sex with her, and sodomised her despite her protests. Polanski, however, has said the sex was consensual. Despite the horrific events, Ms Geimer says what followed was worse than the actual rape. 'If I had to choose between reliving the rape or [that testimony], I would choose the rape,' she says. Samantha Geimer was just 13 when she was in a jaccuzzi with Roman Polanski. Pictured here as a young girl . Hellraisers: Roman Polanski, right, with Jack Nicholson, at the premiere of 'As Good As It Gets' in Paris. It was in Nicholson's jacuzzi that Polanski had sex with the 13-year-old Samantha Geimer in 1977 . Roman Polanski pictured in Paris in July this year . Now she considers Polanski a victim as well because of the judge's collusion with the media. The late Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, she claims, told newspaper reporters what sentence Polanski should face. He was not convicted of rape, but had pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. But it was when Rittenband reneged on his promise that Polanski should serve no more than 90 days psychological evaluation in a California prison, because he feared a backlash, that Polanski fled. The director wrote a letter of apology to Ms Geimer in 2009.","Polanski expressed concerns at a rumour .

"They have plagued feet for centuries, but only now have physicists revealed what causes ingrown nails. Experts have  come up with the first mathematical formulae that describe how human nails grow. They have discovered that ingrown toenails are caused when the forces holding nails in place, and their rate of growth, become unbalanced. Experts have come up with mathematical formulae that describe how nails grow. These graphs show how the tilt of the nail changes when the adhesive molecules are not working efficiently (C), the probability that a bond is not keeping up with nail growth (D) and a representation of the force generated by a nail (E) Other factors, such as the thickness of the nail, biomechanical stress and the way people trim their nails, influences their chances of getting ingrown nails. The University of Nottingham study solves a long-running mystery about why ingrown nails occur. Nails are made of dead skin cells, which are hardened by a protein called keratin. They grow outwards from the half-moon shaped ‘lunala’ at the base of the nail, but their progress of 0.1 to 0.2mm a day is kept in check by adhesive molecules that ‘stick’ the nail to the finger, Popsci reported. They have discovered that ingrown toenails are caused when the forces holding nails in place, and their rate of growth, become unbalanced. When this happens, a nail becomes wider at the top and curls round into the sensitive flesh to either side of the nail. Big toenails are prone to becoming ingrown because of their shape . Scientists looked at the mechanical stresses and energies associated with the nail, to come up with equations to explain nail growth. They show that when the balance between the nail’s growth stress and adhesive stress is broken – if a nail grows too quickly or slowly, or the number of adhesive structures changes – a residual stress across the entire nail can occur, causing it to change shape over time. The equations demonstrate that residual stress can occur in any fingernail or toenail; however, the stress is greater for nails that are larger in size and have a flatter edge, which explains why ingrown toe nails predominantly occur in the big toe. Experts say that the tiny, microscopic structures, which allow the nail to slide forwards, grow in a ‘ratchet-like’ fashion by continuously binding and unbinding to a nail. If the balance between adhesion and growth becomes unbalanced, the nail changes shape, and can become ingrown or spoon-shaped, according to research published in the journal, Physical Biology. Ingrown nails often occur in children, teenagers and pregnant women, when hormones cause a growth spurt of the nails, which extend into the sensitive flesh alongside them. Cyril Rauch, lead author of the study at the University of Nottingham, said that big toenails are particularly prone to becoming ingrown because of their shape. Scientists say that people should trim their nails in a ‘parabola shape’ to minimise their chance of getting ingrown nails. They warned that poor trimming can tip the fine balance of nails, causing residual stress to occur across the entire nail, making problems like ingrown nails more likely . Their squareness means stress caused by walking is diverted to the tip of the nail, which gets wider to spread the load. The scientist says that people should trim their nails in a ‘parabola shape’ to minimise their chance of getting ingrown nails. Dr Rauch warns that regular poor trimming can tip the fine balance of nails, causing residual stress to occur across the entire nail. ‘We suggest that nail beauty fanatics who trim their nails on a daily basis opt for straight or parabolic edges, as otherwise they may amplify the imbalance of stresses which could lead to a number of serious conditions,’ he says.","Scientists at the University of Nottingham have come up with the first mathematical formulae that describe how human nails grow .

"Ofsted has launched an independent investigation into claims that a 'superhead' close to former education secretary Michael Gove knew about inspections weeks in advance. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, said fresh emails have come to light regarding three Norfolk schools all overseen by Dame Rachel de Souza. The academies involved in the allegations are Ormiston Victory Academy in Norwich, Thetford Academy and Great Yarmouth Primary. Ofsted has launched an independent investigation into claims that 'superhead' Dame Rachel de Souza knew about inspections at three schools weeks in advance . By law, schools can only be given half a day's notice of an inspection, but in August it was claimed the schools knew days, sometimes even weeks, before inspectors were due to visit. In a statement, Sir Michael said: 'The ongoing claims that have been made about certain schools in Norfolk being given advance notice of Ofsted inspections are very serious. 'It is vital that the public has absolute confidence in the integrity of the inspection process. That is why I immediately asked Sir Robin Bosher to examine these allegations when they first surfaced in August. 'Sir Robin conducted a thorough investigation, which included 39 interviews with relevant parties and visits to the three academies in question. But I made a public commitment that should any additional evidence come to light, I would have no hesitation in bringing in someone from outside Ofsted to examine this. Sir Michael Wilshaw (left), the chief inspector of schools, said emails have come to light regarding allegations about De Souza who was executive of the Inspiration Trust, which at the time oversaw all three academies . Ms De Souza was principal of the Ormiston Victory Academy and is believed to have found out in advance about an inspection there by Ofsted, and requested for the school website and honour role to be updated . 'For the avoidance of any doubt, I will be asking this independent reviewer to examine all the evidence originally considered by Sir Robin and to establish whether his findings and recommendations still stand in the light of the new email evidence that has now emerged.' The announcement came after the Observer presented Ofsted with a further set of emails which suggested de Souza discussed the timing of inspections with members of the inspectorate. In an email conversation  between De Souza and a consultant for the Inspiration Trust Maggie Hollingsworth in July 2013, they  discuss an inspection date for Larkman Primary in Norwich. Ms De Souza says she is due to meet the deputy director of Ofsted in the east of England, Paul Brooker, that evening. The allegations are also thought to include Thetford Academy in Norfolk, also overseen by the 'superhead' And in another email exchange with a Department for Education official in May 2014, De Souza claims she has received a promise of an inspection in the autumn from Brooker. Ms De Souza writes: 'Between us Paul has promised they'll come back in Autumn but what a waste of time really … and if it can happen to me then imagine schools with less experience …' The original report into the claims was carried out by Ofsted's director of quality and training, Sir Robin Bosher. It concluded Dame Rachel de Souza, chief executive of the Inspiration Trust, which at the time oversaw all three academies, was mistakenly copied into an email containing an inspection schedule. A spokesman for Dame Rachel de Souza said: 'These emails are being quoted out of context. In both cases, Dame Rachel was following Ofsted guidelines and any suggestion that she was lobbying Ofsted improperly is false. 'In the first email to an educational consultant, she discussed an potential Ofsted inspection of Larkman Primary School, which was in the process of being taken over and converted into Norwich Primary Academy by the Inspiration Trust to improve educational attainment. Ofsted's guidance recognises that in these circumstances, with a change of leadership, an inspection may not be appropriate. 'In the interest of transparency and ensuring the change happened in the best interest of pupils and parents, Dame Rachel explained the situation to Ofsted and they noted her views. 'However, in line with their regulations, HMI on behalf of Ofsted did not divulge what effect this information would have on their decision whether or not to inspect the school. 'In the second email, Dame Rachel expressed her disappointment with the result of an inspection, which rated Great Yarmouth Primary as good with outstanding leadership. 'She had hoped to show it was an outstanding school, but Ofsted indicated that one of the key factors they could not award that rating was the fact that exam results were not yet available. 'Dame Rachel considered requesting a second inspection to confirm high or improving standards, and it was confirmed to her by Paul Brooker that she was entitled to do so under Ofsted's rules. In the event, this second inspection was not requested. Again, this is entirely normal practice and in line with Ofsted rules. 'We welcome the independent review of the original Ofsted investigation announced by Sir Michael Wilshaw, which we are confident will lay to rest these false allegations once and for all.' Dame Rachel de Souza discussed an upcoming inspection date in an email conversation with  Maggie Hollingsworth from the Inspiration Trust in July 2013, released by the Observer. On 4 July 2013, De Souza said: 'Do you think it would be better if they were inspected before sept? Or not? Be good to get your advice as speaking with PB this evening on other matters.' Ms Hollingsworth responds 20 minutes later saying: 'I am worried that it is late in the year and Ofsted is pressed to finish its normal inspections. I would hate for a scratch team to go in and give it RI [a 'requires improvement' rating]. That could pull the rug out from under your plans completely. 'I would try to get a deferral till late in the spring term (the likely rise in maths SATs results should give you a good argument for Paul, if you need one) by which time the school could be moving rapidly in the right direction.' Two days later, de Souza replies to Hollingsworth, saying: 'Spoke to PB who agrees with you re below & has noted.'","Chief inspector of schools said fresh email evidence has come to light .

"FIFA president Sepp Blatter has ruled out revisiting the vote for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups after the world governing body's executive committee agreed unanimously that an 'appropriate' form of the Garcia report should be published. Blatter said in a statement that 'external legal experts' supported the view that 'there are no legal grounds' to revoke the controversial vote in 2010 to award the World Cups to Russia and Qatar. FIFA's executive committee agreed unanimously that an 'appropriate' form of the report into World Cup bidding by Michael Garcia, the ethics investigator who resigned earlier this week, should be published but with names and other details removed. The report into corruption by Michael Garcia will be published, the FIFA ExCo have decided . Officials at a meeting in Morocco agreed to the proposal without a vote being taken - but nothing will be published until the ethics committee charges against three FIFA ExCo members - Angel Villar Llona of Spain, Belgium's Michel D'Hooghe and Thailand's Worawi Makudi - have been dealt with. Blatter said at a news conference: 'The famous Garcia report is no longer such a timely matter. At the current time, there is no reason to go back on our decisions. The decision of December 2010 stands.' 'We need to ensure that we respect the rules of our organisation and that we do not breach confidentiality in a way that will prevent people from speaking out in the future. 'The two World Cups are in the calendar, the only thing missing is the precise dates for 2022, but these two World Cups will take place,' said Blatter. 'It would really need an earthquake, extremely important new elements to go back on this World Cup in Qatar.' FIFA president Sepp Blatter (centre) was in favour of Garcia's report being published . American lawyer Garcia produced a 430-page report into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. He quit on Wednesday as FIFA's ethics investigator after losing his appeal challenging the findings to clear Russia and Qatar to host the World Cups. The FIFA ExCo meeting was given a presentation by Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's audit and compliance committee, who suggested the report should be published in an 'appropriate form' - with all names and other details redacted. This was agreed to by the members without a vote - though it is understood there were some strong views expressed questioning how much of the report should be made public. Blatter said in a statement: 'The report is about history and I am focused on the future. We will not revisit the 2018 and 2022 vote and a report by independent, external legal experts commissioned by Mr Scala supports the view that there are no legal grounds to revoke the executive committee's decision on the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.' Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce, from Northern Ireland, welcomed the move to publish the report in some form. But Blatter said there were no legal grounds to revisit the votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups . He said: 'I am pleased the the FIFA executive committee decided without a vote to publish this report. It shows that people at FIFA at the moment do desire transparency and the sooner we can get on with talking about the game of football that we all love, the better.' FIFA's ExCo appointed Zurich-based Swiss lawyer Cornel Borbely to replace Garcia in an acting capacity. Borbely had been Garcia's deputy and took charge of the investigation into the Russian and American bids. Borbely's main task will be to take over the cases of FIFA ExCo members Villar Llona, D'Hooghe and Makudi, who all had proceedings opened against them by Garcia for either alleged code breaches during the 2018/2022 bidding process or for failing to comply with his investigations. Garcia had also opened proceedings against former ExCo member Franz Beckenbauer, the former Germany player and coach, and Harold Mayne-Nicholls, the head of FIFA's inspection team which compiled a technical report on the countries bidding for 2018 and 2022. FIFA also confirmed that a final decision on the timing of the 2022 World Cup will be taken in March - November/December 2022 remains the most likely time in order to avoid the extreme heat of the summer. The FIFA ExCo have also announced they will scrap age limits for international referees . The last meeting of the task force looking at the dates will take place in Doha, Qatar, on February 23. The executive committee also supported the creation of an independent body to oversee a programme to improve workers' rights in Qatar. Blatter also took the opportunity to stress again that he would be standing for a fifth term of office on May 29 next year against as yet unknown definite opponents. 'I trust in myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here,' he said. 'Probably you will see my name because I have been asked by a lot of national federations. Football needs leadership.' Meanwhile, new rules banning third party ownership of players will come into force on May 1 next year, though existing agreements will be permitted until a player's contract expires. In other decisions, the ExCo agreed to scrap the age limit of 45 for referees - officials instead will have to take an annual fitness test. Prize money for the women's World Cup will rise by 50 per cent, from 10million US dollars (£6.4m) in 2011 to 15m US dollars (£9.6m) in 2015, with 2m US dollars (£1.28m) going to the winning team.","FIFA voted to publish Michael Garcia's World Cup bidding report .

"A possible split between old and new FIFA executive committee members has emerged ahead of the vote on Friday on whether the Garcia report into World Cup bidding should be published. It follows a suggestion by FIFA president Sepp Blatter at the previous ExCo meeting that only those members who were on the committee for the 2010 vote should have a say on the report's publication. That would rule out more than half the current members and if Blatter tries to resurrect the move at the meeting in Marrakesh on Friday he is likely to face sustained opposition. FIFA's executive committee members are due to vote on the publication of Michael Garcia's corruption report . One FIFA member said: 'If it is raised again I would strongly oppose it.' US lawyer Michael Garcia's resignation as FIFA's ethics investigator has put further pressure on the world governing body, and the executive committee will vote on whether his report should be published but with names redacted. At the previous ExCo meeting in September, several members confirmed that Blatter suggested those members elected since the December 2010 vote should not have a say on the Garcia report's publication. Only 13 of the 22 members who awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively remain on the ExCo - there are now 25 members plus a further two co-opted members. Sepp Blatter said only older (pre 2010) members should be allowed to vote on the publication of the report . Not all the older members would support such a move by Blatter however - it is understood UEFA president Michel Platini, who has previously backed publishing the report, would be in favour of a free vote involving all members. Another intriguing aspect of the meeting is that the three FIFA members understood to have been under investigation by Garcia for potential ethics code breaches are expected to be permitted to take part in the vote. Spain's Angel Villar Llona, Belgium's Michel D'Hooghe and Thailand's Worawi Makudi were all under investigation by Garcia for either alleged code breaches during the 2018/2022 bidding process or for failing to comply with his investigations. He had also opened proceedings against former ExCo member Franz Beckenbauer, the former West Germany player and manager, and Harold Mayne-Nicholls, the head of FIFA's inspection team which compiled a technical report on the bidding countries. Garcia's report was only published as a summary by FIFA, something Garcia himself quickly denounced . Garcia resigned as chairman of the investigatory chamber of FIFA's independent ethics committee on Wednesday after losing his appeal challenging the findings to clear Russia and Qatar to host the World Cups. Garcia issued a hard-hitting statement criticising FIFA's 'lack of leadership' and saying he cannot change the culture of the world governing body. Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce said Garcia's resignation was 'damaging'. Boyce told Sky Sports News: 'I am totally shocked. It must be damaging. Michael Garcia is someone of the very highest credibility. He must feel very, very strongly about certain things when it has got to this stage. 'I have always said that as much of that (Garcia) report, as legally possible, should now be put in the public domain. I honestly feel that this has got to a stage now where people are absolutely fed up with it. We need to bring it to a conclusion. 'Until this situation is completely resolved, and brought to a head, I'm sorry, but FIFA's reputation is always going to be damaged.'

"In July 1944, Orson Welles wrapped up one of his wartime radio broadcasts with a brief, emotional reading of one of the country's favorite authors, John Steinbeck. The piece was titled With Your Wings, an inspirational story about a black pilot that Steinbeck wrote for Welles' program, and it seemed to disappear almost as soon as it was aired. There are no records of With Your Wings appearing in book or magazine form. Even some Steinbeck experts, including scholar Susan Shillinglaw and antiquarian James Dourgarian, know little about it. 'It doesn't ring a bell at all,' said Dourgarian, who specializes in selling first editions of Steinbeck's work. Unearthed: The transcript of a story written by Of Mice And Men author John Steinbeck (pictured) will be published Friday in The Strand, a magazine that specializes in reissuing obscure works by famous writers . 'And that's saying something if I haven't heard of it. 'It's also surprising because you would think that anything Steinbeck was involved with would be printed some place.' But 70 years after Welles' introduction in the midst of World War II, With Your Wings is getting a second release. Andrew F. Gulli, managing editor of the Birmingham, Michigan-based quarterly The Strand Magazine, came upon the transcript recently while looking through archives at the University of Texas at Austin. He features it in The Strand's holiday issue, which comes out Friday. Steinbeck, who died in 1968, wrote often about social injustice and on occasion featured black characters, notably Crooks in his classic novella Of Mice and Men. Gulli, whose magazine specializes in reissuing obscure works by famous writers, said in a recent email that With Your Wings was characteristic of the Nobel laureate's worldview. Flashback: The story With Your Wings was written by John Steinbeck (left) and read on the radio in 1944 by Orson Welles (right) but has been missing since. Until now . 'Steinbeck was an idealist. He saw America as this wonderful land with so much to offer but on the flip side, he could see inequality, he could see greed and excess destroying the working classes,' Gulli wrote. 'This story strikes me as an effort to show middle America that African-Americans were carrying on a huge burden in defending the United States and the allies during the war.' Released Friday: The Strand is a magazine that specializes in reissuing obscure works by famous writers . An avid supporter of the war, Steinbeck worked overseas as a correspondent in the 1940s and, according to biographer Robert DeMott, wrote a favorable book about the Air Force called Bombs Away! Dourgarian noted that Steinbeck had favored 'unusual' stories instead of describing the daily briefings from military officials. With Your Wings at first reads like a standard narrative of a veteran's return, a plot used by everyone from Homer to Ernest Hemingway. Second Lieutenant William Thatcher has completed his training and at a farewell ceremony receives silver wings, pinned to his chest. He climbs into his 'clattering' Model-A Ford and sets out for an unidentified hometown. He appears to be greeted as a hero, or at least a celebrity, passing 'crowded porches' and children 'washed and dressed in their best and starchiest clothes, hairs bursting with ribbons'. 'He could hear the rustle as the neighbors moved silently near and formed a half circle behind him,' Steinbeck writes. 'It was as though his own people were sitting in judgment on him.' Thatcher's sense of obligation is made more clear and powerful when Steinbeck reveals that he is black, at a time the military was segregated. 'He took off his cap with the gold eagle on it and held it in his hand. He saw his tall father lick his lips. And then his father said softly, ''Son, every black man in the world is going to fly with your wings'',' Steinbeck writes. 'His heart was pounding. 'He could hear a little quiet murmur of voices in front of the house. 'He knew they were going to sing in a moment. 'And he knew now what he was to them.'","With Your Wings is a story about a black war veteran written by John Steinbeck .

"Britain may end up paying hundreds of millions in extra cash to Brussels, David Cameron admitted yesterday, after a senior EU official warned refusal to pay would threaten our rebate. The Prime Minister told MPs he will never pay ‘anything like’ the £1.7billion demanded by the European Commission, while MPs said he should tell the EU to ‘stick’ their bill. However it seems the UK will almost certainly be forced to pay something extra after the Commission suggested it could withhold our £3billion-a-year rebate. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron's EU statement: The Prime Minister told MPs he will never pay ‘anything like’ the £1.7billion demanded by the European Commission, while MPs said he should tell the EU to ‘stick’ their bill . A furious Mr Cameron told MPs yesterday that the row had undermined public support for the EU. Despite his combative stance in the Commons, the Prime Minister appeared to shift his position by saying it was the ‘scale’ of the cash demand that was unjustified. He said Treasury officials would ‘crawl’ through all the EU’s figures to ensure Britain was being asked to pay the right amount. But he had to fend off criticism that he should have known long before last Thursday that we might be facing such a huge cash demand. Mr Cameron said: ‘Britain will not be paying 2billion euros to anyone on December 1 and we reject this scale of payment. We will be challenging this.’ But later a spokesman said that in the past, Britain had been happy to pay sums of ‘the low hundreds of millions’ – indicating that the UK may end up paying a similar amount this time. The Prime Minister was accused of being ‘asleep at the wheel’ by Ed Miliband. He claimed the Office for National Statistics had been working on the changes since 2012 and publicly stated in May that they would impact on the UK’s contribution, while then-Treasury minister Nicky Morgan said in March that the Government was giving ‘high priority’ to addressing them. And Europhile Tory MP Kenneth Clarke also cast doubt on the Prime Minister’s claim that the demand took the Government by surprise, telling MPs that the Foreign Office and Treasury must have known for at least five months that it was on its way. Jab: Ed Miliband accused the PM of being ‘asleep at the wheel’, pointing out the Office for National Statistics had been working on the changes since 2012 and stated in May they would affect the UK’s contribution . In another blow for Mr Cameron, it emerged that the Netherlands – which has also been hit with a Brussels cash demand – said they would probably pay up. Yesterday the German finance minister undermined the Prime Minister’s hopes of getting powers over our borders back from Brussels – saying any change to the principle of free movement of workers was ‘unthinkable’. Support for Ukip hit a new high after the EU’s budget demand, a poll last night suggested. Backing for Ukip jumped four points to 19 per cent – one point above its previous high in June. Labour slumped five points to 30 per cent – the party’s lowest rating under Ed Miliband – leaving it level with the Conservatives, the ComRes poll for The Independent showed. And Mr Cameron’s insistence that Britain will not pay the full £1.7billion was met with scepticism from the EU’s budget commissioner, Jacek Dominik. Mr Dominik said it would be ‘extremely difficult’ for the UK to challenge the demand, as this would need the support of a qualified majority of member states.  He added that any refusal to pay the bill would open a ‘Pandora’s box’ which could put the future of the UK’s EU rebate on the negotiating table. Mr Dominik said he was ‘surprised’ by the Prime Minister’s anger, insisting that the adjustment of Britain’s contribution was a routine annual procedure. He claimed that the figures behind the calculation were provided by the ONS, and the UK was informed on October 17 of the scale of the surcharge. Britain had had two opportunities to challenge the way the figure would be calculated. And he warned that Britain would be liable for ‘late payment fines’ if it failed to hand over the cash on time. Responding to Mr Dominik, Mr Cameron’s spokesman said: ‘The rebate is not on the table.’ The controversial European Arrest Warrant system must be retained by Britain to ‘keep our country safe’, David Cameron said last night. The Prime Minister’s comments appeared to give strong backing to Home Secretary Theresa May, who warned opting out of the scheme could turn Britain into a ‘honeypot’ for criminals. But the party leadership still faces the prospect of a rebellion by dozens of backbench Tory MPs who oppose the warrant. The legislation allows EU citizens to be fast-tracked to other member states for trial and applies to crimes carrying a maximum sentence of 12 months or more. Critics say it is a blunt tool which undermines civil liberties and is abused by law enforcement agencies in countries which lack British legal protections. Many also point to the case of five-year-old Ashya King, whose parents were subject to a warrant after they sought treatment for his brain tumour abroad. But supporters say opting out would lead serious criminals to view Britain as a safe haven. Responding to questions from MPs over whether Britain should remain in the system, the Prime Minister said: ‘What matters most of all is that we give the police and the security services the powers they need to keep our country safe.’","Despite combative stance, PM softened his criticism of the EU demand .

"A man who was tortured and killed by the Taliban while visiting relatives in Afghanistan was targeted by the violent regime specifically because of his dual Afghan-Australian citizenship. Sayed Habib Musawi, 56, from Sydney, was travelling from the Jaghori to Ghazni province in southern Afghanistan when he was targeted and captured by the Taliban. According to Mr Musawi family, he was on a minibus heading back to Kabul when insurgents boarded the vehicle and demanded him to identify himself. Mohammad Ali Ahmadi, the deputy governor of the Ghazni province, has told the ABC that Mr Musawi was singled out by the Taliban because they think 'Australia is an infidel country'. 'The reason of his murder was very clear – that he was a dual citizen, he came from a country that Taliban think is an infidel country,' Mr Ahmadi said. Scroll down for video . Australian man Sayed Habib Musawi was captured by the Taliban, tortured and killed while visiting family in a volatile region in southern Afghanistan . 'Of course the reason is that he was an Afghan-Australian. 'When the Taliban arrested him, he said to them, ""I came from Australia to see my family."" And then the Taliban... issued an order for his murder. 'He didn't do anything besides that – he didn't do anything wrong, he wasn't a criminal, he wasn't involved in government activities.' The man's son Nemat Musawi, 23, said the family was 'devastated... we can't believe it' and suspected the attack was a 'set up'. 'I just spoke to my dad a week-and-a-half ago and he was with family members and he said he was going to call me back,' he said. 'I was waiting for his call and then the next thing I hear he's been shot dead by Taliban three times. 'It seems like it was all set up, because they just stopped the bus on the way to Ghazni and then they just went straight to my dad, called him and pulled him out of the bus'. Nemat Musawi, 23, said he suspected the attack on his father was 'all set up' Whilst members of the Hazara community attempted to negotiate with the Taliban, raising hopes that he would be released, Mr Musawi's body was found on Tuesday. He had three bullet wounds on his body, once through his neck and twice in his chest, and also showed signs of torture. Mr Musawi's daughter, Kubra Musawi said that the family was in shock, and despite reporting the death to the federal Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, had received no assistance from the government. 'He’s an Australian citizen and yet nothing’s happened yet. I’m not in a good condition to do all the paperwork; I’m in a bad situation. I don’t know what’s going on, no one has been contact,' Ms Musawi told The Guardian. A spokesperson from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that the family was being assisted by the government. 'The Australian Embassy in Kabul continues to seek to confirm reports an Australian-Afghan dual national has been killed in Afghanistan,' a department spokesman said. Ms Musawi, who is based in Sydney, wants the Australian government to investigate how the political fundamentalist group managed to locate her father. 'I want the government to find out how the Taliban knew how my dad was going back to Kabul. It is obvious they got a report about him because they went onto the minibus and said ""Sayed Habib, get up,"" she said. Mr Habib was travelling from Jaghori to Ghazni province in southern Afghanistan when he was targeted and captured by the Taliban. 'He wasn’t anything to do with the government there. They just wanted to stop him coming back to Australia. I don’t want anyone else to experience this. Every minute we think of my brother’s family who are still there, I can’t study or work because of the stress of it.' Mr Musawi had been living in Australia since 2000, and had returned to Afghanistan in May, hoping to travel to visit the his daughter-in-law and grandchildren when the region stabilised. 'The area where these events reportedly occurred is contested by the Taliban and it will be difficult to obtain definitive and official confirmation of the man's death from the Afghanistan government,' said the DFAT spokesperson. There have been numerous reports of ethnic and religious minorities being persecuted and murdered in the area recently, with the Australian government reinforcing that Afghanistan is still listed as 'not safe to travel'. According to the United Nations, the Taliban and their allies were responsible for between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of Afghan civilian casualties in the past five years. The Hazari community has been regularly persecuted by the Taliban, and despite a slight improvement since the ousting of the political fundamentalist group, the population continues to experience violence. Australia has received large numbers of Afghan refugees, many of whom are members of the Hazari community, over the last decade.","Sayed Habib Musawi, a dual Afghan-Australian citizen, was brutally murdered by the Taliban while visiting relatives in a persecuted area .

"Ask people to imagine American life in 2050, and you'll get some dreary visions. Whether they foresee runaway technology or runaway government, rampant poverty or vanishing morality, a majority of Americans predict a future worse than today. Whites are particularly gloomy: Only one in six expects better times over the next four decades. Also notably pessimistic are middle-aged and older people, those who earn mid-level incomes and Protestants, a new national poll finds. Penny Trusty, 74, a retired software designer poses with photographs of her five grandchildren in her home in Rockville, Maryland . 'I really worry about my grandchildren, I do,' says 74-year-old Penny Trusty of Rockville, Maryland, a retired software designer and grandmother of five. 'I worry about the lowering of morals and the corruption and the confusion that's just raining down on them.' Even groups with comparatively sunny outlooks - racial and ethnic minorities, the young and the nonreligious - are much more likely to say things will be the same or get worse than to predict a brighter future. 'Changes will come, and some of them are scary,' says Kelly Miller, 22, a freshly minted University of Minnesota sports management grad. High tech future: Kelly Miller, 22, a recent graduate of the University of Minnesota, looks forward to some great things in the future, but also worries that people will become overly reliant on technology . She looks forward to some wonderful things, like 3D printers creating organs for transplant patients. But Miller envisions Americans in 2050 blindly relying on robots and technology for everything from cooking dinner to managing their money. 'It's taking away our free choice and human thought,' she says. 'And there's potential for government to control and regulate what this artificial intelligence thinks.' Overall, 54 per cent of those surveyed expect American life to go downhill, while 23 per cent think it will improve, according to a December survey from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 21 per cent predict life will stay about the same. That minority may be onto something, however. While no one can say what catastrophes or human triumphs are to come, contentment at a personal level has proven remarkably stable over the past four decades. Love lives: Overall satisfaction with marriages and jobs has remained much the same since 1972, despite huge social changes in the intervening years . Interviews by the federally funded General Social Survey, one of the nation's longest-running surveys of social trends, show Americans' overall happiness as well as satisfaction with their jobs and marriages barely fluctuating since 1972. Those decades spanned the sexual revolution and the women's rights movement, race riots and civil rights advances, the resignation of one president and impeachment of another, wars from Vietnam through Afghanistan, the birth of the home computer and the smartphone, boom times and hard times. Despite the recent shift toward negativity about the state of the nation, the portion of U.S. residents rating themselves very or pretty happy stayed around 9 out of 10. 'Most people evaluate their lives very stably from year to year,' said Tom W. Smith, who has been director since 1980 of the GSS, conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. 'You don't want massive surges and falls in personal happiness, and the fact that we don't see that is reassuring.' Equality: The survey shows Americans' personal satisfaction barely fluctuating since 1972, despite wars, the civil rights and womens movements and political upheavals including the impeachment of one president and the resignation of another . The GSS, conducted once every two years, will send interviewers back into the field in 2014. The AP-NORC Center survey asked people to rate the change in American life during the period tracked by the GSS, from 1972 to 2012. A majority - 54 per cent - say life in America is worse today than four decades ago. Those old enough to remember the early '70s are especially nostalgic, as are tea party supporters and people who live in the countryside. Those who say U.S. life has declined are more apt to name politics, the economy, moral values or changes in families as the biggest difference. The three in 10 who think life is better are more likely to point to computers and technology as the big change. Racial and ethnic minorities are apt to cite domestic issues, including civil rights. The GSS offers a look at the real-time changes in American opinion, along with things that have stayed the same, and hints for the future. Some of the opinions voiced in the 1972 survey are rarely uttered today. Back . then, nearly four in 10 non-blacks agreed with the idea that whites had the . right to keep blacks 'out of their neighborhoods.' A quarter of . non-blacks said they wouldn't vote for a black man for president, and 26 . percent of all adults wouldn't back a well-qualified woman. Now . the president of the United States is black and a woman is the . most-discussed prospect for 2016. The GSS dropped those three questions . in the 1990s as results began to show they were no longer contentious. La'Shon . Callaway, a 19-year-old political science student at Stockton College . in New Jersey, is optimistic that his generation will make the future . brighter and that he'll see discrimination fade over his lifetime. 'People . are getting tired of it, and fed up,' said Callaway, who is black. 'They're realizing even if you're not the same color as me, you're still . a person and I'm still a person.' As . 2050 approaches, one central component of U.S. race relations will . change: Non-Hispanic whites will no longer make up the majority of the . population, according to Census Bureau projections. Bright future: Political science student La'Shon Callaway, 19, is optimistic that racial discrimination will continue to decline over his lifetime . In 1972, the sexual revolution was . ablaze. That year the Supreme Court ruled that unmarried couples had a . right to birth control. 'The Joy of Sex' manual was published. And then . there's 'Maude,' the sitcom character who shocked Americans by getting . an abortion. Still, a . third of Americans back then disapproved of a woman working if she had a . husband to support her. The GSS no longer bothers asking that one. Americans . today are more worried about divorce and the increasing number of . never-married moms. Nearly 4 out of 10 women who gave birth in 2011 were . unmarried, according to the census. 'It's . very sad to me,' says Christine Hicks, 57, of Nashville, Tennessee, who . divorced when her two children were teens. 'It's really hard to be a . parent when you're alone.' Despite . the social turmoil, 98 per cent of married people today say their union . is happy, including two-thirds who are 'very happy.' And marital . fidelity remains an ideal endorsed by nearly all Americans. The . political debate over abortion shows no signs of being resolved, more . than 40 years after Roe vs. Wade. Young people today are somewhat more . conservative on the issue than middle-aged Americans. Gay . marriage, on the other hand, appears headed toward future acceptance. Young people are solidly in favor, while opposition is strongest among . the oldest Americans. Acceptance: Carl Smith, of Las Cruces, New Mexico, holds up a sign in support of same-sex marriage during a rally to celebrate the New Mexico Supreme Court ruling that it was unconstitutional to deny marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples . Through those decades of moral tumult, . the vast majority of Americans held onto belief in God or some higher . power. Fewer than one in 10 say there's no God or no way to know. Yet ties to organized religion are slipping. Since 1972, the number of Americans who name no faith preference has quadrupled to 20 per cent. 'Maybe . it just means people are thinking for themselves and not following . blindly,' says Hicks, a Tennessee state worker and Methodist churchgoer. 'But I do think the church gives families a foundation.' Recession, a stock market crash, runaway . inflation and an oil crisis marred the U.S. economy in the early 1970s. Forty years later, those look like the good times to many. Before . the Great Recession hit in 2007, most people consistently said their . family finances were getting better instead of worse. That's not the . case anymore. Americans are more likely to consider themselves 'lower . class' than ever in GSS history - eight per cent say that. 'You . read every day about ""no more middle class"",' says Bill Hardy, 67, a . Westerville, Ohio, investment adviser. 'It's the poor versus the rich . almost.' Whites are . especially pessimistic about their prospects. Black and Hispanic . optimism surged after Barack Obama became the first black president in . 2008. Overall, about half of Americans still believe their children will have a better standard of living than they do. 'I . just think they're going to have to deal with a lot,' Hardy, who is . white, said of his grown children and three grandkids. 'They'll deal . with it. Kids today are very smart.'","A survey from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that Americans have a pessimistic outlook for the future .

"David Cameron has spoken about the pain of seeing Baroness Thatcher ‘slip away’ as she succumbed to dementia. The Prime Minister said it had been hard for him to see her deteriorate from being at the ‘height of her powers’ to falling victim to the disease. He revealed that every member of the Cabinet signed up yesterday morning to become ‘dementia friends’ – meaning they will receive training in how to deal with patients with the condition. Scroll down for video . David Cameron posed with the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the doorstep of 10 Downing Street in London in 2010 . Mr Cameron said the poor standards of care for thousands of sufferers – uncovered by the Care Quality Commission earlier this week – was ‘unacceptable’. And he revealed he was worried he might develop dementia in later life. Lady Thatcher died last year after long battle against dementia; a fight which was vividly brought to the screen by Meryl Streep in The Iron Lady. Speaking to BBC Radio Oxford, Mr Cameron said: ‘It was very noticeable and obviously having seen her at the height of her powers when I started working for the Conservative Party back in 1988, you see what an effect this has on someone. ‘I'm actually sitting in Number 10 Downing street in what's called the Thatcher Room, named by Gordon Brown, there's a picture of her staring at me from the wall as we speak which is slightly disconcerting. ‘I've seen that with the parents of friends as well - one minute at the height of their powers, brilliant intellect and brains - then suddenly they start to slip away.’ Mr Cameron said no one in his family had ever had dementia, but he had seen it affect friends. ‘Also as a constituency MP, I've had that heart-breaking wander round care homes where you see people who have often been well-looked after but have slipped away into this silent world,’ he said. ‘It's a heart breaking thing to see.’ Former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham spoke on Monday night of his heartbreak of deciding to end visits to his dementia-suffering father while he was in a care home. Mr Cameron said: ‘It makes you desperately sad to see what happens to individuals' lives and families' lives. Listening to Ian Botham last night the whole country would have been moved by what he said. ‘But it was also a wake-up call for me when I had it properly explained to me - it's not just a natural part of ageing, it is a disease like cancer, like strokes, like heart disease.’ He said there should be more research into a cure for dementia, as well as better training in hospitals and the training of thousands more ‘dementia friends’ – volunteers who learn how to cope with sufferers. Mr Cameron said: ‘I've become one myself, I did the training, it's a fascinating thing to do and I'd encourage people to do it. ‘We discussed it at the Cabinet this morning and the whole Cabinet has agreed to become dementia friends. We are going to make sure that happens at a future Cabinet meeting. ‘It’s a fascinating thing to do to put yourselves into the shoes of someone with dementia and work out how best to help them.’ Chancellor George Osborne was pictured crying at the funeral of the former Conservative leader last year . On Monday, the CQC found that almost all dementia sufferers will experience poor care at some point. Nine in 10 care homes and hospitals fail to provide better treatment. The Prime Minister said the findings were ‘not acceptable’ – and said all care home staff should be dementia friends. ‘One of the things that we did with the CQC is to get it to focus on the real sharp end; to get into the hospitals, get into the care homes, and perhaps spend a little less time worrying about every single dentist chair and GP surgery and get into the care homes where people could be suffering or be mistreated. ‘What they found is unacceptable and the practice needs to change - no doubt about it.’ Mr Cameron told a carer who was looking after a relative with dementia that his experience with his son Ivan, who died five years ago after suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, was that carers needed plenty of rest. ‘As someone who looked after a deeply disabled child, you mustn’t be too tough on yourself. The best thing you can do as a carer is make sure you get the breaks, get the space so you can go on being a good carer when you are caring. ‘We’re not angels, luckily some of us are but most of us aren't - so you need to have the space to go on being a carer.’ The Prime Minister said he worried that he may have to cope with dementia himself. ‘Anyone who has seen someone suffering from dementia, you can't help thinking what if that happens to me, what would it be like, how would I react,’ he said. ‘This national debate that's taking place is a good thing because instead of it being a silent crisis, we are all facing up to it and we're thinking more about what we can do to avoid getting dementia, how we’d cope with a relative with dementia, how we can be better with neighbours with dementia.’","PM says he saw the ex Tory leader deteriorate from 'height of her powers'

"A third of homeowners admit to regularly spying on neighbours and half say they peek behind curtains whenever they hear 'goings-on' in their street . One in three homeowners admit they regularly 'spy' on their neighbours, it emerged yesterday. And nearly half say they peek from behind the curtains whenever they hear 'goings-on' in their street. Almost 50 per cent of people surveyed said they could recite the times their neighbours leave and return from work and spot a new car immediately, with a fifth noticing if a stranger visits. Noticing parcels being delivered, if a couple argue more than normal or even when the online shopping comes, were other common aspects people knew about those living close by. But one in ten admit they had been caught peering through the windows by their neighbour. The study of 2,000 adults – commissioned by Yale as part of National Home Security Month – found that the most common reason given for keeping tabs on the neighbours was 'to check they are all right'. For neighbours even the intimacy of a relationship is common knowledge - over a quarter knew a neighbouring couple were having real troubles and one in ten even know a neighbour currently having an affair. Nigel Fisher, from Yale, lead sponsor of National Home Security Month, said: 'This shows just how closely the people who live next to us are watching and the things that don't go unnoticed. 'However, the results show that where people did admit to keeping tabs on a neighbour it was usually with good intentions of making sure everything's alright.' The study also saw a quarter of people confess to spying on the neighbours at least once a week. Scroll down for video . While a third admit they rush to the window if they hear a strange car pull up. A nosy four in ten regularly peer out of the curtains and thirty per cent had looked out of the window of a dark room to watch undetected. Almost half of those surveyed said they could recite the times their neighbours leave and return from work . And 45 per cent said they were very familiar with their neighbours habits and daily routines. While some have even had cause to speculate that a neighbour was pregnant - such was their level of observation, while being au fait with next door's evening trips to clubs or taking the kids to activities was common. 1.

Results showed that four in ten adults have caught their neighbours watching them from a window when they're in the garden, whilst others peek over the fence or listen in on conversations when in earshot. A frustrated 17 per cent have fallen out with their neighbours over their intrusive behaviour, with many admitting their neighbours seem more interested in the lives of others than their own. Almost three in ten troubled homeowners have even confronted the people next door over their nosiness, though many said it made no difference to their snooping habits. In fact, a third of those polled had neighbours that were so nosy it had led them to avoid that person wherever possible. However, just under three quarters of respondents said that they would always raise the alarm and inform the homeowner if they saw something unusual occur on the property.","One in 10 admit they have been caught peering through windows .

"When a beautiful fashion designer embarked on a crazy year of one-night stands, the last person she expected to meet was the man of her dreams. Devastated by the end of a ten-year romance, New Yorker Periel Aschenbrand, 37, picked up men in bars, turned into a bunny boiler when an ill-fated fling with her boss went wrong and had sex with a fireman who couldn't string a sentence together outside the bedroom. Then she got drunk at a cousin's wedding, broke every rule in the dating-for-keeps book and embarked on what she assumed would be nothing more than a dirty weekend. Breaking every rule in the book: Periel Aschenbrand, 37, from New York City, charts every embarrassing detail of her year of one-night-stands in her new memoir, On My Knees . It turned out she'd met her future husband. And today Periel - who looks like Amy Winehouse minus the tattoos - still can't quite believe she hooked Mr Right by doing everything wrong. 'I'm a total believer in one-night stands,' she says, waving her hilarious memoir On My Knees about as she tells the stories she documented during her year of living dangerously. 'Girls today are given all sorts of ridiculous advice on dating. You aren't supposed to sleep with someone until you've had five dates or whatever. It's outdated and contrived. 'I say sleep with anyone you want, when you want. Now I'm not advocating that you go off with a serial killer - you should always text a friend and take photos on your phone of the guy's address - but you should be able to have fun.' Not that Periel's one-night stands were always fun – in fact some were down right sickening. Illegally squatting in her dead grandmother's flat, many of her encounters happened on a pink sofa that her gran had covered in plastic covers to keep clean. 'I'm a total believer in one-night . stands. Girls today are given all sorts of ridiculous advice on dating. . . It's outdated and contrived' But it wasn't so much the squelching sounds from the sofa that grossed her out. It was usually the men. 'There was a bite-your-arm-off ugly Canadian – the hairiest man I have ever encountered,' she says, describing her horror at the fat man she drunkenly dragged home from one bar. 'Steve was covered in coarse, pubic-like hair. He looked like a fat horse. If that wasn't bad enough, he also smelled like a barnyard animal,' she says. When Periel pushed him away, he took off his underpants and started pleasuring himself. Periel ran off to the bathroom in disgust. When she returned, Steve had passed out naked on the floor and was snoring loudly. 'I kicked him awake and threw him out. I thought that encounter was my lowest point. 'But then I decided to really self-destruct – by sleeping with my best male friend Nico, a man who was also technically my boss. 'He owned an advertising agency with offices in News York, London, Paris and Tokyo. He convinced me to do some freelance consulting.' True love: Periel reveals how she met her now-husband, Guy, when she got drunk at a cousin's wedding and embarked on what she assumed would be nothing more than a dirty weekend . They started having sex shortly after Periel's long-time romance ended – and everything instantly went wrong. 'He just wanted to have a good time. I, being in a dark depression, was looking for someone to save me.' Periel says she turned from fun friend-with-benefits to a needy screaming harridan. Nico made it clear that the last thing he wanted to be was to be Periel's boyfriend. But she ignored every warning sign and threw herself into what was a non-existent romance. 'I was pathetic,' she says, explaining how she went 'psycho' for no logical reason when he told her friends were joining them for dinner. 'After reading my book, my mother told me she felt like she needed to wear a burkha to leave the house' Most women would find it hard to admit that sort of behaviour to even their best female friends. The fact that Periel has charted every cough and spit in her new memoir is surprising. 'After reading my book, my mother told me she felt like she needed to wear a burkha to leave the house,' she says. 'My uncle read the sex stuff and he screeched, ""On your grandmother's couch, have you no shame?""' One of the oddest bits of the book is a strangely un-erotic encounter with elderly American author Philip Roth, who fed her cherries as he peered down at her chest. 'My mother had read every single one of his novels, which is probably why I hadn't. It was only after the encounter that I picked up his books and kicked myself for not trying to sleep with him,' she says. But she had no qualms about bedding a trainee fireman, who had a broken ankle. 'He was a kid, maybe 24, with a gold chain and a slick body covered in tattoos,' says Periel. 'We actually slept together a few times but he wasn't the brightest bulb in the pack. 'The sex was good – despite the broken ankle – but we didn't have a lot to say outside the bedroom. Telling all: Periel has charted every cringeworthy detail of her one-night-stands in her new memoir . 'I had a fling with a British guy – and I was dumb struck because I just wanted to listen to his accent. 'He was such a smooth-talker and really courted me. It was hard to take him seriously though, when he gave me compliments, because I was so wrapped up in his voice.' Periel had given up on finding the perfect man when she flew to Israel for a cousin's wedding. 'I wasn't expecting to meet my future husband there,' she says. 'Guy apparently spotted me sitting on the floor drunk with food smeared all over my face. 'I was so out of it I didn't even notice him. But the following day he came to my aunt and uncle's home and it was like boom, an-out-of-body experience. He was the most beautiful man I had ever seen.' But the course of true love hardly ran smoothly. They went to a bar with friends and she was so frustrated that Guy didn't seem interested that she carted another man outside and snogged him for 30 minutes. 'I was wasted. This man in his gold chain and wife beater shirt seemed hot in a cheesy sort of way but outside under the street lights I sobered up and realized how ridiculous it was,' she says. 'I could try and make this sound better than it actually was but if I'm really going to be honest, I had just made out with a character out of a Sasha Baron Cohen skit. 'Upon realizing this dreadful error and having no interest in repeating my ordeal with the masturbating Canadian, I got the hell out of there.' Guy, an internet marketing executive, had disappeared but re-appeared at her cousin's home the next day and invited her to dinner at his apartment. Periel says she expected sex and was stunned when he dished up a home-cooked ten-course meal. But when she finally got him into bed, she says their love making blew her mind. 'I still thought of it as a one-night stand yet I broke all my own rules - I slept the night there with him, rather than disappearing. Then the next day and the next day…' 'I still thought of it as a one-night . stand yet I broke all my own rules - I slept the night there with him, . rather than disappearing. Then the next day and the next day…' Three years ago, they tied the knot and now the couple have just welcomed their first child - a baby boy named Ari. Periel admits that she never expected to meet her future husband while doing her best to sleep with him. 'I had no expectations when I met Guy, so I just acted like myself,' she says. 'Everything you ever read about the rules of a first date – don't get drunk, don't sleep with someone immediately – went out of the window.' Periel became an accidental feminist clothes designer during President George Bush's White House years when she walked into a Los Angeles boutique wearing a T-shirt she'd designed saying 'The only bush I trust is my own.' The shop owner asked her to print more and her business Body As Billboard took off. T-shirts bearing the words 'Marriage is so gay' and 'Does date rape mean I also get dinner?' became massive hits. Today she's the creative designer of an online boutique called House of Exposure and to promote her memoir she'd had bags made up carrying the words: 'Can a book be better than a blow job?' It is a question she's not sure she can answer but she has certainly given two fingers to all the dating advocates who advise being cautious when it comes to casual sex. 'I found my future husband during a drunken one-night stand. And if I can do it, so can anyone else,' she adds defiantly. On My Knees by Periel Aschenbrand is published by Harper Perennial.

"A 35-year-old Utah high school teacher accused of having sex with a 16-year-old student is now facing allegations of sleeping with a second teenager. Brianne Altice's September trial for three counts of rape and one of forcible sodomy has been delayed after prosecutors laid a further charge of each, claiming she also slept with a 17-year-old. A court heard in June how the former teacher claimed she was the victim because the first boy 'wore down her defenses' and her lawyer's request to throw out the charges was dismissed. Scroll down for video... Brianne Altice, 34, says she is the victim and was seduced by a 16-year-old student. She has pleaded not guilty to rape charges . Altice sobbed as she left court after a judge set a trial for September . According to KSL, the charges show Altice held a position of 'special trust' with both minors. Her lawyers claimed the 16-year-old admitted he set out . to have sex with Altice and that it was therefore legally consensual. It . is illegal in Utah for a teacher or anyone in a position of power to . have sex with a person under 18. 'She . repeatedly refused and declined his advances until he ultimately broke . down her resistance,' defense lawyer Edward Brass claimed, according to . the Salt Lake Tribune. 'The state failed to establish probable cause to believe that the intercourse that occurred was without consent.' However, Judge John R. Morris threw out the motion - saying that there was probably cause they try Altice. He set a September trial date. The statuesque blonde former English teacher at Davis High School in heavily Mormon Kaysville, Utah, sobbed as she left court with her family. The 16-year-old boy told investigators in last November that he had had sex with Altice on three occasions in 2013 and testified to that fact at a preliminary hearing in February. According to the Standard-Examiner the teen said in the preliminary hearing that he was upset because his family had moved to Utah from another state. He said he was having problems and home and doing drugs and that he would skip class to hang out with Altice. Fighting it: Altice pleaded not guilty to three felony counts of raping the 16-year-old. But the boy told police they had sex multiple times in 2013 before her October arrest and that their first sexual encounter was in a church parking lot . Poised: The 34-year-old Utah woman no longer teaches at the school. Her husband filed for divorce in November shortly after her arrest . Soon a sexual relationship began after an initial encounter in a church parking lot, he said. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. Altice's husband filed for divorce shortly after his wife's arrest. It was finalized in December. 'The defendant occupied a position of special trust in relation' to the juvenile, prosecutors wrote. Altice was originally arrested in . October. Altice was believed to have had sex with a 16-year-old on many . occasions, including at her South Weber home and at a park in addition . to the church parking lot, a Davis County Jail report states. Altice was only hired by the high school last August, but had previously worked for other schools in the district since 2004. ‘Anytime . a story surfaces like this ... I think it all causes us concern because . these are members of the community that are held to a higher standard,’ district spokesman Chris Williams told Deseret News.

"It seems that risking his life as he crosses the Chicago skyline 50 stories in the air isn't enough for daredevil Nik Wallenda, as the tightrope walker has revealed he will complete the feat blindfolded. Wallenda broke the news this morning while appearing on Today,  shocking Matt Lauer when he made his big announcement. 'Why?' asked the morning show host. Scroll down for videos . Big announcement: Tightrope walker Nik Wallenda has revealed he will cross the Chicago River 50 stories in the air while blindfolded . Dizzying heights: Wallenda will begin at the Marina City West tower and walk a wire strung at an uphill 15-degree angle across the Chicago River to the Leo Burnett Building (seen above) 'It’s about challenging myself and through challenging myself, inspiring other people,' Wallenda told Lauer. 'I’ll not only need incredible physical strength to complete this walk, but laser-focued concentration,' he added. The daredevil performer first revealed the plan for his latest feat in an interview with Outside, and it is not for the faint of heart. He said he will begin at the Marina City West tower and walk a wire strung at an uphill 15-degree angle across the Chicago River to the Leo Burnett Building. And's that's not all. Thrill of the chase: Wallenda is seen above crossing the Grand Canyon, over 1,000 feet in the air . Then he'll come down to ground level, walk back to Marina City West, and cross another wire to the Marina City East tower. It is all set to go down on November 2, and, of course, will air as a live-TV special on Discovery. This setting is shockingly urban for the tightrope walker, whose last two nerve-racking feats involved him crossing the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. The city also presents challenges that seem to make Wallenda a bit nervous. 'It’s gonna be cold. It’s gonna be windy,' he said. 'That’s the challenge. The other walks were enjoyable, peaceful.' Seeing as those previous two 'peaceful' walks took place 1,400 feet in the air, it is safe to say the performer has a far different definition of the word than most. Wallenda will be untethered for the walk, which he prefers. He was tethered for the Niagara Falls walk, but was not for his performance in the Grand Canyon, meaning that any slip would be fatal. Seven members of his family have fallen to their death, most recently Nik’s great-grandfather Karl during a 1978 walk in Puerto Rico. That fear of possible death is what brings in the audiences however, says Wallenda. 'The public is fascinated with a guy on TV that could die at any second.' He quickly added, 'Now, do they wanna see me die? I don’t think so.'

"The widow of a cop who was shot dead while on duty today hit out at a college's decision to let his killer perform a graduation speech, branding it 'despicable'. Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is serving life in prison for gunning down officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981, has been selected as a speaker at his alma mater: Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont. The liberal arts college, which has around 600 students, plans to play the 60-year-old convict's recorded remarks alongside a video about him at a commencement on Sunday. Angry: Maureen Faulkner (left), whose police officer husband Daniel was shot dead by Mumia Abu-Jamal (right) in 1981, today hit out at Goodard College's decision to let  the convicted killer perform a graduation speech . But today, Mr Faulkner's wife, Maureen, said the students' selection of graduation speaker was 'inappropriate' and should be reversed. She told Fox News: 'It’s not appropriate. His freedom was taken away when he murdered a police officer in the line of duty.' 'It seems like our justice system allows murderers to continue to have a voice over the public airwaves and at college commencement. It’s despicable.' Abu-Jamal, born Wesley Cook, was originally sentenced to death after killing 25-year-old Mr Faulkner, from Philadelphia, during an early morning traffic stop on December 9, 1981. Victim: Abu-Jamal was originally sentenced to death after killing 25-year-old Mr Faulkner (above). But his sentence was later reduced to life without parole . However, his sentence was later reduced to life in prison without parole. In 1996, he received a bachelor of arts degree from Goddard College through a correspondence program. The commencement on Sunday will be the third one at which Abu-Jamal has spoken, with the killer having previously appeared at Washington's Evergreen State College and Ohio's Antioch College. 'How can this go in our country?' said Mrs Faulkner. 'People need to start realizing that there’s right and wrong in this world. It seems like no one thinks about that.' Despite Mrs Faulkner's comments, Goodard College's interim president Bob Kenny has defended Abu-Jamal's upcoming appearance at the school. On the college's website, he said the decision reflects students' 'freedom to engage and think radically and critically in a world that often sets up barriers to do just that.' However, the Vermont Troopers' Association said in a statement that including Abu-Jamal in the ceremony shows 'an absolute disregard' for Faulkner's family. 'While our nation is searching for solutions to gun violence in our schools and communities, we are outraged that Goddard College is hosting a man who shot and killed a police officer,' it said. Pennsylvania Corrections Secretary John Wetzel added that he is 'disdainful' of the college's decision to choose Abu-Jamal, who is housed at the Mahanoy state prison in Frackville. 'Police officers put their lives on the line every day to protect society and now we have a college allowing an individual convicted of murdering a police officer to share his opinions with impressionable students. This fact is very troubling,' he said. College: The commencement at Goddard College (pictured) on Sunday will be the third one at which Abu-Jamal has spoken. He has previously done so at Washington's Evergreen State College and Ohio's Antioch College . Imprisoned for life: In 1996, Abu-Jamal (pictured) received a bachelor of arts degree from Goddard College . He continued: 'Inmates do have a constitutional right to access telephones. While we do not support or endorse this specific type of activity, we cannot prohibit it from happening.' Goddard College holds 20 commencement ceremonies every year, so students in each degree program can individualize their graduations and choose their speaker. Undergraduates design their own curriculums with faculty advisers and do not take tests or receive grades, said college spokesman Dustin Byerly. The students who chose Abu-Jamal as a speaker are receiving bachelor of arts or fine arts degrees. Widow: An emotional Mrs Faulkner said. 'People need to start realizing there’s right and wrong in this world' Twenty of the 23 students are expected to attend the ceremony. Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panther Party, claims he has been victimized by a racist justice system in the wake of the killing. He has since attracted international support, with books, documentaries and radio shows helping publicize his case.","Mumia Abu-Jamal, 60, serving life in prison for shooting cop Daniel Faulkner .

"Those clever marketing guys at Ikea have stepped things up a level with this year's Halloween advert. Late night shopping may never be the same again after you watch Ikea’s homage to Stanley Kubrick’s horror classic, The Shining. The clip begins with a view from behind of a boy on a tricycle - mirroring when Danny begins his ferocious hallway pedal scene. The young boy sets off on his tricycle journey in IKEA's latest video . He cycles past a couple of skeletons enjoying some dinner in a kitchen . The boys continues to motor his way through what looks like a deserted warehouse . What follows is the youngster taking us on a journey through what appears an abandoned warehouse. In reality it is Ikea's Singapore store. Cycling past one unit, the Halloween theme is all to evident as two skeletons sit in a kitchen. Twisting and turning past sofas, beds and high-end tables, while keeping the speed up, the boy turns the corner only to be met by two not-so little girls dressed in blue who ask him to 'come play.' The one on the right seems at this point a man wearing a dress. Danny is then met by 'two little girls' who block his path . They say to the boy that they want to play . Danny is now scared and his journey has come to an abrupt halt . 'Come play with us Danny,' say the pair in unison as the boy begins to cover his eyes and recoil in fear. Then peeking through the gaps in his fingers, things turn to normality. 'Come play with us Danny, come on',say a now more appropriately dressed couple extending their hands out. He uses his hands to cover his face in fright - but can't resist peering through the gaps in his fingers . But instead of 'two little girls' he is met by his parents, who tell him that they have to go . And all is right with the world, as Danny realises it was all just a bad dream . The boy smiles, showing huge relief and runs towards his parents as they say 'let's go.' It's not the first time the Swedish company have done their own parody video. Back in September Ikea one-upped the competition with the announcement of their 2015 catalogue aka 'bookbook' - a play on Apple's MacBook. The scene from Stanley Kubrick's hit film The Shining, of Danny cycling through the hallway. The film was an adaptation of Stephen King's novel. 'The interface is 7.5 x 8 inches. But can expand to 15 x 8 inches,' the narrator explains . This parody video was particularly timely as Apple was gearing up to launch the new iPhone with what was a hyperbolic and exquisitely designed ad campaign. 'Once in awhile, something comes along that changes the way we live,' the advertisement began. 'A device so simple and intuitive, using it feels almost familiar. 'Introducing the 2015 Ikea catalogue.' The advert demonstrates the 'bookbook's' unique ability to expand its interface - simply by opening it . The entire advert is narrated by Jorgen Eghammer, dubbed the Chief Design Guru . 'The first thing to note is no cables - not even a power cable,' Jurgen continues. 'Not even a power cable. The 2015 Ikea catalogue comes fully charged and the battery life is eternal.' Thoughts will now be turning to their Christmas offering, and what tricks they have up their Swedish sleeves next. Oh, and Ikea is open until 11pm daily during the Halloween season - the point of the spoof video.","Boy cycles furiously through what appears to be deserted warehouse .

Screeners will need to get so close they even take the possible patient's temperature. Paramedics will be paid $20 per hour, but The New York Post notes that EMTs will only earn $19 per hour. Washington Dulles, Newark Liberty, Chicago O'Hare, and Hartsfied-Jackson Atlanta international airports are all hiring screening staff. Facebook user Jaclyn Namer was cautious about the job in a comment under the posting. 'Wow, that's really scary...Be safe everybody' she wrote. Others were less worried. 'I can help on weekends in Chicago,' wrote one Jeremy Voris on the same thread.

Screeners will use no-touch thermometers to try to find passengers with fevers. Washington Dulles, Newark Liberty, Chicago O'Hare, and Hartsfied-Jackson Atlanta international airports are all hiring screening staff . Using infrared temperature guns, staff are checking for elevated temperatures among passengers whose journeys began or included a stop in one of the three African countries. Customs officials reported about 150 people travel daily from or through Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea to the U.S. Nearly 95 per cent of these travelers land first at one of those five airports. Those countries have seen most of the deaths from the outbreak, which has claimed more than 4,000 lives. However Republican Representative Tim Murphy said today during a congressional hearing on Ebola that the screening processes are flawed because people can mask symptoms with Ibuprofen or simply avoid the airports which have installed screenings. The screenings are being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP), under direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Customs officials reported about 150 people travel daily from or through Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea to the U.S. CBP staff will identify passengers to screen by looking at trip information and checking passports.

No passenger was found to have a fever but five were sent for further evaluation. Ebola patient Thomas Duncan landed in Dallas on September 20 after traveling from his home in Monrovia, Liberia. He also traveled through Brussels Airport in Belgium and Washington-Dulles. The 42-year-old Liberian national was not contagious while he traveled.

"Travellers appear to be warming up to Ryanair’s effort to revamp its image as the airline announced Thursday that it is expecting more passengers and higher profits than originally forecast this fiscal year. Europe’s largest budget airline has long been criticised for its surcharges and customer service, but it has softened its stance on baggage charges and booking conditions and introduced allocated seating and a new business class service in a bid to win over passengers. Michael O’Leary, the controversial chief executive of the Dublin-based airline, informed shareholders Thursday that Ryanair now expects to fly 87 million customers in the year to 31 March, an increase of one million from the previous forecast. Ryanair now expects to fly 87 million customers in the year to 31 March, a million more than originally forecast . Mr O’Leary, who revealed that he is nearing a deal to remain chief executive for another five years, also raised the no-frills airline’s full year net profit towards the upper end of its previously guided range of £484m to £507m. He said in a statement: ‘Our customers and shareholders have responded favourably to our improving customer experience, our better digital platform and the positive initial uptake of our Business Plus Service.’ He said the airline expects ‘slightly stronger traffic growth’ this winter with new bases in primary airports in Cologne, Gdansk, Glasgow and Warsaw (Modlin). Ryanair has also announced plans to increase its flight frequencies and schedules from Dublin to UK cities and European capitals. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary says customers have 'responded favourably' to its initiatives . But Mr O'Leary warned there was still uncertainty over the full-year performance due to little visibility on fare yields in the October to March period. Ryanair's post-tax profits were 8 per cent lower at £408m in the year to 31 March after a price war left average fares 4 per cent lower at a time of rising fuel costs. After announcing a deal with Spain’s Amadeus on Wednesday, Mr O’Leary suggested that Ryanair and other budget carriers could become feeder airlines for legacy airlines such as Lufthansa in the future. Ryanair's CEO says low-cost airlines could become feeder airlines for legacy airlines such as Lufthansa . He believes low-cost airlines could fill in the gap as legacy airlines increasingly focus on long-haul routes amid competition from rival Gulf airlines such as Etihad and Emirates . Earlier this month, Ryanair announced that it has agreed to purchase up to 200 new Boeing 737 Max 200 passenger jets in a deal worth as much as £22bn.

'The A and E department was very busy and I waited another hour after the X-Rays were taken, before another doctor came and said they were clear and I was just badly bruised.' It was 1 am when she was given the news and she was kept in spending the night on the clinical decisions ward (CDU). She said: 'The next morning I was seen by a physiotherapist because I was still struggling to walk. I was then discharged without seeing another doctor or any further follow up.' After she was allowed home the pain continued and she fell in her bathroom.. As a result she was bed bound by severe pain in her upper back and hips and was unable to use the crutches the hospital had loaned her. Rotherham Hospital said it was 'sorry' to hear Ms Connell was 'unhappy' and was investigating her complaint . Ms Connell added: 'I became hysterical because the pain was so bad and it was in a house full of kids who were wondering what was happening.' Husband Glynn called for an ambulance and she had to be carried out on a stretcher to return to the hospital that had discharged her 24 hours earlier. Another doctor examined her X-Rays after she was admitted and said there had been some damage to her upper back but said she was fit enough to return home with painkillers. However, Ms Connell, still wracked with pain, refused to leave the hospital and staff reluctantly admitted her onto a ward. She said: 'The next morning an orthopaedic surgeon looked at the same X-Rays and told me I had two quite bad breaks in my back. 'He said: 'yes you have done a pretty good job at it as well' as if to say 'I can't believe you've done that on a children's slide'.' A CT scan also revealed a slight change from the earlier X-Rays because the broken bones had crushed into her spinal canal and an operation was needed. Ms Connell said: 'I'm angry and disgusted that that it was overlooked on X-Ray. I shudder at the thought if I didn't go back to hospital I could still be at home suffering and ended up with permanent nerve damage.' A hospital spokesman said: 'We are very sorry to hear that Mrs Connell is unhappy about the treatment she received at Rotherham Hospital. 'The Trust takes issues such as these very seriously. The Trust's patient experience team is working with Mrs Connell to investigate this matter.' Andy Lee, Urban Green Spaces manager for Rotherham Council said he was sorry to hear about the accident but said both the slide and safety surface conform to British and European safety standards.","Toni Connell was rushed to hospital after  crashing off end of a 30-foot slide .

"The killer who bashed a seven-month-old baby to death has finally been deported from Australia to Papua New Guinea, more than two months after he was granted parole. It was a condition of his parole that Christopher Hoerler, a PNG national, would be released from prison straight into the custody of Immigration officials and immediately deported. However, Hoerler remained in the country after his August 14 prison release and the distressed family of his victim, baby Jordan Anderson-Smith, have been desperately trying to locate the criminal. Hoerler's visa, allowing him to stay in Australia, was cancelled in 2011. Christopher Hoerler has been deported to Papua New Guinea, more than two months after he was released from prison on August 14 for the brutal murder of baby Jordan. It was a condition of his parole that he would be immediately deported . A photo of baby Jordan Anderson, taken shortly before his death. Christopher Hoerler tortured the seven-month-old to death in Wagga Wagga on February 25, 2000.  The Crown prosecutor found that Jordan died from multiple injuries, including bruises and abrasions to his face, a torn lip, liver and bowel damage and crushed toes - which were inflicted when Hoerler put his then-girlfriend's son's toes in a clamp. The Immigration Department confirm Hoerler was deported on Monday, according to the Daily Advertiser. 'Once released on parole, the individual was detained as an unlawful non-citizen,' immigration minister Scott Morrison told The Daily Advertiser. 'Mr Hoerler was removed from Australia this week.' After years of distress, the news is a small comfort for Jordan's father and his family. 'I don't think there'll ever be closure but it's a relief,' Jordan's uncle Darcy Smith told The Daily Advertiser. Baby Jordan was tortured and killed after a party at his mother's home in Wagga Wagga, NSW on February 25, 2000. At the time of Jordan's murder, Hoerler was in a relationship with Jordan's mother, Louise Anderson. They lived together with Jordan and Jordan's two half-brothers, who were aged 2 and 4. Hoerler was tried for murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter 20 months after Jordan was killed. The 37-year-old ex-boxer was sentenced to 14 years and four months in Sydney's Long Bay prison, after prosecutors appealed the initial term of 11 years. His sentence was due to expire in February 2016 but the State Parole Authority granted parole this year, citing Hoerler's good prison performance. Cecil Smith (left), the father of the late baby Jordan, pictured leaving court in 2003 with his brother, Darcy Smith (right), who is acting as the family's spokesman. Darcy Smith is appealing to the Minister for Immigration, Scott Morrison to ensure Jordan's murderer, Christopher Hoerler, is deported when he is released from prison next week on August 14, 2014. 'The Smith family are extremely disappointed in the decision the parole board has made to release this convicted child killer back into the community,' Jordan's father Cecil Smith wrote at the time. Hoerler and Ms Anderson had been smoking cannabis and drinking at their home before Jordan's horrific, brutal death. Jordan choked on his own vomit after being beaten and tortured by Hoerler, with injuries including a lacerated liver, a torn lip, facial abrasions and broken ribs. Jordan's toes had  been crushed by a clamp and his teeth went through the roof of his mouth. The forensic pathologist who conducted the post mortem found that the baby's 'palate injury was caused by a blow to the jaw, and the abdominal injury by a non-penetrating blow or blows of considerable force'. Jordan's injuries were so extensive that they took four days to document. Jordan's father had contacted the Department of Community Services when he believed Hoerler was showering with Jordan. Jordan would have turned 15 on July 24 this year. Jordan's mother, Louise Anderson, is pictured leaving her baby's murder trial in 2003. Christopher Hoerler was found guilty of brutally murdering seven-month-old, Jordan Anderson-Smith. Hoerler was Mrs Anderson's live-in boyfriend at the time of the murder. The family was not convinced that Hoerler would be immediately deported so launched an online petition in July, calling on immigration minister Scott Morrison to give assurance that Hoerler would be immediately deported. The Smiths feared Hoerler would appeal the deportation condition of his release because he has biological children living in Australia and could claim that he wanted to be a father to them, Fairfax newspapers said. 'He is trying to pull a rabbit out of the hat to stay in the country,' Darcy Smith said on behalf of the family. 'I hope the minister is smart enough to see through that.' Previously, Mr Smith has spoken of the family's intense and unrelenting grief. 'We are the ones living with the life sentence. We have to live without Jordan every day.' They explained that their mother, Jordan's paternal grandmother, visits Jordan's grave every Sunday. The Smith family have previously explained that Hoerler had moved into the home only three weeks before he murdered Jordan. Hoerler met Ms Anderson on New Year's Eve in 1999, but by less than two months later, on February 25, 2000, he killed her son. The baby's father had attended school with Hoeler and once considered him a friend. The Smith family have thanked the Wagga Wagga community for their ongoing care and support.

"Rachel Kenehan, 35, from London, arrives at Winchester Crown Court where she is on trial alongside three others who are charged with murder and conspiracy to supply . A PhD student who studied criminology used her in-depth knowledge of crime to help her boyfriend run a heroin and crack cocaine ring, months before he and his friends murdered a rival, a court has heard. Rachel Kenehan, 35, of Hewlett Road, London, was in a relationship with one of the men accused of shooting Jahmel Jones in the head in Southampton in 2012. She met her boyfriend Pierre Lewis through a prison mentoring scheme, Winchester Crown Court heard. Kenehan, who also has a Masters degree in sociology, was charged with conspiracy to supply class A drugs, assisting an offender and perverting the course of justice. She was said to have used her academic career at London School of Economics to assist Lewis and his friends deal drugs. Kenehan's boyfriend, Pierre Lewis, 20, and his friends Jemmikai Orlebar-Forbes, 22 and Isaac Boateng, 22 are accused of the murder of Jahmel Jones, 23, also known as Lucky, after he was shot in the head in Southampton in 2012. The jury heard Kenehan had 'an in-depth knowledge of criminal behavior and the frailty of human nature' that she had gained from the studies that she used to aid the crimes. According to prosecutor Ian Lawrie QC she played a 'robust, direct and calculating role' in the conspiracy to supply heroin and crack cocaine, spending thousands hiring cars and making trips on the M3 between London and Southampton. Sometimes she would cover hundreds of miles in a day in her alleged attempts to aid the drug ring that spanned a length of the country. Other times, one hire car would be dropped off and another one picked up ten minutes later, and these cars were frequently caught by speed cameras. Every time one of the cars was caught, Kenehan would take the blame, but the pictures showed a black man was behind the wheel. Kenehan and Lewis met when she was volunteering for a charity that put young men with mentors to stop them from breaking the law, and they soon developed a relationship. Lawrie said: 'How is it that this young lady, with all her ability and intelligence, gets involved in class A drugs? 'It’s a short stop beyond that to assist the man she’s in a relationship with. 'rather ironically, because of her qualifications, she had an in-depth . knowledge of crime, and that it was up to the jury to decide whether she . was someone with a “misplaced attachment” or whether she had been . actively involved.' Mr Lawrie said the defendants had no family and no fixed address in Southampton but would often stay homes of drug users. One of the flats they used was in a block called Graham House in St Mary Street, Southampton, also used by Jones. The jury heard that shortly . before his death, Jones and the defendants were spotted several . times on CCTV cameras walking up and down St Mary Street. Jahmel Jones, 20, was shot in the head in Southampton in 2012 . Jones . ended up asking one of his customers for help and telling them he was . in some sort of trouble. Jones and the customer entered flat four in Graham house where . Orlebar-Forbes allegedly raised his arm, with a revolver in his hand, and fired . two shots. One hit Mr Jones in the head and the other in the right arm, causing him to fall to the floor, and Lewis's palm print was later found on a wall above where Jones had collapsed. The court heard that the . defendants were then seen leaving the building through a back door before . briefly returning to collect their belongings from a friend's home and by 11.31am they were in a taxi to . another friend's home in Basingstoke where they were later picked up by . Kenehan. Orlebar-Forbes was seen rubbing the . taxi's sun visor and rear doors with his sleeve, before they all . changed their phone numbers later that day. Mr Lawrie said there had been regular contact between Lewis and Kenehan which 'spurred her to go to Basingstoke to rescue them, and that according to texts between Lewis and Kenehan that day, she must have known what  happened that morning. One text from Kenehan to Lewis said: 'Do not disappear, that will look weird. I want your baby.' Another said: 'Promise we can get through this. Be smart, act normal. We'll talk. I wish you had got your passport.' And a third message talked about them sunning themselves, semi-naked in Brazil. Mr . Lawrie said: 'This behaviour and these actions are an echo of her . desire for the man she presumably loves as she wants his baby. 'The allegation we make is that she is clearly assisting all three defendants.' Kenehan denies all charges, while Lewis, of Castlenau, Barnes, London, Orlebar-Forbes, of Cloudesdale . Road, London, and Boateng, of Mill Farm Crescent, Hounslow, London, all . deny murder but have pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to . supply heroin and crack cocaine. The trial continues.

"Hikers in Sierra Nevada are being told to stop taking selfies with the wild bears. The worrying and very real trend has seen visitors to South Lake Tahoe, California, put themselves at risk to get a share-able snap of themselves with a bear in the background. Hikers have got as close as a few feet away from the wild bears, and officials have now been forced to send out an official warning. High-risk profile pic: Officials in South Lake Tahoe report 'mobs' of tourists risking their lives by approaching the bears in order to take a selfie as they fish for salmon in Taylor Creek . The U.S. Forest Service at Taylor Creek Visitor Center in South Lake Tahoe say visitors are risking their lives in the hunt for a unique profile picture by approaching the bears. ‘We've had mobs of people that are actually rushing toward the bears trying to get a “selfie” photo,’ Lisa Herron, spokesperson for the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit told Reno Gazette-Journal. ‘We are telling people they need to stay on the trails and they need to stay away from the bears. ‘If a bear has a mind to it can run very fast.’ 'But first, let me take a selfie': Hikers have got as close as a few feet  from the wild bears at Taylor Creek, who flock to the waters for the annual kokanee salmon run on the south shore of Lake Tahoe . Although bear attacks are rare, the risk of one taking place unsurprisingly increases if the animals are provoked by the presence of humans. In particular, female bears with cubs will charge if they perceive a threat on their cubs. However, for the tourists at Taylor Creek, where the annual kokanee salmon ruin attracts many hungry bears, it seems nothing is too much for a risk for the right Instagram brag. A recent visitor at the site said she saw dozens of people taking selfies with the bears, who were unafraid of the group. ‘There were like 30 people taking pictures of themselves with the bears,’ Manutsawee Buapet told ABC News. ‘They weren’t scared at all of the people and one bear cub came as close as two feet to the tourists.’","Tourists in Sierra Nevada told to stop posing with the bears .

"A disabled pensioner claims is facing a parking bill of up to £1,500 because he displayed his blue badge upside down. John O’Callaghan, 66, had parked his Ford Focus on a street while he visited a friend at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, returning to find an £80 ticket because his disability badge was not correctly displayed. As he did not have enough money to pay the fine, a bailiff company acting on behalf of the city's council is demanding he pay £422 - or risk having his possessions confiscated. Pensioner: John O’Callaghan, 66, claims he is facing a parking bill of up to £1,500 because he displayed his blue badge upside down while parked on a street in Liverpool . The retired factory worker, from Speke claims he has been told the final bill could rise to £1,500 if he does not pay. Mr O’Callaghan, who suffers from a heart condition and uses a walking stick, said: 'They are threatening to come round to my flat and clamp my car. 'I parked and left my badge the wrong way up, it was an honest mistake. 'I told them I couldn’t pay £80 in one go so asked if I could do it over two months but the council wanted it straight away. 'Now I’ve had a letter saying it’s gone up to £422 or they will send the bailiffs round. I think these are bully-boy tactics. 'And they are threatening it could go up to £1,500.

He added: 'They want me to pay an absolute fortune and it’s frightening the living daylights out of me.' Liverpool council has defended its position and says there will always be 'additional charges' when bailiffs are called in. A spokesman said: 'Before bailiffs get involved there are opportunities to appeal against the notice, several reminder letters are sent out and we would ask people not to ignore these letters. 'If anybody has difficulty in paying the penalty charge notice, they should contact us to make arrangements about paying. 'We also require a county court order before the matter is sent to the bailiffs and there would have been further opportunities for people to state their case. 'If bailiffs do become involved there will be additional charges so it is important that they get in touch with us at an early stage.'","John O'Callaghan, 66, parked on the street while visiting friend in hospital .

"A woman has created a unique family album by photoshopping herself into snapshots from her mother's childhood, in order to imagine the kind of friendship that the two might have shared growing up. Danielle Delph, an art director from Portland, Oregon, managed to seamlessly merge a series of images of herself as a child with older snapshots of her mother in order to create the heartwarming collection of photos, titled If I Had Known My Mother Back Then. 'I've always wondered if my mom and I would have been friends had we grown up together,' Danielle wrote on her website. Then and now: Danielle (left) wanted to imagine a friendship between her mother and herself . Peas in a pod: In many of the images, it's almost impossible to tell which person is which . Friends forever: Danielle (right) and her mother are as close now as they would have been back then . 'Would we be in the same classes? Would we have the same sense of humor? Would people tell us we were inseparable? 'After seeing myself in her childhood photos, I'm pretty sure we would have been great friends.' The images show the pair 'posing' together at various stages of their lives, from early childhood right up until what appears to be their teenage years. In one of the snaps, Danielle has edited herself into an image so it seems she is posing alongside her mother before a night out, with both women sporting smart dresses and glamorous make-up looks. In another, the pair can be seen as young children wearing costumes, perhaps in preparation for Halloween. Danielle revealed to MailOnline that the whole process to six months to complete. 'It took about six months; harassing my mother to send me every old photo of her life was tricky because we had lost the majority of both our childhood photos when Hurricane Ivan destroyed our home in Pensacola, Florida,' the 25-year-old said. 'So I had a limited amount of photos to work with. 'I'm pretty sure we would have been great friends': Writing on her website, Danielle confessed that she thinks the pair would have bonded . Charmed: In this image, Danielle (left) is actually wearing her mother's charm bracelet . 'I scanned all the images where we were the closest in age, and hunted through my Facebook photo albums to find childhood photos of myself. From there, I tried different juxtapositions in Photoshop trying to tell the story of two little girls growing up together. 'I'm really happy with how the project turned out. I was surprised at how natural the interactions were considering I was working with images of two little girls born a generation apart.' In addition to posting the images on her site, Danielle also took the opportunity to pay tribute to her mother, writing: 'Thanks Mom for being the same friend to me now, that you would have been then.' Danielle confessed that she gave her mother little warning about the project and asked her to send the childhood snaps without knowing what they would be used for. Unsurprisingly however, her mom was thrilled with the outcome. Friendly fun: Danielle managed to seamlessly merge herself into many of the images . '[My mom] is miles away so I didn't get to see her reaction in person, but she tells me it's just so special,' Danielle added. 'She looks at the site everyday - well now she calls it our site - and it makes her cry. 'She made an interesting comment about how it feels really deja vu, which is strange, almost as if now when she thinks back on those moments from her childhood I was actually there.' In many of the images, it's almost impossible to separate Danielle from her mother thanks to the art director's seamless editing process. And in the final photo shared by Danielle, a recent picture of herself with her mother, it's clear to see that the pair still bear an uncanny resemblance to one another, despite being separated in age.","Danielle Delph, 25, wanted to imagine a childhood friendship with her mom .

"A hunter has been mauled by an enormous black bear after shooting it with a bow and arrow in Minnesota. The man, who has not been named, was hunting in dense woodland near Duxbury with a group of friends on Friday night when he fired at the 525lb animal . Fearing the bear's meat would spoil in the evening heat, the group then waited four hours before using its blood trail to track it several miles in the darkness. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Fellow hunter Craig Lindstrom, from Wyoming, said: 'I heard him screaming - felt like 10 minutes, but was probably two minutes - literally screaming, and you knew he was being mauled. 'He made that thing die because he stabbed it about 20 times while it was chewing on his arm. He kept stabbing it  and it was pounding on him, a quarter of a ton - a 525 pound bear pounding on him.'

"As Brits abroad, our reputation often precedes us. However, according to a new research, that's not necessarily a bad thing any more. British holidaymakers are more polite, better behaved and more generous than they were three years ago, claims a survey of 500 hotel workers from across the world. Tipping, general behaviour and politeness emerged as the most improved factors in holidaymakers' attitudes. Best behaviour: British holidaymakers are more polite, better behaved and more generous than they were . The survey also found 21 per cent of staff thought the Dutch the most pleasant to deal with on holiday.

Those taking part in the Sunshine.co.uk survey were asked to  compare their interactions and opinions of UK tourists today to their experiences from three years ago. More than half of hotel staff (65 per cent) found that Britons were more generous with their tips - although 18 per cent said they were less generous than in 2011, whilst 17 per cent did not see any change.

"A father has won his fight for a review into a decision by prosecutors not to charge doctors who allegedly failed to spot his son was dying 25 years ago. Robbie Powell, ten, of Ystradgynlais, Powys, was seen by five different doctors from December 1989 before he died from the rare Addison’s disease in April 1990. His father William, 56, has fought for justice after police found the doctors could face up to 35 charges including manslaughter and forging medical documents. Father and son: Father William Powell (left), 56, has fought for justice for his son Robbie (right), ten, of Ystradgynlais, Powys, who was seen by five different doctors before he died of the rare Addison’s disease . The Crown Prosecution Service refused to prosecute the doctors because the case was so old, but Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders has now ordered a review into the decision. Mr Powell said: ‘If the doctors had admitted their mistakes at the time we would have been able to move on. Battle: Mr Powell is pictured with his legal paperwork . ‘This has taken over my life and it has taken a toll on my other children and on my marriage to my wife. I won’t feel this is over until we have some justice for Robbie.’ Robbie died 24 years ago  of the rare illness which stops the adrenal glands on top of the kidneys producing vital hormones. More than 8,000 people in Britain have the disease - most commonly found in those aged from 30 to 50. Six years later the NHS accepted there was negligence during Robbie’s treatment at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Mr Powell said: ‘The CPS said in 2003 that they weren’t willing to go ahead with prosecutions because of how much time had gone by. ‘But the Director of Public Prosecutions has said that whether it’s 30 days or 30 years, if there’s enough evidence the perpetrators will be prosecuted. It has given me hope.’ The Crown Prosecution Service said they will start the review procedure by taking a new statement from Mr Powell. A spokesman said: ‘The DPP has written to Mr Powell to confirm we will relook at the material in the case relating to the death of his son.

"Jailed: Dawn Barr has been sentenced to nine years in prison after she stabbed the father of four of her children to death . A mother-of-six who stabbed the 'devoted' father of their children to death during a blazing row after she left him for another man has been jailed for nine years. Darren Orrett, 32, had moved out of the family home in Cheadle, Greater Manchester, he shared with care assistant Dawn Barr, 42, after she told him she had started a new relationship with lover Robert Joyce. Manchester Crown Court heard Mr Orrett, a window fitter, was 'very upset' by the break up of the 12-year relationship and felt Joyce had 'ruined his life'. Alan Conrad QC, prosecuting, said he . took it particularly hard because three of the four children he had with . Barr suffered from cystic fibrosis and he was dedicated to the special . care they needed. On . November 15 last year, he returned to the house after one of his . daughters called and posted messages on Facebook messages saying she missed . him. Alan Conrad QC prosecuting said: 'Darren continued to . attend at the house - whether to see the children or to try against the . odds to win back the defendant. But it is plain that the defendant did . not welcome these visits. 'So too Darren Orrett could not stand . the thought of Robert Joyce being in his house.

The court heard that after Mr Orrett had tucked his daughter into bed, a row . broke out between him and Barr over her cheating and he vowed to hide . her mobile phone so she could not contact her lover. During the war of . words he was stabbed with a kitchen knife used to cut vegetables. 'Upset': The court hear Darren Orrett had been left devastated after his partner of 12 years Dawn Barr left him for another man . Murder: Police were called the family home in Cheadle, Greater Manchester, after reports father-of-four Darren Orrett had been stabbed . Police and paramedics alerted by a 999 call from Barr arrived at the house to find Darren bleeding to death on the floor. Mr Orrett was taken to hospital . where he died a short time afterwards after the fatal wound severed the . left jugular vein and penetrated into the left lung. Reconciliation: Victim Darren Orrett had returned to the family home to try and rekindle the relationship and see his four children . Barr originally told police . her ex partner stabbed himself in a fit of jealousy. She later admitted she had . killed him but said it was in self defence during a violent row. She said Mr Orrett had previously threatened her and Joyce and vowed to . take custody of the children. Barr told police: 'I had the knife and I just . remember it being in his neck and blood coming out. I didn't feel it . going in.' The court also heard that Barr had texted Joyce 48 hours before the killing, saying: 'Get him gone - I'm gonna kill this c***. I'll stab the c*** myself.' Barr was found guilty of manslaughter and jailed for nine years. She was acquitted of murder. Passing sentence Judge Michael Henshell said: 'The relationship with Robert Joyce which ultimately was the destructive force behind this case, was an entirely selfish relationship which you embarked on with this man. 'It led you to be blind to the fact that Darren Orrett - the man who loved you and was a devoted father - was feeling completely excluded. That led directly to the way he behaved towards you, to your loss of control and led ultimately to his death.' There was a single cry of 'suffer' from the public gallery as Barr, who showed no emotion, was sent down. Tragedy: The court heard Mr Orrett had returned to the house to see his daughter after she called and posted messages on Facebook saying she missed her father . Today Senior Investigating Officer Duncan Thorpe from Greater Manchester Police said: 'On the night of his death Darren received a phone call from his eldest daughter asking him to call round because she was missing him. 'Darren visited her and whilst there, an argument started with Barr where the end result was her stabbing him and Darren sadly losing his life. 'This was a needless act, not only leaving a family without a brother and son, but four children and two step-children without a much loved and dedicated father. They will now have to grow up knowing that their mum killed their dad, robbing them of a lifetime love.'","Dawn Barr, 42, killed ex-partner Darren Orrett at their home in Cheadle .

"Claims by a member of the Royal Australian Navy that he had been assaulted and threatened outside his home in Sydney's north-western suburbs yesterday are no longer being investigated by police. NSW Police have today confirmed the 'claims an ADF member was assaulted at Bella Vista have been withdrawn'. They have told Daily Mail Australia that: 'We believe it never actually took place'. Australian Defence Force chief, Mark Binskin, has confirmed the complaint has been withdrawn by a member of the navy and has apologised to the country's Middle Eastern community . Scroll down for video . NSW Police are no longer investigating claims by a member of the Royal Australian Navy that he was attacked on Thursday morning near his home in Bella Vista, in Sydney's north-west . The alleged attack was reported to have occurred in Bella Vista, in the the city's north-western suburbs . The assault claims follow the largest counter-terrorism raids (above) in the nation's history last week, which involved more than 800 Federal and State police . ADF Commander Mark Binskin has confirmed that the man has withdrawn the claims and he has apologised to the Middle Eastern community. At a new conference today he said 'on behalf of the Australian Defence Force I would like to apologise to the Australian community and in particular the Middle Eastern community for any angst this has caused'. But NSW Police have also revealed they are looking into the reasons behind the allegations being brought to them, in the first place. 'We are now investigating why those allegations came to us,' a NSW Police spokeswoman said. Following two alleged 'incidents' Defence officials advised members of the ADF to use their own judgement when considering going out in uniform. 'ADF members have been advised to consider where they are going, to be aware of their surroundings, and to exercise common-sense and judgement when considering where and when to wear uniform in public,' the statement read. Commander Binskin added that it was up to individuals or their commanders to decide if they were their uniforms outside of their base. 'I want people to be aware of their situation and aware of their surroundings,' he said. On the question of sailors wearing uniforms outside of base, Commander Binskin said he would not be issuing a general command but 'I want people to be aware of their situation and aware of their surroundings' 'They know through common sense where they should wear uniform and where it might not be right.' A previous earlier attack on a member of the RAN, which is still being investigated, relates to a verbal assault on a sailor in the Sydney CBD. The complaint which has been withdrawn, was reported to police as having occurred at about 6.30am on Thursday morning a 41-year-old man was allegedly set upon by two men of Middle Eastern appearance in Bella Vista. He told police he was in full uniform, was on his way to work and had suffered bruising. The navy member reported the alleged incident to police by phone and then in person at Kings Cross Police Station, which is located near the Navy Base in Garden Island. There had been reports that the man even told police his apparent attackers had threatened to cut his throat. The claims led to a swift response from Muslim community leaders, Dr Jamal Rifi tweeted that such an attack was 'abominable'. Chief of the Defence Force Mark Binskin recently decided to raise the alert level at all of the military's bases and establishments. The decision followed the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) raising the nation's terror alert level to 'high', meaning an attack is likely. The largest counter-terrorism raids in the nation's history, involving more than 800 police in New South Wales alone, occurred earlier this month. Now, it's been revealed by NSW Police, that the reported incident in Bella Vista is being investigated on the basis of why they had to throw resources at something 'we believe never actually took place'.","The Navy member claimed to have been attacked by two men of Middle Eastern appearance in Sydney's north-west .

"The British author behind best-selling novel One Day has revealed how his latest book was delayed by a computer program which starts deleting words if they are not written quickly enough. David Nicholls had so much trouble starting his latest book Us that he downloaded Write or Die - a software package that promises a 'consequence' if the user does not write a certain number of words within the set time frame. But the 47-year-old told the Cheltenham Literature Festival how the program ended up compounding his writer's block by making him feel as though he were writing 'with a gun' to his head. Author David Nicholls, 47, from north London, says his latest novel Us was delayed after he downloaded a computer program which deletes words if the writer does not type quickly enough . The father-of-two, who lives in north London, was eventually forced to scrap his first draft of 35,000 words and start his novel again, more than two years later. It means the highly-anticipated book - Us - has now been five years in the making. According to The Times, he told the audience: 'At the lowest point, I downloaded this piece of software called Write or Die. You set it going and start to type and if you stop, it starts to delete what you've written. 'I produced huge piles of paper and I saw it was all rubbish. It was as if I was writing with a gun to my head.' He added: 'I wrote 35,00 words and every one was agony. In December 2012, I showed it to my agent and friend. We met in January 2013 and they said ""I think you should put this to one side"".' Nicholls also revealed how he used programs Freedom and SelfControl while writing the book, both of which he found to be more successful. The programs - designed to stop procrastination - prevent users from accessing certain sites online and have been hailed by White Teeth author Zadie Smith and Nick Hornby. Us is told from the viewpoint of scientist Douglas Peterson, who goes on an InterRailing trip across Europe with his wife Connie and teenage son Albie. Us (left) released last week, comes some five years after Mr Nicholls' bestselling One Day (right) after he was forced to scrap his first draft of 35,000 words . But before the trip, Connie unexpectedly tells Douglas that she wants to leave him. The holiday becomes the chance to salvage not just his marriage, but his relationship with his son, with whom he has become somewhat estranged. The storyline was inspired by Nicholls’s own experience of being on the road while promoting One Day five years ago. The book follows the mismatched trio on their adventures in Paris, Amsterdam, Munich, Venice, Florence, Sienna, Madrid and Barcelona. Each destination on the trip triggers a memory of happier times - and all three members of the family must question whether they have a future together. Experts believe the story will have widespread appeal and could be a break-out hit among older audiences. Young love: One Day was adapted for the big screen in 2011, starring Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway and there is already a battle for exclusive film rights to Us . Gladiator star Russell Crowe is among the Hollywood A-listers already locked in a battle for the film rights. He reportedly wants to produce and star in the possible adaptation. Nicholls confirmed last month to MailOnline that there was interest in a film version of his new novel. ‘Yes, there has been talk about that. Of course I would love it to have another life like One Day,' he said. One Day was adapted into a film in 2011 starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess as lovers whose relationship was charted on the same date over several years. There are now dozens of apps, computer programs and free downloads sweeping the internet which are designed to encourage writers into being more productive. Write or Die - which is marketed using the catchphrase 'Putting the ""prod"" in productivity' - was designed by 'Dr Wicked' to encourage writers to just keep on typing. Each person who downloads the program can chose a time goal or a word-count for which to aim. If they stop writing before this goal is reached, the 'consequences' begin. The program can be used in a 'forgiving', 'strict' or 'evil' setting, varying the 'consequences' which are dished out. The writer is also allowed to pause the session once, for example if they need a toilet break. Write or Die: The second version of the computer program, designed by Dr Wicked . The program then uses a variety of punishments, including sounding off noises which the writer has admitted to hating, playing out songs the write might loathe or projecting images onto the screen which they might find frightening. The ultimate consequence sees words deleted. In the latest version, there are also 'rewards for accomplishment'. British novelist Helen Oyeyemi, the author of four novels - including White is for Witching and Mr Fox - previously told how she successfully used the software for some of her work. She encouraged other writers to download it. Meanwhile, another program used by authors is Freedom, developed by Fred Stutzman. Used by Nick Hornby, Dave Eggers and Naomi Klein, it blocks the user from being able to access the internet. Mr Stutzman also created Anti-Social, a less severe version of the program which blocks any social-media sites. SelfControl, created in 2009 by American artist Steve Lambert, also allows users to block whichever websites they chose for the time period they decide upon.","David Nicholls, 47, had writer's block when starting his latest novel, Us .

"Arron Lewis pleaded not guilty to capital murder in the slaying of real estate agent Beverly Carter in rural Arkansas . A convicted thief out on parole has been charged with murder in the killing of a missing Arkansas realtor, whose body was discovered in a shallow grave at a concrete company early Tuesday. Investigators found the body of Beverly Carter, 49, Tuesday, at Argos Concrete Company in a rural area about 25 miles northeast of Little Rock. Hours later, Arron Lewis, 33, was charged with capital murder, kidnapping and multiple counts of gun possession. Carter's body was found more than 20 miles away from Scott, where she had an appointment to show a house Thursday but hadn't been seen since. During a press conference held late Tuesday afternoon, Capt Simon Haynes, the lead investigator working the case, revealed that Lewis was Beverly Carter's mystery prospective home buyer. When asked about a possible motive, Haynes described the 49-year-old real estate agent as a 'target of opportunity' for Lewis. While officials remained tight-lipped on the details pertaining to the investigation, Pulaski County Sheriff Doc Holladay did say they were able to track Mrs Carter's phone leading to the discovery of her body. The sheriff, however, would not say how she died. Scroll down for videos .

Lewis, 33, was apprehended in Little Rock by the local police at around 10am Monday in connection with the case. He made his initial court appearance Tuesday morning, pleading not guilty to capital murder, kidnapping and four counts of possession of firearm. He reportedly told the judge that he is sorry and wants the whole thing to be over. As he was being led in handcuffs to a car to be transported to Pulaski County Jail at around 6am, a KARK reporter asked Lewis if he killed Beverly Carter. 'No,' he replied, adding that he has not seen her for two days. Perp walk: Lewis is seen here been led in handcuffs to a car that would transport him to Pulaski County Jail . Blame game: Lewis denied killing Carter and implicated a mystery co-defendant named Trevor . Lewis then implicated a 'co-defendant' named Trevor working for US Air Force at a military base. In response to a reporter's question 'why Beverly?' he replied: 'Because she was just a woman that worked alone, a rich broker.' When asked what he would say to the victim's family, Lewis said from the back to the police vehicle: 'sorry.' Pulaski County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. Carl Minden later told KARK that 'Trevor' was not a suspect in the kidnapping and murder case. Captain Haynes reiterated during the press conference that they do not consider 'Trevor' a suspect at this time. It's understood that Lewis did not give up the location of the body, but that police received a tip that led them to the makeshift burial site in the 12100 block of Highway 5 in Cabot. 'We didn't know for sure until midnight that she was not alive,' Sheriff Holladay told reporters Tuesday. Following the devastating discovery, the Carter family released a statement  mourning the loss of their 'precious Beverly.' 'There is now a hole in our hearts that will never be filled,' the statement read. 'Mr Lewis robbed us of an amazing wife, loving mother and grandmother.' The Carters thanked law enforcement officials and volunteers for helping in the search effort, and their community for offering them support. 'We draw some comfort in knowing that she is now in the arms of Jesus,' the statement concluded. The Little Rock blog Forbidden Hillcrest tweeted that Lewis was captured in Pleasant Pointe apartments on Green Mountain Drive after allegedly pulling a knife on a bystander. A passerby recognized Lewis from the news coverage and approached him, sending the man fleeing towards the Pleasant Pointe apartments. Cornered: Lewis jumped from a window and tried to flee, but was surrounded by officers (pictured) Nowhere to run: Lewis is pictured with his hands cuffed behind his back outside a Little Rock housing complex . First look: Eyewitness Adam Nash photographed Arron Lewis' arrest outside an apartment complex in Little Rock after he had allegedly pulled a knife on him . Humble abode: This is a house in Little Rock where murder suspect Arron Lewis once lived . As responding officers arrived outside the building, Lewis allegedly burst into the manager's office and jumped out the window in an attempt to flee, but was immediately caught. Lewis was named as a 'person of interest' after being involved in a car accident and taken to a hospital by police - before fleeing while officers thought he was having a CT scan done. Authorities released images of Lewis, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, with blood on his face following the crash in a bid to track him down. According to the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office, deputies received a call at around 10am Sunday about a single-vehicle crash in the 8700 block of Cato Road in Jacksonville, in which Arron Lewis' vehicle smashed into a concrete culvert. A bloodied Mr Lewis reportedly told the responding officers that someone had run him off the road. A witness told investigators that Lewis was driving at a high speed when he lost control of his vehicle in a curve, KARK reported.. Pulaski County Sheriff Doc Holladay told reporters Monday afternoon that Arron Lewis was being interviewed . Notorious: Lewis has criminal records in several states, including Arkansas, Missouri and Utah . Boyfriend: The 33-year-old  is seen here with a woman believed to be his girlfriend . The sheriff's office also has revealed that the 33-year-old is an active parolee with a long criminal history, including charges of felony theft; accomplice to theft; unlawful removal of theft device; obstruction of government operations, and other counts. Lewis also has rap sheets in Kansas City, Missouri, and in Utah. He was released on parole in Arkansas in August 2013. Earlier, Mrs Carter's husband of 35 years, Carl, made a tearful plea for authorities and residents to do all they can to find her. Mr Carter found his wife's car abandoned outside the house, which was left unlocked and open. 'I'm going to try to be strong as best I can - I just want my wife back,' he said. He appeared before cameras looking tired and distraught, as one neighbor revealed he saw a 'skinny white man' pull up at the house in a pick-up truck around the time of the disappearance. Search is over: Lewis (left and right), 33, of Jacksonville, had been on the run since Sunday after fleeing the hospital where he was taken following a crash . Dark past: Lewis has a long criminal history and is currently an active parolee . Mr Carter, who raised the alarm after his wife didn't come back from her appointment after three and a half hours, has since received unusual text messages from her phone, but no other sign of her. Describing the moments he went to look for her, he told KARK: 'By eight o'clock I knew something was wrong - but I waited to eight thirty. I went up in the house, went through every closet, everything.' He could find no sign of her inside, and police and volunteers have been searching ever since. It is unclear whether the pick-up driver was the buyer Mrs Carter was going to meet. Beverly Carter, 49, vanished from the property in Scott, near Little Rock, Arkansas, after meeting an unknown person at the address Thursday evening. She was reported missing by her husband, Carl, after she didn't make contact with her family after the 5.30pm appointment. Missing: Carl Carter spoke of his distress at the disappearance of his real estate agent wife on Thursday . Tragic: Mrs Carter was a realtor with Crye-Leike in Little Rock, Arkansas . Matriarch: Beverly Carter has been married for 34 years and has four grandchildren . Property: Mrs Carter was showing this property in Scott, Arkansas, to an unknown buyer who reportedly said he would be willing to pay in cash . When Carter went to the property to look for his wife, he found her car, a brown Cadillac, containing her purse, outside of the house, which had a wide open door. There was no trace of her inside. Mrs Carter, who worked for the Crye-Leike real estate company in Little Rock, was last seen wearing a black, sleeveless shirt and red capri pants. According to ABC News, the home had been foreclosed, and Mrs Carter was showing it to a buyer she had never met, who said he could pay in cash. Carter, who says it is extremely unusual for his wife of 34 years not to stay in close contact, said that he received unusual texts from her number at 1am the morning after she disappeared. Search: Mrs Carter's husband, Carl Carter (left), told how he went looking for his wife (right) and found an empty home and an abandoned car . He said: 'All of a sudden I received three texts in a row. One said ""Yes."" Then she sent another text that said, ""My phone's low. The battery's down, and I'll call you whenever I get signal."" 'And, then, straight back-to-back, I received a text that said ""Oh, I'm out drinking with some friends.""' 'Beverly's not a drinker…We just want our mom back, and my wife of 35 years…I need her.' He told First Coast News: 'Her car was there, and the house was wide open, and I knew that something was wrong.'

"It was a landmark moment in her life and should have been one of her family’s most precious memories. But Harmonie-Rose Allen’s first steps are tinged with sadness for her parents. Just weeks after starting to walk, their daughter is to lose all of her limbs to meningitis. Harmonie-Rose Allen is currently in hospital facing amputation of both her arms and legs after she contracted meningitis. She is pictured here with parents Freya and Ross . The 11-month-old is on a life support machine in hospital, suffering what doctors said is one of the worst cases of the deadly condition they have seen. Despite initially being given just a 10 per cent chance of survival, Harmonie-Rose is expected to live – but her arms and legs must be amputated. The tragedy comes just weeks after she took her first tentative steps with a baby walker. Family and friends in her home city of Bath, Somerset, are now hoping to raise more than £40,000 to pay for prosthetic limbs that will enable her to live as normal a life as possible. Harmonie-Rose’s aunt Hannah Hall, 31, said doctors did not think her niece would pull through, adding: ‘The family feel like Harmonie-Rose’s whole life has been robbed.’ The baby’s parents Freya Hall, 20, and Ross Allen first noticed something was wrong on September 27, when she woke in the night coughing . The baby’s parents Freya Hall, 20, and Ross Allen first noticed something was wrong on September 27, when she woke in the night coughing. Mr Allen, a customer service worker, said: ‘She had been a little bit under the weather all week. But we just assumed it was a cold and because she was teething we put it down to that as well.’ They took her to the Royal United Hospital in Bath as she was finding it difficult to breathe, but doctors could not find anything seriously wrong and she was sent home. The next morning Harmonie-Rose turned ‘all limp and she was blue’ and the couple took her back to the same hospital. Following a thorough assessment they were told it was just a virus and were again sent away. Just weeks after starting to walk, Harmonie-Rose was diagnosed with the worst case of meningitis that doctors had seen in years . But hours later she became floppy and lethargic and her parents took her to the hospital for a third time, when a rash was spotted. Harmonie-Rose was then taken by ambulance to a specialist unit at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. Her devastated father said: ‘It was absolutely horrible. She was really lucky to survive. ‘Doctors told us it was the worst case they had seen in three years and they really didn’t think she would make the journey to the hospital.’ By the time she arrived at the intensive care unit, Harmonie-Rose’s arms and legs had turned black and her parents were told all four limbs would need to be amputated. The little girl needs two pairs of prosthetics to replace her arms and legs, which will cost around £40,000 . She is still being closely monitored by doctors. The operation will be carried out in the coming weeks. Mr Allen said: ‘We are hoping that we can buy her two pairs of prosthetics – arms and legs that she can walk on. ‘This will cost us about £40,000 – £20,000 per set – and we’re hoping we can get her some pink ones. ‘She’s a little fighter and she is going to keep on fighting. ‘We hope that she can carry on with life like any other children her age.’ Her father Ross Allen said: She’s a little fighter and she is going to keep on fighting.

"As a large light is wheeled into the room, 66 year old Larry Hester's face suddenly lights up and a huge smile spreads across his face. The patient at Duke Eye Center in North Carolina is one of the first in the world to be given a bionic eye - and cameras were there to capture the moment he saw for the first time in 30 years. As his wife rushed over to hug him, he told surgeons the good news, telling them 'Yes! Oh my goodness, yes!' moments after surgeon's pressed a button, activating Hester's newly implanted bionic eye. Scroll down for video . Paul Hahn, MD, a retinal surgeon at the Duke Eye Center, switches on the bionic eye - and 66 year old Larry Hester sees for the first time in 30 years . 'Can I kiss him?' his wife, Jerry Hester, exclaimed as she heard him say he saw flashing lights for the first time . The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis Device incorporates technology initially developed by researchers then at the Duke Eye Center. Using wireless technology, a sensor is implanted in the eye to pick up light signals sent from a camera mounted on special eyeglasses. Its sophisticated features were further enhanced and marketed by a company called Second Sight Medical Products. On Oct. 1, 2014, Hester became only the seventh person in the United States to have a so-called bionic eye - an Argus II Retinal Prosthesis Device – activated as a visual aid to send light signals to his brain. Paul Hahn, MD, a retinal surgeon at the Duke Eye Center, counted backward from three and pressed a button, activating Hester's newly implanted bionic eye. The device incorporates technology initially developed by researchers then at the Duke Eye Center; its sophisticated features were further enhanced and marketed by a company called Second Sight Medical Products. Using wireless technology, a sensor is implanted in the eye to pick up light signals sent from a camera mounted on special eyeglasses. Hahn implanted the sensor on Sept. 10, and activated the device on three weeks later – to the sheer delight of Hester and his family. 'Can I kiss him?' his wife, Jerry Hester, exclaimed in the moment she heard him say he saw flashing lights for the first time. However,  the device will not restore normal eyesight, but instead provide a visual aid that could help Hester distinguish a door from a wall, or a crosswalk painted in a roadway. Hahn implanted the sensor on Sept. 10, and activated the device on three weeks later – to the sheer delight of Hester and his family. Using wireless technology, a sensor is implanted in the eye to pick up light signals sent from a camera mounted on special eyeglasses. Hester describes seeing flashes of light that are more intense when he aims the camera at lights or light-colored objects. During a clinic visit on Monday, Hester described 'seeing' sights he had long believed were past memories – a white duck swimming in a pond, the harvest moon, his wife's yellow chrysanthemums. In a healthy eye, the rods and cones convert light into tiny electrochemical impulses that are sent through the optic nerve and into the brain, where they are decoded into images. If the photoreceptors no longer function correctly the first step in this process is disrupted, and the visual system cannot transform light into images. The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System (""Argus II"") bypasses the damaged photoreceptors altogether. A miniature video camera housed in the patient’s glasses captures a scene. The video is sent to a small patient-worn computer (i.e., the video processing unit – VPU) where it is processed and transformed into instructions that are sent back to the glasses via a cable. These instructions are transmitted wirelessly to an antenna in the implant. The signals are then sent to the electrode array, which emits small pulses of electricity. These pulses bypass the damaged photoreceptors and stimulate the retina’s remaining cells, which transmit the visual information along the optic nerve to the brain, creating the perception of patterns of light. Patients learn to interpret these visual patterns. Using wireless technology, a sensor is implanted in the eye to pick up light signals sent from a camera mounted on special eyeglasses. Jerry Hester said her most cherished moment came while they were watching a football game on Sunday. She was sitting in a dark chair, and her skin was enough of a contrast that Larry could see flashes. He reached out and touched her face. 'It was just a beautiful touch,' she said. Hester will return to the Duke Eye Center regularly for additional training on the device, learning to discern shapes and objects from the flashes generated by the device. He said is eager to provide researchers with information they can use to enhance the technology, so that the next generation of patients will benefit from his pioneering effort. 'I just wonder how I have been so lucky,' he said. 'Why me? But if I can use what I learn from this to help others with RP, it will not just be for my benefit.'","66 year old Larry Hester was blind for 30 years due to a degenerative disease .

"The CIA gave the Intelligence Star to a 14-year-old for her behavior during a home invasion while living with her station chief father overseas in the Congo in 1966. The story of the girl, who was since been identified as Maureen Devlin, is now-publicly viewable in CIA documents, Business Insider reported, which earlier revealed Devlin's actions. The documents, published as 'The Youngest Intelligence Star,' detail how Devlin heard 'three masked burglars' snatching items in her room, and how she faked being asleep. Awarded: The CIA gave the Intelligence Star to a 14-year-old Maureen Devlin (file photo) 'The girl heard the burglars discussing the possibility of harming her,' the documents say. 'She understood their local language, Lingala, but she did not understand the word rape, only that it was a physical threat. They turned on the lights, and one used a butcher knife to cut her nightgown. She managed to roll over and cover herself with the sheet, still feigning sleep. Her greatest fear at the time was that perhaps the men had already killed her mother and father. 'When one robber pricked her head with the knife, she could no longer pretend she was asleep. She started to speak, but the robber made a sign and said in French that she would kill her if she did. He grabbed her arm and tried to pull her from the bed. She wrenched free, jumped out of the other side of the bed, and declared in Lingala that he should keep his hands off her. Pulling on her dressing gown, she faced the armed robbers and warned them not to harm anyone in the house.' The documents say that 'As they walked through the house, she boldly warned them in Lingala that the American Embassy had ""secret and magic"" ways of identifying people who harmed Americans. She told them that Americans always kill such people.' Devlin eventually took the men into her parents' bedroom under duress, while the robbers pointed weapons both in front of and in back of her. Remembered: Maureen Devlin's father Larry wrote a memoir about his experience working overseas for the CIA . Devlin's parents woke up, and the family had to stand in a corner during the robbery, the documents say - 'All the while, the mother harangued the robbers in French.' The Devlins were later told to go inside a bathroom during the home invasion, according to the documents. 'The daughter entered first, followed by the mother and father,' they recount. 'They slammed the door behind them, threw their bodies against the door and locked it before the robbers could enter. The daughter grabbed two large water bottles to use as weapons and gave one to her father. The family called through the window for help. After a few minutes, their cook's voice could be heard. The robbers had fled. The family unlocked the bathroom door, and the father and daughter armed themselves with handguns and rushed out to hunt for the robbers.' The men were later apprehended and executed, the documents say. They also reveal that Devlin now works inside the CIA's Directorate of Operations.","The CIA gave the Intelligence Star to a 14-year-old Maureen Devlin .

"A Perth breast imaging clinic and a former doctor have been fined a total of $100,000 for false and misleading conduct after promoting their services as an alternative to mammograms. The Federal Court on Friday ordered Breast Check Pty Ltd to pay $75,000 and former doctor Alexandra Boyd $25,000 for making claims in contravention of the Australian Consumer Law that put patient's lives at risk. In misleading pamphlets, the clinic claimed either a Thermography Device alone or in conjunction with the Multifrequency Electrical Impedance Mammograph, known as a MEM device, could assess whether a person was at risk of breast cancer. The Court also found that Breast Check had represented that there was an adequate scientific basis for using the devices as a substitute for mammography, when that was not the case. Ms Boyd was found to have been knowingly involved in the clinic's deceptive conduct. Perth clinic Breast Check Pty Ltd has been fined for false and misleading conduct after promoting their services as an alternative to mammograms and putting patients lives at risk . In his judgement, Justice Michael Barker said the key issue was the potential to divert customers from using a medically recognised form of breast imaging. 'Even if only one consumer has been so diverted to their detriment, the consequences to a person's health may be very serious, and at worst, fatal,' he said. 'That is not something that can be measured solely in monetary terms and it is of no assistance to say the conduct was only directed to a small number of individuals.' The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it was particularly concerned that Breast Check made such significant health related claims without a proper scientific basis. 'Consumers are entitled to expect that breast imaging services would be provided in a way that is consistent with credible scientific knowledge,' said ACCC Commissioner Sarah Court in a statement. 'If consumers relied on Breast Check’s representations instead of using conventional breast cancer investigation methods including mammography, then potentially breast cancers could have gone undiagnosed,' she said. If consumers relied on Breast Check’s representations, 'breast cancers could have gone undiagnosed,' said the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission . Last week the Court ordered another breast imaging provider, Safe Breast Imaging Pty Ltd, to pay penalties of $200,000 for similar contraventions of the ACL. Breast Check, now called PO Health Professionals Pty Ltd, no longer provides breast imaging services.","The Federal Court has fined a Perth clinic and a former doctor for misleading conduct that put patient's lives at risk .

"Britain’s best hotels are getting a run for their money from pubs and restaurants in the 2015 edition of the Good Hotel Guide. Pubs and restaurants with rooms are vying with top-notch hotels as the best places to stay, with several establishments included in the latest guide. One of the top gongs in the book’s annual Cesar Awards – named after legendary Swiss hotelier Cesar Ritz – was awarded to The Talbot Inn, which serves as a watering hole for locals at Mells, Somerset, but has eight guest rooms for visitors. Scroll down for video . Cheers: The Talbot Inn at Mells, Somerset, won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year . On the water: Located on the River Tummel, The Green Park at Pitlochry was the top hotel in Scotland . Stunning scenery: Moor of Rannoch Hotel at Rannoch Station, Perth and Kinross, was Newcomer of the Year . Surrounded by Somerset’s stunning countryside, The Talbot Inn won the title of Pub-With-Rooms of the Year. It is described as a traditional yet stylish coaching inn with all the comforts of a smart hotel plus a classic pub, grill room, 500-year-old sitting room and garden. There are more than 400 entries in the latest guide, which acts as a bible for the UK’s hotel industry. Its editors say the guide is independent and all the hotels and B&Bs are recommended by readers, with anonymous inspections done by the editorial team. 'A Georgian gem': Guests are greeted with tea and cake at Newforge House, the Irish Guest House of the Year . Family-friendly: Fowey Hall at Fowey, Cornwall, was named the best place to take the kids .

A good manager will have slept in every bedroom to ensure it’s up to scratch. ‘Breakfast is also a very good benchmark. It’s the guest’s last meal before check out, so good-quality coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice and free-range eggs should be a given.

"Twenty-one rarely seen letters by Thomas Jefferson have gone on display at the Museum of the City of New York. The correspondence with Robert Livingston was written from 1800 to 1803. Livingston was chancellor of New York state. He administered President George Washington's oath of office 12 years before Jefferson himself became president. This 1805 letter written by President Thomas Jefferson has been valued at $35,000 . Jefferson's handwritten letters touch on important issues of the day including the Louisiana Purchase, the first steam engine and the Napoleonic Wars. Jefferson also inquires about the unearthing of a mammoth skeleton in upstate New York. Museum Director Susan Henshaw says the letters reveal Jefferson's wider legacy as an 'all-around collector of knowledge.' They were donated to the museum in 1947 by Livingston's descendant Goodhue Livingston. They'll be displayed through Dec. 5.

"Charlie Brooker, 26, (pictured) was today jailed for 18 months after pleading guilty to assault and making threats to kill - he was described by police as a 'danger to women' A stalker who bombarded a woman with 25,000 threatening texts and forced her to drive him around while screaming abuse at her has today been jailed. Charlie Brooker, 26, who has a long history of convictions for violence and harassment, called his victim constantly on both her personal and work phones on top of sending the deluge of text messages. His campaign of abuse escalated on May 17 when Brooker forced the woman to drive him around in circles before finally stopping at a shop in Crayford, in Bexley, East London. A court heard while there the woman asked the shopkeeper to call the police because she thought Brooker was going to kill her. He then dragged her outside and slammed her up against the side of a delivery van. Brooker, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to assault and making threats to kill at Maidstone Crown Court, Kent, and was today jailed for 18 months. The court also heard Brooker threatened to head butt a female police officer while in custody. The court heard even when police officers answered his calls on her behalf, Brooker threatened to 'wring her neck'. He also told his victim he would slit her throat and harm members of her family. After his arrest detectives from Kent Police downloaded 5,000 pages of text messages from Brooker to his victim, averaging about five texts per page. Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) heard Brooker threatened to slit his victim's throat and sent her 25,000 texts . Detective Constable Becky Saunders, of Kent Police, said: 'Charlie Brooker is a violent offender with 44 previous convictions, most of which in recent years are for violence and harassment. 'He was in breach of a suspended sentence when committing these most recent offences and therefore now serves this term. 'Brooker is a danger to women and belongs behind bars where he can cause them no harm and where they are free from his barrage of abuse.'","Charlie Brooker, 26, bombarded his victim with 25,000 threatening texts .

"Chanel has come under fire for showing Native American-inspired headdresses as part of its latest collection presented in Dallas on Tuesday. Activist Sasha Houston Brown was dismayed to see models were dressed in feathered headpieces walking down the runway at the star-studded Metiers d’Arts show. She told MailOnline: 'I think this incident really demonstrates that regardless of a brand’s status, cultural appropriation and misrepresentation continues to be an ongoing issue in the fashion industry. Write caption here . She said that Chanel should have learned from previous Native-inspired fashion offenses . by Urban Outfitters, Victoria’s Secret, and H&M, which should have provided . the label with clear-cut lessons before staging its show. Miss Brown, a 26-year-old member of the Santee Sioux Nation, and serves as the director of education for Little Earth United Tribes, says that the runway show’s portrayal of Native American fashion represents a gross underassessment of traditional Native American dress as a whole. ‘We have over 566 federally-recognized tribes in the U.S. and very few of those outside of the plains really [wear] anything resembling a headdress.’ She says that headdresses are ‘very tribal specific,’ and that their mass association with Native American culture represents a ‘stereotype.’ In fact, Miss Brown, who resides in Minneapolis, has labeled Chanel’s headdress designs as an ‘offensive mockery.’ Cowboys and Indians: The show was inspired by the old American west . She told us that ‘there is a way of . working with native communities – you can do it in a beautiful way, but . when it becomes problematic is when you go off a mainstream stereotype . that exists and then say your designs are “inspired.”’ Futhermore, Miss Brown says that when included in a tribe’s traditional repertoire, headdresses are a ‘sacred object’ that are only used by tribe leaders in religious ceremonies. The fashion industry’s cyclical trend cycle often relies on inspirations that are drawn from foreign cultures. Miss Brown says that she understands this concept, but would find it more appropriate if designers would ‘speak with the people that they are drawing inspiration from, and go to that community where the designs originate.’ She thinks that ‘it’s the responsibility of the company to go about it in an appropriate way and look at artists in those communities to find outlets for collaboration,’ especially in many Native American communities, where handcrafts still provide a large source of income. Representatives for Chanel issued the following statement to MailOnline: 'The Chanel-Dallas Metiers d'Art 2013/2014 collection is a celebration of the beauty of Texas. Native Americans are an integral part of Texas's rich history and culture and the feather headdress, a symbol of strength and bravery, is one of the most visually stunning examples of the creativity and craftsmanship they possessed.' The brand’s headdress debacle follows similar moves by lower-priced brands including Victoria’s Secret and Urban Outfitters. How did it happen? Activists are confused how Karl Lagerfeld and Chanel as a whole did not learn from past scandals experienced by Urban Outfitters and Victoria's Secret . In 2011 Urban Outfitters pulled its ‘Navajo’ range of designs from store shelves after it prompted widespread outrage for its misrepresentation of Native American design. Similarly, in 2012, Victoria’s Secret faced blowback after it dressed Karlie Kloss in a Native-inspired get-up (headdress included) for the ‘Calendar Girls’ portion of its annual fashion show. Both the brand, as well as Miss Kloss were forced to publicly issue apologies, and Victoria’s Secret ultimately cut the look from its televised broadcast. Miss Brown says that Chanel’s collection represents ‘so much more than one clothing item, it’s even bigger than the fashion industry. We are talking about issues that at their core are about colonialism and over racism against indigenous people.’","Sasha Houston Brown, a 26-year-old member of the Santee Sioux Nation, took issue with the show's feathered headpieces .

"Police in Florida say a 19-year-old Tampa man has turned an innocent stuffed horse into his personal sex toy while shopping at Walmart. Sean Johnson was arrested Tuesday at the big-box store located in Brooksville and charged with indecent exposure and criminal mischief after Walmart employees told police that the 19-year-old had been spotted pleasuring himself with the help of a stuffed animal. Johnson was taken to the Hernando County Jail but was later released after posting $1,500 bail. Horse whisperer: Sean Johnson, 19, was charged with indecent exposure and criminal mischief after Walmart store cameras caught him defiling a stuffed horse toy . Not your average toy: Police say Johnson picked out a horse toy (similar to the one pictured) from the clearance section, took it to the bedding department and used it to pleasure himself . According to Johnson’s arrest report, the suspect was caught on surveillance cameras just before 3pm Tuesday acting suspiciously. The teenager reportedly removed a brown, black and red stuffed horse from a clearance shelf and walked over to the bedding department, where police say he proceeded to pleasure himself using the toy, TBO.com reported. The arrest report cited by The Smoking Gun described in graphic detail how the 19-year-old man allegedly pulled out his genitals so he could ‘hump the stuffed horse utilizing short fast movements’ until he achieved satisfaction. Store cameras then captured Johnson placing the defiled horsey smeared with bodily fluids on top of a packaged comforter set. The 19-year-old then took off running but was apprehended a short time later. When questioned by police, Johnson reportedly came clean about his bizarre amorous encounter with an inanimate plaything. Disgusting: Johnson later replaced the defiled stuffed animal covered in bodily fluids on a shelf at the Brooksville Walmart and ran off, but was quickly caught . ‘I did unmentionables to a stuffed animal,’ Johnson said in a written statement. ‘The officer put it into perspective of what would happen if somebody would pick it up and use it. 'I did not think of it the way he put it and I so feel like I did a horrible act.’ The defiled toy and all the items it came in contact with had to be disposed of after being deemed contaminated and unsalable.","Sean Johnson, 19, charged with indecent exposure and criminal mischief .

"Runaway teacher Jeremy Forrest had sex with his schoolgirl lover up to eight times a night, a court heard yesterday. The married 30-year-old had a four-month affair with his pupil before she persuaded him to flee to France with her amid fears she might kill herself. Before they absconded the maths master seduced the 15-year-old in his car while she was wearing her school uniform, Lewes Crown Court was told. Jeremy Forrest, pictured arriving at court today, asked the schoolgirl to return home and was in tears as they drove to France, the girl said . Forrest had also sent her ‘graphic’ and cringe-making text messages, it was claimed. During a police interview played to . the court, a friend of the girl said the teenager had told her she had . slept with Forrest in his car, home and at hotels, often without . contraception. ‘She said they had sex multiple times in one night. It was seven or eight times,’ said the girl. The friend said the teenager was . often wearing her school  uniform –which consisted of a  navy polo, knee . length black skirt, black tights and black Vans shoes – during the . encounters as Forrest used to meet her straight after class. The friend said that at the start of . the relationship Forrest sent compliments to the girl such as ‘You’re . beautiful’. As it progressed the messages became more explicit, she . said. ‘There were some sexual ones, they were quite graphic things, it’s . really like cringey stuff. Case: Jim Forrest looked well when he arrived at Lewes Crown Court  (pictured) today, but collapsed shortly afterwards. He was not there for the verdict . Jeremy Forrest leaves Lewes Crown Court after the sixth day of his trial . ‘I think she kind of liked it, so she did play along with it, she said the same sort of things back to him. ‘I do not remember exactly what she said but she said, “Imagine  me . doing this to you” or something like that.’ The couple spent eight days . on the run before Forrest was arrested with her in Bordeaux last . September. He has denied a charge of child abduction. The couple, who have not met since . they were found, smiled at each other across the courtroom yesterday as . the teenager, now 16, took to the witness box, having declined an offer . to give evidence via video link. She told the jury that before the pair fled she had felt suicidal, fearing their relationship was about to be exposed. A day earlier police had confiscated . her phone after being tipped off as rumours of the relationship swirled . around Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne, East Sussex. The girl, who cannot be named for . legal reasons, said Forrest tried to ‘persuade me not to run away’ and . only came with her because she was ‘insistent’ and he feared for her . safety. The girl said that as Forrest drove her to Dover to board a . cross-channel ferry to Calais he seemed ‘very worried and very . emotional’. She said: ‘I don’t think he wanted to take me anywhere. I was insistent. ‘I was very determined and once I had . an idea in my head nobody was going to stop me, not Jeremy, not . anybody. I was adamant we had to go otherwise I feared what would . happen.’ Forrest was aware she had suffered from an eating disorder, self-harming and was having problems at home, the court heard. The teenager said: ‘He was concerned . that if I went on my own I would be in danger so he said it would be a . better idea if he came with me. Former maths teacher Jeremy Forrest, 30, who taught at the Eastbourne school, denies one count of child abduction . Jeremy Forrest allegedly had sex with the girl up to eight times a night . ‘I was very pleased. If Jeremy said he was not coming with me I dread to think what situation I would be in then. ‘He said to me, “this isn’t going to . end very well but if you are insisting things could happen to you as a . result we have to go”.’ Under cross examination by defence counsel Ronald Jaffa, the girl admitted she had felt suicidal at the time. She said: ‘It was one of those times I . was feeling very low indeed and I was very desperate. And when I’m . desperate those are the kind of things I do.’ The teenager said that after they fled, Forrest repeatedly  asked her to return home but she refused. She added: ‘He was saying “I can’t go back”. He was now stuck in the position.’ The girl told the court she had . ‘instigated’ the relationship with Forrest, which began following a . school trip to Los Angeles the previous February. Forrest had comforted her after learning of her personal problems. The girl said her mother, who was . pregnant with her fifth child at the time and had just left her . stepfather, did not believe she had a problem. As she left the court the teenager smiled again at Forrest who rested his head on the front of the dock. The case continues.

"Property experts claim that the housing market could be up to 10% over valued, following a month of staggering results for the national property market. In Melbourne a record breaking 1558 properties were up for grabs this weekend alone, with one of the top selling properties fetching an astounding $5.35 million. The Hawthorn property, which was last bought as a block for $950,000 in 1998, sold prior to auction and boasted six bedrooms on three levels, and included a lap pool and tennis court. With four bathrooms, a butlers pantry, a separate guest wing and court-side terraces, the house is nestled in an exclusive suburb close to top end private schools and boutique shopping. Scroll down for video . The Berkeley St property in Hawthorn sold prior to auction for $5.35 million . The property boasts six bedrooms on three levels, and includes a lap pool and tennis court . With four bathrooms, a butlers pantry, a separate guest wing and court-side terraces, the house is nestled in an exclusive suburb close to top end private schools and boutique shopping . The property had been expected to sell for as little as $5 million, and so the selling price reflects a growing trend of increased sale prices throughout Australia. Experts from Deloitte Access Economics report that the Reserve Bank of Australia should be nervous about Australian housing prices 'getting too far ahead of themselves.' The latest Business Outlook report indicates that 'on simple measures, housing looks to be about 10 per cent overvalued'. Warwick Anderson, Director of RT Edgar Toorak, said that this was particularly evident in houses within the $1-$2 million range, as there was increased competition for the properties. This Toorak property sold for $1.73 million at auction over the weekend, $400,000 over reserve price . The house was 'renovated beautifully', according to Warwick Anderson, Director of RT Edgar Toorak . 'The trend of houses selling for well over reserve price is much more common in this range, where younger couples are bidding against older couples who may be downsizing,' he said. 'Particularly if they're well renovated, they're the ones that are really taking off.' 'One property sold over the weekend for $1.73 million, $400,000 over the reserve price. In that price range that is extraordinary.' The Denham Place, Toorak property was placed on the market for $2.665 million, but sold for $2.770 million when it went under the hammer over the weekend. The property had been 'beautifully renovated,' according to Anderson, and had the potential for further restoration. However, Anderson said the trend tapered off the higher the price brackets went, where the turnover of properties had increased but the prices remained relatively stable. 'It's an interesting market, but it's important not to overstate the sale prices in that range, which do pale off.' 'There simply aren't as many properties in what we called the hyper top end. It's the properties in the lower bracket of $1-$2 million that are seeing the growth in sales especially.' This Elizabeth St residence is part of the Eliza Building complex and is situated enviably across from Hyde Park, in Sydney's CBD . With four spacious bedrooms and marble ensuites, the apartment has floorlength glass concertina doors which makes the most of the incredible view of the parklands and St Mary's Cathedral . The apartment was sold at auction over the weekend for an impressive $3,880,000 . This reinforces the report from Deloitte Access Economics which indicated that despite early concerns that Victoria's economy was under pressure, interest and exchange rates remain solid. In NSW, Deloitte said that interest rates remained low, and the housing market was 'hot, with a big lift in homebuilding underway helping to underpin a broadly favourable growth outlook.' 'It's NSW time to shine,' said the report. This is clear from the impressive silver medal price at auction over the weekend, which saw a property in Sydney's CBD fetch $3,880,000.

"Xavi Hernandez could yet remain at Barcelona until at least January after reportedly holding last-ditch talks with manager Luis Enrique and president Josep Maria Bartomeu. It had been widely expected that the legendary midfield player would leave the Catalan side this summer and end his playing days with New York City in the MLS. One possibility had been that Xavi would play for Manchester City’s other sister side, Melbourne City, in the A-League before the beginning of the new MLS season in March. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Xavi greeted with a cheeky slap from Ibrahimovic . Delay: Xavi Hernandez may remain at Barcelona for the first half of the 2014-15 season . Old friends: Xavi has held positive talks with Barca coach Luis Enrique who is an ex-team-mate . Decorated: Xavi has won seven La Liga titles and three Champions League titles at Barcelona . La Roja: Xavi has also won two European Championships and a World Cup with Spain . However, reports in Catalonia now say that Xavi has decided to stay at the Nou Camp after holding lengthy talks with Enrique and he will spend at least the first half of the season with the club. He is expected to report for training with Barcelona on Thursday. It is understood that the 34-year-old Spaniard, who has won 22 trophies in a glittering career with Barcelona, could still join New York City in time for the club’s first campaign in the MLS in 2015. If that move materialises, he will link up in the United States with Frank Lampard, whose move to New York City is likely to be finalised in the coming week. Imminent: Frank Lampard's move to New York City is expected to be confirmed soon . Lampard is expected to spend the next few months in Australia with Melbourne, where he is likely to become what is known as the ‘marquee’ player. Under strict regulations, Aussie clubs are allowed two marquee players, one of which must be Australian and the other can be from abroad, who are allowed a wage package that goes beyond the normal salary cap. David Villa, who is spending a short stint in Melbourne before heading Stateside, is exempt from the marquee category as he is a ‘guest’ player that will qualify to play 10 non-consecutive games for the club. Confirmed: David Villa has already joined NYC and could link up with Lampard at Melbourne in the A-League . This means that Lampard and Villa could both play for Melbourne until January, along with former Chelsea and Fulham midifelder Damien Duff, whose wage is below the club’s $2.55m salary cap. However, Melbourne officials will have to decide between the commercial benefits that the presence of both Villa and Lampard will bring to the club and their chance of winning the league, for it will not be beneficial to lose the two star players in January midway through the season. Ideally, Melbourne would prefer an international marquee player, therefore, that would remain at the club for the whole season but with the global standing of Villa and Lampard, they are likely to make an exception for this campaign.","Xavi expected to move to MLS side New York City from Barcelona .

"A teenager cruelly banished to Siberia by her American mother for failing in school has escaped the frozen region to live in Morocco. Sofia Petrova, 18, was duped into going to Russia and the hell of being abandoned by her mom to live with her biological father - whom she had just met and could only speak Russian. But after descending into poverty, and allegedly being beaten, Sofia has escaped to live in Morocco with those she considers her true family. Her mom's ex-boyfriend, who raised Sofia while she was growing up in Chantilly, Virginia, took pity on her and paid for flights so she could live with his family in Africa. Scroll down for video . Exiled: Sofia Petrova, pictured left in frozen Siberia, was uprooted from her life as a 15-year-old in Virginia by her mother, Natalia Roberts (right) Escape: Sofia, pictured in Morocco, has now made it to North Africa with the help of Farid Souliman, who raised her and whom she considers her true father. Above, she poses with Farid's mother, Sofia's 'grandmother' Farid Souliman, who lived with Sofia's mom Natalia Roberts for most of the girl's youth, helped Sofia get to Morocco where she now lives with his mother. She has now taken on his surname and considers herself part of his family - especially her 'grandmother', who cares for her and is helping her blend into Moroccan society by learning French. Sofia went from an ordinary, all-American girl to an outcast in Russia, where she lived until she was two. She was banished back to Siberia with her father, Igor, for behaving badly back home. She had no idea the move, billed as a vacation, would become permanent until after she had landed. While living in the remote city of Novosibirsk, Siberia, she had to work in a hostel as a teenager to make ends meet. Her relationship with her biological father reached such depths that she considered taking her own life. She now also plans to write a book, laying bare all the details of her Russian exile and fractious family relationships. Savior: Farid Soulimani, pictured above with a young Sofia (right) and her sister Maria (left), helped her escape Siberia for Morocco . Discussing the project, Sofia told The Siberian Times: 'There are many things that I never shared, and many secrets that I kept. All of this is going to be included in my book. 'It goes into details about my relationship with my mom, biological father, and men that have been in my life. 'People know my story, but they know only a little part of it. 'Writing a book has always been a dream of mine. And if you have a good story to tell, you might as well use it.' Sofia was a 15-year-old freshman at Chantilly High School in Virginia in 2011 when she was suddenly packed off on what she was told would be a three-week trip to Siberia to meet her biological father for the first time. But after arriving in the city of Novosibirsk to stay with a man she barely knew, her Soviet-born mom - now a US citizen - and stepfather back home in America told her she wouldn't be allowed home until she changed her ways. Sofia, who was born in Siberia, has a Russian passport and no automatic right to live in the United States without her mother's consent. 'Abusive': Sofia fled her life with her biological father Igor, who was unknown to her before the visit . Growing up: Sofia is pictured above as a child in Chantilly, Virginia, where she made it to freshman year of High School before being flown off to Siberia . Instead, her mother said she would have to stay there as 'punishment' for her unruly behavior, including flunking school, running away from home and stealing $1,000. Despite having spent almost all her life in the US, Sofia was born in Siberia and only has a Russian passport, leaving her exiled and making any return to her home almost impossible. When it emerged there was no return ticket, her story was told around the world. Her friends in the U.S. supported her, saying her transgressions were no worse than many other teens. Sofia pleaded with her mother - who used to be an assistant professor at the University of Delaware - but could not persuade her. Details of Sofia's ordeal sparked protests and campaigns to have her sent back to US. It emerged her biological father, who spoke no English, was often drunk and she claimed he beat her. Sofia had to flee the house and stay in a children's center, where she spiralled into depression and, faced with the possibility of a permanent stay in a grim orphanage, tried to take her own life. Cold: Sofia found little to enjoy in Siberia, where she had a difficult relationship with her father, did not speak the language and had to work to sustain herself . Her book will detail the teen's pain and suffering as she struggled to cope with being abandoned and a life in a foreign country, where she could not speak the language. It will also tell how she moved to a hostel where she lived and worked 60 hours a week, including nights, just to earn her keep and pay for her studies. Sofia said she hoped the book will help others facing similar traumas in their lives. She added: 'I have found some peace in my life and I really want to help other children do the same. 'I stand up for children's rights now - so many kids don~t have a voice and are scared to speak. 'I'm not. I get kicked down for it all the time, but it doesn't stop me. Adults hold most of the power, but they aren't always right.' The book will also go into detail about the relationship Sofia had with the three father figures in her life: her Russian biological dad, her mother's new husband, and the man she grew up believing to be her dad. Far, far away: Sofia, pictured above in her Siberian exile, begged her mother repeatedly to return - in vain . It was at the age of 13 that Sofia learned about her Russian birth father, and until then she believed her mother's then boyfriend, Farid Soulimani, was her dad. In desperation, during her torment in Siberia, Sofia tracked down her 'father' Farid, who she had not seen in almost six years, through one of his friends, following the global publicity of her ordeal. And while he still lived in the U.S., he arranged for her to take a month-long trip to Morocco to the sanctuary of his relatives, including the woman Sofia called her grandmother. When she arrived back in Russia, she found she had lost her job and she broke up with her boyfriend, fast-tracking her decision to return to north Africa permanently. Now 18 years old, she has moved to Casablanca and has decided to adopt the surname Soulimani She is now taking French classes in a bid to integrate into society. 'It's not a new family,' she said. 'I remember my grandma from when I was a little girl and she had come to visit. It was nice to see a familiar face. 'Everyone is just so loving here. It's nice to wake up every morning to hugs and kisses. 'Right now I am just focusing on my French classes and finally being able to relax.' Sofia said she is in the process of getting her official documentation completed to allow her to stay in Morocco indefinitely, meaning she never has to return to Siberia. And she says her Soviet-born mom  is no longer part of her life. 'Everything was horrible,' she said. 'I didn't have my things, a place to stay, or a job. It was a disaster. I called my dad and he bought me another ticket to Morocco. 'My mum and him had gone through a very bad break up so my communications with him had been completely cut off. Desperate: Sofia sent this message to her college professor mother - but it did not persuade her . 'But his friend got in contact with me and brought the two of us together. He expressed how hurt he was that we hadn't talked in so long, but I knew that he loved me so much. 'He's the only one that I call dad. It was such a relief to finally have my best friend back in my life.' Sofia said she has not spoken to her mother 'for many months' and is not sure if she is even aware she has finally been able to leave her Siberian prison. She said: 'She is no longer a part of my life, I've moved on.' The teenager said she also had contact with her biological father in Berdsk, and revealed she had dropped plans to take legal action against him for beating her. She said: 'I've no idea how he is, I don't talk to him. Right now I have no relationship with him, I have a dad already. I don't need two.' Sofia said she is still desperate to return to the United States, where she has a sister, and is working with an immigration attorney on various options. 'I haven't given up hope,' she said. 'I would love to be able to rebuild a bond with my sister. I don't know if that would be possible but it's something that I dream of.' Roberts could not be contacted to comment on her daughter's situation. But in a previous interview she said: 'Sending Sofia to her father, grandparents, uncle, aunt, and cousin was not an easy choice that we had to make - but it was the right choice.'","Sofia Petrova, now 18, was sent to Siberia by her mother three years ago .

"Barbra Streisand, Robert De Niro and Meg Ryan: just three of the Hollywood A-listers who have stayed at Kathryn Ireland’s French farmhouse La Castellane, 31 miles north of Toulouse, in the south-western Tarn-et-Garonne department. Kathryn, 51, is well known in Tinseltown as the interior designer to the stars. Her client list includes Steve Martin, Lindsay Lohan and, most recently, Drew Barrymore. News of her idyllic Gallic retreat spread when her book Summers In France was published in 2011. It documents life at La Castellane, which is set in 50 acres of glorious unspoilt countryside and has its own swimming pool. The interior designer for the stars has put her 10 bedroom French house on the market for £1.76million . Now, after two decades throwing open the doors of La Castellane to famous guests, Kathryn is selling up and planning to move to Scotland, where a property she has been eyeing up for years has at last come up for sale. Her French house is on the market for £1.76 million. So how did a British designer, who attended Heathfield school in Ascot, Berkshire, where she became great friends with the late fashion icon Isabella Blow, find herself hosting Hollywood stars at her French holiday home? After Heathfield, Kathryn worked with society playboy and nightclub host Dai Llewellyn in London, before moving to America, where she met and married film director Gary Weis. They went on to create the concepts for the pop videos that promoted The Bangles’ hit Walk Like An Egyptian and Paul Simon’s You Can Call Me Al. It was on a holiday in France with Gary in 1990 that Kathryn found and fell in love with La Castellane. She was pregnant with her first son, Oscar, and had just finished working on a video with George Harrison in London. ‘Gary and I were living in Los Angeles at the time, but I had a nesting urge and wanted to buy a house in France,’ she remembers. ‘I opted for France because Gary was used to living in California and hated rain, and we knew that the summers in France would be good. ‘So we were on our way to Provence, driving through the most beautiful, unspoiled countryside – which was not unlike the West Country – and I knew that this region was where I wanted to be. We bought the house from a family who had lived in it for decades.’ Kathryn Ireland, 51, has a client list that includes Steve Martin, Lindsay Lohan and Drew Barrymore . Robert De Niro (left) and Barbra Streisand (right) have both stayed at the 50-acre French farmhouse . Built in 1870, the farmhouse has ten bedrooms. Its 4,500 sq ft interior includes The Pigeoniere, a low-lying outbuilding which includes a dovecote that Kathryn has transformed into cosy guest quarters. Boasting sweeping vistas of the Tarn Valley, the house sits on a knoll and has 360-degree views. Kathryn spent 20 years renovating La Castellane, working with a local architect to create her perfect holiday home. First she stripped away all the linoleum to reveal limestone floors underneath. ‘I was soon turning what had been a modest 19th Century French farmhouse into the functional equivalent of a small hotel that would accommodate all of our friends and family,’ Kathryn says. The farmhouse is situated 31 miles north of Toulouse, in the south-western Tarn-et-Garonne department . After the plumbing, roofing and electrical work was completed, she installed the swimming pool, which has become a focal point for the stellar list of guests who have stayed at La Castellane over the years. She recalls when Streisand and her actor husband James Brolin were her guests. ‘Barbra sent ahead a list of all the things she didn’t want in the kitchen. Chocolate was one of them. Both Barbra and James were utterly charming, and Barbra and I ended up eating a small chocolate cake between us, after all.’ She also vividly remembers De Niro’s visit. ‘He came for dinner, and my three sons were really enamoured with him. He gets on with kids so well, and he taught mine a balancing act they loved.’ When Meg Ryan was filming in Paris, she spent a few days at La Castellane for a rest between shooting scenes. And Conde Nast magazines president Nicholas Coleridge was so impressed that he raved of his stay: ‘If there is anywhere on Earth more fun or more chic, I have not found it.’ For sales enquiries, contact Alexandra Parrish on 00 1 323 965 888, ext 200.","Kathryn Ireland is selling her French farmhouse 31 miles north of Toulouse .

"A British sports therapist raising money for charity has beaten the world record for the most marathons run in consecutive days after completing 53 in less than seven weeks. Amy Hughes has finished the challenge after running 1388 miles in just 53 days to raise money for good causes. The 26-year-old from Oswestry, Shropshire, bypassed her original goal of beating the previous women's world record of 17 weeks ago to set a new precedent for both male and female runners. Amy Hughes beat the world record for the most marathons ran in consecutive days after taking on 53 across Britain. She is pictured at Ripon Cathedral after running 26.2miles on August 16 . The sports therapist raised more than £20,000 throughout the challenge. She is pictrured in York (left) and Wakefield (right) Miss Hughes poses after yet another marathon with two fellow runners in Liverpool on the second day of the challenge . Akinori Kusuda from Japan held the previous world record after running 52 marathons between January 30 and March March 22 in 2009. Miss Hughes beat that record today after crossing the finish line in Manchester where she completed . But while most would look forward to a hot bath and a lie-down, Miss Hughes said she'll miss getting up to take on a new marathon every day now that it's over. 'In a strange way it is sad that it's all ending as I put so much time and effort in and I enjoyed it so much. 'We met everybody around the country and I'm really sad that it's at the end. I will enjoy a lie in though.' The sports therapist stuck to a regimented routine throughout the course of the challenge which began in Chester on August 6. Waking up every morning at 6.30am in a different city, the team ate a hotel breakfast everyday before taking on another 26.2mile stretch. And even a stomach bug didn't stop the 26-year-old from pounding the pavements, with Miss Hughes completing her 35th marathon in Taunton, Somerset, while ill. Today Miss Hughes crossed the finish line in Manchester after 53 days of running. Her effort has raised more than £20,000 for the Isabelle Lottie Foundation, which helps with the early diagnosis of children with brain tumours, through an online donations page.

'One of my favourite parts has been meeting so many great people and having onlookers complete the marathons with me. 'Especially the ones who have never done one before, it was great. 'Everybody has been great. A lot of people have turned up to support us and lots of people have come out to run with us. 'The support has been great and really got me through.' Amy's quickest marathon was in Cambridge where she completed the 26.2 miles in four hours, 50 minutes. Her slowest was in Taunton in a time of eight hours after she spent the night before with a stomach bug. She averaged around five hours 20 minutes for each marathon she completed.

"Denim Llewellyn, 19, has been handed a nine-week prison sentence for obstructing a railway line after he entered the tunnel in South Wales on March 12 . A cyclist who took a shortcut through a busy railway tunnel, causing trains to be suspended for 14 hours, has been handed a prison sentence. Denim Llewellyn, 19, risked his life by entering the half-mile tunnel on the commuter line between Cardiff and Caerphilly in South Wales, at rush hour. Passengers watched the 'reckless idiot' in disbelief as he cycled along the train tracks and ignored their warnings of the dangers involved. The teenager, who is currently at Cardiff Prison serving a nine-month sentence for unlawful wounding, has been handed another jail sentence after admitting to obstructing the railway line. Appearing via video link from the prison, he was given a nine-week jail term for the offence which Judge Eleri Rees told him 'put his life at risk and endangered others'. Prosecutor Ian Colvin said the incident occurred on March 12 this year, and told Cardiff Crown Court that the alarm was raised when the cyclist disappeared into the tunnel. Trains on the busy line were placed on caution at first before the services were suspended while police searched the track, fearing he could be trapped inside. Mr Colvin said: 'Llewellyn was seen with a push bike on Caerphilly train station at 6.45am. 'Llewellyn entered a 950 yard long railway tunnel which caused trains to be stopped completely. 'Anyone walking through that tunnel put themselves and others in considerable danger.' He said the train driver got out to speak to Llewellyn and told him: 'You're going to get yourself killed.' But Llewellyn ignored this and other warnings to get off the track. Mr Colvin said: 'Rush hour trains were delayed by 85 minutes and there had been 23 cancellations costing £6,380.' The 19-year-old ignored warnings from rail passengers and a train driver as he entered the half-mile tunnel . British Transport Police released CCTV photos of the cyclist wheeling along the train tracks into the mile-long tunnel, which later led to him being identified and tracked to London where he was arrested. Huw Wallace, defending, said: 'He has learned a valuable lesson. He apologises to all those passengers who had their time wasted.' Recorder Judge Eleri Rees told him: 'You not only put your own life at risk but endangered the lives of others who had to tackle the problem. 'You were obstinate and ignored warnings. There was an arrogance in the way you acted, causing disruption and inconveniences to others,' Llewellyn cycled off the end of Caerphilly station platform, causing 14 hours of delays on the main railway line . British Transport Police spokesman Morgan Andrews said he was shocked by the incident and the risk taken by Llewellyn. He said: 'I am genuinely shocked to see that, despite our constant warnings some people are still willing to risk their lives by trespassing on the tracks. 'This was absolutely senseless behaviour and I cannot overstate just how dangerous it is.' Llewellyn's nine-week sentence will run consecutive to the nine-month sentence he is currently serving, which was imposed last month.","Denim Llewellyn risked his life by entering the railway tunnel in South Wales .

"An ax-wielding man is on the loose following an unprovoked attack on a Washington, D.C. cop just days after a rookie NYPD officer was hacked by a radical Muslim convert while on patrol. The officer was sitting in a marked police car when the suspect shattered the driver's side window at 3.20am on Friday morning. Following the ambush, the officer chased the subject and tackled him to the floor, but the suspect was able to escape. Unprovoked: The officer was sitting in a marked police car when the suspect shattered the driver's side window at 3.20am on Friday morning in Washington, D.C. Officials in the District of Colombia stressed there was no evidence linking the two attacks, but contacted the New York City police's counter terrorism unit, who have now put their officers on high alert. The department released an advisory saying uniformed officers saying they should 'remain vigilant' and approach all situations 'tactically'. According to the New York Daily News they will not be allowed to patrol alone, with officials fearing they could be targeted by terrorists in random attacks. Last Thursday, Zale Thompson targeted a group of four rookie officers while they were out on patrol in Jamaica, Queens. Photographer Dominick Williams spotted the officers and asked them to stand for a picture. Seconds later, Zale Thompson ran up to the cops - who where standing against a wall in Jamaica, Queens - and started swinging a sharp hand ax. Officer Kenneth Healey, 25, was taken to the hospital in critical condition, but is expected to survive the injury. Scene: Following the ambush, the officer chased the subject and tackled him to the floor, but the suspect was able to escape . Washington, D.C, Police Chief Cathy Lanier said: 'A lot of these radical organizations, terrorist organizations are very vocal about targeting first responders. It's no secret. It's not new. But it certainly has ramped up,' Lanier said. 'We're on extremely high alert.' Lanier said she spoke with John Miller, New York City's top counterterrorism official, to go over any investigative details that might be helpful. The officer spotted the man briefly before the attack and believed he was carrying a baseball bat, Lanier said. The officer drove into an alley in an attempt to follow him but did not see the man again until the ax hit the car, Lanier said. The officer chased the man and tackled him and was injured in the struggle, police said. Police don't have a good description of the man, and Lanier said investigators were pursuing 30 to 40 leads, including some generated by tips from the public. The FBI offered help with the investigation if needed. Fanatic: Last Thursday Muslim convert Zale Thompson attacked a group of four rookie NYPD cops in Jamaica Queens, critically injuring one .

"Tracked down: A new documentary has heard from FBI agents who have revealed how Boston mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger was finally captured thanks to a stray cat and a boob job . For 14 years, America's most-wanted criminal James 'Whitey' Bulger and his moll Catherine Greig evaded capture by posing as any other elderly couple in a low-key suburb of LA. Now the FBI has revealed for the first time how the pair were finally tracked down when two vastly different pieces of the jigsaw came together to out them - her love of a stray cat and her vanity as a younger woman when she opted for a boob job. Bulger, a notorious Boston underworld kingpin was jailed for life earlier this month after a 40-year career of murder, extortion, money-laundering, arms trafficking and drug dealing. The 84-year-old was arrested in 2011 after years on the run at the apartment he shared with Greig in Santa Monica, where residents told how the couple blended in like all the other retired couples. Speaking to 60 Minutes on CBS News, neighbour Barbara Gluck remembered how Greig always fed a stray cat after its owner had died. She said: 'She would pet it, you know, and be sweet to it and she put a plate of food like out here. She loved the cat.' Bulger had been a great source of . embarrassment for the FBI after he had infiltrated the Boston office of . the bureau and bought off agents who protected him. They gave him the tip that allowed Bulger to flee just days before he was to be indicted in 1995. Some feared he would never been caught. The film heard from FBI agents who told how they had struggled to find a workable lead for ten years - nor did they have any good photographs of the pair. They were aware of the couple's love of animals, but appeals to veterinarians proved unsuccessful. There had also been reports that Greig had once had breast implants and other plastic surgery in Boston before they fled the city, and, grasping at straws, they turned to cosmetics surgeons in the hope of a clue. Posing as any other retired couple: Whitey Bulger spent 16 years on the run with his . girlfriend Catherine Greig (pictured together . here in an undated photo) Spotted: Greig and Bulger were captured in 2011 in their then-apartment in Santa Monica, California . To their astonishment, one came from Dr Matthias Donelan, who not only found her file in storage - but crucially, photographs. Agent . Tommy MacDonald, who joined the Bulger taskforce in 2009, told the . programme called The Gaskos: 'I was trying to leave the office a little . early to catch one of my kids' ballgames. 'And I said, ""Well, listen - I'm gonna swing by in the morning and pick those up."" 'And . they said to me - ""Do you want the photos too?"" 'And I said ""You have . photos?"" And they said, ""Yeah, we have photos."" I said, ""We'll be there . in 15 minutes.""' Armed with . the picture, the FBI decided to switch strategy to focus on finding . Greig and created public service announcements on daytime talk shows . aimed at women. Then they got a call from a neighbour. Deputy U.S. Marshall Neil Sullivan, who took the lead, said: 'The tipster specifically . described that they were caring for this cat and their love for this . cat. 'So that was just . one piece of the puzzle on the tip that added up to saying ""if this . isn’t them it’s something we better check out immediately because it . sure sounds like them.""' Bulger disappeared in 1995 as law enforcement agencies were about to arrest him . When officers closed in, more . than $822,000 and 30 guns were found hidden in the walls of the . couple’s rent-controlled apartment, where they had been living there . under assumed identities with Grieg running errands, buying her aging . lover’s medication and paying bills. Bulger . was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month for his murderous . reign of terror in the 1970s and '80s, bringing to a close a case that . exposed FBI corruption so deep that many people across the city thought . he would never be brought to justice. He . was defiant to the end, calling his trial on racketeering charges a . sham and refusing to testify or provide information to probation . officials preparing a sentencing report for the judge. The . jury convicted Bulger in 11 of the 19 killings he was charged with . participating in, but acquitted him of seven and could not reach a . conclusion on an eighth. Greig was sentenced separately to eight years for aiding and abetting him.","Boston crime lord tracked down in LA suburb after 16 years on the run .

"Former Labour minister Denis Macshane, who was jailed for fiddling his expenses, has welcomed news that thousands of pieces of paperwork relating to the MPs expenses scandal have been shredded. The ex-MP, who served six weeks of a six-month sentence for fraudulently claiming £13,000, said he was 'so glad' that records of claims made before 2010 had been destroyed so that other politicians 'won't face difficulties'. The disposal of the documents led to accusations the Parliamentary authorities, and the Speaker, John Bercow, are trying to avoid any further scrutiny of the claims. Former Labour minister Denis MacShane was jailed two days before Christmas after pleading guilty to false accounting by filing 19 fake receipts for 'research and translation' services . Today he wrote on Twitter how he was pleased that all records of expense claims from before 2010 had been destroyed to prevent other politicians facing 'difficulties' Documents are routinely being destroyed after three years, under arcane rules known as the Authorised Records Disposal Practice. Details of the practice emerged after members of the public wrote to the standards watchdog, Kathryn Hudson, to raise concerns about their MP's claims only to be told there can be no investigation due to lack of evidence. Writing on Twitter today, Mr MacShane said: So all records of MPs exes prior to 2010 have been destroyed. Bit late for me but so glad for others that they won't face difficulties.' MacShane, 65, pleaded guilty to false accounting by filing 19 fake receipts for 'research and translation' services and was jailed two days before Christmas 2013. A House of Commons spokesman told the Daily Telegraph last night that the rules were designed to comply with the Data Protection Act – a law which protects individuals' private information. The comments will raise concerns that privacy of MPs is being used as an excuse to delete potentially damaging information - and remove the chance of future investigations. Under the same set of guidelines, the pay, discipline and sickness records of Commons staff are kept until their 100th birthday and thousands of other classes of official documents on the day-to-day running of the House are stored indefinitely in the Parliamentary Archive. Documents relating to the MPs expenses scandal have been shredded, leading to accusations  Parliamentary authorities, and the Speaker, John Bercow (pictured), are trying to avoid any further scrutiny of the claims . A disk electronic containing copies of scanned receipts, expenses forms and correspondence which were reported on by the Daily Telegraph in 2009 remains with the paper. It is now thought to be the last remaining record. Expenses documents were leaked following a High Court case battle by the Commons authorities to prevent the release of the information. Details of the deletions prompted the suggestion last night that police could no longer launch 'cold case' investigations like that which undermined Maria Miller (pictured) Details of the deletions prompted the suggestion last night that police could no longer launch 'cold case' investigations like that which undermined Maria Miller. The former Culture Secretary resigned in April and apologised to the Commons after Mrs Hudson ruled she had wrongly claimed thousands of pounds in mortgage payments between 2005 and 2009 on a home occupied by her parents. The case was first uncovered by the Telegraph in 2012. Details of the deletions came after Tory activists the watchdog to investigate accommodation claims worth £103,000 made by Isle of Wight MP Andrew Turner, between 2004 and 2010. They alleged he improperly designated the five-bedroom island home he shares with his partner as his 'second home' while telling the fees office that a one-bedroom flat in London was his main home. The MP insisted his claims were audited and found in compliance with the rules at the time. Mrs Hudson, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards said the allegation was 'serious', but refused to investigate, citing 'availability of evidence'. She added: 'All records relating to expenses claims before 2010 have now been destroyed. 'No unredacted information is now available here nor any notes of conversations or advice given to Mr Turner which might establish the facts,' she wrote. A House of Commons spokesman said the policy on destroying MPs' expenses records was 'long-standing', but it was originally set by the Members Estimate Committee, which is now chaired by Mr Bercow. John Mann (left), the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said members have been kept in the dark about the policy, while Sir Alistair Graham (right) said historians have been denied the chance to study Parliament's 'worst hour' In the immediate aftermath of the scandal, in March 2010, the committee called for the policy to be suspended and all expenses records to be saved. But two years later, it began deleting again, after an agreement between the three main parties. Only expenses records where inquiries into wrongdoing have already been opened have been retained. John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said members have been kept in the dark about the policy. 'It sounds like MPs trying to protect MPs again. It will make the public very suspicious of what the motive is. The old gentlemen's club is resurrecting itself.' Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said historians have been denied the chance to study Parliament's 'worst hour'. 'There was a strong public interest in retaining this information so that people have access to it, and I'm really very surprised.' Mr Turner said his expenses were independently audited twice in 2009 to ensure the rules had been complied with. A Commons spokesman said: 'The spokesman said: 'Destruction dates for records are prescribed by the House of Commons Authorised Records Disposal Practice (ARDP) policy, and in compliance with the Data Protection Act. 'The retention period for general financial data, of which Members' Expenses is a sub-set, is three years after the current financial year finishes. The long-standing policy on retention of MPs' expenses records was originally agreed by the Members Estimate Committee (MEC).' 'In accordance with the ARDP, the disposal of records relating to Members' expenses claims pre-2010 was carried out on a routine basis at various times each year up to 2014, four years after the House of Commons' oversight of the MPs' expenses arrangements finished.'","Ex-Europe minister says he hopes it will prevent 'difficulties' for others .

"At least 40,000 Australian couples signed up for the intimate challenge of 30 Nights of Nookie throughout the month of September. The couples were set intimate daily tasks and given a Nookie box of goodies before they began their quest with the end result aiming to bring them closer together in their everyday hectic lives. Relationship expert and coach Jacqueline Hellyer says there are endless things that you can do to get in the mood. 'Think of it like a toolbox – lots of different activities and its a different one every single evening,' she said. 'You can use those to help the two of you connect and have a lovely and intimate time together.' The idea came for the challenge came about after Durex’s annual State of the Nation survey revealed that almost three in four Aussie couples want more emotional and physical interaction from their partner and 70 per cent are unhappy with the amount of sex in their relationship. Sydney Swans player Ryan O’Keefe and his wife Tara have shared their 30 day journey and how they coped with juggling looking after their two children and finding the time to spend on themselves. Scroll down for video . Sydney Swans player Ryan O’Keefe (left) and his wife Tara (right) have shared their 30 Nights of Nookie journey . All couples were given a Nookie box of goodies before they began their quest with the end result aiming to bring them closer together in their everyday hectic lives . WEEK 1: THE BASICS . Tara said the first week was quite challenging to find the time for each other. 'We implemented things like embracing each other a bit more throughout the day,' she said. 'We tried to take technology out and it mean you're not just picking up calls and it’s the simple things but sometimes they are the most effective things.' 'We are addressing everyday as it come and just looking at it quite openly - it's nice to be abel to experiment and work out what works for us and then move forward with that.' Ryan spent five minutes tidying up the lounge room once the children went to bed  to help get them in the mood . 'It was good to just put everything front of mind - stepping outside yourself,' he said. 'We all can be a little bit self-consumed sometimes so it makes you feel good when you are thinking about others and doing stuff for others than just for yourself.' Ms Hellyer said kissing is one of the most intimate things a couple can do – it's also one of the most effective ways of getting in the mood and staying connected . Ryan said he hoped the tasks became easier and more natural as the weeks went on. 'You think after so many years will be easy but when you are forced to do it you think ""why is this so difficult?"".' The couple found the first week was quite challenging to find the time for each other . WEEK 2: TOUCH . Ryan said this week was more difficult than the first seven days which involved communication and that probably your biggest thing in a relationship . 'Tara is probably more affectionate than I am – she enjoys the hug and the touch – whereas I can take or leave it a little bit more,' he said. 'Giving her a massage is comfortable and easy although the other stuff is different but it's good to know what each other's likes are.' Tara said agreed that it was helpful to discuss what each other enjoys to have done to them. 'That’s something that sometimes you wouldn't necessarily chat about as a couple so it's good raising these little awarenesses to these points that you can then get something out of it,' she said. 'Now we are into week two we have been able to roll into it a bit easier.' Ryan (left) admits that the second week was tough becauseTara (right) was more affectionate than he was . WEEK 3: EXPLORE . The couple were hesitant about a couple of the this week's exploration tasks including using a camera in the bedroom. 'I felt this week with using a lot of props – it was OK but it didn’t feel natural – I'm a pretty easy going guy - I don’t really need too much to please me,' Ryan said. 'As you get further into the program – it's more in depth and taking you out your comfort zone.' Tara said her husband was working on becoming more affectionate in the program. 'It's something that he is following through with and being really mindful of - he gives me glimpses of back at the start how he used to be with our relationship,' she said. 'We referred back to a couple of other days we enjoyed in the week and we tried to implement those things again.' The third week involved exploration tasks which took the couple out of their comfort zone . WEEK 4: MOREPLAY . This week focused on different ways to make love and keep the creativity flowing. The task on day 26 of waking the neighbours was a daunting prospect for them. 'Our house is pretty noisy as it is,' Ryan joked. 'But I'm looking forward towards the end when we have special nights where you focus on each other.' 'A lot of times we have had a good giggle,' Tara said. At the end of the four weeks, the couple felt more connected and really in sync with each other. 'Its been fantastic - we’ve been able to take on the challenges more confidently – we are very much on similar pages in terms of the things we like to do in our personal time,' Tara said. 'Its amazing when you focus on something the better you become at it – we have both improved and grown,' Ryan said. Ryan even found value out of the more cringeful tasks. 'The things that do stand out are the ones where you think ""nah these aren’t us"",' he said. 'With role playing – we looked at it and said ""nah it's not for us"" although the good things are the things that work - you also learn from your mistakes so to speak.' 'It's something we have really enjoyed-  the journey has been fun and the results of it has strengthened our relationship and really get back to what it used to be like - I think it’s a great concept, ' he said. At the end of the four weeks, the couple felt more connected and really in sync with each other .","40,000 Australian couples signed up for the intimate challenge of 30 Nights of Nookie throughout the month of September .

"The double murder of an elderly Melbourne couple was nothing more than a thrill kill, a judge has said. Thomas James Hemming, 21, held lifelong fantasies about what it would feel like to kill, the Victorian Supreme Court heard. In the early hours of February 19, the Murrumbeena man acted on them. He put on black gloves and a black leather jacket and stuck a knife he had ordered online in a scabbard. Pictured: Robert Adamson, 65, with wife Cheryl, 60 . Robert and Cheryl Adam were killed. Here, they are pictured with their son, Michael . At 6am he knocked on the door of neighbours Robert Adamson, 65, and his wife Cheryl, 60, telling them he needed to use their phone. Once inside he stabbed Mr Adamson in the back and chest multiple times, the court heard. Mrs Adamson picked up a broom and swung it at Hemming before he turned his attention to her. Prosecutor Gavin Silbert SC said Hemming told police he thought it was better to kill an old couple than someone young. 'He wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone,' Mr Silbert told the pre-sentence hearing on Monday. During his police interview Hemming initially denied his involvement in the Adamsons' deaths but he has since pleaded guilty to two counts of murder. Defence lawyer Damian Sheales said Hemming was a youthful offender who had lived a narrow existence and had Asperger's syndrome. Justice Betty King described the murder as a 'thrill kill'. 'It's terrifying,' Justice King said. 'There's just no feeling. No empathy. No care.' Psychologist Daniel Sullivan said Hemming had a preoccupation with killing. People with Asperger's syndrome are more likely to be victims of violence, than violent offenders, Dr Sullivan told the court. A friend of the Adamsons, Andrew Masters, said the crime is scarier now that he knows there was no real motive. 'There was some suggestion that Asperger's limited his ability to feel for the victims, but I have Asperger's myself and I feel plenty for the victims,' he told reporters outside court. Hemming, who lived 160 metres from the Adamsons, will be sentenced on a date to be fixed.","Double murder of elderly couple was a 'thrill kill'

"Prosecutors in Mexico are under pressure to drop a probe into a vigilante gunman who shot dead two armed robbers when they climbed aboard the bus he was travelling on. Heberto Lujan Fuentes has received a massive outpouring of support on Mexican social media with calls for him to be cleared of any charges. He had joined a gun club and obtained a licence to own a gun after twice being robbed at knifepoint. It is not clear if he also had permission to carry it in public. Heberto Lujan Fuentes has received a massive outpouring of support on Mexican social media after he shot dead two armed gunmen who were attempting to rob a bus he was traveling on . When the two armed men had attempted to rob bus passengers of their belongings while he was on board, he simply pulled out his gun and shot them both dead. Mexico has experienced increasingly high crime rates in the last 10 years, especially in major urban centres, and many are fed up with the failure of authorities to crack down on violence. The incident happened on a bus driving through the Cuauhtemoc borough of Mexico City when the two men boarded the vehicle at a bus stop. As soon as the doors were closed, the men started brandishing weapons and threatening passengers into handing over their belongings. Passenger Fuentes, 43, then pulled out his gun and shot both of the robbers, one of whom - a 23-year-old named Ricardo Sevilla Amador - died on the spot. His partner, who has not been named but is between 25 and 30 years old, managed to stagger out of the bus but died on the street.

"An Argentine woman was confronted by an angry crowd when she married her twin sister's killer on Valentine's Day. Edith Casas, 22, wed Victor Cingolani yesterday in a ceremony taking place less than a year into the groom's 13-year sentence for the murder of model Johana Casas. The bride was pelted with stones and eggs as she emerged from the register office, while her husband, disguised in sunglasses and a beret, was rushed out of the back door to his cell. Killer: Victor Cingolani (right) has married Edith Casas, twin sister of Johana (right) who he murdered . The couple married in Pico Truncade in southern Argentina, the same city where Johana was shot twice in the head days before her 20th birthday in July 2010. Her body was found on the outskirts of the city, which lies around 1,200 miles from the capital Buenos Aires, and Cingolani, an ex-boyfriend, was convicted of murder in June last year. Cingolani was convicted of murder in June last year, when a court found he was a 'willing participant' in the killing. According to The Independent, he told a local news channel on the morning of the wedding: 'I’m getting married because I love Edith. I didn’t think the wedding would have so many repercussions worldwide.' Bride: Edith Casas had to undergo physiological testing ordered by a judge before she could marry Cingolani . Cingolani claims he is innocent and is appealing against the conviction. Another man, Marco Diaz, who was sharing a house with Johana when she died, is also accused of the kill and will be tried in May. Edith also argues her husband is innocent, and last year said: 'I’m going to get married to the person I love and not the person who killed my sister.' Model: Johana died days before her 20th birthday . She added: 'Victor is not a violent person and I’m not mad. We’ve got no doubts about what we’re doing. We love each other.' The couple, who have been together for five years, had planned to Wed last December but a judge, Gabriela Zapat, ordered it to be suspended at the last minute following a request by the twins' mother, Marcelina . Edith was ordered to undergo psychological testing before the ceremony could be given the go ahead, and the date was set when doctors found no signs of 'mental dysfunction'. Cingolani's sister and brother-in-law acted as witnesses during the 20-minute ceremony but Edith's relatives, who have disowned her, shunned the service. Her family have said Edith is guilty of a 'terrible betrayal', and her father Valentín Casas told Clarín newspaper in December: 'Johana is with God and Edith is with the Devil.' Marcelina has claimed her daughter is suffering psychological problems and said she feared Cingolani would take her life too. She said: 'There are no words to describe what Edith is going to do. She’s guilty of a terrible betrayal.' Lucas Chacon, Cingolani’s defence lawyer, has previously insisted: 'The cigarette butts found near Johana’s body belonged to Diaz and all the witnesses have incriminated him. 'I can understand Johana’s parents’ attitude. But Edith is not marrying a killer or anything like it. 'She is marrying a man who was convicted in a judicial scandal. All we want is justice.'","Victor Cingolani is serving 13 years in jail for the murder of Johana Casas .

"Women in the small town of Barbacaos, southwest Colombia, have reportedly gone on their second sex strike in two years, demanding that the roads to their remote region be repaved. Dubbed the 'crossed legs movement,' the women in the town are refusing to have sex with their significant others until the road that . connects their small, isolated town to the rest of the country is repaired, according to Colombia-based reporter John Otis. And it might have actually worked.

A 77-year-old woman has spoken of her 30 year battle with breast cancer, in which she discovered a tumour almost every six years. Pam Corrigan discovered her first tumour in 1984 and has since undergone a double mastectomy and countless rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She has even had cancer in the scar tissue left by her mastectomy. Over the past three decades, she has lived through innovations in treatment for the disease and helped pioneer experimental drugs which have since become commonplace. She has also raised more than £1 million for specialist treatment centres for breast cancer. Despite various different treatments, including three different drugs, her cancer has repeatedly returned over the decades. Mrs Corrigan, an accountant who lives in Bristol, is now in remission from her latest bout of the disease last year - and remains stoic and positive about the future. She said treatment of breast cancer has changed dramatically since the 1980s. 'When I was first diagnosed no one spoke about it. We would be kept on a general ward,' she said. 'There was no such thing as after care, it was more like 'we have done our job, that's it. 'No one was specially trained and although you could tell they wanted to do more for you, they had no training, so they were almost scared they would do something wrong. 'I remember going for check-ups in an old hospital and it had cubicles set up in a ward with just curtains around each area. You could hear everything that was being said. 'That was really hard, you didn't want to hear other people and you didn't want to make much of a fuss because you didn't want everybody else hearing about you.' Mrs Corrigan was first diagnosed with cancer after she went to the doctors complaining of a pulled muscle around her breast. Although medics suspected cancer it took weeks to formally identify the disease as the hospital had limited resources, including an old, inefficient scanner. After six weeks she was finally given the diagnosis and was admitted to hospital for a lumpectomy to remove the tumour, followed by radiotherapy. In 1991, Mrs Corrigan set up the charity BUST, which has raised more than £1 million for specialist breast cancer treatment centres. At that time, breast cancer was treated on general wards by general surgeons. Mrs Corrigan is pictured here at a BUST fundraising ball . Mrs Corrigan is pictured with husband Michael, 78, at the Cape of Good Hope in March 2009. Despite finding a tumour almost every six years, she remains positive for the future . Tamoxifen is an anti-oestrogen drug that is widely used to treat breast cancer. It‘s occasionally used to treat some other cancers. It binds to oestrogen receptors, cutting off the hormone so it can no longer feed the growth of cancer cells. A large new sutdy published last year found that  women with breast cancer that keeps coming back may be able to beat the disease by taking Tamoxifen for ten years after surgery. Using tamoxifen for ten rather than five years halves the risk of women dying from the most common kind of breast cancer. The study was described as a 'pivotal moment' in the fight against the disease. Just four years later doctors discovered another lump and Mrs Corrigan was told a single mastectomy was her only choice. 'Having breast cancer as a specific entity was still just part of general surgery, you weren't treated specifically because you had it,' she added. In 1990, she was once more diagnosed with cancer when it developed in her scar tissue. After her doctor 'cut it out and dragged the skin back together', she was put on the then revolutionary drug Tamoxifen. This is used to treat breast cancer and occasionally other cancers. It binds to oestrogen receptors, cutting off the hormone so it can no longer feed the growth of cancer cells. Despite being prescribed Tamoxifen, just a year later Mrs Corrigan was back in hospital again when doctors found the disease in her scar for the second time and she underwent surgery to reform her breast. As she was recovering on the ward she met fellow sufferers Carol Thomas and Margaret Twiggs and they launched BUST, a charity to ensure specialist treatment could be given. All three had been shocked by the lack of support for breast cancer patients treated on general wards. Mrs Corrigan remembers that on general wards, there was only a curtain around a woman's bed so everyone could hear their breast cancer diagnosis. She set up BUST so that specialist treatment centres with separate diagnosis rooms could be opened. Here, she is pictured (far right) at the opening of a centre in Bristol . Mrs Corrigan is pictured with husband Michael in Chile in 2003. In 2000 her cancer returned and she had another mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Through her fundraising (right) she has managed to raise £1 million. Here she is pictured receiving a cheque from St Peters Wives group . They set about trying to help specialist surgeon Simon Cawthorn, who had taken an interest in breast cancer. Mrs Corrigan said: 'We saw how much needed to be done and how good a surgeon Simon was. He seemed much more interested in breast cancer than anybody else. 'People thought you were just on a conveyor belt and the next patient would be along with a hernia or something else. 'He was much more committed to breast cancer, and we thought surely we could do something to make his job easier.' 'We built one of the first breast cancer care centre with a dedicated area and dedicated support nurses so you had a place to go when you didn't get the best news. 'We built the new unit with nice consulting rooms, to treat people in a much more caring way.' Sadly, her cancer returned yet again in 2000 where she had another mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. After being told she was in remission she developed more lumps six years later, and again in 2012. She had surgery once again in September 2012 to remove her lymph nodes completely, and went back on drug Tamoxifen. In July 2013. she underwent another bout of radiotherapy after doctors spotted a 'cancer hotspot' and it is hoped she is now, once more, in remission. Mrs Corrigan said: 'I don't want people in their 40s developing cancer, thinking ""Oh my gosh it's not going to go away"", my case is unusual. 'If when I first had it and they had Tamoxifen or another drug there is every chance it would never have come back. 'My cancer is low grade so it would be easy to stop it, if the advances had been around at that time.' Pictured is a newspaper clipping of a story about BUST when it was set up in 1991. Mrs Corrigan remembers being left on general wards and being treated by those who didn't understand the disease, as well as given unnecessary surgery and inefficient scans .","Pam Corrigan, 77, discovered her first breast tumour in 1984 .

"Every night, 23-year-old graduate Hannah Vickers dreams about the perfect life she deserves. We know this because she has written about it on her blog, complete with dewy pictures of herself. ‘I think about how I’ll have the perfect figure, a nice house, a good job (preferably blogging full-time), a successful novel in the pipeline and my boyfriend and my dog by my side,’ she writes. ‘I’ll go travelling thanks to my blog and I’ll be able to afford holidays of my own, several times a year.’ Scroll down for video . Impossible fantasies: Hannah Vickers thought that when she left university she would have a perfect life . Hannah is unemployed and living with her parents in Lincolnshire. Her website is called Away With The Fairies. Given the gap between reality and these frothy expectations, the name would be laughably apt were it not so tragic. But Hannah is hardly alone in her impossible fantasies. Away With The Fairies could be a tag (or perhaps hash tag) for her entire generation. For it is not so much Generation Y — the name given to those born in the Eighties and Nineties — but Generation Y Am I Not Rich, Famous and Successful? As shaky economic growth leaves many twenty-somethings stranded from the property and job markets, many still believe a life of glamour and opportunity will miraculously materialise for them. But Generation Entitled is heading for a serious fall, say experts. One of the world’s leading psychiatrists warns of the dangers of elevated expectations and lofty self-esteem. Professor Dinesh Bhugra, a former President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says the selfie-loving generation are unlikely to develop the tools to deal with failure because they are used to being puffed up by online ego-massaging. Away with the fairies: Hannah's blog details her lofty expectations of graduate life . He even fears that the inevitable failure to live up to their own expectations will one day trigger spikes in violence, depression and suicide. ‘The difference between young people’s expectations and the reality of their lives is wider than ever,’ he explains. ‘There is a considerable amount of research which shows that the discrepancy between aspirations and what you actually achieve is an incredibly important factor in psychiatric disorders. One of the hypotheses posited to explain high rates of suicide in some countries is when people think they’re capable of something and then don’t make it. ‘Already, rates of depression are going up. It stands to reason that the suicide rate might go up, too.’ Indeed, Hannah is already feeling depressed as she considers the vast, jolting shortfall between her dream and her actual life. ‘I thought I would land a job at a magazine writing about beauty but that hasn’t happened,’ she says. ‘I thought I’d have my own swanky apartment and be living the high life but it hasn’t worked out like that. Two years after graduating, I’m still living at home, with no job, and no further ahead. It’s depressing.’ Worse still, the endless rejections from employers are proving demotivating — the opposite of what she needs. ‘It makes me feel, “What’s the point of getting out of bed?” because I don’t have anything to work for. I’m at the end of my tether.’ After graduating in 2012, Hannah had a string of internships and short-term jobs, at a book distributor and as a marketing assistant, but, so far, her ideal career has failed to materialise. Her parents, she says, are ‘desperate’ for her to ‘move out and get a job anywhere’. But while it would be easy to blame Hannah and others like her for their unrealistic expectations, analysis of the problem shows they are victims of a deeper malaise. Unrealistic expectations: Aged 23, a depressed Hannah is unemployed and living at home with her parents . For several decades now, the mantra spouted by everyone from teachers and social workers to pop stars has been that the key to achieving success is simply to visualise it. Youngsters have been schooled to believe they can do anything and that they deserve a fantastic home, career and relationship. When Britain was booming, such aspirations were perhaps understandable. Today, however, 20 per cent of young people are out of work and 26 per cent of 20 to 34-year-olds live with their parents — an increase of a quarter since 1996. The average age of first-time buyers is now at a high of 29, with two thirds needing help from Mum and Dad to get on the property ladder. Inflated sense of importance: Hannah admits that having lots of followers and posting pictures of herself on photo-sharing sites  massaged her ego . Dovetailing these stark statistics have been two culture-defining phenomena: reality television and social media. The latter, says Professor Bhugra, is the true culprit. ‘Social media feeds narcissism and stokes expectations,’ he says. ‘With the resulting sense of entitlement comes a feeling that one doesn’t need to work hard to achieve. ‘When someone has 16,000 Twitter followers, they can feel as if that in itself is an achievement.’ Hannah, an avid Twitter and Facebook user, admits that having lots of followers and posting pictures of herself on photo-sharing sites Instagram and Pinterest gives her an inflated sense of importance. ‘You get a great response and think, “I’m good at this!” she says. ‘But when it comes to that turning into a job, it’s a different story.’ Compounding the problem is the way in which twenty-somethings present their lives on social media, editing out the reality to convey an enviable lifestyle. ‘For five years I’ve been reading blogs about people jetting off to LA and you think, “Why can’t I have a piece of that?”’ says Hannah. Social media executive Hollie-Anne Brookes, 25, whose own aspirations of a glamorous fashion career never came true, is also affected by this highly-edited showboating — and does it herself. ‘It’s like an addiction,’ she says. ‘Once you’re posting pictures of yourself on Instagram in your best dress, on a crazy night out, the pressure to keep up that pretence is scary, and I’m guilty of it. ‘Tonight I will be reading with my make-up off, but my Instagram will show some beautiful shot of a glass of prosecco and a Jo Malone candle to make it look fancy.’ Hollie-Anne, who lives in her boyfriend’s house in Nottinghamshire, adds: ‘Everything in our lives goes through a filter. We’re too afraid to say, “This is how things really are. This is how I really look.”’ It is a problem which concerns many middle-class parents. Cath Smith, 46, a lecturer in social work, still has her son Jim, 23, living at home with her in Ruddington, Nottinghamshire. Missing out: Jim Smith, who was unable to go to university and lives at home with mum Cath, says being unable to move out is 'disappointing and frustrating' He had dreamed of going to university and becoming a history teacher — precisely the sort of ambition the previous Labour government encouraged. This is the consequence of Tony Blair’s determination that half of young people should go to university, regardless of which jobs would ultimately be available. Cult of the individual: Cath blames reality TV for the idea you can become rich and famous without trying . ‘A lot of Jim’s friends have a fatalistic attitude, as if things will just happen for them,’ says Cath. ‘It’s all very narcissistic. I’m from a background where if you didn’t work hard you got nowhere. ’ As well as the internet, Cath blames reality TV. ‘Big Brother fed into this idea that everyone is special and has a story and could become rich and famous without doing anything,’ she says. ‘The cult of the individual has been coming for some time and is firmly here to stay.’ Jim’s university hopes were dashed after a cycling accident left him with injuries which meant his A-level grades — two Ds — suffered and this combined with steep university fees made higher education all but impossible. Five years on, he works 28 hours a week in a library. He says: ‘I’ve felt like I’m missing out because my friends all went to university. I see them on Facebook celebrating graduations and boasting of their party lifestyle.’ Not being able to move out due to rocketing rents is also ‘disappointing and frustrating’, he says. Yet Jim himself, a sensible and level-headed young man, falls prey to social media. ‘You can’t help but feel a bit self-important when loads of people “like” a comment on Facebook, or if you tweet someone famous and they reply,’ he says. Meanwhile Hannah and her friends continue to struggle with life’s harsh realities. ‘Everyone is feeling like me — disheartened. They thought they’d have gone a lot further.’","Despite shaky economic growth, 20-somethings still believe a life of glamour and opportunity will miraculously materialise for them .

"Nurse Amber Vinson has beaten Ebola. The Texas health care worker, who contracted the deadly virus while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan, has been officially declared Ebola free and will be released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta later today. Her remarkable recovery comes exactly two weeks after she was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital with the disease hours after flying from Ohio to Dallas. Ms Vinson, 29, is the second Dallas nurse who caught Ebola from Duncan and the second to recover. Last week, her colleague Nina Pham was cured and released from the hospital. Scroll down for video . Recovered: Doctors at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta have declared Amber Vinson free of Ebola just two weeks after she was admitted . Even as Ms Vinson steps out in public, dozens of people who came into contact with her - including her family and passengers on her October 13 Cleveland to Dallas flight - remain fearful that they could still come down with Ebola from contact with her. She sparked panic across Northeast Ohio when it emerged that she had visited her family in Cleveland and Akron while possibly contagious. School closed, a bridal shop she visited has had to undergo a deep cleaning to lure customers back and some members of her family remain in voluntary quarantine. She boarded the Frontier Airlines flight with the blessing of public health officials, even though she had a low-grade fever at the time. Local health officials have ordered the 132 passengers on her flight to regularly monitor their temperatures to signs of fever - the first symptom of Ebola. So far no one has been diagnosed with Ebola from contact with Ms Vinson and health officials say the chances of exposure are 'very low.' However, the 21-day incubation period for the disease still has not passed. Ms Vinson was flown to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta the same day she was diagnosed with Ebola at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas . Ms Vinson's family announced last Wednesday that the virus could no longer be detected in her body. Doctors are now confident she had beaten the disease after keeping her under observation for six more days. She was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where she works, on October 14. She was diagnosed the next day and flown to Emory's hospital for treatment. Ms Vinson handled Duncan's blood and other bodily fluids - transmitters of Ebola - while he was under care at Texas Presbyterian. However, hospital officials say she and Ms Pham took CDC-recommended precautions. It is still not clear how she contracted the disease. Ms Vinson is the eighth person treated for Ebola in the United States. Only Duncan, a Liberian national who died on October 8, has not survived the disease. Dr Craig Spencer, a New York health worker who volunteered in Ebola-ravaged Guinea, is the only person currently being treated for the disease in America. He is in serious condition at Bellvue Hospital in Manhattan.","Ms Vinson was the second nurse who treated Thomas Eric Duncan to contract Ebola .

"A foul-mouthed mother of four who inflicted ‘a vile onslaught of racial and homophobic abuse’ on her own children that forced neighbours to sleep in their cellars has been slapped with an Asbo. Jobless and single Lauren Beckham, 31, verbally abused her four mixed-race children - aged from one to 12 - ‘day in and day out’ since she moved into a house in Shipley, West Yorkshire, last July. Beckham - who made her neighbours’ lives ‘a living hell’ by shouting and swearing - was given a three-year anti-social behaviour order yesterday at Bradford and Keighley Magistrates’ Court. Family: Jobless and single Lauren Beckham (pictured with an unidentified man), 31, verbally abused her four mixed-race children - aged from one to 12 - 'day in and day out' since she moved into a house last July . Maxine Hoey, 42, who lived next door to Beckham until she moved out in March, said: ‘I can't even begin to describe what my family have been through since Lauren moved in. ‘Her foul language and abuse towards her children has been like poison seeping through our walls. Every day, all day, for almost eight months, those poor kids would be screamed at. ‘The things she would say are just vile. She'd call them black b****** and p****. She'd call her son a f***** and tell her daughters they were s****. On top of that there was constant swearing, shouting and banging. ‘I heard her several times scream at her daughter and threaten to break her legs. She was always so aggressive. It was awful for us neighbours but those kids are the real victims. ‘I used to phone social services on a weekly basis and ring the police around three times a week trying to stop the abuse but nothing was ever done. It might not be physical abuse but it's still abuse and it was constant - even going on right through the night.’ A thick schedule of complaints compiled by Bradford Council's Asbo officer John Crossland included reports from neighbours shocked by Beckham's high volume of verbal abuse of her children. 'The things she would say are just vile. She'd call them black b****** and p****. She'd call her son a f***** and tell her daughters they were s****' Maxine Hoey, former neighbour . Beckham, who lives on income support and . child benefits, moved out of the privately-rented house in March and . now lives in Bradford, where there have already been similar complaints, . the court heard. Neighbour Carol Gatenby, 52, was driven to complain about Beckham's tirades. She said: ‘It was just sheer hell - absolutely horrendous living next door to them. And since she left, it's heaven.’ She added: ‘Me and my husband were always arguing because we were so stressed and my grandchildren couldn't come round and visit because they would have to listen to the vile language she used. 'Sheer hell': Neighbour Carol Gatenby, 52, was one of those driven to complain by Beckham's tirades . ‘We couldn't sit in our living room . for almost eight months because of the noise and so I felt like the . heart had been ripped out of the home. She had absolutely no respect for . herself, her kids, her home or her neighbours.’ Mrs Hoey, who has three daughters, said . her family were forced to use the cellar as a living room because of the . noise - and on some nights would even be forced to sleep there. She said: ‘She has robbed us of our family life. Since the day she moved in the noise started and it never seemed to stop. We'd get half an hour of peace if we were lucky and then it would start again. ‘She was even verbally abusive to me and if I was in the front garden or street she'd shout and say she was going to kill me and she'd bang on the walls with a hammer. I never spoke to her so it was completely unprovoked. ‘We couldn't use our living room when she lived there because we could hear all her vile language and insults to her kids so we'd use our cellar as a living room. House: This is the former home of Beckham in Shipley, West Yorkshire, where she brought misery to her neighbours . ‘We'd sleep in our bedrooms but on some occasions because we'd get woken up in the early hours of the morning and wouldn't be able to get back to sleep for the noise so we'd sleep in the cellar. ‘When her baby would cry she'd just scream, shout and swear at it to be quiet. It was just a vile onslaught of racial and homophobic abuse against her children. I can't even begin to imagine what they were going through.’ Mrs Hoey said her 11-year-old daughter, who has learning difficulties, would get distressed by the abuse and her husband was struggling to work. ‘Two of my daughters, who are aged just 11 and 15, would have to listen to the filth being spouted. It was bad enough for me to listen to it but children shouldn't have to listen to that. ‘My youngest daughter has learning difficulties and so it was even harder for her to understand what was going on. She'd get really distressed by all the shouting and would often get upset about it. ‘My other daughter would spend most of the time out of the house to try and escape it. My husband works at a bank and he has a long drive to get to work each morning. ‘He was severely sleep-deprived for months and was struggling to do his job. It was also incredibly dangerous for him to be driving long distances without enough sleep. I'd worry about him constantly. ‘It has just been absolute hell for all of us. We'd have to listen to those poor children being screamed at and yet there was nothing we could do to stop it.’ Mrs Hoey said that since Beckham has moved out, it's been ‘heaven on Earth’ in the street. ‘As soon as she left there was peace and quiet,’ she added. ‘We have our home and family life back again and I'm absolutely delighted. ‘To be able to use the living room again and get a full night’s sleep is just fantastic. But I still worry about those kids. Unless they're taken away from her they'll continue to be verbally abused.’ 'As soon as she left there was peace and quiet. We have our home and family life back again and I'm absolutely delighted' Maxine Hoey . Appearing at court, Beckham accepted the order banning her from shouting, swearing, banging and upsetting neighbours. Clare Larton, prosecuting, told the bench that agreement had been reached and that Beckham was prepared to accept an order, which she had contested until that moment. Referring to the three-year ASBO and an application for costs of £300, Mrs Larton asked magistrates: ‘We simply ask you to endorse the order as sought.’ Bill Rawstron, for Beckham, said while not conceding lightly, she agreed it was an appropriate order. Beckham was told she was now prohibited from acting in any anti-social manner within the Bradford district - and specifically shouting, screaming, and banging in a place of residence. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Crossland said the council was worried for the welfare of Beckham's children, but added: ‘We will put the victims of anti-social behaviour at the top of our list.’","Mother-of-four Lauren Beckham, 31, verbally abused her four children .

"Australians have had the highest median wealth in the world for five consecutive years according to this year's Global Wealth Report. Research by the Credit Suisse Group, which analysed wealth trends in countries and regions across the world, has revealed the median wealth per adult in Australia is estimated to be USD 225,400, or $257,704 as of June 2014 - with the median being the centre point between the highest and lowest figures. The figure is significantly higher than the one recorded for the country in second place, Belgium, which has a median of USD 173,000. Australia has the highest median wealth in the world at USD 225,400 ($257,704), according to the 2014 Global Wealth Report . In terms of average wealth, Australia comes in at second place behind Switzerland with USD 581,000 ($664,269) per adult. Real assets, mainly housing, were found to make up 60 per cent of household wealth in Australia, averaging at USD 319, 700 ($365, 929). 'This average level of real assets is the second highest in the world after Norway,' the report stated. Australia was also found to have 4 per cent of the world's US dollar millionaires, with 1,252,000 people falling into the category. Australia was also found to have 4 per cent of the world's US dollar millionaires, with 1,252,000 people falling into the category . However, the country is only considered to have a 'medium' level of 'inequality' as the wealthiest 10 per cent share only 50-60 per cent of the nation's capital, as opposed to the 70 per cent shared by countries which are considered to have 'very high inequality'. When compared to the rest of the world, Australia was revealed to have the highest percentage of people with more than USD 100,000 ($114,460) in wealth. This is due to more than 1,700,000 Australians making up part of the top 1 per cent of global wealth holders, 'despite having just 0.4 per cent of the world's adult population'.

'Household wealth in Australia grew at a fast pace between 2000 and 2014 in US dollar terms, except for a short interruption in 2008,' the report said.

"The German fiance of a transgender woman who was allegedly slain by an American Marine fainted when he was barred from boarding a flight home from the Philippines. Marc Sueselbeck, the boyfriend of 26-year-old Jennifer Laude, was told he was not allowed to board the Malaysian Airlines flight from Manila's international airport because he has been described as an 'undesirable alien' by authorities. He is then said to have lost consciousness and fallen to the ground where he was treated by paramedics and taken to hospital. They accused him of 'gross arrogance' after said he showed 'serious disrespect' after he entered an off-limits U.S.-Philippine compound and pushed a guard to get to  Marine Private First Class, Joseph Scott Pemberton. Fainted: German national Marc Sueselbeck, fiance of slain transgender Filipino Jeffrey 'Jennifer' Laude, lies on the ground after he was refused from boarding his flight to Germany at Manila's International Airport . Barred: The Bureau of Immigration accused him of being an 'undesirable alien' for alleged 'gross arrogance and serious disrespect to Philippine authorities' after he entered an off-limits U.S.-Philippine compound . The 19-year-old from New Bedford, Massachusetts, is accused of murdering Laude in a hotel in Olongapo City, around two hours drive from Manila, on October 11. Witnesses say Pemberton met her in a nightclub and didn't know she was transgender until they were in a hotel room. Suselbeck apologized for his behavior on Sunday, saying: 'I extend my sincere apology for the incident that happened at Camp Aguinaldo on 22 October 2014. I regret that my action appeared as if I was disrespecting Philippine authorities, especially the Armed Forces of the Philippines. That was not my intention.'

According to Rappler, the Philippine Bureau of Immigration confirmed Sueselbeck 'attempted to leave tonight.' But the bureau said: 'His departure was deferred due to a pending deportation case for undesirability . Earlier this week dozens of angry Filipinos gathered outside a military base where a young American soldier is being held accused of murdering a transgender woman, in a protest which ended in the victim's family scaling the fence. Treatment: Pictured being treated by medics after being put upright, he pushed away a Filipino soldier in a failed attempt to meet U.S. Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton, the suspect in Laude's killing . Aftermath: With his arm covering his face while lying on a stretcher, paramedics load him  on into the back of an ambulance and transport him to hospital . His girlfriend Jennifer Laude (left) was allegedly killed by Private Marine First Class Scott Pemberton. He is now in custody accused of her murder . However, Jennifer Laude's family have expressed their anger at Pemberton being guarded by U.S. forces at the base and yesterday gathered outside the base, demanding proof that the teenage marine was really kept there. Marilou Laude, the sister of Jennifer, who was born Jefferey, climbed over the fence and into the base and was swiftly captured by guards. Jennifer Laude's German boyfriend Marc Sueselbeck also jumped over the fence, and was seen pushing an army guard. Laude, who was born Jeffrey, was found dead in a hotel in Olongapo City, around two hours drive from Manila, on October 11. Anger: German Marc Susselbeck, Laude's boyfriend, follows over the gates as the family demands to see the teenage U.S. soldier accused of killing transgender Jennifer . Action: Susselbeck pushed past one of the Filipino guards in an attempt to get access to the base . Laude, who was said to have been unemployed and living off a monthly allowance from Susselbeck, was later found strangled to death there, her head in a toilet bowl. Pemberton was detained on board the USS Peleliu at the Subic Bay Freeport, about 50 miles northwest of Manila, after he was implicated in the death. Pemberton's transfer by helicopter to Manila early Wednesday was agreed by the U.S. and the Philippines, Philippine military chief of staff Gen. Gregorio Pio Catapang told a news conference. He said that Pemberton will be detained in an air-conditioned van, directly guarded by U.S. Marines while Philippine military guards will be posted outside the compound, he said. 'They agreed to put him in a facility which will pass U.S. custodial standards,' Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said. 'We're happy with this because he's a suspect in a crime that was committed in our country.' Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, who has described Laude's death as tragic, said that the arrangement showed 'mechanisms are in place so that justice can be served,' adding there was strong cooperation between the treaty allies. Philippine and U.S. authorities engaged in a high-profile custody battle over another U.S. Marine, Daniel Smith, who was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison on charges of raping a Filipino woman after a night of drinking in 2005, also at the Subic freeport. Smith was held at the U.S. Embassy in Manila until a Philippine appeals court overturned his conviction in 2009, allowing him to leave the country amid anti-U.S. protests. In the latest case, Philippine police and witnesses said Pemberton and Laude met at a bar in the city of Olongapo on October 11, then went to a hotelroom where Laude's body was later found in the bathroom. She had apparently been drowned in the toilet bowl, according to police Chief Inspector Gil Domingo. U.S. Pacific Commander Adm. Samuel Locklear has ordered Pemberton's amphibious assault ship, which joined large-scale combat exercises with Filipino forces that ended October 10, to stay in the Philippines until the investigation was completed. Under the Visiting Forces Agreement, which allows U.S. forces to conduct combat drills in the country, the Philippines can prosecute American service members, but the U.S. has custody over them 'from the commission of the offense until completion of all judicial proceedings.' Tragedy: Jennifer's mother Julita Laude cries in front of the coffin of her daughter during her funeral in Olongapo City, Zambales province north of Manila . Mourning: Relatives of  Jennifer Laude, including her sister and her German boyfriend, walk during her funeral march in Olongapo City . Protest: Students gather for a rally at the University of the Philippines campus at suburban Quezon city, northeast of Manila, to demand justice for Jennifer . The Philippine Supreme Court, however, ruled in 2009 that convicted U.S. military personnel must serve any sentence in Philippine detention. Left-wing activists and nationalist Filipinos have cited the custody provision as proof that the accord was lopsided in favor of the U.S. and undermines the sovereignty of the country, which was an American colony until 1946. Left-wing groups have staged small protests at the U.S. Embassy in Manila and at the Subic wharf where the USS Peleliu is moored, demanding Washington to turn over Pemberton to Philippine authorities for prosecution and detention and calling for the 1998 agreement's abrogation. President Benigno Aquino III on Monday defended the agreement, saying a crime can happen anywhere and 'the sin of one person' should not reflect on the entire country. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that Washington seeks no special privilege for the suspect but only protection of his rights.

"My Little Ponies were the magical equine toys introduced in 1983 to the delight of small girls around the world. Now the childhood classic is back - and it's found a surprisingly masculine (and much older) fan base second time around. Meet the 'bronies', an 80 per cent male group of My Little Pony fans, who love the toy and the TV spin-off so much, they spend their lives dressing up as their equine heroes. The mane event: Bronies dressed in colourful equine-inspired outfits outside the BUCK brony convention . The bronies, most of whom are aged between 18 and 35, also express their love for My Little Pony by writing poetry and fan fiction, creating pony-themed avatars and by attending conventions, one of the largest of which is held in Manchester. Now a new documentary has gone behind the scenes at BUCK, the British brony convention that attracts hundreds of My Little Pony fans living in the UK and Europe. One regular attendee is 'Cheesey Burger', the 23-year-old head of the 'Manechester' bronies, who hails from Salford and says he loves everything about My Little Pony. '16 to 25 year old males watching a show about ponies from a little girl’s show in 1985...' he muses. 'You’d . normally think that that would be weird. 'But then I am weird myself, so I . mean I watched it and I loved it and I can understand totally why . anyone would get behind it.' Dressing up: A brony dressed as a male version of Princess Celestia (left) and another with his favourite pony . Inspiration: My Little Pony was originally launched in 1983 as a toy for small girls but now has broader appeal . Boys' club: The Brony fandom is 80 per cent male with female bronies known as 'Pegasisters' 'It’s innocence, it’s fun, it’s . colourful, it’s, you know, it’s a nice escape from the grey world as it . were for the time being and it brings me joy,' says 48-year-old brony, Neil. 'It’s something I like to share and if I can share something good and, you know, make people happy, then great.' Others say the sympathetic story lines covering issues such as friendship and fitting in is what most appeals to them. 'It’s not just about world problems, . just about simple problems,' says one. 'It's things like having no friends, trying to find . friends, finding out about friendship is magic.' 'Friendship is Magic', the strapline for the My Little Pony cartoon relaunched in 2010, is something you hear about a lot during a visit to BUCK and for many bronies, neatly encapsulates why they love the show so much. Cheers! As with the TV show, the brony slogan is Friendship is Magic and making friends their purpose . Entertaining: Most bronies, seen here with presenter Darren McMullen, got into it after seeing the 2010 cartoon . Exciting: During BUCK, bronies enjoy Q&A sessions and workshops, and get to meet likeminded fans . 'For me it was ironic at first,' says 'Spitfire', a teenage brony. 'But then I kind of got into it, you know, I appreciated the message within it. 'It’s got decent values to go by and you don’t find that on TV much anymore.' While it's easy to see why sympathetic tales of friendship featuring strong female characters might appeal, what's harder to understand is the 'cosplay' element of bronydom. Although not every brony feels the need to dress up, others choose to express themselves via colourful costumes, many accessorised with horns, that reference their favourite pony character. 'Bronies usually only dress up during meet ups or conventions to celebrate their mutual fandom, so it's not unlike a comicon event,' explains Ariel White, who produced the upcoming episode of Outsiders with Darren McMullen that features the bronies. 'This . is not Peter Pan syndrome but a passion for a show that symbolises . friendship amongst those who often find it hard to make friends. Avatar: Michael Clark dressed as his avatar, Vinyl Scratch (left), and fellow brony Rob Arnold as Princess Luna . Magic! Presenter Darren McMullen with brony Michael Clark (left), dressed as his alter ego, Vinyl Scratch . Quirky: Brony Shane Jennings as his avatar, R-Dash 5000 and right, bronies watching a show . 'Often . these young men spend much of their social interaction online and . following the rerelease of the cartoon in 2010, the unlikely and often . lonely fans found each other thus creating this subculture. 'We’re very accepting of everything, . because you know, people come from all walks of life here,' adds Cheesey. 'At the end of . the day we do watch a little girl’s show.' And in an echo of White's comments, more say becoming a brony has given them a sense of security as well as a place where they feel accepted and fit in. 'A lot of people [at BUCK], I kind of feel would have very low self-esteem on a normal day,' explains one. 'They find it hard to make friends, and this is where they feel comfortable.. . They can interact with people, they can talk with people and it gives them a confidence boost. They feel as if they’re a part of something.' 'The fandom simply wants to find like-minded people whom they can become friends with,' adds White. 'At the end of the day, it's all about their key message: Friendship is Magic.' The bronies appear on Outsiders with Darren McMullen, Friday at 10pm on the National Geographic Channel.","Bronies are male fans of My Little Pony, a TV show based on the 80s toy .

"A tooth from a Tyrannosaurus Rex proves the creatures were active hunters that engaged in predatory behaviour instead of scavenging for carcasses, American scientists have said. The four centimetre-long tooth was left embedded in the tail of plant-eating Hadrosaur. Some 65 million years later, scientists discovered it stuck between two of the Hadrosaur's fossilised vertebrae. Scientists from the University of Kansas (pictured) have discovered a T-Rex tooth embedded in the tail of a plant-eating Hadrosaur, which they claim proves that the fearsome dinosaur was an active predator and not a scavenger . Healed bone had grown around the tooth, fusing the vertebrae together, indicating the creature had a lucky escape. The Hadrosaur may have lived for months or even years after almost becoming a T-Rex meal. More importantly for dinosaur experts, the tooth provides strong evidence that the T-Rex was actively pursuing living prey. Opinion is still divided over the dining habits of the fearsome meat-eater, which sported pointed, bone-crunching teeth up to nine inches long. In films such as Jurassic Park, the T-Rex is portrayed as a terrifying, merciless hunter. But some scientists believe in reality it mainly fed on the carcasses of already dead animals and had more in common with hyenas than lions. However, the new discovery from a rock formation known as Hell Creek in South Dakota, US, does not conjure up a picture of a lazy scavenger. It suggests the Hadrosaur was fleeing for its life when the young T-Rex's jaws snapped on its tail. The four centimetre-long tooth (pointed out using a pencil) was left embedded in the tail of plant-eating Hadrosaur. Two fused fossilised vertebrae are pictured. The Hadrosuar's healed bone had grown around the tooth, indicating the creature had a lucky escape . A US team led by Dr David Burnham, from . the University of Kansas, wrote in the journal Proceedings of the . National Academy of Sciences: 'The fused vertebrae and embedded tooth . are the result of an attack on a live hadrosaur, not the scavenging of a . carcass, and represent unequivocal evidence of a predator-prey . relationship. 'We now have conclusive evidence that T-Rex indeed engaged in predatory behaviour. 'Whereas previously cited fossil evidence, such as isolated tooth marks, might have been easily misconstrued as the result of scavenging behaviour...our specimen includes the identities of the prey animal and the attacker, and the fact that the prey was alive when attacked. 'Moreover, the position of the injury - the tail - suggests that T-Rex could possibly have engaged in pursuit predation.' The scientists pointed out that the position of the tooth was consistent with present-day pursuit attacks by predators. For example, African lions had been observed initially targeting the hindquarters of a prey animal in order to immobilise it. 'This Hadrosaur escaped and began to heal around the tooth lodged in its caudal vertebrae, providing evidence of the attack and the identity of the attacker,' the researchers added. The scientists believe that they have 'conclusive evidence' that T-Rex indeed engaged in predatory behaviour. Whereas fossils of tooth marks might have been misconstrued as the result of scavenging behaviour, the new fossil shows the identities of the prey animal and the attacker. An artist's impression of young T-Rex is pictured . 'Such evidence is rare in the fossil record for good reason - prey rarely escapes.' It was possible that many T.-Rex bite marks found on other fossils were not associated with bone healing because the prey had been killed, they said. The fact that the Hadrosaur got away did not necessarily mean T -Rex was a poor predator, the scientists argued. Between 45 per cent and 62 per cent of attacks by modern predators such as coyotes and lions end in failure or were aborted, but they are still viewed as efficient killers. The tooth is 3.75 centimetres long and 2.35 centimetres wide at the base and had been broken off at the root. It is identical in size and shape to teeth from T-Rex ""sub-adults"" housed in museums. Comparisons with teeth from two other predators strongly suggested the tooth was from T-Rex and not some other dinosaur.","Scientists from the University of Kansas have discovered a T-Rex tooth embedded in the tail of a plant-eating Hadrosaur .
They claim their discovery proves the T-Rex was not a mere scavenger .
The fossil, found in Hell Creek, South Dakota, suggests that T-Rex chased the herbivore in a bid for a meal in a similar way to modern predators ."
"The charity which raised over $240,000 dollars for abandoned baby Gammy has revealed it will also buy him and his Thai family a three-bedroom home. Hands Across the Water has been assisting the now nine-month-old, who was born with Down Syndrome and inspired a commercial surrogacy overhaul, with medical costs since his plight was first revealed. The funds were supplied by over six thousand people when it was revealed that his biological father, convicted paedophile David Farnell, and his wife Wendy only took his healthy twin sister Pipah home with them to Western Australia. Peter Baines, the founder and chair of the Australian charity has revealed that up to $140,000 will be used to buy a three-bedroom apartment for Gammy and his mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua, as well as her husband and two other children, News.com.au reports. Scroll down for video . Hands Across the Water has revealed they will buy a three-bedroom hose for baby Gammy, his Thai surrogate mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua and her two other children and husband . 'We hope to secure some new accommodation for the family which is close to the private hospital where Gammy will continue to receive care and therapy as he grows,' Mr Baines wrote on the charity's Facebook page. 'The accommodation options also allows the extended family to remain together for support and Goy's older children to remain in their current school.' Prior to this decision, the charity payed for three months of rent in an apartment for Gammy's family. Furthermore, a monthly allowance of $530 will be given to the family for everyday living expenses. The decision was revealed after the charity's founder, Peter Baines, visited the family earlier this month to assess their situation and needs. Pictured: Goy and her three children, including Gammy, with Mr Baines . 'In addition to the proposed accommodation solution, funds will be provided to the family on a monthly basis ensuring Gammy has all that he needs,' Mr Baines continued. 'Hands General Manager will remain in weekly contact with Goy to oversee the distribution of funds in the early days and also facilitate the roll out of the medical care plan for Gammy.' Mr Baines told the Sydney Morning Herald that this allowance will mean Goy can stop working and instead take care of Gammy full-time. The decisions were made following a visit Mr Baines paid to Gammy and his family on September 22. Goy (left) will also receive a monthly allowance that will allow her to care for Gammy and her other two children full-time . Mr Baines described Gammy as: 'a strong little boy who certainly appears healthy and full of life' 'I was able to spend the day on the ground in Thailand (not at donors cost) planning the long term future of Gammy. The morning started with a visit and meeting with the Director of the Private Hospital where Gammy was treated for his pneumonia and where he spent 11 days. We discussed the ongoing treatment and the services that are offered by the hospital. 'I then spent a number of hours with Goy and her grandparents along with her older two children and of course Gammy. During the meeting I was able to listen to Goy and better understand her needs and desires.' He added: 'Gammy is a strong little boy who certainly appears healthy and full of life.' Mr Baines said: 'we anticipate the original donated funds being sufficient to see Gammy into early adulthood' 'With the accommodation option that we are pursuing on behalf of the family, the disbursement of income and payment of foreseeable medical costs, we anticipate the original donated funds being sufficient to see Gammy into early adulthood.' Earlier in the year, Hands Across The Water administered $20,000 towards Gammy's medical costs, including moving him from a public to a private hospital, when he was suffering from a lung infection. The charity, which has also been providing food, clothes and other supplies to Goy to help her care for Gammy, has often voiced that they do not believe it is in anyone's best interest to provide the child's family with large sums of cash, choosing instead to disperse it.

"A mother-of-two has been charged with domestic violence after starving her newborn baby to the brink of death and neglecting her two-year-old daughter, police said. Katherine Amanda Mattern, 23, is accused of 'withholding the basic necessities of life' from her seven-week-old son Liam Alexander Lee, according to court documents. The woman, from Burien, Washington mistreated her son for such a long time that without medical treatment he would have died, doctors said, adding that any illness could have proved fatal. Scroll down for video . Domestic violence charge: Katherine Mattern has been accused of starving her seven-week-old baby boy to the brink of death in Burien, Washington . Innocence: Two-month-old Liam Alexander Lee was seriously underfed and had scabies when doctors examined him on May 15 . Doctors at Children’s Hospital in Seattle were alarmed to find that the boy was suffering from severe malnutrition when they examined him on May 15 and called child protective services. Mattern told doctors she thought that her son 'looked a little skinny'. The baby was now being cared for in hospital and his condition had improved. The mother had previously been investigated by child protective services in Oregon over the care of her now two-year-old daughter Abigail Lilly. She left the state in August to move back to Washington to live with relatives. Child protective services in the Seattle area contacted Mattern in February after it was reported that her daughter had scratches on her face, according to q13fox.com. Murky past: Mattern had already been investigated by child protection services in Oregon over the alleged mistreatment of her daughter Abigail, now two years old . The little girl had survived at the filthy home in Washington state, where they lived with Mattern's mother, by foraging for food, it was reported. She was believed to have had better nutrition than her baby brother because she had spent some time in the care of other family members. The home was described by authorities . as 'cluttered and unsanitary'. Both children were treated for scabies . while the two-year-old also had an MRSA infection. Abigail and Liam were now being looked after by the state. Reckless: Mattern allegedly starved the baby boy so severely that doctors believed he would not have survived much longer without medical treatment . Mother: Katherine Mattern's two children had both developed scabies from living at an unclean home . Mattern is reportedly married to a registered sex offender who was banned from having contact with children. Mattern was arrested yesterday and charged with criminal mistreatment in the second degree – domestic violence of her son. She has not been charged in relation to any abuse of her daughter but authorities said that the case is under review. She faces up to five years in prison if found guilty. Bail has been set at $200,000 and Mattern is due to be arraigned on June 14.
