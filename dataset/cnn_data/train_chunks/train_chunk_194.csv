"Washington (CNN) -- The issues of abortion and illegal immigration will be in the spotlight over the next week, but all eyes will be on Texas on Monday for a major player to announce his political plans. 1. Austin or Washington for Perry? Will Texas Gov. Rick Perry run for re-election next year for an unprecedented fourth full term in office? We should find out Monday, when Perry is expected to make his intentions known at an event in San Antonio in front of friends and supporters. Perry to announce political future Monday . Perry was originally planning to announce his plans by the end of June but delayed his decision after he called the state legislature into a special session to try to once again pass a controversial bill that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill was sidetracked by a filibuster a week and a half ago by Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis that grabbed national headlines. The conventional wisdom is that Perry is leaning against another term in Austin, as Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a fellow Republican, gears up for running. And if Perry doesn't run for re-election in 2014, the thought is that he would make another bid for the White House, in 2016. Can Perry overcome his last presidential run? But note that Perry has bucked conventional wisdom in the past. 2. Abortion battle resumes in Texas . Texas state lawmakers on Monday will resume that special session called by Perry, with a state Senate committee holding a hearing on the abortion measure and the full Senate convening the next day. In the state House, Republicans have already passed the bill through committee. It heads to the full chamber Tuesday. Large demonstrations on both sides of the issue are planned starting Monday. Perry blames abortion rights activists for 'absolute anarchy' The push in Texas comes after other states have passed such bans in recent years, including Nebraska, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Indiana and Alabama. Arkansas has a ban in place for pregnancies beyond 18 weeks, and North Dakota has the tightest restriction in the country at six weeks, when a fetal heartbeat can be detected. 3. And another one heats up in North Carolina . The abortion issue will also be front and center in North Carolina, when state lawmakers return to Raleigh this week. The state Senate just passed a series of anti-abortion amendments that were tacked onto a bill that would ban Sharia law. The measures don't include a 20-week provision but would place increased standards on abortion clinics and limit health care coverage for abortions. North Carolina joins states legislating against abortion . The action now moves back to the state House, which has passed the Sharia law bill without the abortion restrictions. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory has expressed concerns about how the Republican-dominated state Senate rushed the passage of the anti-abortion amendments but has not indicated whether he would sign the bill. 4. Rubio has a decision to make . On the federal level, Sen. Marco Rubio is considering a request by anti-abortion groups to sponsor a bill in the U.S. Senate that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks, an adviser to the Florida Republican confirmed to CNN on Wednesday. ""I can tell you that the pro-life groups are asking Senator Rubio to sponsor the bill in the Senate. He's on a family vacation this week and will decide when he returns to D.C. next week,"" said the adviser, who asked for anonymity to speak more freely. Anti-abortion groups push Rubio on 20-week ban bill . Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, said her organization has been leading efforts to recruit Rubio to sponsor the bill in the Senate. ""He wants to, and that's good news,"" she told CNN on Tuesday. Susan B. Anthony List describes itself as a group ""dedicated to electing candidates and pursuing polices that will reduce and ultimately end abortion."" Other anti-abortion groups are also urging Rubio to sponsor the bill. If he does, it would give the measure added media attention, as Rubio is one of the GOP's biggest stars and is considered a possible 2016 Republican presidential contender. But conservatives have criticized the first-term senator in the past couple of months for his big push for a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform package that includes a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. The Republican-controlled House passed a similar late-term abortion ban bill last month, with only six Republicans voting against the measure and six Democrats voting for it. The bill prohibits most abortions for women beyond their 20th week of pregnancy. While the original House bill included an exception for cases in which the health of the mother is in danger, Republicans got strong pushback for not including exceptions for pregnancies that resulted from rape or incest. Republican leaders later added new language to include those exceptions. The measure is expected to go nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate, and the White House has threatened a veto on the legislation. 5. Congress returns with immigration fight waiting . With the Senate passing a bipartisan immigration reform bill a week and a half ago, the spotlight has shifted to the GOP-dominated House. House Republicans meet behind closed doors Wednesday to discuss their next steps. Republican leaders in the House say the Senate bill, which includes an eventual pathway to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants, is a nonstarter in their chamber. House Speaker John Boehner insists that lawmakers will craft their own bill or series of bills, separate from the Senate legislation. Immigration reform looks doubtful in House as lawmakers quarrel . The Senate bill, which passed 68-32, included a last-minute, bipartisan amendment, which called for tougher border security measures, to make the overall legislation more acceptable to Republicans. CBO: Senate immigration bill would cut undocumented flow 33-50% . A bipartisan group is also working on a package in the House, though its proposals differ sharply from the Senate measure by making it harder for undocumented immigrants to get on a path to citizenship. The same day that House Republicans powwow, former President George W. Bush speaks about immigration at his recently opened presidential library in Texas. The title of the event: ""What Immigrants Contribute."" The former Republican president tried but failed to pass immigration reform during his second term in the White House, thanks in part to opposition from members of Congress from his own party.

"(CNN) -- A Cleveland man accused of murder, rape and holding three women captive for about a decade in his home pleaded not guilty Wednesday to the 977 counts against him. Ariel Castro's plea is his second in a month, necessitated by a fresh indictment issued by a grand jury last week. The 977-count indictment added 648 counts to the 329 to which he pleaded not guilty in June. Castro, wearing an orange jumpsuit and flanked by two defense attorneys, kept his eyes closed during most of Wednesday's proceedings in Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. The judge periodically instructed him to open his eyes to make sure he understood the charges and his rights as she summarized them. ""I'm trying,"" Castro responded at one point, looking at the judge for a time before closing his eyes again. Authorities said Castro abducted Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus separately in a two-year period starting in 2002. Source: Michelle Knight was Cleveland suspect's main 'punching bag' The women, as well as Berry's 6-year-old daughter, who authorities say was fathered by Castro, were freed in May after one of the women shouted for help while Castro was away from his 1,400-square-foot home. The judge on Wednesday ordered that bail remain at $8 million and that a previous order prohibiting Castro from contacting his alleged victims remain in place. Castro, a former school bus driver, is awaiting trial at a Cleveland jail. 'Please don't let me go,' Cleveland kidnap victim told officers . The new indictment encompasses all the years of the women's alleged captivity, whereas the previous indictment covered only the first four and a half years, the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office said. Among the charges are two counts of aggravated murder, in which Castro is accused of intentionally causing the termination of a pregnancy. Castro also faces 512 counts of kidnapping, 446 counts of rape, seven counts of gross sexual imposition, six counts of felonious assault, three counts of child endangerment and one count of possessing criminal tools. After Castro pleaded not guilty to the first 329 charges last month, one of his attorneys, Craig Weintraub, told reporters that although some of the charges ""cannot be disputed,"" the plea was an effort to seek a deal that would avoid a trial and take the prospect of the death penalty off the table. Prosecutors have not decided whether to seek the death penalty, Maria Russo, a spokeswoman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office, said Wednesday. She declined to comment on whether a plea deal might be in the works and said that the state will be ready for an August 5 trial date previously set by the judge.

"(EW.com) -- Another day, another English musician getting upset over his compensation from a streaming service. Following in the footsteps of the gentlemen from Pink Floyd, Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke took umbrage with the amount of money paid to artists who allow their music on Spotify. ""Make no mistake new artists you discover on #Spotify will no get paid,"" Yorke tweeted. ""Meanwhile shareholders will shortly being rolling in it. Simples."" Yorke engaged in a Twitter exchange with his longtime producer and collaborator Nigel Godrich, who tweeted, ""We're off of Spotify. Can't do that no more man. Small meaningless rebellion."" Pink Floyd writes an open letter on streaming services . That means that Spotify customers can no longer stream Yorke's 2006 solo album ""The Eraser,"" the first album from Godrich's Ultraista project, or the Atoms For Peace album ""Amok."" ""The reason is that new artists get paid f*** all with this model. It's an equation that just doesn't work,"" Godrich wrote on Twitter. ""Meanwhile small labels and new artists can't even keep their lights on. It's just not right."" More and more musicians have been speaking up about streaming services, who continually swear that their compensation packages are fair. In the eyes of Yorke and Godrich, services like Spotify (or Pandora, another frequent adversary of musicians) devalue the product created by artists. Yorke drove that point home in his most recent tweet: ""For me 'In Rainbows' was a statement of trust. People still value new music,"" he wrote, referencing the album his band released as a pay-what-you-want download back in 2007. ""That's all we'd like from Spotify. Don't make us the target.""

"(Cover Media) -- Nick Cannon is proud of his wife Mariah Carey's ""trooper"" mentality in the face of her injury. Carey dislocated her shoulder on Sunday while shooting her latest music promo for her single ""#Beautiful"" in New York City. Immediately after the accident, she visited New York's Hospital for Special Surgery on the Upper East Side to have her shoulder reset. Cannon was with the mother of his two children when she sustained the trauma, and he is shocked by how strong Carey was through all the pain. ""She's such a trooper,"" Nick told the ""Today"" show Tuesday. ""I was going to rush to the hospital with her, [but she said,] 'You get back in there and finish that video!' Then, after they put [her] shoulder back in place, bandaged her all up, she came back to the video early in the morning and finished out everything."" Apparently when Carey went down she donned full diva attire. ""She was in this nice, beautiful gown, heels on and everything, and was kind of on this platform and reached and slipped and fell on her whole side,"" he said. Cannon added that his wife's injuries were a little more dramatic than initially reported, as the songstress' bones were also damaged. ""It was pretty serious,"" he said. ""Not only did she dislocate her shoulder, she actually cracked a rib and ... she chipped her shoulder bone."" Despite her injury, it's rumored that Carey will still perform in upcoming shows. She is set to sing at a free concert on Central Park's Great Lawn July 13, an event in association with Major League Baseball to benefit the Hurricane Sandy Relief. The singer is currently promoting her album ""The Art of Letting Go,"" which is scheduled for release this year.

"(EW.com) -- No one can question Guillermo del Toro's passion for Japanese monster movies. The fanboy-friendly director, who earned his Comic-Con bona fides by crafting oddball fantasias including Pan's Labyrinth and the Hellboy films, has spoken at length about being weaned on creature double features as a kid in Mexico. And it wasn't just the granddaddy of all man-in-a-rubber-suit behemoths, Godzilla, who cracked open his mind. He also swooned over the more esoteric beasties in Toho Studios' kaiju (i.e., giant monster) stable â titanic brutes like Mothra, Megalon, and Mechagodzilla. It goes without saying that the man's geek credentials run deep. Now, with his latest film, the gargantuan monsters-vs.-mammoth-robots smackdown Pacific Rim, del Toro has somehow persuaded Hollywood to bankroll his tribute to the giddy junk food he grew up on. And that's exactly what the film feels like: a 48-year-old kid playing with gigantic action figures in the world's most expensive sandbox. Unfortunately, his deep-rooted passion never quite makes the leap from his imagination to the screen. EW: Idris Elba as Mandela in trailer . Set in the not-too-distant future, Pacific Rim picks up after a string of apocalyptic sea-monster attacks have reduced San Francisco, Manila, and Cabo San Lucas to dust. It turns out that a breach in the bottom of the Pacific Ocean has ripped open and loosed an armada of kaiju. Humanity is defenseless against their massive, razor-toothed maws and battering-ram limbs â at least until the military's high-tech Jaeger program is conceived. The Jaegers (German for ''hunters'') are 25-story robots operated by two human pilots whose minds are neurally linked in a process called ''the drift.'' The Jaegers are only as good as their operators, who must be able to read each other's thoughts and intuit each other's next moves. Go-it-alone rebels need not apply. But of course one does: Raleigh Becket (Sons of Anarchy's Charlie Hunnam), a hotshot pilot whose brother was killed in a kaiju rampage and who's so wild and unpredictable he might as well have the name ''Maverick'' stenciled on his helmet. It doesn't help matters that Hunnam has to bark goofy lines like ''Stay in the drift, the drift is silence!'' EW: Martin Freeman says farewell to Bilbo Baggins . Silly dialogue is not the most serious problem with del Toro's rock-'em-sock-'em monster mash. We've come to expect a few groaners from our action spectaculars. But do the clichÃ©s need to be piled quite so high? Raleigh is a loner who must learn to trust his new partner (Babel's Rinko Kikuchi) and heed the lessons of his stern commander (Idris Elba). Few of the actors leave much of an impression. And the ones who do (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as a shrill pair of wacky scientists) are grating. Let's be clear, though: The main reason anyone wants to see a movie like Pacific Rim is to watch robots smack the snot out of monsters and vice versa. And that's where del Toro hits the biggest snag. The problem is a matter of scale. Pan's Labyrinth cast such a spell partly due to the freaky details of a character like the Pale Man. The giant eye in the palm of his hand was designed with such jeweler's precision that it was seared into your dreams (and nightmares) after you walked out of the theater. Here, del Toro's monsters are so big, and shot in such unrelenting rainy darkness, that the audience never gets a chance to dissect and fetishize their monstrous anatomies and be swept away by their weirdness. And if you can't be transported by a humongous calamari leviathan with suction-cup limbs projectile-vomiting bioluminescent goo, that's an issue. I don't know if del Toro felt overwhelmed by the pressure of making a megabudget 3-D tentpole for the first time, but there isn't enough of his bewitching poetic touch in the film. In a sense, Pacific Rim winds up being not enough of a Guillermo del Toro movie. It's more like a mash-up of Real Steel and the Transformers pictures. Which is a shame, because the idea is undeniably cool. But I'd be surprised if a kid in Mexico or anywhere else walked out of Pacific Rim with a burning desire to direct a tribute to it when he or she grows up. Grade: B- .

"(CNN) -- Like many things in life, it's going to get worse before it gets better. That lardy layer of humid, sticky heat oozing over the Northeast and Midwest is getting hotter and spreading out Thursday. But cooling rain will wash it away in some places in the evening. The worst of it started out on the National Weather Service map as bright orange spots over parts of New England and Michigan this week. The spots have grown nearly together like a bad rash, forming a seething blotch from Massachusetts to South Dakota. Temperatures above 90 degrees will combine with roughly 100% humidity to put heat indexes -- how hot it feels -- in the 100s. New York City is expected to have a heat index of 103 Thursday. Hartford, Connecticut, along with Detroit and Baltimore, are expected to hit 105, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. ""What makes heat so dangerous is not just the maximum temperature for one day, but how long the heat wave lasts,"" she said. ""New York City is in its fifth day, and we're not over with it yet."" The temperatures are above normal for what is already one of the hottest times of the year, she said. A cold front from Canada will work its way south, bringing some temperature relief to the Midwest on Friday and to the Northeast on Saturday, but also bringing severe storms, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. Sweltering conditions . The heat has already caused problems in major cities this week. Thousands of people were stuck in a commuter train in rush hour Wednesday as they headed out of Manhattan to Long island, New York. In Detroit, some schools are closed for the rest of the week. ""Daily Show"" reporter John Oliver summed up the misery with a joke: ""On my way to work this morning, I saw a squirrel stab a pigeon over a piece of ice."" Health dangers . Extreme heat causes more deaths than all other extreme weather conditions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. It killed over 8,000 people between 1979 and 2003, more than ""hurricanes, lightning, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes combined."" From 1999 to 2009, there was an annual average of 658 heat-related deaths in the country, the CDC says. At least six people have died this summer in the Northeast, health officials in Maryland and New York state reported. A elderly man in Kentucky found dead this week after he wandered away from his home passed away from heat exhaustion, a local coroner's office said Thursday. The hot weather is of particular concern for children, the elderly and people with heart and lung conditions, as air quality plummets while ozone levels soar. Officials advise everyone to stay cool and drink plenty of water. Letting off some steam . Some people could find no relief from the heat and took their complaints to social media. ""Melting. Way too hot in this place to sleep,"" tweeted Morgan Sable from Ontario. Twitter user @annielaa2 in Pennsylvania didn't have air conditioning Wednesday and turned a fan on herself and her cat. ""Getting hot air blown in your face really doesn't help,"" she tweeted. From Toronto to Indianapolis, many people chose not to hide indoors in front of the air conditioner and opted for water instead, flocking to beaches, pools, fountains and splash parks. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Leslie Bentz, Sunlen Miller and Laura Ly contributed to this report.","NEW: Heat exhaustion kills man in Kentucky .

"(EW.com) -- Jeremy McGuire, the 23-year-old ""boat shop associate"" from Texas was evicted from the Big Brother house last night. And even though Julie Chen went easy on him during his exit interview, we didn't think he should be able to walk away without answering some questions. Entertainment Weekly: How's it going, Jeremy? Jeremy McGuire: It's going as good as it can be. I mean, I got evicted, so it's kind of a bummer. EW: How much did you know that you were getting evicted? You seemed when you gave your final speech to the house to know that it was kind of a fait accompli. McGuire: Yeah, I mean it's a small house and word gets around quick, so I mean, I knew at the beginning of the week. And even though I tried to make as many deals as possible, they knew that the only way to get me out was to backdoor me so they took the opportunity. EW: I mean, can you blame them? McGuire: No, I can't blame them. I mean, it's a game, and I respect everybody's game, and to be honest with you, if they didn't get me out then, they probably wouldn't have been able to get me out later. EW: Yeah, it's true. I'm sure you haven't had time to go back and watch, but it almost seemed like Helen and Elissa might've been ready to make a deal with you. At what point after you had that talk with them in the HOH room, did you know that's not going to work? McGuire: Ah, well, I was making deals all the way up to the last day, so I didn't know until the last day. But, Helen had enough respect for me to come up and let me know that none of the deals were gonna be made and I just had that gut feeling. EW: Were you surprised that GinaMarie was one of the people to vote you out? McGuire: No, actually. I told her beforehand to vote with the house so that she could be in a better position. I mean, I knew I was going with or without her vote. It made her cry, but she's a good girl, and I didn't want to ruin her game. EW: No offense, but anything makes her cry. McGuire: Yes. [Laughs] That's very true. She wears her heart on her sleeve. EW: What was up with all the tears? McGuire: This was a very emotional cast. I feel like there was a lot of high emotions, and that house is a pressure cooker, so I think it just made everything a little bit worse. EW: I think had Kaitlin not used her power of veto, you both would actually still be in the house. I think that Aaryn would've gone home. I don't think people would've taken it out on Kaitlin for not using it. What's your sense of what might have happened? McGuire: I don't know. From what we were told, if she didn't use it, she would be going home, so we felt that it would be stupid for her not to use it. I mean, everybody told her that she would either have to use it or she'd be going home because everyone would vote her out for keeping me here. So we did what we had to do at the time that we had to do it. EW: Did you ever think about playing her and somehow telling her that that wasn't the case, so that she would keep you and she would go? McGuire: Ah no. You know, I'm not gonna lie, I fell hard for her, and I didn't want to ruin her game at all. I mean, I would've used it on myself, so I told her to use it on herself. EW: So like you said a couple minutes ago, the house was a real pressure cooker this season, and it's been an incredibly controversial season. How much were you told after you left the house about some of the things people have been saying about the racism and the homophobia and the anti-Semitism and the sexism that's gone on among the contestants? McGuire: Yeah, I was warned a little bit about some of the things. They told me that it's been a pretty hectic time outside the house, but I haven't gotten in to too many specifics, so I couldn't really tell you too much. But I know who I am, and I know that no matter what anybody says, it's not going to change my feelings about myself. So bring it on is all I have to say. EW: I haven't been watching the feeds. I've just been watching the show, but there have been a lot of people that have been watching the feeds, and they've been reporting things that several the contestants Ã¢â¬â among you Ã¢â¬â have said and there have been some homophobic and racist and sexist things that you've said. Do you have anything to say about that? EW: 'Big Brother' adds disclaimer for prejudice . McGuire: Yeah, I'm not racist, sexist, or homophobic, so I mean, I guess everything can be taken out of context. Everybody in there was friendly with everybody and we weren't scared to say it in front of each other, so I'm sure it was just twisted and turned in a way to entertain. But I guess we'll just have to wait and see. EW: Well, I don't know how much some of these words can be twisted or misinterpreted. I think it's difficult to misconstrue hate speech, but what was it like watching some of the things that Aaryn did, like flip over a bed or call Candice ""Shaniqua"" or things like that? McGuire: I mean, it was crazy, don't get me wrong. It was an emotional roller-coaster, and I just had to sit back and watch for most of it. But being there was kind of surreal regardless of what was going on. Everything kind of seemed unreal to me, so it really hasn't hit me yet to be honest with you. EW: When we talked to Nick after he got voted out, he said that on some level when you're playing a game you don't want to rock the boat, but then you don't want to be that person who just stands by idly while someone is making such racial slurs and just saying some really unfathomable things. Did that factor in at all for you? McGuire: Yeah, yeah. You know, I -- like you said, you don't want to rock the boat. I didn't want to get on anybody's bad side, and if it wasn't effecting me or at me personally, I didn't really want to jump into it. There's probably some times I should've stepped in and said, ""Calm down,"" but it's a really crazy time. It's really completely different than you would ever think, so I just sat back and enjoyed the show, I guess. EW: How do you think Kaitlin is going to react to a certain term you used to describe a private part of hers? McGuire: [Laughs] I don't know because I don't know what you're talking about. But hopefully, she reacts well. EW: I guess you'll see. So what's next for you? You're moving back to the boat? McGuire: Yeah, I'm going back to the boat. Gotta continue my sailing and hopefully, sail around South America soon. EW: 'Big Brother' contestant loses job over racist comments . EW: Yeah? With Kaitlin maybe? McGuire: Ah. I don't know 'bout all that, but we'll see. EW: Who do you think is most likely to last longer as a relationship: you and Kaitlin or Amanda and McCrae? McGuire: I think me and Kaitlin will. Amanda's got a man at home, so we'll see about that. EW: Oh, really? Does McCrae know that? McGuire: She's got a boyfriend at home. She might not anymore, but she did.

"(CNN) -- Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl whose struggle for a life-saving lung transplant became a national issue, actually had to undergo two transplants days apart, her family revealed Friday. In some of their first comments since the girl went into an operating room on June 12, the family released a statement detailing the necessity of the second transplant -- and explaining that the second set of lungs ""were high-risk because they were infected with pneumonia. ""They were Sarah's best and only hope,"" the statement added, as the girl remained on a ventilator Friday and unable to breathe independently yet. The original transplant on June 12 at Chilldren's Hospital of Philadelphia reportedly went smoothly but that evening ""... an emergency code blue was announced. Sarah's vital signs had begun descending rapidly as her new lungs started to fail,"" the family's statement said. The girl underwent surgery immediately and was transitioned to a bypass machine that took over the function of her heart and lungs, the statement continued. She remained on the bypass machine -- ""... her doctors prepared us for the probability that Sarah would die, either before a second surgery could take place or on the operating table,"" the family said Friday -- until June 15, when new lungs became available and a second transplant took place. Although the donated lungs were infected with pneumonia, ""Each day since (the second transplant), her lungs have improved on x-ray and have continued to work better and better,"" the statement continued. Her family expressed cautious optimism as they wait for the new lungs to work independently.

"(CNN) -- Earl Lane, 35, used to have a bad habit he thinks too many American men share: He never went to the doctor. Lane made decent money working at the popcorn plant near Marion, Indiana, but his job didn't come with health benefits. A doctor's visit was way out of his price range -- or so he thought. A family member was on the board of the Indiana Health Centers. She told him he should at least get a physical there. The center charges patients on a sliding scale based on a patient's income. Eventually, Lane gave into family pressure. ""And it's a good thing I did. Going to the center saved my life. It was truly a blessing,"" Lane said. ""The doctor tested my triglycerides, and then he tested them again because he just couldn't believe the number. He kept asking 'Are you sure you feel OK?' "" The test registered Lane's triglycerides in the 2,000 range. A healthy person's numbers are supposed to be around 150 mg/dl. An extremely high triglyceride number like Lane's can be a sign of type 2 diabetes. Further tests showed Lane was diabetic -- dangerously so. ""I praise God that He keeps His Hand on me and in this case His Hand came through the Indiana Health Centers,"" Lane said. Community health centers that qualify for federal funding could help some 22 million Americans, many of whom are uninsured. The centers often provide medical, mental health and dental services. For many it's the only access to medical care they have outside of an expensive emergency room visit. And now these centers are going to play an even bigger role in helping people get access to care. U.S. manages disease, not health . The Obama administration announced Wednesday its first big push to help educate uninsured people about the health coverage they'll qualify for under Obamacare. The health care law expands who is eligible for Medicaid and makes insurance available to people who wouldn't have qualified before because of pre-existing conditions. Starting next January, all Americans must have health insurance or face a financial penalty. Open enrollment for state-based health exchanges that will provide this more affordable coverage will start in October. The Obama administration's education effort comes in the form of $150 million. Grants will go to 1,159 community health centers that are spread out through all 50 states. Doctors working in fast-food restaurants . Health centers will use these new federal grants to create bilingual education materials about changes in the law. Money will go to training so that medical staff knows how to sign patients up for insurance. Funding will also pay to hire some 2,900 additional workers who will do specific community outreach. Polls show a large percentage of Americans don't know about the law or how it works. The Obama administration thinks these health centers can make a huge impact in spreading the word. Federally qualified health centers ""are the trusted resources not only of good care but of information in some of the neighborhoods that stand to benefit the most from the expansion of our health coverage,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said. ""The next few months represent an unprecedented opportunity for millions of Americans to get connected to the security, quality, and affordability health coverage provides -- in some cases for the first time ever."" Angela Curran knows a number of her clients at the Community Nurse Health Center will need help understanding Obamacare. The CEO's health center in La Grange, Illinois, provides medical services to people concentrated in the Western suburbs of Chicago. She estimates more than 36,000 people in her area will qualify for insurance through the new state exchanges and the expanded Medicaid benefits. Community Nurse Health Association received a $74,586 grant through the new HHS initiative. Finalized rules let religious groups opt out of contraception . ""There is a lot of work to be done to let people know that they will qualify and to even help them understand at a basic level what health insurance is,"" Curran said. ""These are things many of us who have health insurance take for granted that people understand, how it works, but that's just not the case if you have always grown up in an environment without it. ""We'll explain the essentials like 'What does insurance mean for me?' We'll tell them that preventative care will now be covered. We'll explain how to maximize their benefits and how to look for a doctor in network. This will be a real learning curve for people."" Curran said her center will use the grant to train staff how to help people sign up for insurance. It will also help the center hire an additional staffer who will do a kind of Obamacare education blitz. ""If there is a library event, a park district gathering or a school registration meeting, we will be there letting people know,"" she said. Myths about Obamacare . President and CEO Elvin Plank said Indiana Health Centers have contacted all the hospitals in their coverage areas in preparation for their grant's arrival. ""Since a lot of uninsured folks use emergency rooms for their primary care, we thought we'd target patients there. Our staffers handling outreach will let people there know that they will no longer have to use the expensive emergency room any more to treat their chronic conditions."" Earl Lane, who continues to have help managing his diabetes from the Indiana Health Center in Marion, believes so much in the good that these centers can do, he's joined their board. ""I know many men will forgo their own good health if it means they can have more money to feed their families,"" Lane said. ""But now so many more people will be able to get access to primary care services because of this law, and now because of this grant, more people will know about it.

"(EW.com) -- Young women drove Summit's zombie-themed romantic comedy ""Warm Bodies"" to the top spot at the box office over Super Bowl weekend, while Sylvester Stallone's Bullet to the Head got tackled, leaving the action icon with the worst debut of his career. ""Warm Bodies,"" which was financed for about $35 million, earned an estimated $20 million from 3,009 theaters in its first three days. No, that's not a Twilight-sized number, but no one was expecting ""Warm Bodies"" to be the same sort of blockbuster. Sure, they're both about romances between a teenage girl and an undead boy, but the Isaac Marion novel upon which it is based is certainly popular, but it never experienced the utter ubiquity that the Twilight books did. ""Warm Bodies"" opened with a bit less than the 2009 comedy ""Zombieland,"" which debuted with $24.7 million, but its star was in line with the debuts of both Chronicle and The Woman In Black, which opened on Super Bowl weekend last year to $22 million and $20.9 million, respectively. Much like the latter film, Warm Bodies played primarily to young ladies. According to exit polling, the film's audience was 60% female and 65% under 25. ""Warm Bodies"" earned a solid ""B+"" CinemaScore grade from crowds, and thanks to relatively strong reviews, its legs may not rot away as quickly as other teen-targeting titles, and a finish in the $50-60 million range seems likely. For star Nicholas Hoult, who has a slew of high profile releases â including Jack the Giant Slayer, Mad Max: Fury Road, and X-Men: Days of Future Past â on the horizon, Warm Bodies is a nice start to his run as a leading man. In second place, last weekend's champ Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters dropped 53 percent to $9.2 million, good for a $34.5 million total after ten days. Paramount's long-on-the-shelf fairy tale adaptation cost $50 million. Silver Linings Playbook held strong in third place in its 12th weekend. The Weintstein Co.'s $21 million David O. Russell dramedy fell only 14 percent this weekend to $8.1 million, giving it an $80.4 million total. Before this weekend, Silver Linings Playbook had been running a touch behind Zero Dark Thirty (coincidentally, the closest Oscar race â between Jennifer Lawrence and Jessica Chastain for Best Actress â is also the closest box office race), but Playbook took a decisive lead over the last three days, and it's still on track to finish above $100 million. Joe Flacco Super Bowl f-bomb heard on TV . Speaking of Chastain, the red-haired beauty owned the rest of the Top 5. Her Guillermo Del Toro-produced horror flick Mama continued its lucrative run, dropping 49 percent to $6.7 million. After 17 days, Universal's $15 million film has earned $58.3 million. Meanwhile, Chastain's more serious vehicle, Zero Dark Thirty, dropped 45 percent to $5.3 million. The film has earned $77.8 million total after seven weekends. 1. Warm Bodies -- $20 million . 2. Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters -- $9.2 million . 3. Silver Linings Playbook -- $8.1 million . 4. Mama -- $6.7 million . 5. Zero Dark Thirty -- $5.3 million . The weekend's other new wide release, Sylvester Stallone's R-rated action vehicle Bullet to the Head, got off to an even worse start than Arnold Schrwazenegger's The Last Stand did two weeks ago. Bullet to the Head debuted in sixth place with a terrible $4.5 million from 2,404 theaters and an underwhelming ""B-"" CinemaScore grade. That's Sylvester Stallone's weakest wide release debut ever. The last time a Stallone film opening in over 500 theaters did worse was in 1981, when Nighthawks earned $2.5 million on opening weekend â and that was only from 659 theaters, about 30 percent of Bullet's theater count. According to exit polling, the few crowds that did see the film were 60 percent male and 81 percent above the age of 25. Super Bowl: Funniest power outage tweets . Bullet is the fifth gun-toting action film targeting older men to disappoint at the box office in the past month. In recent weeks, Gangster Squad has earned $43.1 million versus a $60 million budget, Broken City has grossed $18.2 million versus a $35 million budget, The Last Stand has found $11.7 million versus a $45 million budget, and Parker has earned $12.4 million versus a budget of approximately $35 million. (When reached, Warner Bros. did not provide EW with a budget for Bullet to the Head, though reports claim it cost $55 million.) Of course, each of these movies was poorly reviewed, and that may be the main factor in their poor performances, but the weak results also suggest that fantasy-free shoot-em-ups starring older men (many of them Expendables stars) aren't connecting with viewers right now. Yes, Django Unchained is succeeding â it crossed $150 million this weekend â but that has a fantastical tilt to it. The overall trajectory doesn't bode well for Bruce Willis' A Good Day to Die Hard, which opens in two weeks. Lionsgate's Stand Up Guys also opened this weekend in 659 theaters, where it earned a paltry $1.5 million. The film stars Al Pacino, Christopher Walken, and Alan Arkin, and it's safe to say it won't be the biggest hit in any of their careers. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- The number of children living with HIV is slowing down in areas of the world that typically account for the most new infections, the Joint U.N. Programme on HIV/AIDS said Tuesday. That's proof, organizers said, that a program it created to get antiretroviral medications to pregnant women is working. The program is known as ""The Global Plan Toward Elimination of New HIV Infections Among Children by 2015 and Keeping Their Mothers Alive."" It was created by a joint effort between UNAIDS and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The initiative targets 22 countries that account for 90% of the world's new pediatric infections. The program gives antiretrovirals to pregnant women who are infected with HIV in those countries. The medicine prevents the transfer of the virus to their babies. Seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Zambia, Malawi, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Ghana and Ethiopia -- have reduced the number of new HIV infections among children by 50% since 2009. HIV discovery 'will change your life forever' Ghana showed the most remarkable progress. The number of new pediatric infections there fell by 76% since 2009, according to a new report on the program. South Africa had a 63% decline. In South Africa and Botswana, transmission rates between mother and child are now below 5%. ""The progress in the majority of countries is a strong signal that with focused efforts, every child can be born free from HIV,"" said Michel Sidibe, UNAIDS executive director. ""But in some countries with high numbers of new infections progress has stalled. We need to find out why and remove the bottlenecks."" One of the problems may be the small number of women who take antiretrovirals when breast-feeding. The report shows only half of all breast-feeding women living with HIV or their children receive these medicines to prevent mother-to-child infection. There is also an urgent need to improve early HIV diagnosis in children, according to UNAIDS. The goal of the program is to reduce mother-to-child transmissions by 90% and to reduce the number of AIDS-related maternal deaths by 50% by 2015. ""Now we must all continue working together to see the day when no children are born with HIV,"" said U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator Eric P. Goosby. This goal, he said, is clearly ""within our reach.""

"(CNN) -- Paula Calzetta was driving to dinner with Diane Keim last month when she made a wrong turn that put the women in front of a Bank of America building in Cheshire, Connecticut. Keim nearly threw up. In a flash, Calzetta remembered everything she'd learned about the brutal murders connected to that place. They had been jurors in the trial of a man who, after extorting money from a woman there, killed her and her children. The former jurors ended up at that bank on the way to meet the deceased woman's family for the first time. ""They were worried that we had to go through what they went through,"" said Calzetta, 56. ""They were very thankful, and sorry that we had to go through all of that, but certainly we would have all done it again."" Jurors begin deliberations in Zimmerman trial . At that bank, in July 2007, Steven Hayes had forced Jennifer Hawke-Petit to withdraw $15,000, according to police, while her family was being held hostage at her home. Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky were charged with killing Hawke-Petit and her two young daughters. The children's father, prominent endocrinologist William Petit, was tied up and severely beaten but escaped. Hayes was convicted and sentenced to death; Komisarjevsky's trial is still to come. The path that led to 8 terrifying hours for Connecticut family . Serving on a jury for a murder trial such as that of Hayes, or of Casey Anthony, who is charged with seven counts in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, can be emotionally and physically taxing. And after a trial is over, some jurors report symptoms reminiscent of post-traumatic stress disorder, such as flashbacks and intrusive thoughts. Whether you're in the courtroom or at home watching TV, repeated exposure to the details of a horrific events can lead to a phenomenon called vicarious traumatization -- you're so connected to a tragedy that you feel emotional trauma as if you'd been directly involved. ""To see the images that they're seeing of this is overwhelming,"" Nadine Kaslow, a psychologist at Emory University, said of the Anthony trial jurors. ""Everyone's going to have a reason to be impacted by this case. Whether or not you have children of your own, there's no way out of being profoundly influenced."" Jury service is especially difficult because jurors can't share their thoughts about the case or the experience with anyone until after the trial, said Sonia Chopra, a consultant for the National Jury Project in Oakland, California. ""One of the best ways to alleviate stress and anxiety is to talk it through with somebody else,"" she said. ""While the jurors are in trial, that's problematic, because they're not technically supposed to talk about anything that happens in the courtroom with anyone. For the length of the trial, they're having to just internalize everything that they're hearing and they're seeing."" In the Anthony trial, jurors are sequestered, meaning they are barred from any contact with anyone outside the courtroom, and cannot read or watch news of any kind. When confined to interacting among themselves, jurors sometimes form a support system, Kaslow said. ""To cope, to survive, actually, you form these new families. It's a very good survival technique,"" she said. ""The problem is, when you start getting things like hung juries, and all the challenges around that, you can end up in a very problematic situation."" The Hayes trial jurors were not sequestered, meaning they could go home at the end of the day and be with their families. Calzetta takes care of her 90-year-old father and probably wouldn't have been able to join a sequestered jury; but in a way, isolation might have been better, she said. ""In some ways, it might be easier because of the pressure from everyone on the outside that they know you're on the jury. They really want to ask you [about it],"" Calzetta said. Calzetta thought she would approach the trial with an open mind: She would sit and analyze. She had no idea how much it had affected her until a break in the trial before the sentencing phase. She developed a fever and was sick during the entire time off. Going into the next stage of the trial, she had a new strategy: Pay attention to her own needs, too. She had massages, took steam baths and relaxed in other ways. ""You really do have to take care of yourself, because it's real. All this stuff, once you take it into your consciousness, it's real,"" she said. Even though they got to return to their normal lives at the end of each day, Calzetta felt her group of jurors became a family, too, during the nearly two months of the trial. ""After everything was over, I felt almost, like, a loss. They were my everything for those months,"" she said. Keim, 59, had already been through breast cancer when she was selected for the Hayes trial. She believes her near-death illness and her age made her emotionally stronger as a juror than she would have been in her younger years. But the stories and images stayed with her after the trial. She began to have dreams that the Petit daughters were alive and that she took care of them as if they were her own children. And when she returned to her job as a teacher, about a month after the trial ended, she sometimes saw a flashback of the Petit girls' picture in her fifth-grade classroom. ""Just thinking about what it was like right before they set the fire. ... This happens periodically, I see this image of the girls being burned,"" she said. ""Something that I see will trigger the memory of the trial and the pictures."" And when it comes to a tragic case such as this or Casey Anthony's, with a lengthy trial, it's important to seek help when you need it afterward, Kaslow said. ""I think that these jurors need to be very aware that when you get off a case like this, you may need some counseling. This is going to bring up different things for different people, depending on your life story,"" she said. When the Hayes trial was over, jurors had a debriefing with counselors. Some sought counseling afterward, Calzetta said. And some, including Calzetta and Keim, have remained friends. ""When we get together, we don't need to talk about it. We all just understand,"" she said. The trial of Joshua Komisarjevsky, the other man accused of participating in the murders of Hawke-Petit and her children, is scheduled for September. The lead-up to it brings back more memories for Calzetta, but she still plans to attend at least part of the trial because she feels that she needs to hear that side of the story. To this day, Calzetta keeps a photo of Hawke-Petit and the two daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, on her desk. She hasn't been able to go to their memorial garden, which is where the house they died in used to stand, but she hopes to go this summer with flowers. ""It's sort of like opening a wound a little. Your spirit goes into a place that you were before,"" she said. ""There's a lot of pain there.""","Some jurors report symptoms reminiscent of PTSD, such as flashbacks, intrusive thoughts .

"(CNN) -- The National Institutes of Health will ""substantially reduce"" the use of chimpanzees in NIH-funded biomedical research and retire most of the chimps it currently owns or supports, the agency said Wednesday. NIH Director Francis Collins accepted most of the recommendations issued in January by an NIH working group, according to an NIH statement. ""Americans have benefited greatly from the chimpanzees' service to biomedical research, but new scientific methods and technologies have rendered their use in research largely unnecessary,"" Collins said. ""Their likeness to humans has made them uniquely valuable for certain types of research, but also demands greater justification for their use."" The agency will, however, ""retain but not breed"" up to 50 chimpanzees for future biomedical research, the NIH said. Those that remain available for research will be selected based on research projects meeting the Institute of Medicine's principles and criteria for NIH funding. That's in line with the working group's report, which suggested about 50 chimps be kept for potential research needs. Chimpanzees share about 99% of their DNA with humans. Hundreds of research chimps may be retired . The January recommendations were issued regarding about 360 chimpanzees owned by the NIH, classified as either ""research active"" or ""research inactive."" Another 91 chimps eligible for research live at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio. Officials said in January the NIH supports their maintenance but could not itself retire the animals. A separate group of 219 NIH-supported chimpanzees was previously retired and lives at Chimp Haven Inc. in Keithville, Louisiana, or the New Iberia Research Center at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Chimp Haven operates the Federal Sanctuary System, established in 2002 and overseen by the NIH. About 150 chimps are in the sanctuary system. The Texas Biomedical Research Institute, however, said it was ""disappointed"" in the NIH response to the recommendations. While it agrees with chimps should be provided with ""an appropriate environment,"" and said some important biomedical research can be conducted with a pool of 50 chimps, ""this arbitrarily chosen number is not sufficient to enable the rapid development of better preventions and cures for hepatitis B and C, which kill a million people every year,"" the institute said. Fifty chimps is also not enough to ensure progress in testing aimed at treating autoimmune diseases and some forms of cancer, it said, or even to research prevention and cures of diseases including Ebola hemorrhagic fever and chimpanzee AIDS, ""which are contributing to the extinction of chimpanzees and gorillas."" As the number of available chimpanzees drops below 50 as the animals die due to natural causes, the pace of research ""will be slowed even more, and human and chimpanzee lives will be lost unnecessarily due to delays in bringing new drugs and vaccines to market,"" the institute said in a statement. New Mexico chimps won't be used in additional research, pending review . The IOM, it noted, recognized that new or re-emerging diseases may require the use of chimps, and recommended NIH establish a breeding program for future research needs. In its statement, the NIH also pledged to provide facilities similar to those chimps would encounter in their natural environments, with space requirements yet to be determined; and ""wind down"" research projects using NIH-owned or supported chimps that ""do not meet IOM principles and criteria in a way that preserves the research and minimizes the impact on the animals."" A provision currently limits the amount of funding NIH may put toward retiring chimps and caring for them in the Federal Sanctuary System. The agency said it would continue working with Congress to remedy that. But, said Texas Biomedical Research Institute, ""We are disappointed that the NIH intends to transfer the remaining NIH-owned and NIH-supported chimpanzees to the federal sanctuary and to seek additional taxpayer money from Congress for that purpose."" Sending most of the animals to the sanctuary ""would take them away from their caregivers, many of whom they have known all of their lives,"" the institute said. ""It would also deprive them of the state-of-the-art medical and diagnostic capabilities that have been developed at chimpanzee research facilities over several decades with taxpayer money."" The NIH decision ""culminates more than two years of intensive deliberations among NIH leadership, independent chimpanzee experts, researchers, bioethicists and members of the public,"" said Dr. James Anderson, NIH's deputy director for program coordination, planning and strategic initiatives, in the statement. Anderson's division oversees the NIH Chimpanzee Management Program. Restricted use of chimps in government research recommended . A study was commissioned in December 2010 to examine the ""continued scientific need"" for chimpanzees in NIH-funded research. A year later, the IOM said most current use of chimps in biomedical research was unnecessary, and the use that was needed should be guided by principles and criteria. The advisory committee began its work the same month and presented its report in January.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama expressed deep concern on Wednesday about the Egyptian military's removal of that nation's first democratically elected president, calling for a quick return to civilian leadership and ordering a review of U.S. law regarding aid to the vital Middle East ally. ""The United States continues to believe firmly that the best foundation for lasting stability in Egypt is a democratic political order with participation from all sides and all political parties,"" Obama said in a statement about the move to oust Mohamed Morsy a year after he took office. Obama said the United States expects the military to ""ensure the rights"" of Egyptian citizens ""during this uncertain period."" He also called on the military to avoid ""arbitrary arrests"" of Morsy and his supporters. But Morsy and most members of his leadership team were under house arrest, according to the Muslim Brotherhood. Obama's written statement followed a meeting of national security officials, including Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey and CIA Director John Brennan at the White House, and illustrated a complex diplomatic situation. The run-up to Morsy's removal included huge demonstrations on both sides of the political equation, with millions of people flooding Cairo squares in scenes similar to the mass protests and unrest that led to the military coup that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Obama refused to choose sides then and his administration adopted a similarly neutral stance ahead of the military's decision on Wednesday to suspend the constitution and remove Morsy, who left the Muslim Brotherhood after his election in a symbolic gesture as leader of all Egyptians. The head of Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court will serve as interim president. The Obama administration said earlier in the day Egyptians deserved a ""peaceful political solution."" But State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki also noted that Morsy had failed to outline ""significant specific steps"" to address the concerns of anti-government protesters. Tricky policy scenario for U.S. The situation in Cairo created an uncomfortable policy scenario for a U.S. government and president that champion democratic principles. Obama reinforced that in his statement. ""I now call on the Egyptian military to move quickly and responsibly to return full authority back to a democratically elected civilian government as soon as possible through an inclusive and transparent process,"" he said. ""The goal of any political process should be a government that respects the rights of all people, majority and minority; that institutionalizes the checks and balances upon which democracy depends; and that places the interests of the people above party or faction,"" he added, noting that those protesting Morsy's government must be heard. But he also raised the tricky issue of military aid to Egypt, which also was noted by members of Congress in their reaction to events. Egypt unrest: 5 key questions . Egypt's 1973 peace treaty with Israel and responsibility for keeping open the vital oil shipping lane of the Suez Canal make it an important player in the region regarding U.S. interests. Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont noted that the more than $1 billion a year in military aid to Egypt would be cut off if Morsy's overthrow is deemed a military coup. U.S. law restricts some kinds of aid to countries where the elected head of government is deposed by a military coup, or a coup in which the military plays a decisive role. Obama, who did not use the word ""coup"" in his statement, directed ""relevant departments and agencies"" to review the implications for aid to Egypt. Rand Paul: Stop using U.S. taxpayer money to aid Morsy . Dempsey told CNN before Wednesday's announcement in Egypt that ""there will be consequences"" if the situation was ""badly handled."" ""If this were to be seen as a coup, then it would limit our ability to have the kind of relationship we need with the Egyptian armed forces,"" Dempsey said. In a separate interview with CNN, former State Department official Edward Djerejian noted that the military's announcement included non-military figures from civil society to portray it as a broader political step than a military coup. ""There's something different happening here,"" said Djerejian, a former assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. He said the situation ""creates the possibility for a political transition in Egypt to a pluralistic government system."" Initial statements from congressional Republicans who usually seize on any opportunity to criticize Obama policies were cautiously supportive of Morsy's ouster. ""I am hopeful that his departure will reopen the path to a better future for Egypt, and I encourage the military and all political parties to cooperate in the peaceful establishment of democratic institutions and new elections that lead to an Egypt where minority rights are protected,"" said a statement by GOP Rep. Ed Royce of California, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""But make no mistake about it, Egypt is in for very difficult days."" A vital U.S. ally . Unrest in Egypt erupted as part of the Arab Spring wave of uprisings that began in North Africa in 2010. The situation in Egypt has been a political thorn for Obama, forcing him to balance the interests of Israel with a U.S. desire to promote democratic values in the mostly Islamic region. Opinion: Obama missed out on Arab Spring . Before Morsy's election, Obama announced efforts to help Egypt stabilize and modernize its economy, including debt relief of up to $1 billion and another $1 billion in loan guarantees. Morsy's ascendency benefited Obama a few months later, when Morsy played a key role in negotiating a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel following eight days of Gaza violence last November. But Morsy subsequently issued an order preventing any Egyptian court from overturning his decisions in what was considered an undemocratic move decried by opposition groups. Within a month, he reinstated the judicial oversight and submitted a draft Islamist-backed constitution that voters approved and he signed into law. What is the Muslim Brotherhood? Public anger over economic woes and a lack of opposition voices in government helped spark the latest protests. Mohamed Morsy: Fast Facts . Obama had called Morsy . The White House said on Tuesday that Obama had called Morsy to urge him to show Egyptians that he understood their anger and to take political steps to resolve the crisis. The focus and tone of the White House statement was similar to a year ago when Morsy won Egypt's first election following Mubarak's ouster. ""We will stand with the Egyptian people as they pursue their aspirations for democracy, dignity, and opportunity, and fulfill the promise of their revolution,"" the White House said then. Such a neutral approach has riled conservatives seeking a more assertive U.S. role in the aftermath of the Arab Spring uprisings that swept through parts of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona has criticized the president for yielding a leadership role in the region. Shrinking U.S. aid . Last month, he warned a shrinking U.S. foreign aid budget meant ""Egypt must show that it is a good investment of our scarce resources -- that the return on this investment will be a freer, more democratic, more tolerant Egypt."" If not, McCain said in a speech on the Middle East, ""Congress will spend this money elsewhere. That is just a fact."" The Egyptian military this week gave Morsy an ultimatum to work out a solution to the protests by Wednesday. Morsy responded by calling for creation of a temporary coalition government until early elections can take place in coming months. The statement posted Wednesday on Morsy's official Facebook page warned that a coup would undermine the aspirations and achievements of the 2011 revolution. Travel warning, evacuation . The U.S. Embassy in Cairo ordered the mandatory evacuation of all nonessential personnel, CNN's Jill Dougherty reported, citing a senior administration official. Separately, the State Department warned Americans to defer travel to Egypt and U.S. citizens living there to leave the country.

"(CNN) -- As a heat wave kept roasting the eastern United States on Tuesday, New Yorkers are blasting their air conditioners so much that they could set a record for electricity usage by Wednesday, utility officials said. Meanwhile, Con Edison crews faced scattered outages and restored power to more than 7,600 customers in New York City and Westchester County since the area began to bake Sunday, the utility said Tuesday. ""We could certainly break a record, all-time demand record this week,"" John Miksad, Con Ed's senior vice president for operations, said in a video statement. ""All week, we're gonna be right up there in the 95% all-time record level. We've only had probably four other days that will be as high as what we're going to see this week. ""What we're doing right now is, we've basically got all hands on deck, we've buttoned up the system, and now we're just ready to respond to whatever comes our way,"" he added. Con Ed's record for consumption is 13,189 megawatts, set at 4 p.m. July 22, 2011, the utility said. As sauna conditions seared the Eastern Seaboard, the heat index was expected to reach 100 degrees or more, forecasters said. At noon, New York's heat index was 96 degrees, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. Heat indices represent how hot the air feels, based on the actual temperature and humidity. ""I was in New York City last week: It's so much more than the heat; it's the humidity sticking around. You walk around the city, and it feels like 102, and it's brutal,"" Myers said. The New York Fire Department recorded 37 heat-related incidents on Monday and 25 more as of late Tuesday afternoon, spokeswoman Elisheva Zakheim said. The heat indices for the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest are expected to soar well past 100 degrees Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. A heat advisory was in effect for parts of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as much of Michigan. It's enough to make pedestrians run to the shady side of the street. ""I looked across the street: Which side is the sun shining on, and which side is the shade?"" Randy Turner told CNN affiliate WCBS. ""I was just thinking, walking down the street, why am I walking in this heat?"" Michelle Sangenito also told WCBS. People were willing to hit the floor just to beat the heat. ""Well, I came home late last night to a couple roommates just, like, laying out. I chose the ground because that's cooler,"" Holly King told CNN affiliate WABC.

""We are on alert for heat emergencies. We do have a lot of water, a lot of fluids and cooling capabilities,"" he told WABC. Rain will cool the eastern third of the country by the weekend and bring pleasant weather to that region next week, with temperatures reaching only 80 degrees, Myers said. But the rain also will bring the potential for hail and high winds in the Northeast on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Myers said. Elsewhere in the country, a wacky weather pattern will bring rain and possible flash flooding to the South and Southwest, forecasters said. Flood watches are posted in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Arizona, and the rainfall will bring temperatures 20 degrees below average, CNN meteorologists said. The wetness will bring relief to drought-wracked Texas, but flooding is a concern this entire week, Myers said. ""There's a potential for heavy downpours in dry washes,"" Myers said. Meanwhile, ""monsoonal moisture will increase across the southern High Plains, with flash flooding possible,"" the National Weather Service said. ""The rain and extensive cloud cover will also keep temperatures across the region quite cool for this time of the year, with some areas over 20 degrees below their average July temperatures"" in parts of West Texas, Arizona and New Mexico.

"(CNN) -- Snapchat, the app that sends automatically-deleting messages, has proven to be hugely popular among teens and young adults, but until now, it restricted anyone under the age of 13 from using it. On Saturday, Snapchat decided to change their policy by introducing an update that lets younger users register for a more limited version of the app, which the startup has dubbed SnapKidz. SEE ALSO: This College Student Is the King of Snapchat PR . ""Instead they are able to use 'SnapKidz' a version of Snapchat that includes an interface for taking snaps, captioning, drawing, and saving them locally on the device, but does not support sending or receiving snaps or adding friends,"" the company wrote in a blog post. In essence, SnapKidz is just a photo and drawing app for kids, which lacks Snapchat's main feature: sending messages. The kid-friendly option is currently only available as part of an update to the iOS app, but may roll out to Android in the future. The move comes as Snapchat is reportedly looking to raise a big new round of funding. By introducing a more PG-version of the app for younger users, Snapchat may be able to boost its user numbers and change the perception that it is simply a tool for sexting. Of course, users can also lie about their age and continue using the app's full features. Do you think Snapchat will find success among younger users? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. transportation security officials want to speed more travelers through airport security lines by expanding a voluntary program that requires a background check. ""Let's get away from the one size fits all and let's focus on those that we can pre-screen,"" Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole told the Aspen Security Forum on Friday. ""Those who are willing to share just a little bit of information and say let's do that pre-screening so we can expedite your physical screen at the checkpoint because we have a high confidence that you are not a terrorist,"" he said. For those who opt to become a five-year member of the PreCheck program for $85, they can keep their shoes, belt and light jacket as they walk through a dedicated and expedited security line. Additionally, they can keep a laptop and small water bottle in their bag. The original initiative required travelers to opt in through an airline's frequent flier program or first enroll in other programs like trusted traveler. Starting later this year, U.S. citizens will be able to apply online and visit an enrollment site to provide identification and fingerprints. TSA will start the program at Washington Dulles and Indianapolis International with plans to expand later. It also requires a background check. ""Then, within two to three weeks ... you will be issued a known travel number,"" Pistole said, to applause in Aspen. TSA hopes to have 25% of the traveling public enrolled in expedited screening by the end of 2013. More than 650 million people fly U.S. airlines annually. Airlines and TSA have for years sought to expedite passenger screening, especially for premium-paying business customers. But striking a balance between thorough security in a post 9/11 age and the desire of travelers to reduce the ""hassle factor"" of airport screening has been a political, logistical, and financial challenge. The idea of removing low-risk, pre-screened people from the main security lines, will allow security resources to be concentrated more closely on potential threats and alleviate long lines at security checkpoints. Homeland security officials are most concerned about long-standing terror interests in bringing down U.S. airliners. Currently, the focus has been on sharpening the ability of security personnel to detect explosives. Since the TSA first announced the PreCheck program in March of 2012, a total of 12 million travelers at 40 airports have taken advantage of expedited security lines. When it was first released, the program was only available on Delta and American Airlines, but US Airways, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines were later included. The latest expansion will include JetBlue and Southwest, the largest airline for domestic flights. CNN's Mike Ahlers and Tim Hume contributed to this report.","The PreCheck program requires fingerprints and a background check .

"(CNN) -- The United Kingdom has royal baby watch. Zoo Atlanta had panda baby watch. Now Washington has stinky flower watch. The enormous plant known as the corpse flower is expected to bloom and stink up the grounds at the United States Botanic Garden Conservatory sometime this week. It will be the first flowering of this titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum), also known as the stinky plant, which has lived at the garden since 2007. The plant doesn't have an annual blooming cycle; it can wait years or even decades between cycles. It's expected to heat up, start smelling like dead animals and bloom overnight or in the early morning hours -- though exactly which night it will happen is not known. The heat and smell is to attract pollinator insects such as dung beetles in its natural habitat, said Ari Novy, the garden's public programs manager. The garden doesn't have any such beetles but resident flies could come calling, he said. Impala escapes cheetahs by leaping into tourists' SUV . Once the garden confirmed on Monday, July 8, that the plant was going to bloom, staffers moved quickly to display it publicly on July 11. A native of Sumatra, Indonesia, this particular plant is part of the garden's collection of 14 corpse flowers. They are rarely put on display because they require a lot of heat and humidity, which is why they are grown at the garden's production greenhouses in Southeast Washington -- rarely open to the public. Now the star of the garden, the plant is growing quickly. It was 52 inches tall when it was put on display on July 11. By Saturday morning, it measured 62 inches high and 69 inches by Sunday night. Tuesday morning, it was 79 inches tall. Once completely open, it can stay in bloom for 24 to 48 hours, and then it will collapse quickly. The U.S. Botanic Garden last displayed a blooming titan arum in 2007. At least seven U.S. institutions have at least one titan arum in each of its collections. The garden will have extended hours from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday. If you can't make it to the nation's capital watch it open up online on the garden's live flower cam. The National Botanic Garden of Belgium saw its oldest corpse flower bloom last week, attracting about 4,000 visitors over three days, said garden spokesman Franck Hidvegi. It previously bloomed in 2008 and 2011. The garden has another four plants in its greenhouses, but Hidvegi said they are still too young to bloom.","A corpse flower at the U.S. Botanic Garden will bloom for the first time ever .

"(CNN) -- In a hearing Tuesday outside of the jury's presence, attorneys in the George Zimmerman trial argued about whether jurors should see the defense's 3D re-creation of the altercation between the neighborhood watch captain and Trayvon Martin. The defense also wants jurors to hear about Martin's text messages, which reportedly show he had been in fights and was trying to purchase a gun. The judge recessed court right before 10 p.m. ET, saying she would wait until Wednesday morning to make decisions on both of these issues. Defense attorney Don West vented his frustration as the judge left the bench, saying he was having trouble keeping up with the long hours and fast-paced schedule of the trial. ""I'm not physically able to keep up this pace much longer,"" West said. ""It's 10 o'clock at night. We started this morning. We've had full days every day, weekends, depositions at night."" Animator Daniel Schumaker said he uses crime scene evidence and the same motion capture technology used in movies like ""Iron Man"" to design his digital re-creations of alleged crimes. The defense said Schumaker's computer animation would help the jury understand how the confrontation between Martin and Zimmerman unfolded. The prosecution argued the animated re-enactment makes assumptions, and it's not based on evidence in the case. ""To have an animation that goes back to the jury room that they can play over and over again ... gives a certain weight to something that this court is not particularly certain comports with the evidence presented at the trial,"" said Judge Debra Nelson. Nelson said she wanted to read the case law and wait until Wednesday before making her ruling on the animation's admissibility. The hearing, which went so late that the courtroom lights set on an automatic timer went out, continued Tuesday evening after testimony had wrapped for the day. The defense even had to ask the judge to extend Zimmerman's curfew, which is set for 10 p.m. ET. Zimmerman's defense team told Nelson that it plans to rest its case sometime on Wednesday. Earlier on Tuesday, a forensic pathologist testified for the defense, describing Martin's traumatic last moments alive as he bled to death in the grass after being shot at close range. ""If he was involved in a struggle, you expect his heart to be going, beating -- especially after he had been shot -- more than a 100 times a minute,"" said Dr. Vincent Di Maio, adding that the way Martin died supports Zimmerman's version of the shooting. ""You are losing 1,500 cc's (cubic centimeters) in a minute. That's about a quarter of his blood supply. In a second minute, if you can assume the same rate. Actually the heart would probably be beating faster for the second minute. He is going to lose another 1,500. Well that means he has lost more than 50%of his blood supply."" Zimmerman appeared to be paying close attention during the testimony. Tracy Martin, the victim's father, was in attendance but didn't show much emotion as he heard the details of how his son may have died. Trayvon Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, was not in attendance. Get the latest updates at HLNTV.com's live blog . Di Maio said that given that the entry point of the bullet was a ""contact wound"" -- meaning at close range -- Trayvon Martin never had a chance. ""In this case you have a through-and-through hole of the right ventricle, and then you have at least one hole if not two into the right lung. So you are losing blood, and every time the heart contracts, it pumps blood out the two holes in the ventricle and at least one hole in the lung."" Di Maio also said Martin's gunshot wound indicates the gun was up against the teen's clothing, about 2 to 4 inches away from the skin. He also said the weight of the canned drink in Martin's hoodie pocket may have been pulling his clothing away from his body by a few inches if Martin was on top of Zimmerman, as the former neighborhood watch volunteer has claimed. In any event, ""He is going to be dead between one and three minutes after being shot,"" said Di Maio. Martin, 17, had been walking through the Retreat at Twin Lakes -- the gated community in Sanford, Florida, where Zimmerman lived -- on February 26, 2012, when the two got into a physical altercation. Zimmerman told the police he shot Martin in self-defense while holding the gun in his right hand at point-blank range. He said the teenager was on top of him at the time. Di Maio said the medical evidence is consistent with how Zimmerman has described shooting the teenager. Opinion: Zimmerman trial - it's about race . Di Maio explained to the jury Tuesday that Martin may have lost consciousness between 10 and 15 seconds after being shot and may have been able to talk or make voluntary movement during those last seconds. Zimmerman has said that Martin said, ""You got me,"" after being shot.","Judge in Zimmerman trial delays ruling on defense's re-creation of the altercation .

"New York (CNN) -- Fourth of July traffic will inevitably have gridlocks nationwide, and for the tony Hamptons area in Long Island, access by car and bus will be no different. So why not take to the skies in an Uber Chopper? Uber, a service that dispatches cars for hire using mobile apps, is offering on-demand helicopters from Manhattan to East Hampton. The San Francisco-based car service announced Tuesday via e-mail and blog that it will branch into helicopters, offering to whisk wealthy clients from the throngs of Manhattanites to the relative calm of the Hamptons. The service begins at midday Wednesday. How does it work? Uber Chopper will be added to the Uber transportation options on the company's mobile app. A car and driver pick up the client, who is driven directly to a helipad. Users can select from one of three helipads in Manhattan -- on the east and west sides and the Financial District. Because of the steep price tag -- $3,000 for a one-way trip -- Uber staff calls clients to verify that they intended to call the chopper. Then up to six people can pile into the helicopter for a mere 40-minute ride to the East Hampton Airport. Upon arrival, a second Uber-serviced SUV will drive clients to their final destination. ""It's a lot better than the three to four hours it can take [to drive] on a busy weekend,"" says Josh Mohrer, general manager of Uber New York. ""This is modeled like our car service. We don't own the cars, we just partner with drivers."" For the New York City helicopters, Uber paired with Liberty Helicopters, a private company with several dozen choppers in the area. ""We have a logistics fabric that we use in the cities that we operate in. This is an experiment in extending that,"" Mohrer added. He says the idea began as a joke around the New York Uber offices, which are known to throw a barbecue and ice cream truck into their mix of available services. But the idea morphed into reality for the summer rush to the Hamptons. The concept of such flights to the Hamptons is not new. In 2012, hotelier Andre Balazs introduced StndAIR, an amphibious aircraft that leaves from the East River on a 45-minute flight to the East Hampton Airport. One-way tickets cost a cool $525. Unlike StndAIR, however, Uber is available almost instantaneously, Mohrer says. ""This is similar to a charter, but the magic here is that you're pushing a button when you're ready to go."" Though the service just began Wednesday and flights are not booked far in advance, Mohrer says he expects full flights, judging by the media buzz and feedback from clients. Since it launched in May 2010 in San Francisco, Uber has blossomed from a small technology start-up into a major private automobile presence in 33 cities with drivers around the world. Now add pilots to that list, too.","Uber, a service that dispatches cars for hire using mobile apps, adds on-demand helicopters .

"(CNN) -- When Tessa Thompson was a little girl, she carefully cut out clothes to dress her paper dolls, but her real dream was to own an American Girl doll. Those characters with custom wardrobes and historical pedigrees are still coveted by kids all over. Thompson never got her longed-for toy, but she got a better gift: These days the 29-year-old actress gets to go to work each day and dress like a living doll on the set of the TV period drama ""Copper."" Corsets, shawls, veils, a sweeping evening gown, vintage 1865, are her reality. She plays Sara Freeman, wife of Dr. Matthew Freeman (Ato Essandoh), who partners up with Detective Kevin Corcoran (Tom Weston-Jones) in using early forensic techniques to solve crimes in New York City. On the set, where the slums of Five Points and the developing African-American community of Carmansville meet the brownstones of tony Fifth Avenue, Civil War-era New York comes alive. The BBC America show returns for its second season on Sunday. Bringing 19th century New York to life on ""Copper"" The historical costumes allow the actors to embody their characters, from how they work, move and breathe in the garments to the choices in design and color their fictional counterparts might make. ""It really isn't until you put on the corset and lace up your boots that you can look in the mirror and see staring back at you what you hope to project,"" Thompson said. Head costumer Delphine White, who has been designing for 41 years, and her talented team collaborate with the actors to create hundreds of outfits and accessories suitable for the diverse cast. Her team is full of cutters, sewers, dyers and even an on-call cobbler and milliner. The ""stitchers"" apprenticed in Europe for seven years before they called themselves seamstresses, White said, and she counts herself lucky. Together, they made 600 dresses, frock coats and union suits for the first season alone. From studying photographs and ladies' magazines, White was able to paint a clear picture for her team of what different social classes wore at the time. Then she collaborated with the production team to decide on a color range and distinct look for each neighborhood. Uptown, the tones were cool, while Five Points was earthy and sepia-toned. But the second season of ""Copper"" has brightened colors and loosened the corset stays all around town. Actress Anastasia Griffith was relieved to give her uptown character, Elizabeth Haverford, some literal breathing room. Her tightly laced silk gowns stunned in every episode last year, but she could barely move her arms in some of the voluminous dresses and tiny corsets. ""In the first season, we see this tightly wound human being who is so trapped in this gilded cage of the costume and you don't see her internal life,"" Griffith said. ""In the second, we dive into her unraveling. The costumes have been really influential in helping me inhabit that energy."" Larysa Kondracki, co-producer and director for many of the episodes, let Griffith lose the corset for some of the episodes so she could be free and natural. The duality of Elizabeth's character also allows for Griffith to play to and against the grandiosity of her station. She sits primly in the drawing room, but has also been capable of some duplicitous actions. Veils allow Griffith to obscure her face and heighten Elizabeth's sense of mystery. ""At the time, women could not exist outside of a man's domain. I hope I crack open her true vulnerability, and the Machiavellian necessity Elizabeth finds. She has to be smart enough to play along even though in her heart she is a very independent spirit."" Both Thompson and Griffith were able to collaborate with White and her team about the cut, materials and colors of their costumes. As happens with their conversations with the show producers, actors can casually mention an idea that soon becomes a stunning reality. Last season, Thompson's character, Sara, was trapped on ""a plateau of sameness, and her costume reflected that."" She was trapped by fear, rarely left the house, and was suspicious of every person her husband encountered. She was also incredibly buttoned up and wore a variation on one costume. Now, it has been revealed that Sara is a seamstress, so sitting in with the design team influenced Thompson's shaping of Sara. She helped design one of her gowns and watched as it transformed from sketch to costume over two weeks. When Thompson wore the dress, a group of the clothiers who worked on the creation came to watch her film the party scene, grinning like stage moms. ""As an actor, it feels like an honor to wear these costumes because of the tremendous amount of work, care and love that goes into making them,"" Thompson said. Thompson also has more costuming options this year. Sara is less buttoned up and the color palette has become bolder and richer. Time is the biggest enemy when constructing the garments, because ""Copper"" starts filming a new episode every eight days. That means new costumes have to be ready each week, so the team works around the clock. White has a unique approach to this complex process: Do the research, learn the conventions, push the boundaries and break the rules. She shops for fabric and lace in vintage shops, even stripping old tablecloths and curtains at times, but modern fabrics have worked their way in as well. The color combinations from the 19th century wouldn't hold any appeal for us now, White said. Some of the men in ""Copper"" sport a Mick Jagger- and Robert Mapplethrope-inspired look, borrowing from the 1970s version of frock coats rather than straining for historical accuracy. It's oddly fitting. Although not the timely music for 1865, the rock 'n' roll spirit flows through ""Copper."" The characters in their weathered costumes project a rebellious, jaunty feel for a multifaceted city divided by change. ""A period piece is something I always wanted to do, to inhabit a world you are recreating or reimagining,"" Thompson said. ""This storytelling in costume essentially becomes a 13-hour film of epic stories and you follow these people in a slow burning way.""

"(CNN) -- A fire that broke out Friday in an empty Boeing 787 Dreamliner at London's Heathrow Airport does not appear to be related to the jet's batteries, the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch said Saturday. ""It is clear that this heat damage is remote from the area in which the aircraft main and APU batteries are located and at this stage there is no evidence of a direct causal relationship,"" the agency said in a statement. No injuries were reported, but the cause of the fire inside the Ethiopian Airlines plane was not clear. The incident puts Boeing's marquee 787 Dreamliner fleet back in the headlines after it was grounded this year because of a fire risk associated with the planes' batteries. The U.S. National Transportation Board said Saturday that it sent an investigator to London to aid in the investigation. Senior Air Safety Investigator Lorenda Ward was to be accompanied by NTSB airplane systems investigators and representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing. Japanese Dreamliner held due to A/C power glitch . Ethiopian Airlines said in a posting on its Facebook page that the incident occurred on one of its jets after it arrived Friday morning on a normal flight from Addis Ababa to Heathrow. After passengers deplaned and the plane was cleaned, it was towed to a remote area, where it was parked and its internal and external power switched off, Ethiopian said. ""After more than 8 hours smoke was detected,"" it added. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said no one was aboard the plane when the fire broke out, causing ""extensive heat damage"" to the upper portion of the rear fuselage. It predicted the initial investigation would take several days. Another 787 Dreamliner flying out of the United Kingdom and operated by Thomson Airways was forced to turn back Friday after what the airline called ""a technical issue."" The 787 Dreamliner represents a new generation of efficient wide-body, long-range aircraft, and Boeing has placed a big bet on the fleet. Customer demand for the Dreamliner has remained solid despite the grounding. The plane is more efficient than earlier models due to its lighter weight, using composite material rather than aluminum and wires instead of some of the hydraulics. Another Dreamliner diverted for mechanical problem . Although Boeing has delivered to customers just 68 of the planes, it has 862 unfilled orders. Boeing says it plans to increase production to 10 per month by the end of the year, double the rate earlier this year. The first of the long-delayed Dreamliners went into service for Japan's All Nippon Airways in October 2011, and the planes flew without major problems for more than a year. But after the battery problem emerged in January, the company had to retrofit the 50 Dreamliners already in service before they could return to service. Though Boeing shares sank Friday 3.6% on the news, they were still up more than 30% since the start of 2013.","Fire broke out Friday at London's Heathrow Airport .

"New York (CNN) -- On a chilly Saturday afternoon, a man with all the time in the world stands outside the bus he calls home. While he takes in a view of the Brooklyn Bridge, Bob Votruba boasts he lives on 84 square feet of pure luxury. ""It's a cherished spot for me,"" he says, ""something that is a little sacred."" Votruba, 58, a retired father of three, is in the middle of a 10-year journey to spread kindness across the country. So far he's logged almost 60,000 miles on a school bus he bought and has lived in for four years. His Boston terrier, Bogart, keeps him company. The bus advertises his mission in giant letters painted on one side, ""One Million Acts of Kindness."" It's a goal, he says, a person under 30 can realistically meet if he or she makes it a point to be kind to someone every day. ""It's a constant reminder that I have chosen this path to be as kind as I can in every possible way,"" he says. The impact of Virginia Tech shootings . Votruba says he felt compelled to champion kindness after learning a gunman had killed 32 people on April 16, 2007, at Virginia Tech. He had begun a period of introspection, realizing he wasn't satisfied with his lifestyle, which he considered ""cushy."" His construction business had become just a job, and he felt unfulfilled with the direction of his life, especially with his kids headed off to college. ""It seemed like there was a higher meaning in going forward with life,"" he says. ""That's when Virginia Tech happened."" Votruba drove to Virginia Tech the week of the shootings and talked to people about their experiences dealing with the tragedy. It wasn't just one conversation that affected him but the range of emotions he saw that week, which, he says, motivated him to change his life. He returned to his home near Cleveland, and the single father told his children that he planned to sell all his belongings and drive to university campuses across the country to talk about kindness. Daughter Lizzie, 23, says she and her siblings were taken aback but not surprised. They always said Dad was kind. ""It was a different step than most people take in their life,"" his 25-year-old son, Peter, says. ""I was proud that he left and he was going to do something he felt was right and needed to do."" Reminders . April 16 -- the date is as familiar to Bob Votruba as it is to anyone the Virginia Tech shootings personally affected. Meeting recently with the Chamber of Commerce in Chesterland, Ohio, he told the group what that day meant, but Votruba says he was saddened to see a crowd of blank faces. ""That's how these events end up being lost in the public memory,"" he says. ""The Boston bombings (were) on April 15, and there was so much coverage on April 16, April 17 and April 18. Here was an event that was so big six years ago that hardly got a mention."" Votruba says we live in a ""Post-it note"" society, where people need constant reminders to love and care for one another. He sets at least four alarms each day to remind him to think about others and what he can do to spread kindness. Small gestures can help folks get into the habit of being kind, he says. ""If you want to say a prayer, or a moment of silence,"" he says, that's what you should do. ""Whatever you need to do to honor someone."" On the road . Votruba made good on his vow to sell his home and belongings, taking an early retirement to embark on his journey of kindness. He funds it with his savings and retirement checks but also accepts small donations. ""It's all a buck here, 20 bucks there, that sort of thing,"" he says. He drives to places where the weather is nice, visiting elementary schools and senior centers to drop off fliers announcing his mission. Those organizations will call him up (sometimes up to a year later) and ask him to come give a talk. A couple of years ago, he added a bike to his travels and has ridden it nearly 18,000 miles to spark up conversations with the people he encounters about issues such as domestic violence and child abuse. He placed two stickers on the back of his bike telling people what they should do: ""Be a man. Don't raise a hand. Stop domestic violence,"" and ""Stop childhood sexual abuse now."" By the handlebars, a big black-and-white sign reads: ""Boys should never hit girls,"" a message to which the children respond. ""These are issues as I'm driving across the country I'm hearing so much,"" he says. ""I'm having firsthand conversations with people losing loved ones because of suicide. I've had adults break down and cry 30 to 40 years later because of something that happened in high school."" Votruba likes to hand out ""kindness certificates,"" so people can frame a visual reminder of the mission of his trip. Wake up and smile. Hold the door for someone. Let everybody go through traffic. These are the things Votruba says he does when he's on the road and recommends for others. A living memorial . On this trip to Brooklyn, a dozen people from places as far away as Australia stopped by his bus to read the messages people left behind. ""There is a sense of wonder that turns him into a joy,"" says Sister Claire Young, who lives in Vero Beach, Florida. ""You come outside and say hello to him, and he's just so thrilled to see you. What can be better?"" There is no heat inside Votruba's bus -- or air conditioning for that matter -- but the walls are filled with more than 400 messages, written by children and adults who stop by and chat. It's a living memorial, he says, of the people who took the time to write on it. But it also speaks to the future, when days are long and he needs a reminder to keep going. He likes the simplicity of one note that a 3-year-old left with the help of his mother: ""Just be nice."" And the wisdom of a 92-year-old man who was married for 60 years: ""Tell your love, you love her every day."" Even on a cold day, Votruba says, ""it warms the soul.""","Bob Votruba has traveled nearly 60,000 miles across the U.S. to talk about kindness .

"(CNN) -- Summer. Heat and humidity are up. School's out or soon will be for most families. Maybe you're looking for a bit of a mental escape, so where better to find it than in a book? Readers are in luck, with a slew of hot new titles hitting shelves. Whether you're headed for the beach or the Barcalounger, we've found five titles worth your consideration. So grab a cool drink, find some shade and dive in. 'The Son' by Philipp Meyer . Ambitious readers who take their prose seriously should grab a copy of ""The Son,"" a stunning work of historical fiction by Philipp Meyer. Scores of critics are gushing over the book calling it epic, one of the best of the year, even an American classic. Meyer certainly aims high, with his multigenerational tale of a formidable Texas family. The saga begins in the early 1800s and spans most of the 19th and 20th century, jumping back and forth in time and between several points of view among members of the McCullough clan. There's Eli, captured as a teenager in a brutal Indian attack and raised by a tribe of Comanches; Eli's son, Peter, a rancher caught between the Mexican-American and white settlers who struggle for control of the land; and Jeannie, Eli's great-granddaughter, an oil tycoon and matriarch for the modern era. While the novel is rich in detail in the history of Texas, this is a story of courage, conviction and perseverance that would feel at home almost anywhere in the West. Meyer's writing echoes some iconic Western wordsmiths. ""The Son"" is at times violent and dark, like Cormac McCarthy, vividly character driven like Larry McMurtry and panoramic in its scope, like James Michener, appropriate considering Meyer was a Michener fellow at the University of Texas. Read the first chapter of ""The Son"" 'A Serpent's Tooth' by Craig Johnson . No less authentic is Craig Johnson's hero in a ten-gallon hat, Walt Longmire. The sheriff of the fictional Absaroka County, Wyoming, returns in his ninth mystery, ""A Serpent's Tooth."" Since its inception, the best-selling series has continued to grow globally in popularity and is now a hit on cable TV, just beginning its second season. In this latest adventure in print, Walt's search for a missing girl leads him to a Mormon ""lost boy,"" a family of heavily armed polygamists and a CIA plot involving an interstate oil pipeline only a stone's throw from the original Teapot Dome. While the plot sounds a bit convoluted, Johnson's writing is not. The story moves at a brisk pace, with room for some good-natured humor and plenty of gorgeous Wyoming scenery. But the real stars of the series are Walt and his supporting cast, his second-in-command, Deputy Victoria Moretti, with whom he shares a budding romance, and of course, his best friend and sometimes conscience, Henry Standing Bear. For fans of the series, these three are like old friends whom you look forward to spending time with. Inevitably, once the story is finished, readers will find themselves already looking forward to Walt's next visit. Read more about ""A Serpent's Tooth"" on the author's website and read an excerpt from the book . 'The Shining Girls' by Lauren Beukes . The summer's most buzzed-about book may be Lauren Beukes' ""The Shining Girls,"" a high-concept thriller borrowing elements from several genres, including mystery, sci-fi and horror. Lucky readers who got their hands on the novel early describe it as ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" meets ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" but there's more depth to this imaginative story. Here's the setup: In Depression-era Chicago, a serial killer finds a mysterious house that opens doors to other times. The killer uses this house of horrors to hunt his victims, all promising young women, across different decades until one victim survives. She then turns the tables, and the victim hunts the hunter. It's a creepy concept, and Beukes makes the far-fetched seem plausible thanks to her exceptional writing. Critics, booksellers and some well-known novelists are singing the novel's praises. It's also captured Hollywood's attention. Leonardo DiCaprio and the producers behind Netflix hit ""House of Cards"" just optioned the book, with plans to bring it to TV. It's easy to understand why, because once you start reading, you will be hard-pressed to put down ""The Shining Girls."" Read an excerpt from ""The Shining Girls"" 'Joyland' by Stephen King . Stephen King, quite possibly the world's best-selling writer, reteams with pulp fiction publisher Hard Case Crime for his new paperback thriller, ""Joyland."" But don't be thrown by the tawdry cover featuring a buxom redhead; this is classic King. It's a murder mystery with a ghostly twist. In 1973 small-town North Carolina, Devin Jones is a heartbroken college student who takes a summer job working at the local amusement park. King has loaded the story with lots of ""carny"" language, much of it authentic, some of it invented. For instance, did you know a shooting gallery is called a ""bang shy"" in carnival speak? When he's not running the Carolina spin ride or pushing a popcorn wagon, Devin is intrigued by a local legend. Turns out Joyland's haunted house is truly haunted by the ghost of a young woman, murdered on the ride years before. With the help of a few fellow carny friends, Devin sets out to find the killer. Along the way, he meets a little boy suffering from a terminal illness, who may be able to help him with the more otherworldly aspects of this mystery. While the story is at times dark and intense, there's less of King's trademark horror and more of the wistful nostalgia and emotion that will remind fans of ""Stand by Me"" and ""The Green Mile,"" especially for its bittersweet and moving conclusion. Read an excerpt from ""Joyland"" 'The Ocean at the End of the Lane' by Neil Gaiman . We turn from mystery to myth in Neil Gaiman's ""The Ocean at the End of the Lane."" The book hits stores June 18, and the author's scores of fans are champing at the bit. The prolific British writer has penned award-winning children's stories, such as ""The Graveyard Book,"" films including the animated ""Coraline,"" the hugely popular ""Sandman"" graphic novels and even a recent episode of ""Doctor Who,"" but Gaiman hasn't written a true novel for adults since 2005. The book can be read easily in an afternoon, and it's well worth the wait. An unnamed narrator visits his childhood home in Sussex, England, to attend a funeral when he's drawn into a forgotten memory of his youth. Hazy details start to take shape, a farmhouse at the end of the lane, a duck pond, an odd little girl who was once a friend, her mother and grandmother, all three who may be more than they reveal. While exploring the countryside, the two young friends encounter something dark and menacing that follows them home, and a life and death battle begins. The story could be called something of a distant cousin to Harry Potter, but Gaiman's novel is more about myth than magic. His narrator says at one point, ""I liked myths. They weren't adult stories and they weren't children's stories. They were better than that. They just were."" While that succinctly sums up the book, even more so, this is a rich story beautifully told about memory, innocence and a longing for the way things were when we were younger.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama highlighted stronger federal efforts Monday to help lower a high school dropout rate that, according to the president, is undermining America's future economic potential. Obama noted that the administration has committed $3.5 billion in new federal support for underperforming schools. Among other things, the Education Department is attempting to encourage states to identify and take new measures to reverse trends in schools with graduation rates below 60 percent. The Education Department's new ""school turnaround grants"" are designed to help 5,000 low-performing schools in the next five years. Obama's proposed fiscal year 2011 budget includes an extra $900 million for the program. ""Our kids get only one chance at an education, and we've got to get it right,"" Obama said. ""If a school continues to fail its students, then there's got to be ... accountability. ... The stakes are too high -- for our children, for our economy, for our country."" The president argued underperforming teachers will need to be replaced in struggling school districts. But more accountability and higher standards, he said, need to be matched by greater federal funding and more parental involvement. Obama made his remarks during an appearance at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with the nonprofit group America's Promise, which sponsors programs for at-risk children. The group is headed by Alma Powell, the wife of former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Colin Powell. Roughly 1.2 million students drop out of school every year, according to the White House. About half of the dropouts are Latino or African-American, Obama said. As a consequence, the administration claims, the country loses almost $320 billion in potential earnings every year.","High school dropout rate threatens U.S. economic future, Obama says .

"(CNN) -- Lovemore Mupfukura, a 30-year-old from Zimbabwe who studied health education, moves deliberately and concentrates on conversations like they're chess matches. Rithika Mathias, a 25-year-old chemist and musician from Massachusetts, walks quickly and can carry on multiple conversations simultaneously. One year ago, they didn't know each other. Now, as colleagues, roommates and confidants, they are working to become leaders of our next big social movement -- the fight for health equity. Lovemore and Rithika work side by side out of identical, windowless offices at Covenant House's Crisis Center in Newark, New Jersey. As health counselors, they are in charge of the medical intake and well-being of 40 homeless youth. The only part of their demanding day that is consistent is the morning -- they are greeted with a hug when they get to work. The two were placed at Covenant House by Global Health Corps. Founded in 2009, GHC's mission is to mobilize young leaders from diverse professional and cultural backgrounds to promote global health equity. GHC recruits and trains emerging leaders, then places them in one of seven countries to work with a health non-profit or government office for a yearlong fellowship in order to strengthen and learn from the organization. This week, Lovemore and Rithika will complete their year of service and become GHC alumni as a new class of 106 fellows joins the movement to serve with 44 partner organizations. Our advocacy for health equity is fueled by the belief that access to quality health care is a human right. At GHC, we believe the poor, who are burdened the most by disease, deserve our highest quality of care. We know many of the 1.7 million deaths from HIV/AIDS worldwide can be prevented with better access to antiretroviral medicine. We are motivated by the overwhelming costs of health care for the poor and the fact that more than 60% of bankruptcies in the U.S. are caused by medical expenses. These challenges are daunting, but can be met. We at GHC believe the following four principles are vital to the movement's success: . 1. Young people should be at the center of this cause . More undergraduate students in North America are linking arms and demanding global health curricula while building up community organizing skills. GlobeMed, a nonprofit founded in 2007 by students at Northwestern University that partners with grassroots health organizations around the world, has spread to 55 universities and is joined by several new health organizations. Yet, a scarcity of opportunities and lack of a supportive global health community keeps too many skilled young professionals from fulfilling their potential after college. It's a moral imperative to provide young people opportunities in the global health space. 2. The leaders must be global . GHC has a partnership model where one fellow is always paired with an international fellow. We see our 90 current fellows, who come from 12 countries, sharing challenges and ideas daily, via social media, impromptu gatherings and in-person retreats. The exchange of best practices in this globally connected social movement is not just from the U.S. outward. It is a collaboration that has no boundaries. For example, our fellows at Partners In Health's PACT program in Boston improved care for low-income HIV patients by adopting best practices from community health worker programs implemented in rural Haiti and Rwanda. 3. Complex challenges require diverse skills . Doctors and nurses are vital to the movement for health equity but our next transformational leaders could be from non-traditional health fields such as computer science, economics, or communications. This year, GHC fellows with architecture backgrounds, working with the MASS Design Group in Rwanda, oversaw the construction of hospitals that use the latest theories of design for efficient care. Our new class of fellows represents 45 fields of expertise. 4. Organizations must take a humble approach . We should stand with, and learn from, those we seek to serve. Health programs should be staffed and led by those in the community who are being served. We should also work in partnership with both the public and private sectors to reach more people. Without these partnerships we will fail. After the fellowship, Lovemore will partner with another GHC alum in Zimbabwe to establish an organization to serve orphans and other at-risk youth. Rithika will study medicine at UCLA and focus on community health. After providing care to hundreds of at-risk youth and receiving hundreds of morning hugs this year, they are ready to lead in the movement for health equity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Barbara Bush and Andrew Bentley.","Barbara Bush, Andrew Bentley: Join us in the fight for health equity .

"Editor's note: This post was created for your reading pleasure as a collaborative effort between the editorial staffs of BuzzFeed and CNN. (Buzzfeed/CNN) -- The world has been exposed to the romantic escapades of eccentric rapper Kanye West and tabloid darling/reality star Kim Kardashian, willingly or not, since they made their relationship public in April 2012. Yo, we're gonna let you finish, but let's take a look back at the long road that led these two crazy kids to one of the most talked-about hook-ups of all time. 2007: Kim and Kanye are photographed together at the grand opening of the L.A. fashion boutique Intermix. At the time, Kim was dating then-New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush. ""We met almost a decade ago. I've known him for a very long time. We've been friends for six or seven years,"" Kim revealed of her relationship with Kanye in an exclusive interview with Oprah in June 2012. 2008: Kim and older sister Kourtney publicly cross paths with Kanye again at Flaunt Magazine's 10th anniversary party in L.A. This time, Kanye was dating model Amber Rose. Amber and Kanye would call it quits in 2010 after a two-year on-again, off-again relationship. 2009: Kanye West appears on Keri Hilson's song ""Knock You Down"" with a guest verse that many cite as a direct reference to his infatuation with Kim. The key line, according to Hollywood gossip site TMZ, comes towards the end of the song: . ""You was always the cheerleader of my dreams / To seem to only date the head of football teams / And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing / We were never meant to be, baby we just happened."" After a brief split and reconciliation in 2009, Kim and Bush (presumably the ""head of football teams"" West mentions) ended their three-year relationship once and for all in 2010. March 2012: After not being spotted together publicly for a few years, Kimye, as they are frequently called, show up together at Paris Fashion Week. April 2012: The couple is seen together in New York at the opening of RYU, the Japanese restaurant owned by Kourtney Kardashian's boyfriend, Scott Disick. (This was the same night Kanye was famously photographed pulling his pants up.) April 2012: That same month, Kanye drops the song ""Cold,"" featuring DJ Khaled, which references Kim by name: . ""I got respect for ... Wiz / And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim / Around the same time she had fell in love with him / Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang / Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team / La Familia, Roc Nation."" The lyric appears to be a direct reference to both Amber Rose's relationship with fellow rapper Wiz Khalifa and Kim's short-lived relationship with Kris Humphries, who played for the New Jersey Nets at the time. Kanye's friend Jay-Z owns a minority stake in the team, now called the Brooklyn Nets. May 2012: Kim and Kanye are photographed canoodling at a series of Lakers games. July 2012: They attend the BET Awards together, sitting next to Jay-Z and BeyoncÃÂ©. August 2012: Kim and Kanye show up in comedian Kevin Hart's promo for the MTV Video Music Awards.

"(Health.com) -- You knew it was coming: Flu season's back, and there's no telling how mild or wild it will be (remember swine flu?). ""The severity of each season is unpredictable,"" confirms Dr. Karen K. Wong, an epidemic intelligence service officer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Same goes for ye olde common cold, which also strikes this time of year. But thanks to scientists who are constantly working to learn the best ways to fight germs and build a better flu shot, it's gotten easier than ever to protect yourself. Follow their advice, and this could be the year you don't get sick. Get a flu shot (pronto!) Flu season runs from October to May, so if you haven't gotten jabbed, now's the time. ""The vaccine takes anywhere from two to four weeks to take effect, and it lasts for at least six months, so if you get it now, you'll be primed for the flu's peak in January or February,"" says Andrew Pekosz, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated. About 200,000 people are hospitalized with flu-related complications each year, and thousands die. In fact, as many as 18,000 people in the United States are estimated to have lost their lives to the H1N1 epidemic of 2009. Health.com: 10 ways you increase your flu risk (without realizing it) Women may be more likely than men to end up in the hospital with severe flu symptoms, notes Sabra Klein, an assistant professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University who researches sex differences in infectious disease. That's because women's bodies mount higher immune responses to germs. A quick refresher on how the shot works: Every year, CDC scientists figure out which strains of influenza are most likely to run rampant based on data from the previous flu season, then put dead forms of those strains into the vaccine. When you get the shot, your immune system produces targeted antibodies to beat those specific viruses -- that way you'll be pre-equipped to fight off the live germs if you come in contact with them in the real world. The vaccine is at least 60% effective -- no, not 100%, but ""even if you do get the flu after being vaccinated, your symptoms will likely be less severe because of the partial immunity you've built up,"" says Dr. Cornelia Dekker, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Stanford Medical School. You might have a sore arm or redness after getting the shot, but that's your immune system's response to the vaccine; you can't actually get the flu from the vaccine. (Note: The shot can cause a reaction in people allergic to eggs, so if that's you, talk to your doc before getting it.) To avoid soreness altogether, ask for FluMist, the needle-free nasal spray vaccine (unless you're pregnant, over 50, or have a chronic condition like asthma -- the spray isn't yet approved for those folks). Health.com: What ails you: Cold, flu or something else? Stay away from sickies . The flu gets passed around primarily when infected people sneeze, cough, or just talk, sending tiny, virus-filled water droplets out of their mouths and noses and into yours, from as far as six to 10 feet away. So if a co-worker shows up complaining about aches and pains, or you notice someone wheezing next to you on the bus or in line at Target, you should stay at least 10 feet away, if possible -- ""15 feet if the person's really sick,"" says Philip Tierno, director of clinical microbiology and immunology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York. Switch seats on public transportation or at the movies if you have to. (And if you're that coughing, sneezing person -- stay the heck home, for the sake of those around you.) Vitamin D supplements no help for colds, flu . Although you probably won't get influenza from pressing an elevator button or using a keyboard that a sick person has handled, you could catch a cold, since that virus is mainly passed around by touch. So it's smart to clean shared telephones and laptops with a disinfecting wipe. Also, like Mom said, wash your hands! Soap up or use an alcohol-based sanitizer, especially before you eat or touch your eyes, nose, or face, and after you've been in the bathroom. If you've got a sick child or spouse at home, you can't exactly banish 'em to the backyard. Just wash your hands more than usual and avoid kissing and sharing drinks or utensils with family members; they can shed live viruses for five days after symptoms are gone. Health.com: How to stop a cold in its tracks . Sleep in this weekend . You always hear that rest is important when you're under the weather, but research shows that it really could make the difference between who gets sick and who doesn't. In a study from Carnegie Mellon University, people who got eight or more hours of sleep were less likely to come down with a cold than those who'd snoozed for fewer than seven hours, even when a live virus was placed directly in their nose. (Suddenly, staying up late to catch up on Downton Abbey doesn't sound quite as tempting.) Even if you don't have time for a nap, doing some meditation could really help to ward off colds and flu: In a new study from the University of Wisconsin, people who took an eight-week course in mindfulness meditation were about 30% less likely to get sick than non-ommers. No need to take a class; simply sit still and focus on your inhales and exhales for several minutes every day. Health.com: Superfoods that fight colds . Eat to boost your immunity . What you put in your mouth can make a huge difference in how well your body fights off cold and flu germs. Step one: Cut back on fatty foods and eat more of the stuff that boosts your immune response, like fruit and vegetables, experts advise. Federal guidelines recommend that we get five to nine servings of fruit and veggies a day. At the very least, have one at every meal or snack -- ""especially orange, yellow-orange, and deep green produce, which are highest in the symptom-beating antioxidants you need now: vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene,"" says Dr. Melina Jampolis, a Los Angeles internist, CNN diet and fitness expert and author of The Calendar Diet. Vitamin D is another nutrient to amp up on: One recent Spanish study found that being deficient may leave us particularly vulnerable to colds and flu. Because it's tough to get enough from sunlight (which triggers the body to create it) or food, ""I put my patients on 1,000 IU a day,"" Jampolis says. Health.com: 7 healthy chicken soup recipes .

"(CNN) -- There will be no new gun laws after the Aurora shooting for the basic reason that the American people do not want them. Over the past 20 years, support for gun control has collapsed in the United States. Three-quarters of Americans want to keep the right to own handguns, weapons whose only function is to kill human beings at close range. In 1959, 60% of Americans wanted handguns banned outright for all but police officers. Little to gain, lots to lose for Obama and Romney on guns . Responding to public opinion, states have loosened gun laws to allow citizens to carry weapons with them almost anywhere they go. In Georgia, Arizona, Tennessee and Virginia, it's legal to carry a gun into a bar. Guns and booze: What could go wrong? But here's the odd thing: At the same time as Americans have become more enthusiastic about gun rights, fewer and fewer Americans actually want to own a gun themselves. In the 1990s, the proportion of Americans who kept a gun in the home tumbled from one-half to one-third. And while gun ownership has risen in the Obama years, it remains lower than in the 1960s when strong majorities of the American people demanded stricter laws. How can we make sense of this weird divergence between beliefs and behavior? Americans support gun rights because they believe guns are necessary for self-protection. As the Georgia lawmaker who introduced the law allowing guns to be carried in bars explained: . ""Folks were being robbed, assaulted -- it was becoming an issue of personal safety. The police aren't going to be able to protect you. They're going to be checking out the crime scene after you and your family's been shot or injured or assaulted or raped."" At the same time, people hesitate to own guns themselves because they recognize that keeping a gun in the house is a dangerous thing to do. A gun in the house minimally doubles the risk that a household member will kill himself or herself. (Some studies put the increase in suicide risk as high as 10 times.) An American is 50% more likely to be shot dead by his or her own hand than to be shot dead by a criminal assailant. More than 30,000 Americans injure themselves with guns every year. The good news is that as America becomes safer, fewer and fewer Americans feel the need for a weapon. The overall violent crime index has tumbled by one-third since the early 1990s. The worst crimes -- murder and rape -- have declined even more. American citizens are safer today from crime than at almost any time since record-keeping began, very likely safer than at any time in the history of the country. Americans perceive these improvements in the safety of their immediate neighborhood. Back in the early 1980s, half of Americans said they feared to walk alone at night near their own homes. By the early 2000s, only one-third expressed such fears. (Those fears have ticked up a little in the last few years, even as crime rates continue to fall, but again they remain way below historic peaks.) Yet unfortunately, Americans are not, however, nearly so accurate at assessing national trends. In the mid-2000s, when crime rates were declining fast, almost 70% of Americans wrongly said that crime rates had risen over the past year. Analysis: Why gun controls are off the agenda in America . What force on earth could convince Americans that down is up? The most powerful force of all: television. TV news -- and especially local TV news -- is dominated by news of violent crime, the more spectacular and murderous the better. TV news creates a false picture of a country under attack by rampaging criminals, and especially nonwhite criminals. The people who watch the most TV news, Americans older than 50, also happen to be the group most likely to own a gun. Only one-fifth of young Americans own a gun; one-third of over-50 Americans do. Republicans are twice as likely to own a gun as Democrats. Maybe not so coincidentally, Republicans are more likely to watch the scariest news channel of them all: Fox. Whites are twice as likely to own a gun as nonwhites -- and it may also not be a coincidence that gun purchases have suddenly spiked since November 2008. Proponents of gun control are baffled that horrific massacres such as the one in Aurora, Colorado, do not lead to stricter gun control. They have their causation backward. The more terrifyingly criminal the world looks, the more ineffective law enforcement seems, the more Americans demand the right to deadly weapons with which to defend themselves. It is local TV programming directors, not the National Rifle Association, who are tirelessly persuading Americans that they need to strap a gun to their legs before heading to the mall. And what will change those attitudes is not more atrocity stories, but instead the reassuring truth: The United States is safe and getting safer, safer than ever before in its history. The police can protect you, and will, and do. And a gun in the house is not a guarantee of personal security -- it is instead a standing invitation to family tragedy. The cold dead hands from which they pry the gun are very unlikely to be the hands of a heroic minuteman defending home and hearth against intruders. They are much more likely to be the hands of a troubled adolescent or a clumsy child. In the land of the Second Amendment, nobody will take your guns away. But if you love your children, you should get rid of them voluntarily. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says public support for stricter gun control has steadily waned .

"(CNN) -- After nearly five years as Homeland Security Secretary, former Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano surprised the nation and many of her friends with last week's announcement that she was being nominated for appointment as the 20th president of the University of California. But no one who knows her (I have, personally and professionally for more than 30 years) is at all surprised at why the UC system wants her, or why she emerged as the nontraditional but consensus choice for the job among a pool of talented and qualified candidates. Napolitano will leave her Cabinet post as one of the most respected, trusted and personally admired figures of Barack Obama's presidency. Her new job will be another first in Napolitano's career: She was the first woman valedictorian at the University of Santa Clara; the first woman to be elected governor of Arizona by popular vote; first woman to head the mammoth, sprawling and unwieldy Department of Homeland Security. And now the first woman president of the nation's largest public university system. Her positions have involved widely different subject portfolios, but there are common threads which reveal and reinforce her strengths. Napolitano knows how to herd cats. As governor and as DHS secretary, she presided over many disparate organizational fiefdoms. Her great success in both jobs was to know how to play to their strengths to achieve common goals. In Arizona a $1 billion deficit became surplus, without a tax increase. At Homeland Security, she helped transform 22 agencies from across the federal government into what most now view as a single integrated Cabinet Department. In the process, she has overseen the maturation of that department's ""one-size-fits-all"" security approach to one that matches the strategy to the threat: intelligence-driven and risk-based. FEMA -- the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- was a late-night talk show joke before she took office. Remember Hurricane Katrina and ""heckuva good job, Brownie""? Napolitano worked together with a top-notch professional, FEMA Director Craig Fugate, to lead the federal response to historic natural disasters ranging from Hurricanes Sandy, Isaac and Irene to record flooding in the Midwest and major forest fires in the West. In the process, FEMA turned from a talk-show joke into a top-performing disaster response agency. Napolitano is not a limelight-seeker. She's a results-obsessed lawyer and public servant who sets priorities. At the Arizona border discussing immigration, on Gulf Coast beaches taking stock of daily progress in dealing with the BP Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, visiting tornado-devastated communities in the Midwest and hurricane-ravaged New Jersey beach towns, she walked beside those who were directly affected and ceded the key camera shots to them. She assumed responsibility and when she did take center stage it was as a public figure unafraid to deal with hostility and criticism -- as she did as the administration's sole witness during the recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the immigration reform bill. She brought years of front-line experience to the immigration debate and was a central figure in the ongoing discussions of reform. Her approach was not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. It was to focus on getting rid of criminals and threats to national security, while understanding that immigrants -- like her own Italian family -- have contributed much to this nation's prosperity and security. She has been was willing and ready to roll up her sleeves and work with all sides to construct an approach on immigration that works -- one that addresses both national security needs and immigrant potential. She applied her experience and expertise in many ways and behind the scenes, including in the final days of Senate debate on the ""Gang of Eight"" initiative, to remove roadblocks and move the process forward. Janet Napolitano is also one of the warmest and most caring individuals I know. Few are aware of the time she has devoted to help staff, family and friends in need. One example among many: A longtime mutual friend who served as director of constituent services in her Arizona office was unexpectedly stricken with illness. The woman lingered in ill health for many weeks before her untimely passing. Away from public and press attention, Napolitano went daily to her bedside, de facto family for an employee and friend who had lost most of hers long ago. In announcing the death, Napolitano paid tribute not only to the professional accomplishments but to the person with whom she had connected and befriended. ""[She] played a critical role in the Governor's Office,"" Napolitano wrote. ""What people may not know is that she was also an author, a hospice volunteer and a woman of deep faith. We're only beginning to grasp how much we will miss her."" Napolitano has done exemplary work at the Department of Homeland Security, most of it away from the spotlight. She played a critical role in helping this administration succeed in areas where previous administrations had not. What people may not know is that she is a fan of football and opera and a friend who has your back. The students, faculty, administrators and regents who make up the University of California system are about to find all this out. I suspect that as the administration looks to replace her, it will begin to grasp how much it will miss her. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Wilson.","Doug Wilson: People who know Janet Napolitano not surprised she's to head UC system .

"(CNN) -- Just steps away from the courthouse where a jury decided George Zimmerman's fate, demonstrators vowed that their fight wasn't over. ""Nationwide protest to demand justice,"" they chanted after the jury's not guilty verdict in Sanford, Florida, cleared Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. It wasn't long before some appeared to be heeding their call. Protesters rallied in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Denver, Baltimore, Detroit, New York and other cities. ""I came here today to stand in solidarity with Trayvon Martin's family, and everyone else searching for justice for him, and wanting to bring Zimmerman to justice,"" said Kellie Knight. She spoke at a protest at Union Square in New York City. Catch up on the Zimmerman saga in one story . ""If it can happen to her son, it can happen to anybody's son or daughter,"" she said. Later, a crowd converged on Times Square, chanting: ""This is what democracy looks like."" The verdict in the closely watched trial echoed far beyond the central Florida city's borders in a case that drew national attention and has been racially charged from the start. ""Only white life is protected in America,"" one protester in Washington shouted early Sunday. A crowd lined up outside the White House and sang ""Amazing Grace."" Others chanted ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Trayvon was murdered"" as they marched, freelance photographer Michael Kandel told CNN's iReport. The atmosphere was tense as demonstrators demanded that the government investigate further, Kandel said. ""They believe that this is a civil rights issue that must become the topic of a national conversation in the coming days,"" he said. ""They did not believe justice had been served and were pleading for it."" In Dallas, protesters waved signs that said, ""Justice system is a joke,"" CNN affiliate WFAA reported. Some demonstrators in Denver, Baltimore and Detroit wore hooded sweatshirts like the one Martin wore when he was killed. In Chicago's Daley Plaza, protesters vowed to use technology to push for change. ""It's the 21st century. We've got Twitter. We've got Instagram. We've got Facebook, we've got all these things that our elders did not have,"" one woman told the crowd. ""We have resources."" Verdict doesn't end debate in Martin's death . Pushing for peace . President Barack Obama called Sunday for ""calm reflection,"" acknowledging the Zimmerman case has stirs strong emotions. ""And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,"" he said. ""I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. ""We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis,"" Obama said. Most protests have been peaceful, though there were some reports of property damage at a protest in Oakland, California. ""I think we should, frankly, right now be celebrating the fact that we've seen a generation of young people respond by using our system, raising their voices, but not using their fists,"" NAACP President Benjamin Jealous told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. Analysis: The race factor in Zimmerman's trial . The Rev. Jesse Jackson called for protests to continue, and to remain peaceful. ""There will be protests, but they must be carried out with dignity and discipline,"" he told CNN's ""New Day."" ""Let no act discredit the legacy of Trayvon Martin. In the long run, we will prevail in the struggle for justice. Any act of violence could serve to undermine the innocent blood and moral authority of Trayvon. What will happen if there, in fact, are riots, it gives sympathy to Zimmerman, and discredits Trayvon. Trayvon deserves sympathy. Zimmerman and his school of thought does not."" Zimmerman, his family and their supporters have denied allegations of racism and argued that civil rights groups are being incendiary without facts to back up their claims. ""We have a verdict. I think we should really take a step back, respect that verdict, respect those six women -- an all-women jury, who had to make a really tough call and had to look at this outside all the emotions that were stirred up, and all of the racial innuendo that was stirred up, and just kind of look at the facts,"" Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., told CNN on Sunday morning. ""And the facts spoke for themselves."" Some applauded the jury for siding with the neighborhood watch volunteer's claims that he shot the teen in self-defense. Others said prosecutors failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Some said the trial was a referendum on race that confirmed what they knew all along. ""That's our society,"" Terri Weems said as she headed into church in Washington on Sunday morning. ""We expected not to be given justice. We haven't been dealt justice all this time. ... It's very disheartening."" Zimmerman could still be held responsible for Martin's death . Reactions from the pulpit . In churches around the country, the trial was a hot topic on Sunday. Donna Holmes-Lockett, who was also heading into church in Washington, said she was surprised by the verdict. Zimmerman should have been punished for the shooting, she said. ""As a mother of black males, I have three sons, it makes me nervous about the reaction of the public toward the situations. I felt like he should have got some kind of, something. He's just walking away free. He did shoot him. It's like it's OK,"" she said. ""I think if it was a black crime on a black person, it would have been a different outcome."" At Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the pastor called for all parishioners under 18 years old to step forward in a tribute to Martin. ""The world needs your voice. Don't let anybody tell you that you're a nobody. We love you and we're counting on you,"" he told them. Why this verdict? ""Nobody gets nervous seeing you talk bad and look bad. If you really want to strike fear in the hearts of your adversaries, if you really want to be a real threat, make sure God is in your heart (and) knowledge is in your head."" At churches with close ties to the case, Sunday was a time to reflect and pray. ""We're leaning in and depending on you this morning, oh God, for all of our help,"" a man said from the pulpit at the Allen Chapel AME Church in Sanford, where a town hall meeting was held after the shooting. ""We're not depending on the Sanford Police Department. We're not depending on Seminole County Sheriff. We're not depending on the courts of Seminole County, Florida."" Several members of Martin's family attended services at Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Opa-locka, Florida. ""We're very concerned, very hurt and very disappointed at this point, but we know in the end God will prevail and justice will be served,"" said Roberta Felton, a cousin. While the Martin family grieves, Pastor Arthur Jackson III said, the community must prepare to take action. ""I believe this situation has not paralyzed us, has not traumatized us, but is mobilizing us,"" he said. ""It has been a call to rally at the polls, to vote ... to change these unjust laws.""

"(CNN) -- A flooring contractor from Brooklyn, New York, received news he had dreamed of for more than a year when a Bolivian judge released him on bail Tuesday. Jacob Ostreicher wore a white bulletproof vest as he spoke with reporters after the hearing. Supporters of the businessman, 53, who had been imprisoned for 18 months, say he faces death threats for exposing Bolivian government corruption connected with the case against him. ""His life remains at risk every day that he remains in Bolivia,"" U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, said in a statement Tuesday. Ostreicher was arrested in June 2011 on suspicion of money laundering tied to a rice-growing operation. He has denied the accusations and has claimed for months that corrupt officials had trumped up the case. Bolivian authorities arrested six government officials last month, accusing them of trying to extort and steal from Ostreicher. Now some of his one-time accusers -- including former employees of the attorney general's office and the country's interior ministry -- are behind bars in the same prison where he was held. Bolivia's state-run ABI news agency has described that facility -- the Palmasola prison in Santa Cruz, Bolivia -- as the country's ""most dangerous and overcrowded."" On Tuesday, Ostreicher was released on bail of 100,000 bolivianos (about $14,200), and now will be in more comfortable conditions, although the case against him hasn't been dropped. He will remain under house arrest from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., Judge Eneas Gentile ruled Tuesday, but can move freely at other times. Smith and U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, praised Ostreicher's release as the ""first positive development"" in the case. ""But this is only the beginning of the end,"" Smith said. ""Jacob has incurred permanent damage to his health and has lost over 18 precious months of his life with his wife, children and grandchildren."" After the hearing, an ambulance transported Ostreicher to a clinic where he is being treated for Parkinson's disease, ABI reported. In an interview with CNN en EspaÃÂ±ol from a hospital bed earlier this month, Ostreicher said he was wearing a bulletproof vest out of fear for his safety, even as officials had been arrested in the corruption probe connected with his case. ""Actually I feel much less safe. That's why you see me sleeping with this bulletproof vest,"" he said. ""Because now there are some officials in prison."" The detention of Ostreicher, who at one point went on a hunger strike to protest his imprisonment, drew international attention. Actor Sean Penn sat at his side last week, calling for his release. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Ostreicher said his case was only one of many in the South American country. ""I want Bolivia to know that not only my family and I have been victims of these extortioners who are detained today. Also hundreds of Bolivian families have been victims, and the greatest victim has been President Evo Morales, for which these people deserve to be punished with the harshest penalties that exist,"" he said, according to ABI. Demonstrators outside the courthouse Tuesday both advocated and denounced Ostreicher, CNN affiliate Bolivision reported. Some claimed he had taken over land in Bolivia without paying for it. But members of Bolivia's Jewish community said Ostreicher, an Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn, had been unjustly accused. Some of them held signs in Hebrew. ""He is one more Jew who is the victim of persecution,"" one man said. ""We hope justice is done. We hope he is freed. Being free, he can defend himself. We hope that all of his property which has been seized, practically robbed, is returned to him."" Word of Ostreicher's release was posted on the ""Free Jacob Ostreicher"" Facebook page Tuesday. Below a series of news reports, there were photos of crestfallen children posted last week. ""Hanukah without our grandfather - second year that we spend it without him,"" one caption said. Journalist Gloria Carrasco reported from La Paz, Bolivia, and CNN's Fernando del Rincon and Mariano Castillo contributed to his report from Atlanta.","Jacob Ostreicher, who had been detained since June 2011, was released .

"(CNN) -- It may feel to us, in France, as if Dominique Strauss-Kahn has constantly been in the news since that fateful afternoon of May 14, 2011, when NYPD officers arrested him on board an Air France flight bound to Berlin. The then-head of the International Monetary Fund was due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel to try to solve the euro crisis. The man the French like to call DSK has only spoken twice about the day he fell from grace, the day he risked a brilliant international career, like many others to play Russian roulette. The first time he talked publicly was in September 2011 on French television. Now, almost two years later, he has given his first English language interview, on CNN. The French weren't very tender with him the first time he spoke out; they will undoubtedly be as severe the second time. DSK says how he still feels ""very angry"" at the U.S. justice system for having paraded him, handcuffed, for the whole world to see, ""at the precise time when a man should be considered innocent."" Two years later, DSK still smarting over 'perp walk' Those images were, and indeed remain, shocking. It is illegal in France to show the face of people arrested by the police until they are proved guilty. It is, however, difficult to feel sorry for him now, especially after all that we have learnt since: his admission that he attended orgies in France with prostitutes paid for by friends, although he assures us he could not have possibly realized they were prostitutes because he only ever saw them naked. This man was going to be France's next president after five years of Sarkozy rule. I would have voted for him, as no doubt millions of my compatriots would have done too, convinced as we were of his dazzling intelligence and that he was the man to resolve the euro crisis. We vaguely knew of his womanizing, certainly not a crime in French books, except we weren't aware it was pathological. Strauss-Kahn doesn't however dwell too long on his Sofitel demise and swiftly moves on to explain how Europe is suffering a crisis of leadership. Quoting an Arabic proverb, he says that an army of lions led by a sheep will always be defeated by an army of sheep lead by a lion. Does he unconsciously imply that he was the lion Europe could have had and badly needed to dig itself out of its financial quagmire, if only fate hadn't decided otherwise? Possibly. Meanwhile, the former head of the IMF blames the European institutions for failing to implement hard decisions and for dithering. He says that some European leaders are ""perfectly up-to-date"" and capable but that they are victims of deficient decision-making mechanisms at a supra-national level. Would he give, as France has tried to convince a reluctant Germany since 2008, more power to the European Central Bank and its director Mario Draghi? Probably. As Martin Schultz, president of the European Parliament tweeted this week: ""The U.S. have one currency, one central bank and one government. Europe has one currency, one central bank and... 17 governments! It cannot go on like this,"" before adding: ""We cannot live with 17 individual policies on the euro. We need one single euro governance."" According to Strauss-Kahn, cohesion in decision making in Europe is not the only stumbling block. The European banking system is also at fault, ""sick,"" and needs reforming before growth can settle back in. Reforming traders' pay and bonuses is just but a small part of the problem, Strauss-Kahn says, what is even more important is to purge the whole system. When Strauss-Kahn first spoke to the French in September 2011, he also dived into European economics to give a mini-lecture on how to go about the financial crisis. The French public reacted angrily: what was he doing, distilling his knowledge, when he was in no position to actually help the country any longer? The French perfectly knew of his skills, so lamentably wasted; they just didn't want to hear him anymore. The world will probably feel the same watching his interview with CNN. Strauss-Kahn's voice doesn't resonate anymore; it was lost, once and for all, in a hotel suite in Manhattan.

"(CNN) -- ""Abolition"" isn't a word you hear much in 2013. It should be, though. And a group of modern-day freedom fighters in Illinois is resurrecting the term -- with its echoes of 1800s America -- to combat ongoing slavery in a faraway West African country. The Abolition Institute, which launched its website on Monday, is a newly formed group trying to end slavery in Mauritania, a remote outpost in the Sahara where an estimated 10% to 20% of people are enslaved, according to a U.N. expert. ""There's just a special connection between Illinois, where President Lincoln and President Grant and President Obama are from, and Mauritania,"" said Sean Tenner, the group's co-founder, who also hails from Illinois. ""(They're) different places, but with the same path."" Hopefully that path leads to universal freedom. I traveled to Mauritania in December 2011 to report on the issue for CNN's Freedom Project. It's an amazing and gut-wrenching place, full of vast potential but struggling to break slavery's psychological chains. More than a year later, I'm left with a deep sense of hope and cautious optimism that Mauritania will be able to break them. Tenner and his nascent group are one reason for that. He saw the CNN report online in March 2012 and decided he wanted to do something to help abolish slavery in a country he'd never visited, in the name of people who he's mostly never met. ""To say it changed my life and changed other peoples' lives would be an understatement,"" he said. The Abolition Institute has applied for 501(c)3 status as a nonprofit organization, Tenner said, but has not been granted that status yet. Its website lets users quickly petition the United States and other world governments to put pressure on Mauritania to prosecute slave owners ""instead of protecting them."" It calls slavery in Mauritania ""one of the most pressing human rights issues of our time."" Tenner assembled a well-connected board of directors to raise awareness about the issue and to collect funds for anti-slavery groups who work on the ground in Mauritania. The board includes veterans of Obama political campaigns, the Save Darfur movement, the Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation -- as well as Mauritanian human rights activists who are now living in North America. Paul Rusesabagina, whose story inspired the film ""Hotel Rwanda"" and who is credited with rescuing 1,200 people during the 1994 genocide in that East African country, spoke at the Abolition Institute's grand opening. Tenner, a 35-year-old from suburban Chicago, is following the path of many brave abolitionists in Mauritania -- several of whom I was lucky enough to meet. Since our online project published last year, Biram Dah Abeid, head of one local abolitionist group, was arrested for burning Quornic texts he says condone slavery. Later, after being released, he was given the Front Line Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk by a human rights group in Ireland. Meanwhile, Boubacar Messaoud, head of a group called SOS Slaves and one of the long-standing heroes of the country's abolitionist movement, has provided assistance to women who recently escaped slavery or who come from the enslaved class. Tenner had a Chicago Cubs jersey made with Messaoud's name on it -- and wants to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize. Tenner's first goal, though, is to make people aware that slavery exists in Mauritania, although government officials have denied its existence. And he's smart to do so by forging ties between his state -- home to the American president who banned slavery and the country's first African-American president -- and a country in West Africa that continues to struggle for freedom. ""The more people around the world who are aware of the issue the more pressure will be generated on ... Mauritania,"" he said, ""and the better the situation will become."" The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","New group called the Abolition Institute forms in Illinois .

"(CNN) -- Essie Mae Washington-Williams, the biracial woman who revealed nine years ago she was the illegitimate daughter of former segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond, died Monday, her family's spokesman said. She was 87. Washington-Williams kept her father's identity secret until six months after Thurmond, a segregationist leader for decades, died in June 2003 at age 100. ""I never wanted to do anything to harm him or cause detriment to his life or to the lives of those around him,"" Washington-Williams said at a 2003 news conference, six months after her father died at the age of 100. She died at her Columbia, South Carolina, home of natural causes Monday morning, according to Frank Wheaton. Thurmond ran for president in 1948 on the ticket of the States' Rights Democratic Party, or Dixiecrats, a breakaway faction of Southern Democrats who believed strongly in racial segregation and were opposed to their party's civil rights program. Thurmond joined the Republican Party in the 1960s and ultimately turned away from his segregationist past. Martin: GOP needs to listen to blacks . ""My father did a lot of things to help other people, even though his public stance appeared opposite,"" Washington-Williams said. ""I was sensitive about his well-being and career and his family here in South Carolina."" Washington-Williams said she went public only at the urging of her children, but rumors had persisted for years. An attorney for the former senator's family confirmed in 2003 that Thurmond fathered a child with a teenage black housekeeper in 1925. Her mother, Carrie Butler, worked as a maid at the Thurmond family home in Edgefield, South Carolina. At the time of Washington-Williams' birth, Butler was 16 and Thurmond was 22, unmarried and living in his parents' home. Opinion: MLK would hardly recognize America today . Butler's sister took the girl to live in Pennsylvania when she was 6 months old. She did not meet Thurmond until 1941, when she was 16. Her mother, who was ill and died a short time later, had insisted on introducing her to Thurmond, who acknowledged her as his daughter, the Washngton Post reported in 2003. Throughout the years, the two kept up a relationship despite the divide over race, Washington-Williams said. ""When my father became a United States senator [in 1954], his communication and support continued"" she said, and ""his financial support was constant during various phases of my life. I knew him beyond his public image."" She said she tried -- to no avail -- to dissuade him of segregationist positions, which produced ""mixed emotions"" for her. Voting rights remain vulnerable . ""I never did like the idea of his being a segregationist, but that was his life, and there wasn't anything I could do about that,"" she said. People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived .

"(CNN) -- The saga of Trayvon Martin continued to energize thousands around the country Monday, spurring demonstrations across the United States and even turning what had been a regularly scheduled city commission meeting into a hot-ticket event. Exactly one month ago, the 17-year-old was shot dead in Sanford, Florida, while heading back from a convenience store, where he'd picked up a bag of Skittles and an iced tea. The teen's admitted shooter, neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, hasn't been charged in the case, and his lawyer has said his client shot Martin in self-defense. Yet the young victim's parents, as well as their supporters, have suggested that the shooter thought their son was ""suspicious"" because he was black, adding that they feel local police bungled the case in numerous ways -- chief among them, by not arresting Zimmerman. Newspaper report fills in some blanks about incident . ""Do the right thing, arrest Zimmerman now,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, in presenting Sanford's city commission with a petition he claimed had been signed by 2 million people who urged that the shooter be detained. Sharpton joined Trayvon Martin's parents at a trio of well-attended events Monday in the central Florida city. The first was a noontime ""town hall"" forum hosted by Roland Martin, a CNN contributor. After that, the parents spoke out forcefully in response to recently reported news that February 26 -- the day of the shooting -- their son wasn't in school because he'd been suspended for 10 days after an empty plastic bag found in his book bag had marijuana residue. Family spokesman Ryan Julison confirmed the suspension. ""The only comment that I have right now is that they've killed my son and now they're trying to kill his reputation,"" Trayvon Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, said at a news conference following that forum. The day's most anticipated event was initially expected to be a standard city commission meeting. But in response to the public outcry -- and criticisms over the Sanford Police Department's handling of the case -- city officials decided to focus the meeting on the incident. Some waited in line for several hours for the chance to get one of 500 available seats in the Sanford Civic Center. The meeting had been moved to there to accommodate a large crowd, but even then many hundreds weren't able to get into the packed hall. ""I just want to reaffirm that we truly are in pursuit of truth and justice, and we've looked outside our walls (for help),"" Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett said, referring to the city's outreach to the U.S. Justice Department, the FBI and others to review how the case was and should be handled. ""And we will take swift and decisive action,"" Triplett added. Over the next several hours, several speakers allied with the Martin family took to the lectern demanding Zimmerman's arrest, calling for city officials to take a stand, and criticizing how the police investigation was handled. ""We're not asking for an eye for an eye, we're asking for justice, justice, justice,"" said Tracy Martin, Trayvon's father. The parents eventually left and headed to a nearby park -- where the city commission meeting had been broadcast on large video screens -- for a rally scheduled for later in the day. The family had plenty of support Monday, and not just in Sanford. In communities big and small, people wore hooded sweatshirts -- hoodies -- and carried Skittles and iced tea -- just as Martin had done on the night of his death -- as they called for Zimmerman's arrest, legislative changes and an end to racial profiling. Share your pictures or video from one of these events . They included throngs of people who marched on streets in front of the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, decrying a ""stand your ground"" law in that state -- as in Florida -- that allows people to use force in self-defense. More than 2,100 miles away in San Francisco, others held up signs reading, ""We demand justice."" Similar scenes played out in Iowa City, Iowa; Houston; Detroit; Philadelphia; and places in between. Majority in poll say shooter should be arrested . In Washington, speakers organized by the National Black United Front lined up, one by one, to grab a bullhorn and demand a ""conviction"" of Zimmerman. When protesters agreed with a speaker, they shook their bags of Skittles. Demonstrators there said they believed race was a factor in Martin's death at the hands of Zimmerman, who is a white Hispanic. ""If this had been a brother, he'd be on death row!"" one protester shouted, referring to Zimmerman. Maria Roach, an African-American mother of a 7-year-old boy, delivered to the U.S. Justice Department a printout copy of an online petition with over 500,000 digital signatures to demand that agency take action. ""We want a conviction, we want an arrest, and we want it now,"" Roach said.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Seventh graders at Ron Clark Academy became an overnight sensation during the presidential election when their YouTube performance of ""You Can Vote However You Like"" catapulted them to online stardom. ""The higher the expectations, the higher the results,"" says Ron Clark, seen here with his students. Now, their creative and scholastic talents have proved the students to be more than just ""one hit wonders."" Academy students showcased their poetry and writings for CNN's documentary ""Black in America 2,"" hosted by Soledad O'Brien. Cultivating student creativity is just one of the goals of academy founder Ron Clark, an enigmatic educator known for his unconventional teaching methods. Under his strict tutelage, students at Ron Clark -- who are predominantly African-American -- are expected to excel in all subjects and maintain a high standard of respect for their peers and teachers. ""I'm teaching an eighth-grade curriculum to fifth-graders,"" says Clark. ""Some people say my expectations of the kids, academically, is too high, but the higher the expectations, the higher the results."" But with high academic expectations come an equally high quotient for fun. It's become one of Clark's trademarks: singing and dancing to popular rap and R&B songs during class to get the kids engaged. ""My first day at Ron Clark Academy, I thought all the teachers were psychopaths,"" says seventh-grader Jai Springs. ""I thought Ron Clark was going crazy. He was up in front of the kids on desks, he was dancing. ... I never saw a teacher get up on a desk and dance. But now I'm used to it, so I get up on the desk and dance too,"" says Jai. Clark, formerly a schoolteacher from South Carolina, founded the academy with money he earned from his book titled The Essential 55, which detail Clark's 55 golden rules for success -- in and out of the classroom. Clark was invited to be a guest on the Oprah Winfrey show after winning Disney Teacher of the Year Award in 2001. Oprah believed so much in the well-mannered Southern school teacher from South Carolina that she encouraged him to write the book. Later she promoted The Essential 55 on her show, prompting it's ascension to New York Times bestseller list. Together with co-founder Kim Bearden, Clark transformed a decaying factory in a rough part of Atlanta, Georgia, into a state-of-the-art educational model for middle schools across the country. Soon after the school opened its doors in 2008, a Christmas package from Winfrey arrived for Clark in the form of a $365,000 grant, or ""a thousand dollars for each day of the year,"" as Oprah referred to it in the letter. Then came the elections, with a tight presidential race between Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and John McCain of Arizona. Inspired by rapper T.I.'s hit song ""Whatever You Like,"" Clark's seventh grade class penned their own lyrics and dance moves. The students' performance carried a message: Cast your ballot because you support a candidate's policies rather than just his skin color. When they perform the song, half the seventh grade class touts the virtues of GOP's McCain while the other half root for Democrat Obama: ""Obama on the left. McCain on the right. We can talk politics all night. And you can vote however you like."" The students ""can talk politics with the best of them,"" says Clark. Video clips of the kids performing have garnered over 15 million hits on YouTube. ""We got lots of media attention. But when the media arrived to the school they realized the song is not the story, it's the kids,"" says Clark. One of Clark's credos is teaching a ""global curriculum"" with a heavy emphasis on current events. Himself an avid world traveler, Clark believes it's essential for his students to travel to other countries to develop an understanding and appreciation of the world in which they live. Through Delta's corporate sponsorship of the school, administrators have been able to send all 100 of their fifth to eighth grade students abroad before they graduate. ""I'm not nearly as shy as I used to be,"" says seventh-grader Chi Chi Kasarachi after her first year at the academy. ""My knowledge of the world has improved, I know more about what's going on in other countries and I'm more curious about things. ... I'm just hungry for knowledge,"" says Chi Chi. In fact, the students at Ron Clark Academy are better versed in current events and politics than many adults. ""I never thought I'd be interested in watching the news,"" says seventh-grader Osei Avril. ""Now I find it interesting because I have learned the stories behind the news,"" he says. Osei -- who pronounces Iranian President Ahmadinajad's name perfectly -- says he's interested in learning about world issues such as the Iranian elections, the Taliban in Pakistan, and the Palestinian- Israeli conflict. ""At the beginning,"" says Clark, ""the kids will say something like 'I've been to East Point [a suburb of South Atlanta]. After a few years they've been to Kenya, Japan, or South Africa, or England. ... They've become very comfortable with understanding the country and understanding themselves."" But it's not just the travel or even the singing and dancing to rap music that make the school so special, say the students. It's the academy teachers' creative ways of instilling education, solid values, and a passion for learning. ""They want you to pass the people at the top,"" says Jai. ""To be at the top nonstop, be at your fullest, to be creative, to think out of the box."" But school isn't all fun and games, she says. Clark is a strict disciplinarian that expects -- and enforces -- model behavior from all of the students. ""I love Mr. Clark with all my heart, he's like a father to me,"" says Chi Chi. ""He might fuss a lot, but I know he's doing it for our own good.""","Ron Clark Academy students' '08 YouTube rap performance got millions of hits .

"(CNN) -- British royals rarely speak to the media; the Duchess of Cambridge has done so only once. As a result, reporters rely on other people who have spoken to her for information. It could be palace sources, or even members of the public who have met Catherine during a walkabout. And while there are all sorts of questions that the public likes to ask of Prince William's pregnant wife, the top of the list at the moment is whether she's having a boy or a girl. It's not an entirely trivial matter when you consider the current rush to update ancient British laws in the event the baby turns out to be a girl. At the moment, girls are leapfrogged to the throne by younger brothers -- an outdated and sexist protocol that simply isn't acceptable to this generation. So if Catherine has a daughter, that princess would make history by being the first to grow up assured of her destiny. This interest in Britain's future head of state has turned into a frantic scramble to jump on any nugget of information that may provide clues as to the baby's gender. That latest nugget of intelligence may have slipped from the duchess' mouth as she chatted to Sandra Cook, a 67-year-old royal well-wisher Catherine met while on a trip to the town of Grimsby on Tuesday. Cook told reporters: ""The lady next to me gave her a teddy bear and I distinctly heard her say: 'Thank you, I will take that for my d...' Then she stopped herself. I said to her: 'You were going to say daughter weren't you?' She said: 'No, we don't know.' I said: 'Oh I think you do,' to which she said: 'We're not telling.'"" What started as a minor Tuesday visit to northeast England ended as Wednesday's front page news. ""Does Kate's slip of the tongue mean her baby's a girl?"" asked the headline of the Daily Mail newspaper, a question also splayed across the fronts of Britain's other broadsheet papers. The Mirror event went a step further, declaring ""It's a girl!"" to readers. Catherine's slip wasn't just front page news, however -- it caused a betting frenzy that forced two leading bookmakers, William Hill and Paddy Power, to suspend bets on the sex of the royal baby. Then, out of nowhere, a report in the Grimsby Telegraph newspaper quoted someone else who met the duchess. Katy Forrester said: ""I swear she said it was a boy...I asked her if the baby had been kicking. I swear she replied 'Yes he is, very much so' but no one else heard! Either I misunderstood it, or Kate is trying to confuse us all!"" I was confused, so I followed up with a palace source who told me William and Catherine don't know the sex of the baby, and that she said as much during the walkabout. Who knows...","As British royals rarely speak to the media, reporters rely on other sources, says Max Foster .

"(CNN) -- On the night of February 26, Trayvon Martin was wearing a hoodie and had bought Skittles and an Arizona tea at a convenience store in Sanford, Florida. Some time after that, he was shot and killed by neighborhood watch member George Zimmerman. But beyond those established facts about the shooting of the unarmed teenager in an Orlando suburb last month, much is in dispute about the case that has gripped the nation. Of the two people directly involved, Martin will never be able to describe what happened, and Zimmerman has kept mum. His lawyer vows that, once all the facts surface, things will not appear as clear-cut as they are to many of Martin's supporters at the moment. America will have to wait and see as State Attorney Angela Corey plunges deeper into a case charged with allegations of racism. Martin was African-American; Zimmerman is a Hispanic who, his family says, has been wrongly described as racist. What's clear is that, as more is learned about this case, it becomes more complicated. The little information that has surfaced has been through 911 tapes, what Zimmerman told police and the accounts of witnesses who helped paint a picture of the night Martin died. George Zimmerman . Zimmerman was wearing a red jacket and blue jeans when he came across Martin on that night. He was a neighborhood watch member carrying a Kel-Tec 9 mm pistol, according to a police report. He said he was on his way to a grocery store when he spotted Martin walking through the Retreat at Twin Lakes, according to the Orlando Sentinel, which pieced together an account of what happened based on leaked information from investigators. Sanford police said the newspaper account ""is consistent with the information provided to the State Attorney's office by the police department."" Martin was visiting his father's fiancee, who lived in the gated community in Sanford, a racially mixed northern suburb of Orlando. Zimmerman called police to report a suspicious person. He described Martin as black and said he was acting strangely and could have been on drugs. Zimmerman said he got out of his SUV and followed Martin on foot. ""Something's wrong with him,"" he told a 911 dispatcher, according to the contents of a call released by authorities. ""Yep. He's coming to check me out. He's got something in his hands."" The teenager started to run, Zimmerman said. A 911 dispatcher asked Zimmerman whether he was following Martin, and Zimmerman said he was. The dispatcher said Zimmerman did not need to do that. Zimmerman said he lost sight of Martin and began walking back to his SUV; Martin approached him, according to the Sentinel account. Martin asked Zimmerman if he had a problem; Zimmerman said no and reached for his cell phone, he told police. Martin said, ""Well, you do now"" or something similar and punched Zimmerman in the nose, Zimmerman said, according to the Sentinel. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk. The police report described Zimmerman's back as wet and covered with grass, as though he had been lying on the ground. Zimmerman was also bleeding from the nose and the back of his head, the police report said. ""I was yelling for someone to help me, but no one would help me,"" Zimmerman told police. By the time police arrived on the scene, Martin was dead from a gunshot wound in the chest, according to Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee. The unarmed teenager was lying face-down. Zimmerman told police that he shot Martin. And that he did it in self-defense. 911 calls . Residents of the gated community heard the gunshot. Seven 911 calls released by authorities document their fear. Someone screams, ""help, help!"" in the background. ""There were gunshots right outside my house. There's someone screaming. I just heard a guy shot,"" a neighbor says. ""Hurry up, they are right outside my house."" Another man cries for help. Then the gunshot. ""Hurry, please. ... There's someone screaming outside,"" a neighbor whispers. ""There's a gunshot. Hurry up. ... There's someone screaming. I just heard a gunshot."" In another call, a woman begs the dispatchers to send help, saying someone is ""screaming and hollering"" for help. Moments later, she describes a light at the scene of the shooting. ""Oh, my God,"" she says. ""There's still somebody out there walking with a flashlight."" Zimmerman's call to police was among the 911 tapes released by police. Some people hear what sounds like a possible racial slur. CNN enhanced the sound of the 911 call, and several members of CNN's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur. Witnesses . Mary Cutcher was in her kitchen making coffee that night with her roommate, Selma Mora Lamilla. The window was open, she said. ""We heard a whining. Not like a crying, boohoo, but like a whining, someone in distress, and then the gunshot,"" she said. They looked out the window but saw nothing. It was dark. They ran out the sliding glass door, and within seconds, they saw Zimmerman. ""Zimmerman was standing over the body with -- basically straddling the body with his hands on Trayvon's back,"" Cutcher said. ""And it didn't seem to me that he was trying to help him in any way. I didn't hear any struggle prior to the gunshot. ""And I feel like it was Trayvon Martin that was crying out, because the minute that the gunshot went off, the whining stopped."" The two women said they could not see whether Zimmerman was bruised or hurt. It was too dark. ""Selma asked him three times, 'what's going on over there?' "" Cutcher said. ""He looks back and doesn't say anything. She asks him again, 'everything OK? What's going on?' Same thing: looked at us, looked back. Finally, the third time, he said, 'just call the police.' "" Martin's girlfriend . Benjamin Crump, the Martin family lawyer, says Martin's girlfriend's account of what happened connects the dots and destroys Zimmerman's claims of self-defense. The girl, who did not want to be identified, said she was on the phone with the teen before the shooting. When Zimmerman got closer to Martin, she told her boyfriend to run, but Martin told her that he was not going to run, she said. ""What are you stopping me for?"" Martin asked Zimmerman, according to the girl. ""What are you doing around here?"" Zimmerman asked in response. The girl said she then got the impression that an altercation was taking place and that someone had pushed Martin, because the headset fell out of his ear, and the phone shut off. Zimmerman's friend . Joe Oliver said he spoke with his friend Zimmerman on Monday. He filled Oliver in on what happened between the time Martin came face to face with him and when the gun was fired -- the part that's not all clear. Oliver said he could not divulge what Zimmerman said, just that the gun went off. Corey, the state attorney, was asked whether that meant the shooting might have been accidental. ""We look into that in every shooting case,"" Corey said. Oliver said Zimmerman was badly hurt that night. He went to a doctor the next day to be treated for a broken nose. ""He hasn't been back to his apartment, which is in that complex, ever since that happened, and he's being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder, for depression, for insomnia,"" Oliver said. ""He cried for days after this happened. The George Zimmerman I know is not here anymore, because he knows that he took someone else's life, and he's extremely remorseful."" Zimmerman has not been charged, sparking a firestorm of protest across America. Corey's homicide staff, meanwhile, continues to work round the clock.","The case becomes more complicated as details emerge .

"(CNN) -- A Boeing 767 on a flight from Newark, New Jersey, made a dramatic emergency landing at Warsaw, Poland's Frederic Chopin International airport Tuesday after problems with its landing gear, an airport spokeswoman said. All the passengers on the flight, from Newark Liberty International Airport to Warsaw, are safe and uninjured, she told CNN. Newark Liberty serves the greater New York area. The LOT Polish Airlines flight, which had been due to land at 1:35 p.m. local time, circled above the airport for an hour before coming down in a belly landing at 2:40, she said. ""After noticing a central hydraulic system failure the standard procedure for emergency landings at Warsaw airport were implemented,"" LOT said in a statement, saying emergency crews were in place on the ground to assist. Video footage from the scene showed the plane coming in to land without its wheels down and skidding along the tarmac to a halt. Emergency vehicles raced toward the aircraft and appeared to hose it down as passengers disembarked. There were 231 people aboard the flight, 220 of them passengers and 11 crew, the airline said. The passengers ""stayed calm"" during the emergency landing, and after reaching the terminal were cared for by support staff and psychologists, the airline said. They are being allowed to go home after a medical examination and a brief police interview, it added. Other travelers face significant disruption. The airport will remain closed until at least 8 a.m. local time Wednesday because the damaged aircraft is blocking the runways, an airport spokesman told reporters. LOT said all its flights scheduled to leave later Tuesday have been canceled. Incoming flights have been redirected to other airports in Poland, it said, and passengers will be brought from there to Warsaw. The airport is Poland's busiest, handling almost half its air passenger traffic with about 100 scheduled flights a day, the airport's website says. LOT, the Polish flag carrier and one of the world's oldest airlines, is currently offering special deals on flights from the New York area to Warsaw. In 2010, it carried more than 4.5 million passengers, nearly three-quarters of whom were on international flights, its website says. The airline said it aims to offer quality of service and value for money. CNN's Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.","NEW: Warsaw's main airport will remain closed overnight .

Ask students to brainstorm a list of Latino or Hispanic sports figures, past and present. Divide the class into groups, and have each group select one of these athletes. Guide each group as its members research their chosen athlete's life, including his or her background, culture and achievements. Encourage students to identify objects that could be included in a museum exhibit telling the story of this athlete's life. Inform each group that its exhibit should also contain artifacts that demonstrate both that person's cultural heritage and impact on his or her sport. After groups have completed their research, challenge each group to build a model, draw a labeled sketch or write a paragraph about their exhibit and present it to the class. After each presentation, have individual students give constructive feedback regarding the selection of artifacts and the overall design of the exhibit. Generate a class discussion after the presentations. Ask students: What contributions did these athletes make to their individual sports? What role did culture play in the life stories of these athletes? Which athletes would students consider as role models for others? How might athletes serve as role models for young people who come from similar backgrounds, as well as from different backgrounds? Curriculum Connections . Social Studies .

"(CNN) -- Ronald Reagan once joked, ""Politics is not a bad profession. If you succeed, there are many rewards. If you disgrace yourself, you can always write a book."" Today, that joke would have to be updated to add that not only can you write a book, but you can also be on reality TV show, host cable news programs, run for office again and possibly even win. Disgraced politicians never die. They're like Jason from the ""Friday the 13th"" movies -- you just can't kill them. They keep coming at you like the political version of zombies. Sure, some fallen politicians still write books about their ""adventures."" Former Ohio congressman Bob Ney recently made the rounds on the talk show circuit to promote his new memoir. Ney, who resigned in 2006, served more than a year in prison after pleading guilty to corruption charges in connection with the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. But books are nothing compared to the other ways sullied politicians can profit off of their newly found infamy. Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer -- who resigned because he was caught frequenting prostitutes -- went on to host not one, but two different shows on cable TV. The first one was on CNN, and the second one was on Current TV. Then there's exploiting your scandal in the time between when you're indicted and convicted of the crime. Former Texas congressman Tom DeLay -- while under indictment and awaiting a trial date -- appeared as a contestant on the hit TV show ""Dancing with the Stars."" DeLay was later convicted of campaign finance violations and money laundering. But the guy who set the bar high for all disgraced politicians is former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. After being removed from office by the state legislature and while under indictment, Blagojevich wrote a book about his scandal, went on ""The Daily Show"" and ""Letterman"" and was a contestant on Season 9 of Donald Trump's ""The Celebrity Apprentice."" Blagojevich even appeared at the Wizard World Chicago Comic Con (a comic book convention), where he charged $50 for autographs and $80 for a photo with him. He was subsequently convicted of corruption charges and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Among politicians who don't end up in jail, some try hard to become elected officials again. They want to go back to the very place that caused their problems. It's like a recovering drug addict asking to work at a meth lab -- not a good combo. Just look at former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who is running to fill a recently vacated Congressional seat. As a refresher, Sanford disappeared for six days in 2009 while governor. At first, Sanford's office publicly stated that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. However, we soon found out that he was actually in Argentina visiting the woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair. Sanford seeks 'redemption' in wild congressional race . Sanford later paid $74,000 to settle charges that he had misused state resources and campaign funds in conducting his affair. However, Sanford refused to resign and completed his term. Flash forward to March 19: Sanford came in first in a crowded field of Republicans in the GOP Congressional primary. Recent polls show him with a 10-point lead over his opponent in the Republican primary runoff scheduled for April 2. Sanford's quest for forgiveness in return to political life . And don't forget Anthony Weiner, the former Democratic Congressman from New York City. As most people, and all comedians, vividly recall, Weiner had ""accidentally"" tweeted photos of himself in his underwear to a young woman on Twitter. Weiner later admitted to having non-sexual but ""inappropriate"" relationships with various women on social media. Weiner resigned from Congress a few weeks after the scandal broke in June 2011. What's Weiner up to now? Apparently he has figured out how to use Twitter and is at least considering a return to politics. Weiner revealed he had spent more than $100,000 on polls recently to explore possibly running for office in New York City. What does it say about us that these disgraced politicians have success -- however fleetingly -- after their scandals? Is it because we are a forgiving lot who believe in second chances if the person has sincerely apologized and seeks redemption? Or is it because we are all infected with the reality-show mindset where we reward fame regardless of how it's attained? Plenty of people don't distinguish between whether a person is famous for good or bad reasons. All that matters is if a person has made it to that semi-exclusive club of celebritydom. After that, enough people will support the person to merit securing a book deal, being cast on a reality show and maybe run for office. Look, I'm all for redemption and second chances. But I'm also aware that just like we saw with Jason in ""Friday the 13th"" movies, the longer he's alive, the more damage he will do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Disgraced politicians can write a book, go on TV, run for office again .

"(CNN) -- A second Filipino oil worker has died after last week's Gulf of Mexico oil platform blast, the Philippine government said Friday. Avelino L. Tajonera died early Friday from injuries sustained in the November 16 explosion and fire on the Black Elk production platform off Louisiana, said Elmer Cato, consul at the Philippines Embassy in Washington. The embassy said Philippines citizen Ellroy Corporal also died from the incident, and Jerome Malagapo, another worker from the Philippines, has not been found. Several other workers were injured. Three Filipino workers remain in serious condition, the Philippines Embassy said. They suffered major burns and were being treated at the Baton Rouge General Medical Center in Louisiana. The embassy estimates there are more than 160 welders, fitters, scaffolders and riggers who were hired in the Philippines to work at offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. After the blast, a U.S. Interior Department unit said the Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations ""must take immediate steps to improve its safety performance on the U.S. outer continental shelf."" ""Black Elk has repeatedly failed to operate in a manner that is consistent with federal regulations,"" said James A. Watson, director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. ""BSEE has taken a number of enforcement actions, including issuing numerous Incidents of noncompliance, levying civil penalties and calling in the company's senior leadership to review their performance and the ramifications of failing to improve. This is an appropriate and necessary step as we continue to investigate the explosion and fire that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries last week."" The agency cited safety issues at the production platform where the explosion occurred, at facilities in the South Marsh Island area in the Gulf of Mexico, and in an October 2011 incident in which ""Black Elk operations had used an acid-based chemical for treating a well that resulted in the hospitalization of six workers."" CNN's Vivian Kuo and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Both dead workers were from the Philippines .

"(CNN) -- Inside Moore Medical Center's emergency room, Dr. Stephanie Barnhart had been monitoring the weather all afternoon. A tornado watch was in effect, but that was almost commonplace for this time of year in Oklahoma. The first ""code black"" emergency alert came shortly before 3 p.m. on Monday. The second notified the staff a tornado had touched down in the nearby town of Newcastle. Barnhart and her team jumped into action. The doctors quickly moved all 30 hospital patients to a clinic in the center of the hospital. They used mattresses and blankets from gurneys in the hallway to cover themselves in hopes of preventing head injuries. For 15 to 20 minutes, they waited anxiously, watching on TV as the massive tornado moved within 2 miles of their location. Then the power went out. ""We were hearing it, and we knew that it was coming for us,"" Barnhart remembers. The tornado ripped through 17 miles of central Oklahoma. At least 24 people, including nine children, were killed, according to the state medical examiner's office. See the storm's path . The second floor of the medical center was reduced to rubble. Lampposts and other items from the streets were hurled through the walls of the ground floor. Cars, including Barnhart's, are now piled upside down and sideways in the parking lot. It looks a lot like a junkyard. ""It's pretty amazing that we even walked out alive,"" Barnhart told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. One of the biggest concerns in a tornado is shrapnel, Gupta says. A loose object or anything that's broken by the force of the storm's winds can cause a penetrating, and potentially deadly, injury. Looking at the destruction, it's hard to believe some patients walked out of the medical center without a scratch. The mattresses and blankets helped protect them from the worst of the storm. Inside a tornado-ravaged school . Huddled inside the hospital, Barnhart says she didn't realize how much damage the tornado had caused until she walked outside and saw the bowling alley across the street -- or saw where the bowling alley used to be. Barnhart, 34, is a tiny blonde bundle of faith. She called her husband as soon as she could get cell reception after the tornado passed to tell him she loved him. She says she wasn't really concerned about her own safety during the storm, but worried about friends and family -- who all thankfully made it through OK. Remembering the victims . ""We've been blessed by that. I know there are lots of families that have been devastated by this, and we are definitely praying for them,"" she says. Barnhart went back to work Monday night at one of the area's other hospitals, where patients at Moore Medical Center were evacuated after the tornado passed. She's received many thanks for her quick thinking, but says it's difficult to take credit. ""I was just doing my job, and I knew what I had to do,"" she says. ""It's Jesus that helped us and saved us, and I know that he was with us."" Mayor: New law needed to keep people safe . CNN's Danielle Dellorto contributed to this story.","The Moore, Oklahoma, Medical Center was directly in the path of the EF5 tornado .

"(EW.com) -- Lance Armstrong's story has everything. Victory. Redemption. A triumph of the human spirit. All-American ambition shading into moral decay. The enticing possibility that Matthew McConaughey could play himself. So we shouldn't be surprised that two different studios are trying to translate Armstrong's story to the big screen. In January, reports indicated that J.J. Abrams's Bad Robot was producing an Armstrong movie for Paramount. (Rumors abounded that Bradley Cooper was in the running for the lead role Ã¢â¬â rumors which Cooper denied.) Now, Deadline reports that Warner Bros. has acquired an untitled Armstrong project with a script by Scott Z. Burns, who seems well-suited to the material: He wrote The Informant!, a movie about a delusional man fooling investigators, and Side Effects, a movie about how drug use might be bad for you. The film would be directed by Jay Roach. (A source close to the production confirmed the Deadline report to EW.) Even though it's tempting to paint this as a race between two competing projects, there's plenty of material in the Armstrong story. The Warner Bros. film would apparently focus partially on Tyler Hamilton, Armstrong's former teammate whose damning confession to ""60 Minutes"" initiated the endgame of the Armstrong long con; perhaps that film would focus more on the interaction of the U.S. Postal Service cycling teammates. (The Paramount film is based on Juliet Macur's upcoming book Cycle of Lies: The Fall of Lance Armstrong.) Or maybe Aaron Sorkin will write a Lance Armstrong movie where it turns out he was just trying to bike faster because Rooney Mara dumped him in college.

"(CNN) -- The president of soccer's global governing body has urged the Israeli Football Association (IFA) to intervene in the case of a hunger striking Palestinian footballer. FIFA president Sepp Blatter ""expressed grave concern"" regarding the incarceration of members of the Palestine team in Israel, including Mahmoud Sarsak who is on hunger strike. ""The reports FIFA received state that in apparent violation of their integrity and human rights and without the apparent right of a due process (trial), several Palestine football players have allegedly been illegally detained by Israeli authorities,"" read a statement on the organization's website. ""FIFA urgently calls on IFA to draw the attention of the Israeli competent authorities to the present matter, with the aim of ensuring the physical integrity of the concerned players as well as their right for due process.""

"(CNN) -- Three days after Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crash landed at San Francisco International Airport with the loss of two lives, there is still no official explanation for what caused the incident. Officials have said the Boeing 777, which had flown from Seoul in South Korea, was traveling slower than recommended on its final approach, though it could be months before a definite cause for this is determined. Before that an expert team of air crash investigators must complete a thorough analysis of the events leading up to the crash. CNN looks at how such an investigation works. Interactive: What happened with Asiana Flight 214? Who's in charge of the investigation? According to international protocol, air crash investigations are handled by the country in which a crash occurs. In the United States, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is the government agency that investigates all major aviation accidents. Its purpose is to explain accidents and provide safety recommendations. Since it was formed in 1967, the NTSB has completed more than 132,000 aviation accident investigations, with most taking weeks or even months to complete. Did passengers ignore safety messages? What happens after a crash? In the first hours after a major accident occurs, the NTSB deploys a ""go-team"" of technical experts, who are on call 24/7 with their bags packed. ""Once they arrive, it's like police arriving on a crime scene,"" explained Tom Ballantyne, a journalist and aviation expert. The area must be secured, and all evidence must be documented, mapped, and collected. Two of the most important pieces to recover are the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder -- more commonly known as the ""black box."" Both devices are designed to survive extreme impacts. In the exhaustive investigation that follows, all factors -- mechanical, operational, and human performance -- are taken into account. Here, the NTSB relies largely on other parties, including the airline involved, the aircraft's manufacturer, and in the case of international flights, investigators from the airline's home country, to help examine evidence. In the case of Flight 214, Asiana will be expected to provide ""whatever information is demanded of it,"" according to Ballantyne. Boeing will provide technical expertise during the examination of the aircraft, while South Korean investigators will offer insight from the Korean perspective, as well as assistance with translation -- especially when questioning passengers and crew. ""The NTSB essentially acts as a coordinating body for other parties,"" explained Todd Curtis, a former Boeing air safety engineer. ""Everyone else is playing a support role."" Because of the large amount of evidence, the NTSB never speculates prematurely. ""First guesses are often wrong,"" said retired pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who successfully ditched a U.S. Airways flight in New York's Hudson River in 2009 after the aircraft was disabled when flying through a flock of geese. ""There are so many factors that could potentially impinge on this -- we don't even know what they are yet,"" he cautioned. What happens to the pilots after a crash? Although air crash investigations can seem a lot like the TV show ""CSI,"" though in the United States a crash is not legally considered a crime scene unless terrorism or sabotage is suspected early on. ""The pilot is free to go to his hotel after the crash,"" said Ballantyne. ""He will receive assistance from his airline and his pilot's union."" But shortly after an incident, the NTSB interviews the pilots and then compares their stories with data from the plane's voice and data recorders to construct a picture of the plane's last moments. Ballantyne said investigators are ""certainly prioritizing what happened in the cockpit,"" as they seek to explain why Flight 214 crash landed. Sullenberger said investigators will be looking at human factors, such as fatigue Ã¢â¬â though he stressed it is far too early in the investigation to rule this in or out. ""When they landed in San Francisco at 11.30 in the morning, it was 3.30 am on their body clocks -- a low point of alertness."" How do passenger and eyewitness accounts help? The NTSB works quickly to interview survivors and eyewitnesses after a crash. ""These statements can corroborate flight data, and even fill in gaps,"" said Curtis. ""Remember, a black box doesn't get you photographic data. Sometimes the only visual recording device that we have is people's eyeballs,"" he said. ""One interesting question for investigators to ask people might be: 'when did you start seeing smoke and flames inside the cabin?' That would be helpful with the sequencing of events."" Additionally, the NTSB tries to collect as much photo and video of the crash as possible. ""Nowadays when people are filming with cell phones and iPads, all that footage becomes a crucial part of the investigation,"" said Ballantyne. Flight attendants hailed as heroes . How long until we find out what happened with Flight 214? The investigation will likely take many months. ""We haven't even figured out how big the puzzle is going to be, much less how many pieces there are and how they will fit,"" said Sullenberger. ""This is a painstaking, methodical, analytical process. ""One way of describing this whole investigatory process is that these investigators are in charge of writing a non-fiction detective story that may take a year to complete. It may eventually have 1,000 pages."" But Sullenberger said investigators have ""a huge advantage"" in this case. ""The plane and most of its components have landed on an airport and are immediately accessible. It's not on the floor of the south Atlantic like Air France 447. They have the crew members who survived and are able to be interviewed ... It makes it much more likely that we will eventually find out exactly what happened, how it happened, and why it happened."" Curtis said he is also confident about the process. ""The United States has a habit of spending whatever it takes to finish an air crash investigation. When Trans World Airlines Flight 800 crashed into the Atlantic in 1996, we had thousands of government agents, a little army of people taking wreckage off of the ocean floor. ""So in this case, I'm certain we'll find everything we need for a definitive conclusion. They will have plenty of everything they need to get this thing done.""

"DAVOS, Switzerland (CNN) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has called on the United States to halt its drone attacks against al Qaeda and Taliban fighters on Pakistani soil and warned that the missile strikes were fueling militarism in the country's troubled tribal border region. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani sat down Wednesday with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in Davos. At least 17 people were killed in two drone strikes near the Afghan border on Friday, according to the Pakistani government, in the first attacks authorized since U.S. President Barack Obama took office last week. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who has remained in the post despite the change of government, said Tuesday that Pakistan was aware of U.S. strikes against militants within its territory -- but Gilani strenuously denied that any agreement existed between Islamabad and Washington. ""I want to put on record that we do not have any agreement between the government of the United States and the government of Pakistan,"" Gilani told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview at the World Economic Forum. ""If there are any drone attacks these would be counter-productive... Therefore we ask that if they have credible and actionable information, they share it with our intelligence agencies and we will take action ourselves.""  Watch Christiane Amanpour's interview with Gilani Â» . Gilani said that ongoing Pakistani army operations against the militants were backed by the region's local population, but warned that missile attacks jeopardized tribal support for the government and urged President Obama to ""respect the sovereignty of Pakistan."" ""We are successfully isolating the militants from the local tribes,"" said Gilani. ""But when there is one drone attack then you get them united. There is a lot of anti-American sentiment growing in those areas."" Dismissing western skepticism of his government's commitment to fighting Islamic militancy on its soil, Gilani said the conflict was fueled by fighters from Chechnya, Uzbekistan and the Middle East spilling over the border from Afghanistan, rather than indigenous militancy. He also said NATO's continuing struggle to establish law and order in Afghanistan proved that neighboring regions that had been dragged into the conflict could not be pacified so easily, and rejected suggestions that U.S. military aid should be performance-related as ""counter-productive."" ""We have the ability and we have even the will but we don't have the capacity,"" he told CNN. ""The world is focusing on Afghanistan; they have the most sophisticated weapons in the world -- and our poor people they are fighting without any arms or ammunition. NATO is having a very, very tough time in Afghanistan. We are also fighting a very tough fight."" Gilani's remarks followed an earlier statement from Islamabad in which his government said there was ""no understanding"" between Pakistan and the U.S. over the ongoing missile campaign and called for ""closer cooperation at the operational level"" between U.S. and Pakistani forces. ""As far as al Qaeda is concerned, Pakistan has done more than any other country. We look forward to working closely with the new U.S. administration on all issues, including in the fight against terrorism,"" a spokesman said.","Pakistani Prime Minister Gilani: No agreement with U.S. over drone attacks .

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- As the prosecutor in Florida sought to sort out the facts in the killing of Trayvon Martin, attention shifted Tuesday to Washington, where Martin's parents and family attorney attended a forum on racial profiling, hate crimes and ""stand your ground"" deadly force laws. ""My heart is broke,"" his mother, Sybrina Fulton, told reporters after the meeting, which was sponsored by Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee. ""But it breaks even more to know that we have not gotten justice yet."" ""He's sadly missed,"" his father, Tracy Martin, told the forum, which was packed to capacity. ""And I'll continue to fight for justice for him."" Martin, who was African-American, died February 26 when neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, shot him after calling police to report him as a suspicious person. Zimmerman has not been arrested. ""We honestly believe that Trayvon Martin is dead today because he was racially profiled, and because of that, it escalated, and it led to the fatal altercation with George Zimmerman,"" said Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the family. Zimmerman's family has said he has been wrongly portrayed as a racist. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Florida, called Trayvon Martin a ""victim of a botched police investigation full of incompetence or intelligent mismanagement."" She added, ""Trayvon was hunted, chased, tackled and shot. Ill-conceived laws and lax gun laws all contribute to this tragedy. Mr. Zimmerman should be arrested immediately for his own safety."" Photos: iReporters share self-portraits in hoodies . The shooting and the lack of an arrest have generated outrage. On Tuesday, some members of Congress took to the House floor to speak about the case ahead of the afternoon forum. ""Trayvon Martin is one of the two people who at least deserve a fair trial,"" said Rep. Al Green, D-Texas. ""He deserves a fair hearing on what happened that day. He cannot speak for himself, but there is evidence that speaks volumes about what happened on this occasion."" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, called the case tragic but declined to elaborate. ""It's being investigated by state and federal officials, which I think is appropriate, and I think I'll leave it at that,"" he said. Opinion: Justice, not revenge . Investigators look for 'ear-witnesses' Meanwhile, the special prosecutor in the case continued to try to determine what happened. ""We believe there may have been one person who saw something,"" Angela Corey said. ""We believe there are a lot of what we call ear-witnesses. My lawyers are trying to track those people down."" She said the ""political outcry"" about the case makes her job harder. ""Any time there is a misunderstanding of the process, based on what we are required to do under Florida law, it does make our job more difficult,"" she said. Zimmerman has said he killed Martin in self-defense after the unarmed teen attacked him in the gated community. Martin was returning to his father's fiancee's house after buying Skittles candy and a can of iced tea from a nearby convenience store. Zimmerman was questioned in the shooting but has not been charged because, police said, they did not have evidence to contradict his account. Corey said investigators would look into the allegations that Zimmerman uttered a racial slur on the phone with police just before the shooting. CNN enhanced the sound of the 911 call, and several members of CNN's editorial staff reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur. Report: Zimmerman told police teen punched him before shooting . Zimmerman said Martin punched him . On Monday, Sanford police confirmed an Orlando Sentinel report that cited unidentified authorities saying Zimmerman told them Martin punched him in the nose after the two exchanged words. Police said Monday that the Sentinel account is ""consistent with the information provided to the State Attorney's office by the police department."" The newspaper reported that Zimmerman said Martin then repeatedly punched him and slammed his head onto the sidewalk. Tapes of 911 calls include neighbors saying they heard screams, though it wasn't clear whether they came from Zimmerman or Martin. Two women who live nearby have said they heard someone in distress, and then a gunshot. Mary Cutcher and her roommate, Selma Mora Lamilla, said Monday they ran to about 10 feet from where Martin's body lay. ""(Zimmerman) was standing over the body, basically straddling the body with his hand on Trayvon's back,"" Cutcher said, adding that they called three times to him before he finally asked them to call police. ""It didn't seem to me that he was trying to help him in any way."" When police arrived, Zimmerman's ""back appeared to be wet and was covered in grass (and he) was also bleeding, from the nose and back of his head,"" a police report says. Police have not released Cutcher's official police statement but have said her statements were consistent with Zimmerman's account. Neighbors describe watch leader . Police have said they did not charge Zimmerman because they did not have evidence that differed from his version of the events. Florida's ""stand your ground"" deadly force law prohibited them from making an arrest, police said. Shooting renews debate over 'stand your ground' laws . The law allows the use of deadly force anywhere a person feels a reasonable fear of death or serious injury and has been cited in a number of justifiable homicide cases in Florida. Zimmerman's legal adviser has said he believes the law applies to the case. Friend: Martin, Zimmerman came face to face . On Tuesday, a friend of Zimmerman's, former CNN anchor Joe Oliver, said Zimmerman had given him the same account as the one that appeared in the Sentinel, as well as additional details about what happened between the time the two came face to face and the time the gun went off. Oliver, who now works at WESH-TV in Orlando, said he could not discuss the details Tuesday but said Zimmerman was sorry for what had happened. ""The George Zimmerman I know is not here anymore, because he knows that he took someone else's life, and he's extremely remorseful,"" Oliver said Tuesday on CNN's ""Starting Point."" Oliver said race played no role in the incident. ""I understand completely the fear and anger that's out there over this case. If I didn't know George Zimmerman, I'd be right out there, too,"" said Oliver, who is African-American. ""But I do know George, and I do know that portrayal that young black men have had. I've experienced that growing up. I get that,"" Oliver said. ""I understand that, but in this one spark incident, that wasn't the case. Race had nothing to do with it."" The Martin family and their supporters, however, have blamed Zimmerman, saying he racially profiled and shot the teen, who was wearing a hoodie. They have called for changes in what gun-control advocates sometimes refer to as ""shoot-first"" laws. Crump, the Martin family attorney, said 911 tapes, phone records and testimony from the teen's girlfriend -- who was on the phone with him just before the shooting -- show Zimmerman is at fault. ""Those facts are uncontroverted,"" Crump said. Crump also said authorities were trying to ""demonize"" Martin with accounts that surfaced Monday saying Martin had been suspended from school in Miami for 10 days after a search of his book bag turned up an empty plastic bag containing marijuana residue. ""Whatever Trayvon Martin was suspended for had absolutely no bearing on what happened on the night of February 26,"" he said. Sybrina Fulton said, ""The only comment that I have right now is that they've killed my son and now they're trying to kill his reputation."" Martin's family and their attorneys have also questioned the handling of the police investigation. City Administrator Norton Bonaparte said Tuesday he is in talks with the Department of Justice to establish a procedure for Sanford residents to have complaints investigated by an independent agency. Zimmerman has not spoken publicly about the case. ""He hasn't been back to his apartment, which is in that complex, ever since that happened, and he's being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder, for depression, for insomnia,"" Oliver said. ""He cried for days after this happened."" CNN's Eric Marrapodi, Ed Payne, Kim Segal, Greg Morrison, John Couwels and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.

"Washington (CNN) -- The morning Thomas Jefferson was sworn in as the nation's third president, he declined the seven horses and two carriages that were ready to ferry him from his boarding house to the Senate chamber where he would take the oath of office. Instead, Jefferson walked, followed by congressmen and onlookers, according to the U.S. Capitol Historical Society. Security at President Barack Obama's second inaugural on Monday, however, will be significantly tighter. Police will shut down dozens of downtown Washington streets and close major arteries into the city. Parking will be even tighter than usual. Bags will be inspected and tickets will be required to get close to the ceremonies. The inauguration weekend National Special Security Event will have the Secret Service leading a web of agencies pulling together security and transportation to handle the throng expected to see Obama take the oath of office on Monday at noon. ""We have 42 partners here -- every law enforcement entity, every transportation entity, everyone that's got camera -- we are utilizing,"" Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan said. Authorities estimated that more than 1.8 million people attended Obama's first inauguration in 2009. But the crowd around the event is expected to be smaller this time. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is preparing for up to 800,000 people around the inaugural and the preceding weekend. Champagne glasses and buttons galore: Obama swag at Inaugural store . The Secret Service, Washington's Metropolitan Police Department, Capitol Police and Park Police are shutting down major and minor roads alike around Capitol Hill, where the ceremony will take place. They are securing the National Mall, for more -- standing room only -- viewing of the ceremony, and they are policing the parade route, where onlookers will gather to watch floats, bands, and the president travel the approximately two-mile route up Pennsylvania Avenue. Memorial Bridge, which connects the Virginia side of the Potomac to Washington near the Lincoln Memorial, will be open to foot traffic only. Tickets are required to see the ceremonies up close on the Capitol grounds, while the National Mall is open for the general public. It will be standing room only on the Capitol grounds -- the Secret Service says no lawn chairs, nor umbrellas or signs will be allowed -- and the lengthy list of banned items includes aerosol spray, air horns, coolers, glass, hand tools, laser pointers, pepper spray, strollers, and thermoses. Banned from most secure areas are items like backpacks, pets and weapons. ""We hope and plan for and anticipate a safe and secure inauguration, one that will be memorable and historic,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said. A-listers sign up for inaugural celebrations . Those lucky enough to get a viewing spot along the parade route can expect the gates to open at 6:30 a.m. -- more than five hours before Obama takes the oath. Lines for these venues can be expected to form even earlier. The National Weather Service predicts the Monday morning low to be 26 degrees and the day's high to reach 37. There is a 30% chance of snow showers. Officials will allow spectators to hold signs -- with certain restrictions, including size -- along the parade route. With a number of roads closed, access to and from the downtown area will be largely by public transportation. Authorities are preparing screening checkpoints at the ceremony and along the parade route and deploying a variety of special units to handle any situation that could arise. ""We will have our SWAT team, pretty much all of our specialty teams will be available and on standby to include (weapons specialists), our dive team, our intelligence team -- working around the clock -- our hostage negotiators, (and) our special agent bomb technicians will also be available, so pretty much all of our specialty teams will be available,"" acting assistant FBI Director Debra Evans Smith told reporters. ""There's always chatter on any given day and we are always looking at that and vetting it but currently there are no credible threats to the events,"" Smith added. Washington preps for inauguration . Besides the ground security, traffic will be restricted in the air and water. The Coast Guard is closing down parts of the Potomac River to commercial and recreational traffic, and the Federal Aviation Administration is placing additional restrictions on flights in the area. About 13,500 members of the military will be in the city for the inauguration, too. They include ushers for the ceremony, those marching in the parade, and troops who will assist law enforcement. The first road closures will begin around 7 a.m. on Sunday, according to the Secret Service, and all roads will be open again by Tuesday at 7 a.m. That's just in time for a different set of circumstances to bring the capital to a standstill: political gridlock.","Dozens of streets in Washington will be closed for inaugural ceremonies .

"(CNN) -- The world of professional cycling suffered another blow Friday, as Dutch bank Rabobank announced it is to end its sponsorship of pro cycling teams in the wake of the Lance Armstrong doping scandal. Rabobank will pull its backing for both men's and women's professional cycling teams on December 31, it said in a statement. The company will continue to sponsor amateur cycling, including the youth training and the cyclocross team, it said. The activity is hugely popular in the Netherlands, where millions of people cycle routinely. The bank made clear its decision was a direct response to the controversy that has engulfed Armstrong since the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency last week detailed what it called ""overwhelming"" evidence of his involvement as a professional cyclist in ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program."" Doping scandal costs Armstrong sponsors, charity . ""Rabobank has come to this decision following publication of the report from the American doping authority USADA last week,"" its statement said. ""This report speaks volumes."" Rabobank -- a century-old business which began its involvement in professional cycling 17 years ago ""full of conviction and with a clear mission"" -- had previously seen cycling as a good fit with the company, its clients and its employees, it said. But all that has changed since the USADA report alleging doping by Armstrong and the U.S. Postal Service team. ""It is with pain in our heart, but for the bank this is an inevitable decision,"" Bert Bruggink, of Rabobank's managing board, is quoted as saying. Opinion: With Armstrong's disgrace, will anything change? ""We are no longer convinced that the international professional world of cycling can make this a clean and fair sport. We are not confident that this will change for the better in the foreseeable future."" In its report, the anti-doping agency made public testimony from Armstrong's teammates and others who said Armstrong was among team members who used banned performance-enhancing substances and tried to hide it from testing officials. The seven-time Tour de France winner has consistently denied the allegations against him. But a long chain of accusations trailing Armstrong has begun to erode support even among those who have steadfastly backed him in the past. On Wednesday, Armstrong walked away from the chairmanship of the cancer charity he founded 15 years ago, Livestrong, saying he wanted to spare it any negative effects from the controversy surrounding him. He will remain on the charity's board of directors. Bruyneel becomes first victim of investigation into Armstrong and doping . On the same day Nike, which initially stood by Armstrong, dropped him with a terse statement citing what it called ""seemingly insurmountable evidence"" that he participated in doping. Hours later, brewery giant Anheuser-Busch followed suit, saying it would let Armstrong's contract expire at the end of the year. Nike and Anheuser-Busch said they still planned to support Livestrong and its initiatives. The USADA report is part of its request to international cycling officials to strip Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles. The International Olympic Committee is also reviewing the evidence and could consider revoking Armstrong's bronze medal from the 2000 Sydney games. Armstrong is already banned from competing in events sanctioned by U.S. Olympic governing bodies. Armstrong has said he never has failed a drug test and has consistently denied participating in any banned practices. Armstrong's legacy may withstand accusations .

"(CNN) -- Trayvon Martin's father says his heart is broken but his faith is not. ""God blessed Me & Sybrina with Tray and even in his death I know my baby proud of the FIGHT we along with all of you put up for him GOD BLESS,"" Tracy Martin wrote, in the first of three tweets sent about 30 minutes after the not-guilty decision was read in the Sanford, Florida, courtroom. By midnight, it had been retweeted more than 20,000 times. Neither Tracy Martin nor Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon's mother, was in the courtroom Saturday night when a six-woman jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the death of their son, Trayvon. An attorney for the family said he told family members it would be better if they went home so they could attend church in the morning. Attorney Darryl Parks didn't say where Martin and Fulton were spending the night but called it a ""safe location."" In his tweets, Martin thanked the family's supporters and the people who will join them to ""make sure that this doesn't happen again."" Martin closed by saying: ""Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY."" Later, Fulton sent out a message that offered thanks to God, whom she said she leans on for support. ""Lord during my darkest hour I lean on you,"" she said. ""You are all that I have. At the end of the day, GOD is still in control. Thank you all for your prayers and support. I will love you forever Trayvon!!! In the name of Jesus!!!"" Tracy Martin and Fulton were in the courtroom for most of the trial, leaving briefly when photos of their dead son were shown one time to the jury. Each of them testified during the two-week trial. They both said they believed it was their son's voice crying for help on the recording of a 911 call made the night in February 2012 when Trayvon Martin was shot and killed. But two police investigators told the jury that Tracy Martin had said 'no' when they asked him the same question. The 911 call was played several times, ending with the gunshot that killed Trayvon Martin. The emotional toll of that, of testifying and sitting through all the testimony and the jury selection process was difficult for the family to endure, Parks said. Zimmerman could still be held responsible for Martin's death . Benjamin Crump, the family's lead attorney, said Trayvon Martin would have been proud of his parents. ""Your tireless work in the name of your son has made Sanford and many other cities just a little safer for all our children,"" he said. ""I know Trayvon is up there, proud at the changes that you as his parents have inspired in his name."" When asked what he has to say to Trayvon Martin's parents, Zimmerman's brother Robert Zimmerman Jr. said, ""I think it would be remiss of me not to say, I understand tonight, I understand their pain. And there are no winners. They will not win or lose anything more than they already have lost, which is their son's life, by any kind of verdict for George. ""I applaud them for asking for the verdict to be respected. ... And I will pray for them."" Analysis: The race factor .

"(CNN) -- Eva Walusimbi knows well how it is to live in darkness. As a community leader in the small town of Mityana, central Uganda, she's been witnessing the health hazards and financial strains that a shortage of electricity can bring to people living in energy poor, rural areas. ""Just three miles away from here, people in the villages don't have electricity -- some of them use candles, some use kerosene lamps,"" says Walusimbi, who runs schools for orphans and disadvantaged children in Uganda. ""One morning there was a kid that was picked from school early in the morning because her sibling had died in a fire,"" she says. ""[The kid] had lit a candle in the house and then went outside to do some other chores, so the candle melted away and the house was all on fire. By the time that they came back to see what's going on, the whole house was burned down and the kid was burned to ashes."" In Uganda, some 90% of the population lives without access to electricity, according to World Bank figures. Apart from the health risks, Walusimbi, 50, says that lack of electricity is also preventing people from escaping poverty. ""People that are living without electricity, their day ends up so quickly -- they can do less work compared to the people with full light,"" she says. But for Walusimbi, there is light at the end of the tunnel. She has joined Solar Sister, a group aiming to eradicate energy poverty while creating economic opportunities for women. Using an Avon-style women's distribution system, Solar Sister trains, recruits and supports female entrepreneurs in East Africa to sell affordable solar lighting and other green products such as solar lamps and mobile phone chargers. The women use their community networks of family and neighbors to build their own businesses, earning a commission on each sale. Read related: Harnessing pedal power to light up Africa . Solar Sister founder Katherine Lucey, a former investment banker with expertise in the energy sector, says this model is creating access to safe, affordable and clean energy while helping women to earn a steady income to support their families. ""This gives them a chance to earn money in a way that is a lot more steady -- they have control over it and that money can come into the family,"" says Lucey, who is based in Rhode Island, in the United States. ""In almost all cases we see them using that to spend on education for their children."" During her 20-year career as an energy executive, Lucey says she'd seen how access to electricity was fundamental for economic growth. But whilst working on large-scale energy projects in developing countries, she also realized that the pressing needs of many poor individuals were still not being served. After dark, houses not connected to the electricity grid rely mainly on open-flame kerosene lamps for light. Such lanterns, however, pose fire hazards, emit toxic fumes and a put a strain on family budgets. ""You really can't raise up above subsistence living if you don't have light, electricity and energy,"" says Lucey. ""And when you do have it, it's just tremendous what people are able to accomplish and the impact it has on people's lives: children can study more and go to school, women can start businesses and are able to provide for their families."" Read also: Pay-as-you-go solar power lights up rural Africa . According to Lighting Africa, a joint World Bank - International Finance Corporation program developed to increase access to clean sources of energy for lighting, 589 million people in the continent live without access to a public electricity facility. The group says African poor rural households and small businesses pay $10 billion per year for lighting purposes, while communities not connected to the grid spend $4.4 billion annually on kerosene. Lucey says ending a culture of dependency on aid is crucial to help people escape economic hardship and deal with the issue of energy poverty. She explains: ""There's not enough philanthropy in the world to solve this problem,"" she says. ""A third of the world population doesn't have access to electricity -- it's not going to be solved by philanthropy, it's going to be solved by some kind of market mechanism where people have access to this product ... and purchase as they need it."" So far, more than 270 entrepreneurs in Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan have joined Solar Sister. Lucey says the group, which is looking to expand in other counties in the continent, is deliberately working solely with women as they are responsible of managing the energy needs of a household. ""Women are the ones who walk miles to cut the wood; women are the ones who go to markets to buy kerosene -- so if we wanted to make the change that someone would say 'well, I'll quit the kerosene, I'm going to buy a solar lamp and use cleaner technology,' then it had to be the person who was in charge of making that decision and that's the women."" Back in Mityana, Walusimbi says her life has ""changed enormously"" since she started working with the group, using the extra money to cover her household and farm needs. ""It makes me feel proud to see that I'm bringing an income to my family,"" she says. ""Because if I can support my family, I feel good -- other than seeking helplessly and looking for everything to be sponsored.""","Solar Sister is a network of women selling solar lighting to poor communities .

"Shanghai (CNN) -- When Yao Ming retired from professional basketball seven months ago, there were fears that interest in the NBA among China's 1.3 billion people would dwindle. But now the former Houston Rockets center -- one of the most successful overseas players in the league's history -- could be forgiven for feeling like yesterday's star in China thanks to Jeremy Lin, the American-born New York Knicks point guard with roots in mainland China and Taiwan. ""We have a lot of talented young athletes here who are passionate about basketball,"" Yao told CNN in an interview Wednesday. ""They all want be the next Jeremy. ""I think they can relate more to Jeremy because they're more common-sized."" For Yao, 31, who stands at seven feet six inches (2.29 meters) tall and remains a towering presence off court, Lin's natural talent more than makes up for his below average six-foot-three-inch (1.91 meters) frame in the league. Cha: In Lin, China loves a winner . ""The easy part is to find a strong basketball player -- I have the size; Shaquille O'Neal: big and strong; Kobe, LeBron, all those names,"" he said. ""Jeremy has basketball IQ -- you can't program that. ""He's the kind of player I'd like to play with if I'm still a player -- he's a team player and everybody likes the way he wins a game,"" he added. ""Honestly, he did much more than I'd expected."" Lin, 23, only recently a little known back-up player sitting on the Knicks bench, has been leading his team to a wave of recent victories without their established stars -- pulling off an average of 20 points and eight assists in six successive games. Halfway across the globe, Lin's fan base on Sina Weibo, China's top micro-blogging site, has already hit the two million mark, four times the number of his followers on Twitter. Inside the Yuanshen stadium Wednesday night, in between cheering Yao-owned Shanghai Sharks at a tight playoff game, local basketball enthusiasts gave a huge thumbs up to a player far from their court. Jeremy 'Lin-demand' in China . ""Jeremy Lin is great,"" one man gushed. ""He plays so good -- lots of Chinese love him."" Another added: ""He was born in America, but his blood is Chinese."" Echoing this fan, Chinese media -- to the chagrin of its Taiwanese counterpart -- has been quick to claim Lin, whose parents emigrated from Taiwan but have family roots in mainland China. The two sides split after a Chinese civil war in the 1940s, but the Beijing government regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must be reunited with the mainland. Ever the sports diplomat, Yao has a simple answer to solve the contentious issue of Lin's identity: ""He's a great basketball player."" Politics aside, comparisons between the two seem inevitable. Shanghai native Yao grew up in China's state-sponsored sports system and, amid much fanfare, was signed by the Rockets in 2002 as the NBA's top overall pick. Paid $93 million by the league during his nine-year career, Yao scored an average of 19 points per game and was voted an All-Star player eight times. Lin, born and bred in California, was overlooked by most NBA teams before the Knicks picked him. Even with his new-found stardom, the Harvard graduate earns much less than many of his teammates. Despite their different paths to professional basketball, the two bonded through similar cultural experiences after meeting at an event for Yao's charity two years ago. ""He gives a lot of hope to kids with the same background like his: Asian-Americans, second generation or maybe third,"" Yao said of Lin's recent achievements. ""They can follow his footprints and have more confidence in playing basketball."" While both have been called trailblazers, some argue it would be difficult for anyone to fill the void left by Yao, whose popularity helped the NBA franchise make huge inroads in the world's most populous nation. ""I don't think anybody in the NBA, from the Chinese perspective, will ever become a bigger star than Yao,"" NBA commissioner David Stern told China Daily, the country's official English-language newspaper, early this month. ""Yao was the first, the biggest and the most successful -- and he will always have a special place in the heart of NBA and Chinese fans."" ""(Lin's success) was wonderful for our league... but I don't want to overburden him with expectations,"" he added. ""We have to see how he does in the next 300 games before we make any judgments."" Yao, however, appears to have made up his mind about Lin. The two talk on the phone or exchange messages after the younger player's games. ""I know people talk about me giving him tips -- it's really not that,"" Yao said with a laugh. ""I just congratulated him and said I'm happy for him."" ""I told him we'll support him and I'm a big fan of his.""","Yao Ming enjoyed huge success in the NBA while playing with the Hosuton Rockets .

"Honiara, Solomon Islands (CNN) -- More topless photos of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, spilled into public view Monday as Britain's royal family asked a French court to stop further publication of the pictures. The legal battle raged while the duchess and her husband, Prince William, carried on with an official tour of the South Pacific, including meetings with Solomon Islanders -- some of them topless. The new photos were published Monday by the Italian gossip magazine Chi, which is owned by the same company that last week published several pictures of a topless Catherine sunbathing in private during a vacation at a private chateau belonging to William's uncle in Provence, in southern France. The grainy images, shot from a distance, show Catherine on a balcony and appear to be no more revealing than those published last week by the French magazine Closer, the Guardian newspaper reported. In a related development, Irish Daily Star Editor Michael O'Kane was suspended Monday by Independent Star Limited, publisher of the Daily Star, pending an investigation into the circumstances that led to photographs being republished in that newspaper from the French magazine. Opinion: Wake up, Kate; photogs are always watching . While some have questioned the furor over topless sunbathing, which is a common practice in parts of France and elsewhere, the issue is less about nudity than it is about privacy, royal biographer Christopher Andersen said. William and his brother, Prince Harry, still blame the media for the 1997 death of their mother, Princess Diana, in a traffic accident as her driver fled paparazzi, Andersen said. French investigators concluded the driver of the car Diana was traveling in lost control while he was intoxicated. The royal family is concerned about similar invasions, particularly if William and Catherine have a child, Andersen said. ""This is a deterrent. They're drawing a line in the sand,"" he said. Kate upset about topless photos . On Monday morning, the royal family filed a criminal complaint with French prosecutors seeking invasion of privacy charges against the magazine and possibly the photographer, a palace spokeswoman said. Late Monday in civil court in Paris, lawyers for the royals asked for damages and a court order to prevent the photos from being published again. They also want existing photos taken offline, a palace spokesman said. Lawyer Aurelien Hamelle denounced the published photos in court Monday calling them an infringement of privacy, CNN affiliates reported. ""It is a scene of married life, intimate, personal, that has nothing to do on a magazine"" Hamelle said. Chi, the Italian magazine, put out its special edition Monday with 26 pages of photos of William and Catherine on vacation. As editors at Closer did last week, Chi executives defended publishing the photos despite the furor from London. ""It is a story worth publishing in an extraordinary edition because it shows in a natural light the everyday life of a very famous contemporary young couple in love,"" Editor-in-chief Alfonso Signorini said in a statement. Chi and Closer are owned by the Mondadori publishing company, which is headed by Marina Berlusconi, a daughter of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. ""To see a future royal immortalized in a series of pictures, which are certainly neither morbid nor damaging to her dignity, renders her for sure more likable and less anachronistic and distant from of all of us,"" Signorini wrote. A French judge is expected to issue a ruling by 6 a.m. EST Tuesday on the civil complaint, reporters from CNN affiliates ITN and BFM have said. Pacific welcome awaits William and Kate . The criminal case in France involves claims of invasion of privacy against the magazine and possibly the photographer. French law provides for ""draconian sanctions"" to protect against this kind of behavior, British lawyer Charlotte Harris said, including orders to take magazines off shelves and the imposition of serious fines. But even if distribution of the images is contained to a degree, Harris said, the damage is done to the extent that very private information about the duchess has now become public knowledge. Laurence Pieau, editor-in-chief of Closer in France, defended the decision to publish the images in an interview with CNN affiliate BFM-TV, saying, ""We were just doing our job."" Pieau said that there had been no debate at the magazine over whether to publish the photos and that they show the royals ""are just like any other couple in love."" Legal analysts suggest that Mondadori hopes to recoup any legal costs and fines it may incur by increasing sales, thanks to the revealing pictures. According to Mondadori's website, Closer has an average weekly circulation of about 414,000, while Chi sells more than 340,000 copies a week. Opinion: British privacy should start with British press . William and Catherine's Pacific tour marks a celebration of the queen's Diamond Jubilee anniversary of her reign. They were scheduled to leave Honiara in the Solomon Islands on Tuesday and travel to Tuvalu for the first royal visit to that island nation since 1982. Their tour is scheduled to wrap up Wednesday. Monday's legal actions in France are the only ones initiated by palace officials. British newspapers have not published the photos, although the Irish Daily Star did Saturday, in a move that palace officials slammed as greedy. Editor Mike O'Kane told the BBC that Irish readers wanted to know what all the ""kerfuffle"" was about. ""She's not the future queen of Ireland, so really the only place this is causing fury seems to be in the UK,"" he said. In a sign of how divisive the issue of royal privacy has become, the newspaper's co-owner, media group Northern & Shell, said it opposed he newspaper's decision to run the pictures. The company -- which runs the Irish Daily Star in a joint venture with Independent News & Media but does not exert editorial control over it -- said it was ""profoundly dismayed"" by the move. Independent News & Media said the decision to publish was regrettable and an investigation into the decision was under way. The British media are under close scrutiny after revelations of phone hacking and other abuses. The conclusions of an independent judge-led inquiry, which may recommend greater restrictions on media freedoms, are expected by the end of the year. UK tabloid prints naked Prince Harry pictures .

"(CNN) -- The wife of a former top Chinese politician has admitted to poisoning a British businessman, blaming a ""mental breakdown"" for her actions that resulted in Neil Heywood's death, state news reported. The closely watched murder trial of Gu Kailai took place Thursday, adjourning in the afternoon without the announcement of a verdict, said Tang Yigan, deputy head of the Hefei Intermediate People's Court. On Friday, the state-run Xinhua news agency offered details on what transpired in court the previous day during the seven-hour long trial. That included a statement by Gu in which she not only didn't deny the accusations levied against her, but ""accepted all the facts written in the indictment"" -- including poisoning Heywood at a time when she thought her son's life was in danger. Who is Gu Kailai? ""During those days last November, I suffered a mental breakdown after learning my son was in jeopardy,"" Gu, 53, said shortly before the trial concluded. ""The tragedy, which was created by me, was not only extended to Neil, but also to several families."" Her family aide and alleged co-conspirator, Zhang Xiaojun, likewise admitted to his part in the crime and said he wanted to say ""sorry"" to the victim's family. ""I hope the court can give me a chance to take a new lease on life,"" Zhang said in the court in the eastern city of Hefei, according to the Xinhua report. ""I really know that I did wrong."" The pair were accused of killing the 41-year-old Heywood last November in a hotel room in the city of Chongqing. Chinese authorities had previously said that Gu and her son had ""conflicts"" with Heywood ""over economic interests"" and that she was motivated to kill the Briton because of fears for her son Bo Guagua's safety. Reached Friday by e-mail, Bo Guagua declined to comment on his mother's confession or ""any details pertaining to the case."" Gu's admission is the latest phase in the fall from grace of the prominent family of Bo Xilai, Gu's husband, who until earlier this year had appeared destined to join the elite committee of leaders at the top of China's ruling party. The family's alleged involvement in Heywood's death triggered the most sensational Chinese political scandal in recent memory. And it created an extraordinary set of challenges for the central government as it prepares for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition later this year. Why the Gu Kailai trial is important? Prosecutors said in court Thursday that Gu had invited Heywood to the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing -- the city where Bo was then the Communist Party chief -- from Beijing. The trial took place 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) east of Chongqing, where Heywood died and where support for Bo and his family remains strong. Heywood and Gu drank alcohol and tea in a hotel room, after which the Briton got drunk and began vomiting, a prosecutor said. When Heywood asked for water, Gu asked Zhang, who'd been waiting outside, to come into the room. It was then that Gu got cyanide from Zhang and, after her aide carried Heywood to the bed, poured the poison into the Briton's mouth, according to the prosecutor. Gu then scattered capsules containing narcotics on the floor to make it seem like Heywood was using drugs, the prosecution said. She put a ""Do not disturb"" sign on Heywood's hotel room door and told hotel staff not to bother him, a hotel employee said. Neither Gu nor Zhang objected to the prosecution's outline of the case, according to Tang, the court official, though Gu's lawyer did argue for leniency. Bo and Gu on trial, in different ways . In her statement, Gu explained how, in 2005, she and her son Bo Guagua got to know Heywood after he wrote them to introduce himself. The Briton later became an agent and participant in a land development project in China that never materialized. When Heywood asked for compensation, he began to have disputes with the family and -- according to Gu -- threatened her son's personal safety. Prosecutors displayed numerous e-mails between Heywood and Gu's son showing the increasingly heated conflict. At some point, Gu decided to kill Heywood, prosecutors said. They displayed a statement by Gu in which she said, ""To me, that was more than a threat. It was real action that was taking place. I must fight to my death to stop the craziness of Neil Heywood."" In an e-mail to CNN Tuesday, Bo Guagua said he had submitted a witness statement to his mother's defense team. ""I have faith that facts will speak for themselves,"" wrote Bo, 24, who graduated from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in May. A Bo family friend said the court did not accept the younger Bo's statement as evidence Thursday. Another facet of the case that's drawn international attention, as noted in the Xinhua report, was the fact that an official appointed by Bo's family initially was among those who first decided not to categorize Heywood's death as a criminal case. These authorities covered up Gu's presence at the scene by fabricating interview records and hiding evidence, among other measures, the report said. The authorities ""persuaded"" Heywood's relatives to accept their conclusion and cremated the British citizen's body without conducting an autopsy, according to Xinhua. But the case was reopened after Wang Lijun, then vice mayor and police chief of Chongqing, tried to defect to the U.S. consulate in the neighboring Sichuan city of Chengdu. In a related case, Chinese state media reported Thursday that four top Chongqing policemen will be tried for trying to cover up Heywood's murder to help Gu. The four -- Guo Weiguo , Li Yang , Wang Pengfei and Wang Zhi -- were charged July 30 and will face trial in Hefei, Xinhua and CCTV reported. They have been charged with ""acting with partiality and defeating the ends of justice,"" the outlets reported. CNN's Steven Jiang and Jason Kessler contributed to this report.","The wife of ex-Chinese politician Bo Xilai says, ""I suffered a mental breakdown""

"(CNN) -- I was half asleep when I first read the news, so I was sure I must have misunderstood. The words on the small screen in my hand said, ""Rest in Peace, Jim."" I sat up and looked at the phone again, trying to make sense of it. I couldn't. My friend Jim had died suddenly, unexpectedly at the age of 56. Soon, an avalanche of grief rolled across Facebook, carrying a mix of shock, sorrow, disbelief -- and genuine love. I had met Jim Sutherland many years before when we were both on staff at CNN. But we never really worked together, and we did not become friends back then. In fact, I'm not sure we ever spoke. Friendship came much later, when we connected on Facebook, and Jim became an unlikely part of my everyday life. I learned about his family, his interests, his intensity. And I discovered his many talents and strong political beliefs. Social media had come along and created a new way to have a friend. He had continued working in media production, but his passion -- I should say one of his many passions -- was playing the trumpet, which he did brilliantly. I went to hear him play, in person, but our friendship was almost completely online. I have often used quotation marks in the past when referring to a Facebook ""friend"" with more than a touch of sarcasm. Are Facebook connections really friends? I have absolutely no hesitation in using the word to describe my relationship with my dear friend Jim, whose absence from my daily life has left a palpable emptiness. I miss him. Something has truly changed in my life because he's gone. And I'm not alone. Hundreds and hundreds of people have poured out their emotions in that electronic community. At times, it feels as real, as close, as if we were standing in the same room. In some respects, we are closer. Online, people express themselves with a special openness. They don't have to wait their turn to speak, and the ones with small voices or introverted personalities can convey big, profound, touching emotions. Online we can develop a kind of intimacy that eluded us in the nonvirtual world. On social media, we can share -- as Jim so often did -- big and small parts of our life, without worrying that others are too busy or simply not interested in hearing it. Facebook allows us to renew contacts with people thousands of miles away, an extraordinary resource for those of us who have lived and worked around the world, and have cherished friends thousands of miles away. Messages for Jim came from distant lands. Many wrote as if he were still there; as if he were reading all our comments, surely about to answer, or at least click ""like."" His sister Holly told me the family has drawn comfort from the outpouring of love, including from people he never met in person. ""Rest in peace my friend,"" so many have said, adding their personal touch, ""Enjoy that great jazz gig in the sky."" ""May your soul fly free."" People commented on his intensity and his compassion. Friends posted poems and pictures' and urged Jim to ""shake things up"" in his new digs. Some asked him to say hello for them to others who have moved on. Several said they had never met Jim in person, but their online friendship had developed into something truly meaningful. Among them was another man called Jim Sutherland, whose connection was based on their shared name. I had already heard that story years ago from Jim on his Facebook page . For a time, Jim was posting a picture of his morning cappuccino, displaying his flowery foam designs. He frequently changed his profile image. Some were playful, others serious. He posted his father's or his mother's photograph in honor of Veterans Day or some other special occasion. He spoke of his childhood as a military brat, of his father's heroism in wartime and his mother's own heroics while Dad was away. He linked videos of his recording sessions, praised other musicians and argued for social justice. In occasional conversations, some on his page, some in private messages, he taught me about cinematography, he jovially explained the meaning of the military expression ""Hua!"" -- ""Heard, understood, acknowledged"" he said. ""Hua?"" he asked? ""Hua!"" I dutifully replied. Jim was one of those guys with an opinion about everything. Facebook was perfect for him, and he was perfect for us, the ones who wonder around the edges and jump in for a quick dip every once in a while. Mostly, he shared his views and his ideas, and he supportively commented on what the rest of us did and said and showed about our lives. During my first few months on Facebook, I occasionally posted some of my articles on world politics, and Jim was quick to comment and debate. He loved politics and almost always took a strong leftist position, always displaying a steady social conscience. Whether you agreed or not, there was no denying that he came to it from concern for other human beings. Eventually, I decided to leave politics out of my Facebook life -- although I occasionally slip -- and to try to make it more casual, about friends, leaving other social media, Twitter and LinkedIn, for more controversial matters. Jim, on the other hand, put it all out for the world to see, or at least for all his friends to see. He had a modern version of integrity that went well with his intensity. I stayed out of his political battles but often enjoyed reading them, watching him fearlessly take on the world on every topic. Since the morning I learned of Jim's death, I've started hesitating a bit before reaching for the phone in search of the latest updates. Facebook, I have discovered, can sometimes bring very sad news. That's because, as I have learned, it brings news about very real friends.

"(CNN) -- Russia withheld details from U.S. officials about suspicions of Boston Marathon bombings suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011, information that could have altered the course authorities followed, a U.S. law enforcement official told CNN. While Russia did alert U.S. authorities about Tsarnaev's possible extremism, it kept out some facts, namely text messages referencing his desire to join a militant group, the source said. However, sources told the Wall Street Journal that the United States also likely would have withheld such details for fear of divulging intelligence sources and methods. Sheriff: Tamerlan Tsarnaev's burial handled properly . In the texts, Tsarnaev wrote to his mother about his interest in joining the militant movement carrying out attacks against Russia in the Caucasus region, the law enforcement source told CNN. The Russians did not pass these texts on to American officials when they passed the original intelligence about Tsarnaev, the source said. Last month, a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Russia intercepted a communication between the mother of the accused Boston Marathon bombers and someone who may have been one of her sons ""discussing jihad"" in 2011. That source described the conversation as vague, and said that the Russians turned over the intercept to the FBI sometime during the last week of April. Official: Russia heard Boston suspects' mother 'discussing jihad' House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, told the Wall Street Journal that the withheld information could have changed the way U.S. officials worked. Access to the texts ""would have allowed the bureau to open an investigation where you could track (Tsarnaev's) communications,"" he said. ""To me, that's where the ball really got dropped."" In 2011, Russian authorities alerted the United States to concerns that Tsarnaev was becoming increasingly radical. The Russians also raised questions about Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, according to several sources. But the FBI found no evidence of extremist activity and closed the case. The names of both Tsarnaev and his mother were placed in a terror database, however. Still, Tsarnaev was allowed to travel the next year to a restive Russian region rife with Islamist terror groups, and he returned to the United States after six mysterious months abroad. Investigators have said they are looking at possible links between Tsarnaev and those groups during his time in the region.

"(CNN) -- Now that Lance Armstrong, the seven-time Tour de France winner, has been thoroughly disgraced, one must ask: Has anyone learned anything? In August, the United States Anti-Doping Agency announced that it had disqualified Lance Armstrong for his use of performance-enhancing drugs. His Tour de France victories were canceled, and he was banned from further competition in all Olympic sports. The agency announced that it would soon release its ""reasoned decision,"" which it did on October 10. Shortly before the anti-doping agency announcement, Armstrong announced that he would not respond to any decision taken. He was, he said, putting cycling behind him and moving on with his life promoting the fight against cancer. Armstrong resigns from Livestrong cancer charity . Interestingly enough, however, Armstrong had mounted an aggressive and desperate legal campaign to prevent the arbitration process (to which he is subject pursuant to cycling rules and the provisions of the World Anti-Doping Code) from proceeding. His first attempt in the district court in Texas was thrown out. The judge found that the lengthy document, filled with purple prose, was unacceptable, both as to length, but, more important, content and tone. An abbreviated document was then filed. The action was defended by the agency. Armstrong lost. The anti-doping agency's reasoned decision is a well prepared, well written, compelling document. Its statements and conclusions are supported by documentary evidence, scientific data and sworn affidavits -- more than a thousand pages in all. It is a shocking indictment of the conduct of the U.S. Postal Service cycling team and the riders and officials surrounding it. According to the agency report, Armstrong was not only complicit, but a leader who enforced the use of the performance-enhancing drugs. The conclusions of the report appear unassailable. Armstrong, who had an opportunity to challenge the findings, abandoned the field, in a complete reversal of all his previous conduct. News: Evidence of Armstrong doping 'overwhelming,' agency says . The International Cycling Union has until Halloween to decide whether it will accept the agency's decision. The World Anti-Doping Agency has a further three weeks to intervene, should the cycling union act in a manner which it believes to be incorrect. But the cycling union has already compromised itself by declaring in advance that the United States Anti-Doping Agency process was unsatisfactory. Any appeal which it might institute will lead to a far more searching investigation into its own activities than it is likely to relish. While we wait for the outcome of that end-game, there are already some lessons to be learned. 1. This day of Armstrong's disgrace has been coming for some time. It would undoubtedly have come sooner but for the fact that the United States is arguably the most litigious country in the world. In order to make its statements regarding Armstrong, the U.S. anti-doping agency had to be more than certain of its facts. That takes time and careful research. There had been too much smoke for too long for unbiased observers not to believe that there must be some fire, as well. What they perhaps did not expect was the resulting conflagration. 2. You can intimidate some of the people all of the time, all of the people some of the time, but not all of the people all of the time. Some who would have been willing to talk about Armstrong could not afford to defend against actual or threatened lawsuits. Some needed the jobs they had, which would be at risk or disappear if Armstrong wanted that to happen. Others were not willing to risk the harassment and abuse that came from crossing him. News: Lance Armstrong's legacy may withstand accusations . 3. The cheating involved was highly organized, well financed and well-coordinated. It was not simply a few athletes trying to get an edge by surreptitious use of banned substances. Instead it was an essential part of the USPS team strategy, and it involved participants in several countries, all working to achieve better competitive results by deliberately breaking agreed upon rules at the expense of athletes who competed clean. 4. The Armstrong and USPS revelations are so well documented that the cycling union officials have an all but insurmountable challenge if they seek to deny them or to try to sweep them under the carpet. Some of the claims in the report raise questions about whether there was involvement or awareness of the part of the union itself. What will the union do about that? A tougher question yet is whether they can credibly believe that the USPS team was the only team in the peloton that used drugs. 5. But the real question is how -- how? -- could the leading cycling officials, those most familiar with the sport and its riders, not have been aware of the nature and extent to which their sport was compromised? Stay tuned. This is far from over, and there likely will be even more to be learned from this sordid affair. Do you own a Livestrong bracelet? Share with us on CNN iReport .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese authorities announced murder charges Thursday against the wife of disgraced Communist Party figure Bo Xilai, a new step in a scandal China's ruling hierarchy is scrambling to put behind them. Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, is accused of killing British businessman Neil Heywood in November, the state news agency Xinhua reported. Gu and a family aide have been accused of poisoning Heywood, who died in November. Heywood died in the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing, where Bo was the Communist Party chief and a rising star in the party -- the son of one of the ""eight immortals"" of the revolution that created modern China. The case has forced the Communist leadership to confront allegations of wrongdoing by a high-ranking member in an unusually public way, said Douglas Paal, a top China analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ""The disruption of his departure from office and his wife's crimes have made it difficult to present a facade of unity to their people,"" Paal said. China's internet 'battlefield' over Bo . That united front has been key to ruling China for 2,000 years, he said. The current generation of leaders has been particularly sensitive to maintaining it since 1989, when the party hierarchy split over how to deal with the pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Instead, the scandal surrounding Bo and his family ""showed what people suspected was high-level corruption at high levels of government,"" Paal said. Now, the leadership is trying to resolve the affair before its once-in-a-decade leadership transition at the Communist Party Congress meeting later this year, said Joseph Fewsmith, an international relations professor at Boston University and a longtime China watcher. ""There was a desire on the part of the Chinese Communist Party to get this case settled. It's not yet, but it is out of the party and into the hands of criminal courts -- well before the 18th Party Congress,"" Fewsmith said. With the issue now before the courts, the case could be resolved ""within the next couple weeks,"" he said. ""With these cases being dealt with at this time, I expect there to be smooth sailing to the 18th Party Congress,"" he said. ""There may be some bargaining to go, but most of it has been done."" Heywood, 41, was found dead in his hotel room in Chongqing, a city of more than 30 million. Officials quickly blamed his death on ""excessive consumption of alcohol,"" according to media reports, and his body was cremated without an autopsy. But the matter blew open in February, when Bo's longtime lieutenant, Wang Lijun, sought refuge at the U.S. Consulate in nearby Chengdu. Wang, the former police chief who managed Bo's anti-crime push, wanted political asylum, apparently fearing for his life and allegedly holding incriminating information against his boss. Media reports and online posts claimed Wang clashed with Bo after suggesting Heywood had been poisoned amid a business dispute with Bo's wife -- an allegation that appears in the charges announced Thursday. Daring to speak out about Bo Xilai thriller . Gu and family aide Zhang Xiaojun were arrested in early April. The same day, Xinhua announced that Bo had been stripped of his seats on the Communist Party's Central Committee and Politburo, the nation's ruling organs, for an unspecified ""serious breach of regulations."" Who is Gu Kailai? But Paal said Wang, not Bo, ""is probably the most hated"" figure in the affair for going to the Americans. Wang was taken into custody once he left the consulate for entering the diplomatic post without authorization. Paal said his gambit forced China to deal with the scandal with an unprecedented level of transparency, prodded along by social media. ""That's keeping them honest in a lot of places where they could be dishonest in the past,"" he said. Meanwhile, the party has painted Bo as an outlier who violated party discipline and has been ""very careful"" not to use his case to purge the party of most of his supporters. Gu and Zhang are awaiting trial in Hefei, in eastern China. A Bo family friend told CNN that Gu's lawyers were chosen by the government, not the family. The friend, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, also said the Bo family was not notified of Gu's whereabouts until last week. Read more: Investing in China just grew murkier . Authorities say Gu and her son came into conflict with Heywood over ""economic interests,"" and she regarded Heywood as a threat to her son's safety. Fewsmith said that allegation is the ""one real surprise"" in the charges. ""This had not previously been reported,"" he said. Britain, which had asked China to investigate the matter further after being informed of growing concern about Heywood's case, said it welcomed the charges. ""The details of the ongoing investigation are a matter for the Chinese authorities,"" a Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement Thursday. ""However, we are glad to see that the Chinese authorities are continuing with the investigation into the death of Neil Heywood. We are dedicated to seeking justice for him and his family and we will be following developments closely."" Read more: Inside China's murder mystery hotel . Speculation has been rife about the nature of Heywood's work in China and his ties to Bo's family. Heywood had lived in China for more than a decade and was married to a Chinese woman. Among the companies Heywood advised was Hakluyt and Co., a consulting firm founded by former officers of the British spy agency MI6. That link fueled rumors that Heywood might have had connections to British intelligence services. But in a rare public statement on such matters in April, British Foreign Secretary William Hague denied that possibility. ""Mr. Heywood was not an employee of the British government in any capacity,"" he said in a letter. He said the British government would usually neither confirm nor deny those accounts, but that he was making an exception ""given the intense interest in this case.""

"(CNN) -- Global basketball icon Dwyane Wade is making a concerted effort to get his head around an altogether different ball game which he admits is the ""number one sport in the world"". And it is parental responsibility that has piqued the eight-time NBA all star's interest in soccer. ""I'm trying to get into it,"" the Miami Heat star told CNN. ""My youngest son Zion is playing soccer now, so I've got to learn the sport. ""So this season I'm really diving into soccer, learning the rules of the game. With Zion, and also my lady, they both love soccer, so I got to get into it."" Dwyane Wade's best advice . Wade is yet to pick a football team to support, but the 30-year-old is keen to sample the atmosphere of the planet's favorite sport. ""I need to learn about it first, but I do want to go to a game,"" he explained. ""I want to feel the crowd and the energy -- it's the reason that soccer is the number one sport in the world."" It is football's global appeal that has prompted the NBA to make a strategic marketing push in targeting key markets like China, Africa and the Middle East. That campaign has been boosted by the success of players like China's Yao Ming, whose nine-year stint with the Houston Rockets raised the profile of the league in Asia. Meanwhile Spanish brother Pau and Marc Gasol, who play for Los Angeles Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies respectively, helped their country to a silver medal at the recent London Olympic Games -- when the U.S. beat Spain in the final to take gold. ""It's made (the NBA) very global,"" said Wade. ""The international players are very talented, and it's been getting better and better. The game is so big, around the world now, as big as it's ever been. ""We take some pride in that. But we got a lot of work to do over here, because they keep getting better and better around the world because of this game. We're just happy to be the guys that are able to take this game globally."" Of all the overseas arrivals that have made their mark in the NBA, Wade singled out for special mention Germany's Dirk Nowitzki, who was named NBA finals MVP as the Dallas Mavericks beat the Heat to the 2011 championship. ""You look and say Dirk is probably the one that has the most of the respect from the standpoint of what he's done for so many years in the NBA. ""Obviously they beat us in the finals and winning the championship really put him up there in his place where he should be in our time. But there are other players that have been there before I played that could be named as well."" Despite the NBA's growth, it has some way to go before it can rival football's worldwide appeal given the last soccer World Cup final saw global television audience figures peak at 530.9 million. ""It's very big,"" said Wade on basketball's continued expansion. ""We got a way to go to catch up with soccer, but I think our game is doing very, very well.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Entrepreneurs of all stripes are cashing in on the Lin-sanity phenomenon as swiftly as the NBA sensation can pull off his furious fast breaks. It has been only three weeks since Jeremy Lin, the 23-year-old American-born point guard of Taiwanese descent, came out of obscurity to lead the listless New York Knicks to a winning streak. But while their winning run has come to an end, Lin has gone on to become a media and marketing darling. Lin-related products have become hot items. In New York, merchandise retailers are doing brisk business selling Lin's No. 17 jerseys. ""He's made the Knicks relevant again,"" says Larry Dimitriou, manager of Modell's Sporting Goods store in Manhattan. Jeremy 'Lin-demand' in China . ""We constantly get Lin jerseys every day,"" he says. ""I put one in the window to show people we have them. A short time later, they're gone."" Just as nimble and quick are the publishers of ""Linsanity: The Improbable Rise of Jeremy Lin"" by Alan Goldsher, an electronic book that was turned around in just 72 hours. Available wherever e-books are sold, Goldsher's insta-book costs just $1.99. According to Digital Book World, fast-thinking authors have already churned out least seven e-books, all about the humble and wholesome Harvard graduate. The other Lin-inspired titles include, ""Jeremy Lin: Advice from Sun Tzu on Basketball and the Art of War,"" and ""The Zen of Jeremy Lin."" Not to be outdone, Lin himself has filed to trademark ""Linsanity."" The application, filed through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, would give him exclusive rights to put the signature term on more than 50 consumer products, including clothing, mugs and even action figures. Yao Ming: 'Everyone wants to be next Jeremy Lin' Lin is not the only one to file for a trademark on the term, but he stands a good chance of winning it, according to Washington-based trademark lawyer Gary Krugman. But he would stand a poor chance if he filed in China, where trademark laws tend to favor early applicants. Few can match the prescience of Wuxi Risheng, Sports Utility Co. a Chinese manufacturer of basketballs and soccer balls. Risheng, it turns out, have registered Jeremy Lin's English and Chinese names as trademarks in China and claim to have rights to the name of the NBA's latest star until 2021. Risheng's claim, widely reported in local media, could block plans by major sporting goods companies to capitalize on China's growing interest on the new NBA standout. Jeremy Lin, known in Mandarin as Lin Shuhao, was born in the U.S. to Taiwanese parents with ancestral roots in mainland China. According to government records, Risheng applied for Lin trademarks as early as 2010, the year he graduated from Harvard University and was ignored during the NBA draft pick. ""Our boss Yu Minjie watched a lot of NBA games and noticed Jeremy some time in 2010 when he was a nobody,"" one of the partners in the company told CNN. ""We did not expect Jeremy Lin would be such an instant hit. We are happy for his success and of course we feel extremely lucky."" Risheng may have hit a jackpot if Lin's marketing magic continues. ""In China, first-to-register gets the rights,"" says Horace Lam, a Beijing-based intellectual property expert at Jones Day. ""Chinese companies are aware of this system and use it to their advantage. We see this happen every day. It's a big problem for companies and people trying to protect their intellectual property in China when they are not familiar with the Chinese system."" Marketing mavens are lusting to brand Lin. ""He's the total package, a fine athlete and a wonderful story,"" enthuses Scott Kronick, president of Ogilvy PR China. ""We think he's Lin-credible."" Risheng now makes Lin basketballs but soon might start producing jerseys and sneakers. ""Maybe we'll open franchise stores in east China,"" said the Risheng partner. ""Now more and more companies are reaching out to us seeking business tie-up opportunities."" Lam says the Jeremy Lin trademark that Risheng owns applies to a grab-bag of uses and products, including basketballs, shoes, hats, toys and gym facilities. Risheng claims trademarks for other basketball stars, including Yi Jianlian, a Chinese power forward who now plays for the Dallas Mavericks. It also has a trademark on the Chinese name for ""Jordan's Kingdom,"" an apparent reference to retired superstar Michael Jordan, for use on balls. Jordan, known as ""Qiaodan"" in Mandarin, has been aggressively doing business in China. Now he is tightening his defense. This week, Jordan filed a suit in a Chinese court against Qiaodan Sports Company Limited, another Chinese sportswear and footwear manufacturer, for unauthorized use of his name. ""It is deeply disappointing to see a company build a business off my Chinese name without my permission, use the number 23 and even attempt to use the names of my children,"" the basketball legend said in a statement. ""I am taking this action to preserve ownership of my name and my brand."" Still, intellectual property experts say it will be an uphill battle for Jordan to claim trademark rights in China. ""China requires a high threshold to prove that one is famous,"" says Lam. ""Even if Michael Jordan is a big name today, he still needs to prove that he was already famous in China long before 1997, when Qiaodan Sports first registered the name."" Trademark infringements are common and persistent in China, Lam notes. Gucci, Pfizer, Exxon Mobil and Hennessey are just some of the well-known multinational companies fighting long legal battles to protect their trademark. Even Apple, the world's biggest technology company, is embroiled in a trademark lawsuit over the sale of iPads in China, with a Chinese company claiming that it owns the right to use the iPad trademark in mainland China. To be sure, Lin-inspired marketing ideas abound. Jeremy light bulbs? That's been taken.","In New York, merchandise retailers are doing brisk business selling Jeremy Lin's No. 17 jerseys .

"(CNN) -- In times of despair, a good meal goes a long way. The week of April 15 brought two horrific events: The Boston Marathon bombings and the West, Texas, fertilizer plant explosion. In each city, health care workers jumped into action to help victims of the tragedies. In between trying to save lives, these doctors and nurses somehow found the time to support their colleagues across the country. What started as a single act of kindness turned into a culinary exchange that shows just how inspiring ""paying it forward"" can be. In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon blasts, Nancy James, a registered nurse at the medical intensive care unit at Carolinas HealthCare System in Charlotte, North Carolina, wanted nurses in Boston to know that the nurses at her hospital were thinking about them. During the pre-shift morning huddle on April 20, she asked if anyone would be willing to chip in a couple of dollars to order food for Massachusetts General Hospital's medical intensive care unit. The response was larger than she expected: $126, which she used to have pizza delivered to the Boston health care workers. ""I think doing things like this is important,"" Blake said.

On April 18, Dr. Christopher Kabrhel had pizza delivered to the emergency department of Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center in Waco, Texas, which was treating patients from the deadly explosion the day before that damaged homes in a five-block area in nearby West. With the pizza came a note: ""Thanks for all of your hard work. From one member of the E.R. family. ..."" ""It was an absolute surprise,"" said David Argueta, vice president of operations at Hillcrest. ""Our ED (emergency department) obviously was blown away."" Attempts by CNN to reach Kabrhel for comment were unsuccessful. After the Mass General ICU staff received their pizzas from North Carolina, they also reached out to Hillcrest, sending lunch and dinner to the Texas hospital's ICU on April 21. A lot of nurses at Hillcrest were personally affected by the explosion and had relatives who were injured or lost their homes, so gestures such as this gift ""really show the human spirit,"" Argueta said. The chain of support didn't stop there. Enter Trace Arnold, also known as ""the Rib Whisperer."" He runs a mobile barbecue restaurant called the Ultimate Smoker and Grill, and a stationary establishment called 3 Stacks Smoke & Tap House in Frisco, Texas. After the explosion in West, Arnold and his team served three meals a day for three days, feeding more than 5,000 victims and relief workers. Boston amputee victims urged to 'slay the monster' with recovery . ""I just decided, you know what, let's go help,"" Arnold said. One of the volunteers in West was Jill Barton, whose husband works at Hillcrest as a surgeon. She told Arnold about the pizzas that had been sent from the Mass General emergency department team to Hillcrest. Arnold decided to help Texas return the favor. At 4 a.m. Tuesday, Arnold got on a plane to bring barbecue to more than 200 emergency department personnel at Mass General. Delta Air Lines allowed Arnold and his team to fly to Boston for free with 50 racks of ribs and 15 briskets. Several staff members at Mass General wore cowboy boots for the occasion. A few had tears in their eyes as they dug in, Arnold said. ""It was unbelievable,"" he said. ""We were tired -- we cooked for three days straight, 18 hours a day. I was tired and I was just feeding people. I knew these doctors had been working countless hours. ... They hadn't been eating and hadn't been sleeping."" Arnold gave Kabrhel a Texas flag that had traveled the country on Arnold's mobile smoker. The barbecue ambassadors also brought with them a large green Hillcrest hospital flag, signed by as many as 500 staff members who wrote encouraging messages on it. While the Boston health care team enjoyed their barbecue, their counterparts at Hillcrest Skyped with them, Argueta said. The next day Hillcrest received a lithograph of Mass General, which is now displayed in the administrative area of the emergency department. ""You share a common bond, especially in such a trying time,"" Argueta said. ""The whole situation has been extremely therapeutic, I think on both sides, and just so uplifting."" Arnold will continue to pay it forward. He's convinced his corporate sponsors, such as Pepsi Co. and Frito Lay, to deliver food every week for the next month to emergency workers in West. ""In this crazy world that we live in nowadays ... it just seems right,"" he said. ""We're all just doing our duty as people, as human beings.""

"(CNN) -- Nineteen months after she and 18 others were shot at a political event -- six of them fatally -- former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords returned home Sunday to her native southern Arizona, her husband said. Giffords has spent most of the time since the January 8, 2011, attack at medical facilities in Houston recovering from being shot in the head at a ""Congress On Your Corner"" event outside a Safeway supermarket in Tucson. She has returned to her hometown several times since that shooting, though not permanently until now. ""Moving back to Tucson today,"" her husband Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and astronaut, wrote Sunday on his Twitter feed. ""Gabby has been waiting for this day for a long time."" Records from the Pima County Assessor's Office posted online indicate that Kelly and Giffords bought a 10-room, single family residence in June in central Tucson. The couple paid $1.495 million in cash for the property, which sold for half that price in November 2007, the records show. Then in her third term, Giffords stepped down from her position in Congress in January 2012 to focus on her recovery. Ron Barber, a Giffords aide also wounded in the attack, now holds the seat. On Tuesday, Jared Lee Loughner pleaded guilty to 19 charges related to the incident. That included admitting to killing federal employees U.S. District Court Chief Judge John M. Roll and congressional aide Gabriel M. Zimmerman, as well as Dorothy Morris, Phyllis Schneck, Dorwan Stoddard and 9-year-old Christina Taylor Green. Federal prosecutors said that, under the plea deal, Loughner will be sentenced to life in prison with no eligibility for parole -- meaning he will not get the death penalty, as might have happened with a conviction. His sentencing is set for November 15, prosecutors said. The 23-year-old, whose legal proceedings had been complicated by questions about his mental health, waived his right to seek an insanity defense as part of his plea agreement. Court documents released a few days after the shooting showed that investigators found a letter from Giffords in a safe at the house where Loughner lived with his parents, thanking him for attending a 2007 event. ""Also recovered in the safe was an envelope with handwriting on the envelope stating 'I planned ahead,' and 'my assassination' and the name 'Giffords,' along with what appears to be Loughner's signature,"" the affidavit stated. Giffords worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers and as CEO of El Campo Tire, her family's business, before being elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2000. Two years later, she became the youngest woman elected to the Arizona State Senate. In an online video announcing her retirement from Congress earlier this year, Giffords vowed her public service career was not over. ""I will return, and we will work together for Arizona and this great country,"" she said. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","NEW: Ex-Rep.

"New York (CNN) -- A reference to the name ""Sandy"" can evoke painful reminders of last year's tragedies, be it the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School or an historic storm that wiped out thousands of homes and businesses, and left millions in the dark. But New Jersey's largest firefighters union is looking to honor those affected by both calamities and join them and their mutual names into something more positive. Firefighters have begun collecting donations for the ""The Sandy Ground Project,"" with 26 playgrounds to be built in communities recovering from the storm -- one for each victim gunned down on December 14 at the elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. ""Our only challenge is to raise the money,"" said Bill Lavin, president of the Firefighters' Mutual Benevolent Association, whose 5,000 members are supporting the $2.1 million initiative on the website thesandygroundproject.org. New Jersey and New York each are expected to get 10 playgrounds, with Connecticut getting six. The group says it already has gathered enough funds for at least five of them. The first playground will honor slain special education teacher Ann Marie Murphy and is expected to open on March 1 in Sea Bright, New Jersey, where homes and businesses were devastated by a torrent of wind and water brought by Superstorm Sandy. The massive weather system barreled into the Northeast in late October and left more than 8 million residents without power. Two months later, as emergency personnel struggled in storm recovery, a gunman smashed his way into a Connecticut elementary school and gunned down 6 adults and 20 children, the latter between the ages of 6 and 7. ""We were all working and then Newtown happened, and it just crushed the nation,"" said Lavin. ""People were just walking around in a daze."" He knew he needed to act, and was later inspired by news of a Mississippi girl who wrote a letter thanking New Jersey firefighters for a playground they helped build in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. ""It was so cute,"" Lavin said of the child, who was among several Waveland, Mississippi, schoolchildren to donate a truckload of toys to Sandy victims. ""When I heard about it, I figured we had to do something for our own kids."" ""After talking with parents and school officials in Connecticut, we decided to do it in honor of those children (who were killed in Newtown)."" The three-week-old project has plans for playgrounds in storm-battered areas such as Toms River, New Jersey; Midland Beach, Staten Island; and Westport, Connecticut. ""It's Bill Lavin's project and we are supporting him and thrilled with the efforts that he's made to build them,"" said Jenny Hubbard, the mother of slain 6-year-old Catherine Hubbard. Lavin said he hopes to raise enough money to surpass his goal of 26 playgrounds, and continue building in places such as Tucson, Arizona; and Columbine and Aurora, Colorado, where mass shootings left scores dead.

"(CNN) -- Their stay in Parvin State Park in southwestern New Jersey was supposed to be a getaway, a chance to enjoy the wilderness and quality time with family. But when the line of strong storms came through shortly after midnight Saturday, two related families from nearby Millville decided to huddle together in a single tent hoping to ride out the strong winds and lightning together. Then, after a particularly violent gust, a pine tree snapped -- and fell right on top of them. Lives in danger as many seek refuge from extreme heat . By the time help made it to the scene, past downed trees and power lines, a 2-year-old boy was already dead, said Larry Ragonese, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. His 7-year-old cousin later died on the way to a hospital, the spokesman added. ""The rest of the family members miraculously were virtually unscathed -- a couple of scratches, but nothing to them,"" Ragonese told CNN. ""What they have is the horror of what happened to the two boys."" The families weren't the only ones to experience tragedy when an extreme heat spell helped spawn a powerful line of thunderstorms that swept east from Indiana to New Jersey. Millions were without power Saturday as a result, at a dangerous time given temperatures that soared past 100 degrees Fahrenheit in many of the hardest-hit locales. The combination of no electricity and extreme heat contributed to a host of unique challenges, leading officials to urge residents to do whatever they can to keep cool. Scores of cooling stations were opened up and down the East Coast. At one, in Atlanta, workers unloaded bottles of water while a resident offered advice for the city's senior citizens. ""A lot of them don't realize that they are suffering from dehydration. And so to come to a place that is cool, come to a place where there's water provided, come to a place where they don't have to worry for about 7-8 hours in 106 degree temperature, it's really wonderful,"" said Savannah Potter. Including the two boys from South Jersey, a total of 13 people died as a result of downed trees and power lines, officials said. The millions lucky enough to survive the storms are hardly out of trouble, though, especially given the widespread power outages. 5 tips to survive extreme heat . The strong winds, heavy rains and continued heat made it feel tropical, and certainly dangerous, in inland states like Ohio. ""It looked like a hurricane you would see on television -- the rain was falling horizontally, the patio furniture was moving,"" said CNN iReporter Louis Zur Muhlen from suburbs just north of Columbus, where he spotted burning power lines in the road. ""We have pretty severe weather with thunderstorms and such, but I have never seen winds like that, and I haven't seen this kind of damage."" Hospitals in Prince George's County in Maryland were buzzing Saturday as people came into emergency department waiting rooms trying to get cool, said Fran Phillips, deputy secretary for the state's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Water was running out in Lowell, in southeastern West Virginia, because, without electricity, the town's water tanks couldn't be refilled, water and sewer operator Matt McLeish told CNN affiliate WTAP. Residents in the town use about 50,000 gallons of water a day -- yet the main storage tank only has about 80,000 gallons left in it -- prompting officials there to urge people to conserve water. In Rockville, Maryland, a mother and daughter were dealing with more ordinary, but still disappointing concerns. They were forced to cancel the young girl's birthday party Saturday at an ice skating rink after it lost power. The family doesn't have electricity at its home. ""We're going to the mall.

"(CNN) -- Lance Armstrong's fall from grace has left one of the cyclist's former sponsors not only ""sad"" -- but also without one of its biggest marketing tools. Premier sports eyewear firm Oakley was one of several companies -- including Nike, Trek and Anheuser-Busch -- to end lucrative deals with the American when he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after refusing to answer charges of systematic drug use. Oakley said the 41-year-old had been a ""symbol of possibility"" when he signed up, having inspired millions when he returned to competition after recovering from testicular cancer and then won cycling's blue riband event from 1999-2005. He also raised hundreds of millions of dollars for charity through his Livestrong foundation before a report by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency this year left his legacy in tatters. British Armstrong effigy causes outrage . ""The Lance story is a sad one, with our emotional connection with that athlete,"" Oakley chief executive Colin Baden told CNN. ""We have been very consistent in how we view cheating and we've always stuck with this over the 16 years I've been with the brand, so that if the governing body rules that an athlete has broken the rules, we can't be a sponsor. ""I don't think we'll change any of our strategic views of who we want to promote the brand, but how that person behaves is critical to having a positive relationship."" Many people who once backed Armstrong, following years of allegations about his potentially being a drug user, have now expressed their anger at his apparent duplicity but Baden said there was no point in recriminations. ""For me personally, it's an emotional response. I've never found anger to lead to anything constructive in life -- it's just a disappointment,"" Baden said. ""I can be angry, but it won't change the situation, so I'm just left with the grief of what was a great story."" Baden said there had been no question of Oakley dropping Armstrong until he was officially stripped of his titles. ""We've had athletes fall in the category before and still followed the same rule. Once the recognized governing body rules against them, we follow that governing body's recommendations,"" he said. ""I feel like we're not responding to emotion, we're not responding to the story of the day -- we're following the law."" Cycling's governing body has told Armstrong to return a reported $5 million in prize money he won at the Tour, though it will not reallocate his victories. Texas company SCA Promotions is also seeking the return of $12 million it paid Armstrong, but Baden said Oakley would not be following suit. The company, which has been endorsed by the likes of basketball legend Michael Jordan, tennis star Andre Agassi and now golf's rising star Rory McIlroy, will have to plug the gap left by the fall of one of its most marketable names. ""I like to think of us as a premier sports performance company and we do really extreme product development -- and sometimes the products we develop are unique and it requires somebody in what we call 'the front row' to explain to the masses that this is the best,"" Baden said. ""So any athlete that we're targeting to have a relationship with has to be perceived as the best. There's a reason he's choosing our products -- it's not because we pay him to do it, it's because it pays to do it.""","Former Lance Armstrong sponsor Oakley says it is ""sad"" but not angry about his demise .

"(CNN) -- When Dzhokhar Tsarnaev got a text from a friend asking him if he was one of the two men shown in FBI-released photos of Boston bombing suspects, his reply was short and light: LOL. Other messages from the teenager followed, including ""You better not text me"" and ""Come to my room and take whatever you want,"" according to an FBI affidavit released Wednesday. His friend took the texts as jokes, as if Tsarnaev found humor in the mere idea that he could be responsible for such horror. But when Dias Kadyrbayev showed one of their mutual friends that last text, the friend wasn't laughing. ""He believed he would never see Tsarnaev alive again,"" the affidavit said of Azamat Tazhayakov. What Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov and another friend, Robel Phillipos, did next is the subject of a detailed, sometimes complex FBI affidavit released on Wednesday. That document lays out the federal case as to why the three young men, like their friend Tsarnaev, are now in federal custody. Read the criminal complaint . The charges levied Wednesday do not accuse the three friends of having any involvement in the April 15 attack. Lawyers for two of the men insist that their clients are cooperating and deny any such role. Did they suspect Tsarnaev could be responsible for such bloodshed? According to Tazhayakov's account in the affidavit, while they were eating together about a month before the bombing, Tsarnaev told them he knew how to make a bomb. Less clear, and more critical to their case, was when they concluded Tsarnaev was possibly involved in the Boston attacks, and what they did afterward. And were their actions -- both in tossing a backpack belonging to Tsarnaev and how they dealt with federal investigators -- criminal? That may be decided by a jury, unless the charges are dropped or plea agreements are reached. Suspect's friends face years in prison if convicted . What is known is that the four young men -- Tsarnaev, Phillipos, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov -- enrolled in fall 2011 at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth and became friends. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were in the United States on student visas from Kazakhstan, and spoke Russian as did Tsarnaev. Phillipos, a high school classmate of Tsarnaev, called Cambridge, Massachusetts, his home, as did Tsarnaev. They hung out together, went out together -- including to New York's Times Square, as a 2012 photo with Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov and Tsarnaev showed. Kadyrbayev told investigators that he'd gotten to know Tsarnaev's family and had repeatedly gone to his home when the family lived in Cambridge. And they spent time together after the deadly Boston Marathon blasts. Two days after that attack, on April 17, Kadyrbayev told law enforcement officers that he drove to Tsarnaev's dormitory room on the campus of their southern Massachusetts school and texted to his friend to come down to meet him. Tsarnaev -- who had noticeably shorter hair at the time, Kadyrbayev recalled -- came down, the two chatted, and that was that. Tsarnaev spent that night, until around midnight, at the New Bedford apartment of Tazhayakov. The next afternoon, Tazhayakov went to class on campus and got a ride home from Tsarnaev, the federal affidavit states. That happened not long before 5 p.m., when the FBI released its first photos of the two Boston bombing suspects. One wore a dark baseball cap, a light collarless shirt and a dark-colored jacket. The other had a hooded sweatshirt, black jacket and a white baseball cap turned backward. Sources: Tamerlan Tsarnaev spoke to widow after photos released . It was the latter suspect that caught Phillipos' eye. And it also got the attention of Kadyrbayev, when he got home that night and turned on the TV. Could that be Dzhokhar? The night of Thursday, April 18, authorities say that Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were on the run -- allegedly responsible for killing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer, carjacking a Mercedes SUV, then tossing explosives and trading gunfire with authorities on a high-speed chase through Boston suburbs. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's friends were active that night as well, some 60 miles south. While the three 19-year-olds offered slightly different details and time frames, a common chain of events emerges from their remarks to investigators as laid out in the FBI affidavit. At some point, they exchanged texts about the ""news"" and agreed to meet at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room in Dartmouth. Tsarnaev's roommate let them in, saying Tsarnaev had left a few hours earlier, according to Kadyrbayev. It was around then that Tazhayakov says that Kadyrbayev showed them a text message from Tsarnaev that they could take whatever they needed from his room -- which Tazhayakov interpreted as meaning he'd never be back. While watching a movie, one or more of them spotted a backpack. Phillipos -- who at first denied to investigators ever going to the dorm room, then later changed his story, the affidavit states -- said Kadyrbayev found it when he ""went through (Tsarnaev's) belongings."" Inside, Phillipos noticed about seven tubular fireworks, each between 6 to 8 inches long. The fireworks' powder had been taken out. That wasn't all they found. Kadyrbayev also came across a jar of Vaseline that he thought Dzhokhar Tsarnaev used ""to make bombs,"" according to the affidavit. By then, the same document states, Kadyrbayev knew Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was involved in the Marathon bombing -- a judgment that his lawyer, Robert Stahl, disputed Wednesday, saying ""his first inkling came much later."" Who are Tazhayakov, Kadyrbayev and Phillipos? Whatever their rationale -- be it to help a friend or cover up for him -- the three men left with the backpack. Kadyrbayev said he took Tsarnaev's laptop computer too, because he felt Tsarnaev's roommate might get suspicious if they left with the backpack alone, the affidavit states. They all ended up at Kadyrbayev's and Tazhayakov's New Bedford apartment. There they saw the news coverage on the bombings, wallpapered with photos of the two suspects. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov ""started to freak out, because it became clear from a CNN report that we were watching that (Dzhokhar Tsarnaev) was one of the Boston Marathon bombers,"" Phillipos told investigators. The Cambridge resident said he didn't understand much of what Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov said afterward because they talked mostly in Russian. At some point though -- Kadyrbayev said it was later that night, Tazhayakov thought it was early the following morning -- Tsarnaev's backpack was put in a black garbage bag, lugged outside, and thrown in a dumpster. This came after all three friends talked about what to do first, according to the affidavit. Phillipos' response, for instance, to Kadyrbayev: ""Do what you have to do."" A garbage truck emptied that dumpster that Friday -- the same day that Tsarnaev was finally captured, hurting from apparent gunshot wounds to his head, neck and legs and hand, in the back of a boat parked in a Watertown, Massachusetts, backyard. His friends weren't far behind in following him into federal custody. After 10 hours of questioning that Friday, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were detained the next day on alleged visa violations, according to Stahl. Six days later, the backpack they'd thrown away was found -- this time in a New Bedford landfil. Inside was an assortment of fireworks, a jar of Vaseline and a homework assignment sheet from the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, among other items. And on Wednesday, Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov and Phillipos were in court accused of covering up for their friend, and hampering an investigation into the bloody attacks that jarred a city and a nation.

"(CNN) -- Monday, it was the pool. Tuesday, Myra Murray took her family to a recreation center. ""We've just been going from place to place with the kids, just trying to give them some way to cool down ... and now to eat,"" Murray told CNN affiliate WJLA-TV. She spoke at one of the six sites District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Gray opened to distribute boxed lunches to residents, many of whom lost the means to prepare meals and saw refrigerated items spoil. As temperatures sizzle, fireworks are even more risky . Some of the millions without power after deadly heat-driven storms struck the area Friday flocked to malls, libraries, pools and most any other public place with electricity to seek relief from a massive heat wave blanketing much of the nation. As of Tuesday evening, about 1.2 million customers scattered across 11 states, from Indiana to Delaware, had no electricity, down from about 1.8 million overnight -- and a peak of 4 million on Friday night and Saturday, just after the storms hit. A household is considered one customer, so the actual number of people without power is higher. The total included some 326,000 in West Virginia, 291,000 in Ohio and roughly 223,000 in Virginia, along with about 96,000 in metropolitan Washington, D.C. Utility and government authorities said some residents may not get electricity back until the end of the week. ""This has been quite an ordeal,"" Mayor Gray told HLN's ""Evening Express,"" stressing the need for greater responsibility on the part of the local power company. ""We need a game change. We need to speak not so much about how quickly we restore power, but how do we reduce the likelihood of this happening again in the future,"" he said. Extreme heat warnings were issued Tuesday for portion of Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan, with the National Weather Service saying that those areas would be scorched with temperatures near or above triple digits. Heat advisory warnings were in place for a handful of states, including parts of Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa. Cities and towns in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast have already endured temperatures in the high 90s and above 100 degrees since, in some cases, the middle of last week. It's all part of a system tied to the breaking or tying of more than 2,238 hot weather records nationwide between June 25 and Sunday, according to the National Climatic Data Center. Triple-digit strategies for staying healthy . Frustrations were mounting for many. Residents of Boone County, West Virginia, said Monday their region was among the hardest-hit, telling CNN affiliate WSAZ-TV they're not getting help. ""We have a pool and we have a generator, but a lot of these people have nothing,"" said Stacy Peters of the Prenter community. ""It makes you want to sit down and cry."" She said, ""I know they have a job to do and (power lines) are down everywhere, but you know what? Send somebody down here to check on us. Or set a cooling center up here for us or see if we need water."" The nearby community of Wharton set up a cooling center but said water and ice are in short supply. ""Ever since Saturday, we've had people -- 40, 50, 60 people -- waiting to get some relief and it's just not coming,"" said Carlos Jarvis of Wharton. ""People are in dire straits, really."" About 20 roads were closed in West Virginia on Tuesday, down from a high of about 70 on Monday, said Terrance Lively, spokesman for the state's Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Just after the storm on Saturday, some 680,000 customers were without power, he said. Some 100 major transition lines went down during the storm, he said, but did not know how many were still down Tuesday. ""This is the worst outage we've ever had,"" said Jeri Matheny, spokeswoman for Appalachian Power, which serves most of southern West Virginia. She said it's hoped power would be restored to all customers by midnight Sunday. Crews from 11 states were helping restoration efforts, she said. ""We'll end up rebuilding large pieces of an infrastructure system in five to seven days that took decades to build,"" and crews are working in 16-hour shifts, said Scott Surgeoner, spokesman for FirstEnergy Corp., which covers the state's northern half. He said the company hopes the ""bulk"" of the 125,000 customers lacking power will be restored by Wednesday night, but some outages will stretch into the weekend. At least 17 people were killed from Ohio to New Jersey in the derecho, a massive storm packing straight-line wind damage, while another three in North Carolina died in a second round of storms Sunday. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell said Tuesday the number of storm deaths in his state had risen from 10 to 11. Photos: Storm damage in Washington, D.C. Ken Mallette, executive director of the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, compared the damage to that seen after Hurricane Irene last year. ""We got a hurricane punch without a hurricane warning,"" he told CNN on Tuesday. His agency is most concerned with 36 critical care facilities, such as nursing homes, that were operating on generator power, he said. The Pepco power company, which serves the D.C. metro area, drew criticism from many for its response time, but Mallette said, ""We're not going to sit here and rate Pepco or any other utility. ... That is one thing that will be dealt with in an after-action issue."" For now, he said, ""we're not going to be happy until we have every Marylander back online. ... We have zero tolerance. We want that power back on yesterday."" July Fourth celebrations were canceled in several Maryland locales, including Kensington, Germantown, Rockville and Gaithersburg, officials said. Bone-dry and hot conditions forced fireworks cancellations in other areas. Traffic lights remain out in many hard-hit locales, including around the nation's capital, yet another reason for headaches. ""A lot of detours, a lot of lights that are out (and) some that are spotty,"" said Larry Simmons, a frustrated commuter in southern Maryland. ""A lot of congestion, a lot of discourteous drivers.""

"(CNN) -- The Syrian National Council, a prominent opposition group, elected its spokesman, George Sabra, as president at a meeting Friday in Doha, Qatar. A foreign policy spokesman for the group, Radwan Ziadeh, said Sabra -- the group's third president -- replaces Abdulbaset Sieda, who is now a member of the executive office. In all, 11 members -- men of various religious and ethnic backgrounds -- were elected to the executive office. ""We hope the refreshment in leadership will reflect on the work of the SNC in the future,"" Ziadeh said. ""No women were elected to the executive council but there is a seat for a woman that remains empty,"" he said, adding that no woman had run for the position. After the election, a new push on Syria . The news came on the same day that a group that organizes and documents anti-government actions announced it was breaking with the Syrian National Council. ""Several attempts have been made by the Local Coordination Committees in Syria to push the Syrian National Council and its leadership to adopt a serious and effective general reform plan so that the SNC can assume its role as a political representative of the great people of Syria,"" the LCC said in a written statement. ""It is clear to us now that the Syrian National Council is not fit to assume such (a) role, especially after the disappointing results (of) its restructure attempts."" But Najib al-Adel, a member of the Idlib Revolutionary Movement, told CNN from Doha that some members of the LCC were sticking with the SNC. In addition, other opposition groups remained in Doha and were prepared to continue the talks, he said. The moves in Qatar came as rebels inside Syria claimed victory at a key border town after fighting drove thousands of civilians into Turkey. The battles between Syrian government forces and rebels raged in Ras Al Ain, across the border from Turkey. The fighting has pushed thousands more refugees out of Syria. By Friday, more than 11,000 Syrians had escaped into Jordan and Turkey and more than 400,000 had been registered or were awaiting registration as refugees, said Ron Redmond, the spokesman for U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Across Syria, 126 people were reported dead on Friday, the LCC said. Among them were nine childen and six women, it said.

Syrian rebels reported key strides in their nearly 20-month battle against the Syrian regime, said Amer al-Hasakawi, a Free Syrian Army spokesman in Hasaka. He said several rebel brigades had been slugging it out with government security forces since Thursday morning. Fighters killed dozens of people and arrested others, he said. They seized government buildings, gained control of a border crossing with Turkey and took over border outposts. He said dozens of soldiers in those outposts defected. Clashes continued Friday with military forces shelling Ras Al Ain with artillery and firing rockets. Abu Ahmed, a rebel commander, reported major displacement of civilians because of the fighting and fears that government warplanes will bombard rebel-held neighborhoods. He said rebels were helping move some residents into Turkey and others have fled to nearby Syrian cities. ""Thanks to God, none of the FSA fighters are martyred,"" said Sgt. Muahyman al-Taee, a rebel brigade commander. ""We've killed big numbers from the regime's dogs. Soon we will announce the complete liberation of the city.""

The violence in Syria had Turkey's military on high alert. TV footage showed Turkish soldiers, wearing combat gear, taking cover along berms. It also showed Turkish soldiers picking refugees up from the border and organizing their border crossing. ""The Syrians came right across the border wire,"" said Mehmet Saitavci, the mayor of a neighborhood in Ceylanpinar. Schools in the Turkish town were closed because of the fighting. ""People here have a lot of relatives on the other side, and they are coming up to the border and the Turkish military takes them and brings them into Turkey,"" Saitavci said. ""We were told we can have our relatives be our guests for a few days."" Of the thousands of refugees, 71 were injured, the Turkish Foreign Ministry official said. Two died of their wounds. Most of the Syrians were sent to a Turkish camp in the town of Akcakale. The Turkish Anadolu news agency reported Friday that 26 Syrian military officers and 71 of their relatives had fled to the Turkish province of Hatay. But Turkey's Foreign Ministry denied the report.

As violence continued in border towns, battles between the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters raged elsewhere. The Syrian conflict has left more than 35,000 people dead and widespread displacement. The United States announced more than $34 million in humanitarian assistance for Syrians on Friday, bringing the amount of humanitarian aid it has allocated to more than $165 million. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary Kelly T. Clements made the announcement Friday at the Syrian Humanitarian Forum in Geneva, Switzerland. The money will be used for several purposes, including the purchase of blankets, heating of stoves and other goods for refugees in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon during the winter months. The aid also will target health care, including an immunization campaign for up to 1 million children in Syria to protect them from measles and other diseases. It will also be used to help wounded Syrians at the Lebanon-Syrian border get medical care.

"(CNN) -- An Army captain's wife witnessed her husband's death while the couple was engaged in one of their regular video chats -- he from his base in Afghanistan and she from the United States, some 7,500 miles away -- the family said. Capt. Bruce Kevin Clark was in Tarin Kowt, about 85 miles (140 kilometers) north of Kandahar, when he died during a Skype session with his wife on Monday. Clarence Davis, a spokesman for the William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso, Texas, where Clark was based, said that it has not been determined how Clark died and that the case is under investigation. He added that he ""misspoke"" when he said earlier Friday that ""we believe his death was from natural causes."" Clark's family said in a statement that they'd hoped for ""a miracle"" after his wife Susan saw what happened to Clark earlier this week, but ""it was not to be."" They did not elaborate as to what took place. ""Although the circumstances were unimaginable, Bruce's wife and extended family will be forever thankful that he and his wife were together in his last moments,"" Clark's wife and family said Friday. Clark -- known by many as Kevin -- was a chief nurse in the Army who amassed many honors in his military career, according to his family. Those include an Army Commendation Medal, Military Outstanding Volunteer Service, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and an Army Service Medal. The longtime resident of Spencerport, New York, joined the Army in September 2006 and served, among other places, at the Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, according to a Beaumont Army Medical Center statement. More recently, he was based at that medical facility in southwest Texas and assigned to the Army's A Company, Troop Command. ""He loved being in the military,"" his sister-in-law Mariana Barry told CNN affiliate WHAM in upstate New York. ""He was absolutely willing to make any sacrifice, and it's just horrible that this is the sacrifice he ended up making."" His commander described Clark, 43, as ""awesome,"" ""professional"" and ""a great asset, leader and friend,"" the family said. After his death, special operations troops from the United States and Australia lined up to give him his final send-off from Afghanistan. And on Thursday, his casket was wrapped in an American flag as it was transported off a military plane onto the tarmac of Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, according to the U.S. Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operation. While no dates have been given, the family said that Clark's funeral will be in Spencerport and a memorial service will be held in Addison, Michigan. In addition, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed that all flags at state government buildings be flown at half-staff Monday in Clark's honor, as he's done with other Empire State troops who have died in combat zones. In addition to his wife, Clark is survived by two daughters. Dozens have posted comments on a Facebook tribute page set up in Clark's honor, some of them from people who knew him and his family personally and others from strangers wishing to thank him for his service. ""He was an excellent nurse, a fierce patient advocate, and loved to teach students. But what I remember most about him is the great love he had for his wife and beautiful little girls,"" one woman wrote. ""I have no doubt that Bruce will be watching them and loving them forever more."" Barry said that her sister Susan is ""being strong"" for her daughters and that the entire family is committed to stepping up -- just like Clark did. ""We're going to try to take care of my sister and my nieces the way that Kevin would have taken care of them, and the way he would have wanted us to take care of them,"" Barry said. CNN's Carma Hassan and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: The cause of Clark's death hasn't been determined, an Army spokesman says .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- They wanted to take the chance while they have it. The chance, they said, to live a life without fear. So they lined up Wednesday at lawyers' offices and immigration help centers to complete deferred deportation applications posted online the day before. This was not amnesty or immunity. Nor was it a shortcut to citizenship or a permanent fix to their status: each was illegally in America. But they had hope in their hearts they would be allowed to stay in the country they knew as their own. That they could emerge from the shadows. Ana Laura, 20, and Juana Ramirez, 23, filled out their form at Atlanta attorney Charles Kuck's suburban office. Their parents brought them to the United States from the Mexican state of Michoacan many years ago. They were just toddlers. And they were without any documentation. Face of hope: Lining up to spend two more years in the U.S. They finished high school in Chicago and moved to Georgia three years ago, where they get by working odd jobs here and there. They consider themselves U.S. citizens. Only, they're not. ""I didn't have a choice to come here. I have done nothing bad here,"" Juana said. On this day, when a bold new immigration policy change went into effect, the Ramirez sisters dared to dream and found themselves tempering their emotions. ""I'm scared to get my hopes up,"" Ana said. Scared perhaps because there are no guarantees that come attached to President Barack Obama's executive order signed in June. It allows undocumented immigrants under 30 who were brought to the United States as children to apply for a temporary deferral of deportation if they are in school or have finished school. It allows them to obtain work permits and gives them protection that they won't be deported in the next two years. After that, Obama would need to sign a new order, unless legislation known as the DREAM Act, which has similar provisions, is made into law by then. If Obama loses the November election, there is no guarantee that such a policy would be in place in two years, when all applicants have to renew. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service has assured prospective applicants that their information will remain confidential and will not be used to round up other undocumented family members. Still, the risks made some stop to wonder. David Hernandez, 17, was one. He and his brother Daniel, 15, listened carefully to Kuck as he detailed the program. The brothers arrived in the United States on tourist visas 15 years ago. Like the Ramirez sisters, they were toddlers -- David was 3 and Daniel just 1. Their mother, Salima Hernandez, wanted education and a better future for her children. She said she didn't worry about their legal status until she learned that they would not be able to continue their education without a government-issued ID or Social Security number. David, now a senior in high school, and Daniel, a freshman, say they were not aware of their status until a couple of years ago, when they began to make plans for college. ""I felt that after high school I didn't have anywhere to go,"" David said. ""I felt that if it was not something coming up soon I would end up back in Mexico."" Relief from deportation . Yes, he was concerned about revealing his status to federal authorities. They would know now who he was and how to find him. But it was worth it. ""Whatever comes in the future is better than three months ago,"" he said. The night before in Houston, thousands of people flocked to the consulates of Mexico and El Salvador to obtain passports and other identification documents from their home countries, CNN affiliate KHOU-TV reported. The line wrapped around the building on 4506 Caroline Street, home of the Mexican consulate. Nelly Hernanez said she'd been waiting a lifetime for this. What was a few hours more? ""I've been raised here since I was four, so I've been waiting for this day for a very long time. So it is worth it,"" she told KHOU. Roger Tamez wanted to finally get a driver's license, go back to school. Maybe play football. So many dreams in that one line. There were dreams, too, floating in the swelling crowd at the offices of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles. The immigrant rights group expected about 1,000 people to show up Wednesday. It's estimated that just in the Los Angeles school district alone, 218,000 young immigrants are eligible to apply. Obama's executive order brought thousands relief but many are painfully aware of their sharpest critics who say deferred deportations and the DREAM Act are a form of backdoor amnesty. What also cuts, they said, are charges that illegal immigrants will take jobs away from rightful Americans. Everyone has an opinion, said Martin Bustos, 23, who came to the United States from Mexico when he was 11. But standing in line Wednesday, Bustos offered this thought: there were some jobs that most people don't want but immigrants are willing to take. And that immigrants work just as hard. ""We are like everyone else too,"" he said. ""We are human. We have families."" In New York, Antonio Alarcon, 17, just finished high school. He flipped through the form and spoke of how the six years he has been here has transformed. He feels much more American now than Mexican. ""I work hard. I pay taxes. I have a lot to contribute,"" he said. He hoped his deportation deferment application would be processed quickly so he can see his parents again. They felt worn down by the economic downturn and the stress of their illegal status and finally went back to Mexico this year. They were not there to see their son stand on a stage and graduate at the top of his class. Alarcon hoped that the next time he saw his mother and father, he would be enrolled in college. It was another dream that the immigration policy change could help come true. Five things to know about the changes in immigration policy . CNN's Rafael Romo, Gustavo Valdes, Rose Arce and Miguel Marquez contributed to this report.","This was not amnesty or a fast track to citizenship .

"(CNN) -- In Cambridge, Massachusetts, FBI agents -- guns drawn -- walked down the street near the home where the Boston Marathon bombing suspects lived. Emergency vehicles lined the street, roads were cordoned off, and a suspicious red vehicle was towed from the scene. Mark Santos, 29, a doctorate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it's still sinking in that the suspects, whom he didn't personally know, lived directly across Norfolk Street. ""We were that close,"" said Santos, who has lived there since September. ""It's not something you expect."" His roommate, Diana Jorge, 26, said she's been confused ever since police ordered her out of her home. ""I'm a bit worried. I never thought that this could happen here in Boston,"" she said. Many residents in the area awoke to federal agents with machine guns banging on their doors and the commands: ""Get out! Get out!"" Despite the calls for evacuation, some residents sat on sidewalks near a perimeter of crime scene tape. Others defied the commands to stay indoors and gathered to gawk as state and federal officers -- some in camouflage, most in flak vests -- canvassed the neighborhood. Four miles west, in the suburb of Watertown, many residents remained on lockdown, stuck in their homes after a car chase led the Boston Marathon suspects and a cadre of police into their neighborhood. Chaos ensued just hours after authorities released images of the suspects. It was about 10 p.m. -- close to bedtime for many people, if not past it -- when police received a report that a robbery was under way at a convenience store near the MIT campus in Cambridge. The robbery was the first in a series of crimes that unfolded overnight and well into the next morning, putting the city, suburbs and one of the country's premier universities on lockdown at various points through the night. Residents were told to stay inside, away from windows, as city services came to a halt. About 20 minutes after the robbery, an MIT police officer was fatally shot while responding to a disturbance at Vassar and Main streets, amid several of the school's research facilities. MIT was quick to warn its students of the mayhem on its Twitter feed and emergency services website. ""Gunshots were reported near Building 32 (Stata) which is currently surrounded by responding agencies. The area is cordoned off. Please stay clear of area until further notice,"" the university posted, asking students to stay away from one of the university's busiest buildings. Police arrived on the scene to find the campus police officer in his car with multiple gunshot wounds. They took him to Massachusetts General Hospital, but it was too late. Patrol officer Sean Collier, 26, of Somerville, who joined the force in January 2012, was pronounced dead. Police believe the bombing suspects were responsible for the shooting. ""Sean was one of these guys who really looked at police work as a calling,"" MIT Police Chief John DiFava said in a statement. ""He was born to be a police officer."" Shortly after the shooting came another report of violence: Two men -- whom police now say were brothers living in Cambridge -- hijacked a vehicle at gunpoint in Cambridge, telling the driver that they were the marathon bombers, a law enforcement source told CNN's Joe Johns. At some point, at a gas station on Memorial Drive along the Charles River, the driver escaped uninjured, Cambridge police reported. Police, who were tracking the vehicle using its built-in GPS system, picked up the chase in Watertown, a town of 31,000 just west of Boston. The pursuit went into a residential neighborhood, with the suspects throwing explosives at the police, officers said. ""The suspects and police also exchanged gunfire in the area of Dexter and Laurel streets. During this pursuit, an (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) Police officer was seriously injured and transported to the hospital,"" Boston police said in a release. Richard H. Donohue Jr., 33, was shot and wounded in the incident, a transit police spokesman said. CNN affiliate WBZ reported he has been with the department for three years. He was taken to Mount Auburn Hospital, WBZ said. The officer's condition was not immediately known. Ultimately, one bomber -- later identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26 -- got out of the car. Police shot him, and his brother ran over him as he drove away, according to the law enforcement source. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was critically injured. He had bullet wounds and an injury from an explosion. He was wearing explosives and had an explosive trigger, a source told CNN. He later died, while authorities say his brother, Dzhokar Tsarnaev, 19, escaped. After a hellish week in Boston, residents probably didn't need to be reminded that he was believed armed and dangerous. Warnings to Watertown residents followed. First, Boston police tweeted, ""There is an active incident ongoing in Watertown. Residents in that area are advised to remain in their homes. More details when available."" Then, a warning by state police that the search was intensifying: ""Police will be going door by door, street by street, in and around Watertown. Police will be clearly identified. It is a fluid situation."" Officers locked down the streets of a Watertown neighborhood -- the intersection of Dexter and Laurel streets lies in a heavily residential area -- after isolating the vehicle. SWAT members arrived on the scene, and police in full body armor carrying assault rifles ran down the streets, according to CNN affiliate WCVB. Homeland Security Investigations agents were among those responding, a department spokesman said. Police requested that residents in the area turn off their mobile phones, saying they believe the devices were used to detonate the Boston Marathon explosives. They went door to door, leaving an already-on-edge suburb even more anxious. In Cambridge, police converged on another home, telling residents near Norfolk Street, ""Ongoing investigation. Potentially dangerous. Stay clear."" Chris Howes, who asked local police via Twitter whether they had any advice for residents who lived on Norfolk, also wrote on Twitter, ""This is scary as f***."" Asked via Twitter whether he could provide more information, he tweeted, ""don't really have any info. CPD told us to stay indoors so we just hear lots of sirens outside."" As news emerged that the suspects lived with their parents in the Norfolk Street area, nearby resident Amy McConnell tweeted, ""Just so weird to think those guys have been walking around my neighborhood all week."" She also declined to speak to CNN. At the corner of Norfolk and Cambridge streets, police tape lined the road, blocking off Norfolk a few houses down from the white clapboard home where the suspects reportedly lived with their parents. Police and FBI buzzed around the home. Joey Barbaso, 50, has lived in the neighborhood since he was 5. He didn't know the suspects, had never seen them. The construction worker's pants were worn and stained with paint. The neighborhood, nestled between Harvard and MIT, is a mix of working class and college students, he said, standing in the doorway of a shop. ""You never know who you're living next to,"" he said. ""I think it's nuts. What's this world coming to? I tell you, the world's getting screwed up more and more and more."" Meanwhile, the entire city was shutting down. The transit authority said all modes of transport -- including rail, subway, buses and ferries -- would be suspended until further notice. Taxi service in Boston was suspended. MIT and Harvard canceled classes, as did other local colleges Boston Public Schools. While police requested residents of Boston and all its suburbs remain at home, the Massachusetts State Police specifically singled out Boston, Watertown, Cambridge, Allston-Brighton, Belmont and Newtown. The governor's office added Waltham to the list of places where people should ""stay indoors with your doors locked."" Later, the Boston Police Department announced that ""all vehicle traffic"" in Watertown was suspended and asked that businesses remain closed. The transit authority sent buses to evacuate residents, while bomb squads combed the area. Cambridge police -- already slammed -- announced on Twitter that they had fielded more than a dozen calls about suspicious packages in the city. All were cleared without incident. As dawn came, police announced they were conducting a controlled detonation near Kenmore Square, across the river from MIT. They also released a vehicle description: ""Police seeking MA Plate: 316-ES9, '99 Honda CRV, Color - Gray. Possible suspect car. Do not approach."" The car was later located in Cambridge, but Dzhokar Tsarnaev was not found. Another controlled detonation was announced later in the day, as well as another lookout, this one for a green 1999 Honda sedan. As the situations in Cambridge and Watertown continued to unfold well into the afternoon, many residents woke to a city in turmoil, though some aspects of life were returning to normal, including taxi service and trash pickup. Still, residents were nervous. Tweeted @BarryGagne of Watertown, ""I'm seriously scared right now. Way to close to my house. (2blcks)Afraid of explosives. Everything. Be safe people #watertown #bostonstrong"" Back in Cambridge, authorities erected a blue tent-like tarp outside the suspects' home. Much of the home's contents was placed beneath it, and reporters, who had been kept a block away from the scene, were allowed to have a closer look. Though across-the-street neighbors Santos and Jorge didn't know the suspects, they had succinct sentiments regarding their fate: They hope the remaining suspect meets the same end as his brother. ""I hope he's found dead,"" Santos said. ""I don't think we should pay U.S. taxpayer dollars to give him a fair trial. Nah."" Jorge concurred: ""I feel the same. For me, it's better. I can sleep more."" CNN's Wayne Drash contributed to this report.","Many residents woke to find a marathon bombing suspect dead, manhunt under way .

"(CNN) -- It might not have been a royal procession, but Ted Ligety's tag as ""King of Schladming'""is undeniable after he reigned supreme in Austria Friday. The 28-year-old successfully defended his world giant slalom title to become the first male skier in 45 years to win triple gold at a single world championship. Ligety has enjoyed a stellar week on the slopes, winning the opening super-G before claiming gold in the super-combined. Having already won four of the five giant slalom events so far this season, Friday's victory was not so much of a surprise, but it catapults the U.S. star into the history books and crowns an outstanding past seven days. Ligety claims second gold as U.S. tops medals table . ""If you want to call me the king of Schladming, that's cool with me,"" Ligety told reporters. ""It's been a crazy, unbelievable week and definitely far exceeded my expectations. To win three gold medals is awesome and it's a really cool feeling to join some of the legends of the sport. ""I'm super pumped. It's such a cool feeling and I'm glad to have got it. ""I don't know how easy it was. It was on the limit, and I took some risks, it was dark and bumpy. ""I heard the cheering in the finish area (when Hirscher briefly took the lead), but I didn't feel pressure. I had a 1.3 second lead."" Ligety joins esteemed company in winning three golds, equaling the achievement of Norway's Stein Eriksen who achieved the feat in 1954 and France's Emile Allais in 1937. Grand Sochi project highlights Putin ambition . Only Austria's Toni Sailer, who won four golds in 1956 and three in 1958 and France's Jean-Claude Killy, who also won four in 1968 sit above Ligety. His three gold medals takes his career total to four, equalling Bode Miller's U.S. record, while allowing the American team to regain its place at the top of the medals table. Ligety started the day in perfect fashion, clocking an electric first run to finish 1 minute 30 seconds clear of Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal. The U.S. star then recorded a more conservative second run to come home in an aggregate time of 2 minutes 28.92 seconds, 0.81 seconds ahead of Austrian Marcel Hirscher, with Italian Manfred Moelgg claiming bronze at 1.75 seconds. The home crowd had hoped for a first individual gold of the Championships, but a poor first run from Hirscher ruined any dreams of gold. ""It was definitely one of toughest races I've ever competed in,"" Hirscher told reporters. ""Yesterday I had back problems and at 2 a.m. this morning I was thinking about whether it made sense to compete. ""I was looking pretty bad today - a bad hair day! But I mobilised every energy in my body, it means a lot for me. ""The whole country's watching me; they want to see me winning. I've got a silver medal, it's perfect."" Worley upstages world champion Maze . Meanwhile, Svindal missed out on his third medal of the championships after taking gold in the downhill and bronze in the super-G. ""I feel like the guy who came in fourth place, not ideal but that's the way it is,"" he told reporters. ""I'm definitely not happy right now but I have a gold and a bronze and I was in the chase for a medal in all four races, so it could've been better, but right now I'm disappointed, but in an hour or two I'll be over it.""","Ted Ligety won his third gold of world championships at Schladming .

"Boston (CNN) -- From her perch atop a church bell tower high above downtown Boston, Nancy Taylor watched as runners from all over the world trudged down Boylston Street for the final stretch of the city's 117th annual marathon. ""People often call it the 'Marathon Church,'"" said Taylor, a senior minister and CEO of the Old South Church in Boston, pointing to the brush of blue and yellow paint that spell out the word ""FINISH"" in bold letters on Boylston Street's pavement outside. The church's Colonial-era congregation -- which included Ben Franklin and the Americans who first gathered to plan the Boston Tea Party -- is part of the legacy of a city propped up by its past. The church reopened Monday as authorities removed the last remaining barricades to restore a semblance of normal life. ""There is no question that we are shaken,"" said Taylor. She doesn't think the city will be quite the same. Many shops, restaurants and bars along Boylston Street have reopened since twin bombings at the marathon's finish line on April 15 killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. A popular eatery called Forum, which sustained heavy damage, remains boarded up as workers in hazmat suits clean blood-stained floors and remove shattered glass windows. Boston Magazine cover shows city's heart . Maura Guillet was sipping a mimosa with some friends at the Atlantic Fish Company when a fireball ignited outside her window. ""It was thunderous,"" she recalled. The restaurant, a Boylston Street fixture, remains closed as a result of the blast. By most accounts, many in Boston seem to have come to terms what transpired, though a once-distant perception of terror has now become more personally felt in the days since the attack. ""There's a pause and a fear, but we're not going to be defeated by two punks,"" said Gerardo DeFaeritiis, whose shoe store reopened Monday after being part of a crime scene for the past week. ""Like everything else, time is the best medicine."" Cleaning crews continue to mop up the remnants of glass and scattered debris, while painters splash green paint onto wrought iron gates and wooden moldings atop store fronts, blackened in last week's attack. Dolly Lakkis, who owns an eyeglass store on Bolyston Street, said that returning to work brought an eeriness accompanied by sadness. A floral memorial sits directly outside her window, where passersby come to pay their respects. She catches herself staring at it when work is slow. After Boston: The pros and cons of surveillance cameras . ""We're ready to get back to normal,"" she said. ""We're not going to sit back and take it."" Tough talk is commonplace here, as hardy New Englanders appear to be keen to move on. That sense of resiliency also seems inextricable from the city's history. Even younger residents drop off-the-cuff references to figures like Paul Revere in their casual bar-room banter. Here, Samuel Adams isn't just the name of a popular beer. ""This is not a young city,"" Nancy Taylor said. ""We've been tried and tested over centuries. We've been through wars. We've been through witch trials. So it's not as if we haven't seen horror before."" Her stone church looms almost directly over the marathon finish line, where its 19th-century spire is a welcome sight to runners, signaling their 26.2-mile trek is nearly over. Up until last week, the church had been shuttered only once in its history, which dates back to America's first European settlers. ""We were taken over by the British, who were a little upset with us because we dumped their tea,"" said Taylor, describing the only other time the church formally closed in 1775. After last week's terror attacks, police barricaded Boylston Street and made Taylor's church grounds part of the crime scene. In runners' tent and ER, a rush to save lives, and limbs . From her vantage point view atop the church's 246-foot campanile, she witnessed the clouds of smoke and debris that filled Boylston Street after the blasts. ""One of most extraordinary things was watching people down on the ground sorting themselves out,"" she said. ""Some people were running literally towards the danger to help people out. ""The courage I was witnessed from 246 feet up was amazing."" Now, residents who were directly and indirectly affected by the attack are returning to Old South Church looking for ways to cope with their trauma. ""I came today to pay my respects after picking up my medal,"" said Lauren Tourgee, a runner whose race was cut short by the attacks. ""This is a place that's usually filled with happiness, especially on Marathon Monday."" Tom Ralston said he planned to return later in the week; it will be the first time that he will have seen the familiar downtown street since the second explosion ruptured his eardrums and left shrapnel buried deep in his hand. ""I don't know what to expect,"" said the longtime member of the Old South Church. ""I have nightmares. I have flashbacks."" Since the attacks, Ralston has sought counseling like many Bostonians. ""Talking with friends, and others like Nancy, are making me understand that the only way you're going to get through some of the worst parts of this is by talking,"" he said. ""I think I've got a lot more talking to do."" But for the moment, a lingering trauma has left him still wary of public places. ""I actually turned down four wonderful Red Sox tickets for Saturday night because I'm not sure that I'm ready for an open-air crowd just yet,"" he said. ""I'd have no idea who's sitting next to me or behind me."" After visiting Fenway Park ""hundreds of times before,"" he's just going to wait. ""If you think about Boylston Street -- if it can happen there, it can happen absolutely anywhere,"" he said.","Minister Nancy Taylor watched from a bell tower as the Boston terror attack unfolded .

"(CNN) -- A man alleged to be a senior member of a Tijuana-based drug cartel was extradited from Mexico to the United States on Friday to stand trial. Eduardo Arellano-Felix, 55, faces charges of narcotics trafficking, racketeering and money laundering. He was arrested on October 25, 2008, after a gunbattle with Mexican forces, the Justice Department said. Arellano-Felix was ordered extradited to the United States in 2010 but spent nearly two years on unsuccessful appeals of his case. ""The extradition of Eduardo Arellano-Felix today marks the end of a 20-year DEA investigation into this vicious drug cartel,"" said William Sherman, the Drug Enforcement Agency's acting special agent in charge in San Diego. According to a Justice Department news release, his cartel, the Arellano-Felix Organization, ""controlled the flow of cocaine, marijuana and other drugs through the Mexican border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali into the United States."" Prosecutors said the group brought Colombian cocaine into Mexico by sea and air, then smuggled it into the United States for sale. The Justice Department estimates the cartel made hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. ""The FBI is pleased with Mexico's efforts to bring to justice a leader from one of the most violent criminal enterprises in our history,"" said San Diego FBI Special Agent in Charge Daphne Hearn. ""The spirit of cooperation between our two countries is a powerful force in disrupting the criminal activities of these groups that instill fear and threaten the safety of our citizens in the border regions of the United States."" Arellano-Felix is scheduled to make his first court appearance in San Diego on September 4. The Justice Department noted two brothers of the accused already are serving time in the United States. Benjamin Arellano-Felix and Francisco Javier Arellano-Felix were convicted on drug trafficking, money laundering and racketeering charges.","Eduardo Arellano-Felix, 55, faces charges of narcotics trafficking and racketeering .

"(CNN) -- Nadia Comaneci will forever be remembered as the first gymnast to achieve the perfect score of 10 in Olympic competition on the way to winning three gold medals at the 1976 Montreal Games. Comaneci, who was just 14, went into the Olympics with admittedly ""very, very low expectations"" -- but in the space of a few short days became one of the most recognizable athletes on the planet. Competing for Romania, she was awarded seven scores of 10 during the course of the competition as she took gold in the uneven bars, beam and all-round disciplines, backed up by a silver in the team event and bronze on the floor. ""It's hard to believe it's 36 years since I did that, it doesn't feel that long, but it is. I remember everything, all the routines,"" she said in an interview for CNN's Human to Hero series. Coached by the famous combination of Bela and Marta Karolyi, who trained many gymnastics champions, Comaneci went on to claim two more gold medals at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow and captured two world championship golds and nine at European championship level. She retired from competition in 1981 and turned to coaching, but in 1989, shortly before the revolution which other threw Romanian president Nicolae Ceaucescu, Comaneci defected to the United States. In 1994 she became engaged to American gymnast Bart Conner, who had first met her back in 1976. They married in 1996 in Bucharest as she returned to her native country for the first time since defecting. Comaneci became a U.S. citizen in 2001 and is still involved in gymnastics through an academy she runs with Conner, while holding a number of honorary positions with the Romanian and international federations. Early years . Spotted by the Karolyis at the age of six, Comaneci started training at their academy in her hometown of Onesti. ""I didn't know I wanted to be a gymnast, I was just introduced to the gym,"" she said. ""I loved the place because it looked like a hi-tech playground with mats and a lot of things I can hang from. ""But I like the competition. And probably if I didn't do gymnastics I would have done a different sport and hopefully I would have been good enough."" That competitive edge helped her burst onto the international scene with four golds at the European championships in Norway in 1975, and the following year came Olympic immortality. Inspirations . In a golden era for women's gymnastics, the 1972 Olympics in Munich featured two competitors who were a big influence on Comaneci as she watched at home in Romania. She admired the graceful Ludmilla Tourischeva, who won the all-round gold title, but it was another Soviet Union entrant, the diminutive Olga Korbut, who captured her imagination -- and that of the international audience -- in winning three gold medals. ""Olga Korbut was the famous gymnast in that time, but I was watching her in the gymnastics and I said to myself, 'I hope one day I will be like her,' "" said Comaneci. Four years later they competed against each other in Montreal, with Korbut winning gold as part of a Russian team which relegated Romania to silver. Perfection . While Comaneci missed out on that team gold, it was her performances in the individual and all-round disciplines that catapulted the teenager to fame. Competing in the uneven bars final, Comaneci first achieved perfection, a mark of 10 from the judges. But there was an element of farce as she awaited her score. ""First of all it was not 10, it was a one point zero zero because the computers couldn't cope!"" she recalled. ""They were not prepared for the 10, so they didn't make enough space after the decimal to be able to accommodate the 10. ""They said it was a one point zero zero or a hundred, which meant nothing in gymnastics, or a one is ... a one is a really bad score."" After the technical glitch was sorted, Comaneci was able to celebrate with her teammates, but in contrast to the emotional Korbut, she rarely showed emotion during competition and was the butt of some criticism for her demeanor. ""I always said that I was the kind of person who didn't smile all the time, but I did smile at the end of the routine,"" Comaneci said. ""I think that when you are on a four-inch balance beam, you don't care about laughing or smiling or waving to the crowd because you're going to be down in a second."" Looking back on her feat, the gymnastics equivalent of the first four-minute mile in athletics, Comaneci almost downplays her achievement. ""People ask me what the definition of perfection, I said it's none, there is no definition of perfection. At some particular time when I was 14 years old, I've done something that people didn't expect,"" she said. ""It's a ladder that you climb in life, and I got there first."" Philosophy . Comaneci is aware that, like Korbut before her, she inspired a generation of gymnasts, but she believes they should stamp their own mark on their career. ""I don't think you should replicate what I've done, everybody has to be unique and do their own thing,"" Comaneci said. ""I think that the kids should have role models, but I don't think you should duplicate anybody. You should create your own thing."" Comaneci spent many hours of training from an early age to win her gold medals, and says that is still the recipe for success. ""You have to have a lot of passion for what you do, to be able to work hard and to have a lot of motivation because you're going to go to places that you're never going to believe.""","Nadia Comaneci was first gymnast to achieve perfect score of 10 in Olympics .

"New York (CNN) -- Seventeen families from the New York City borough of Queens are planning to sue the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), blaming the company for a devastating fire that destroyed more than 130 homes during Superstorm Sandy. ""Damages were sustained as a result of the negligence, gross negligence, carelessness and recklessness of the Long Island Power Authority,"" the plaintiffs say in their ""notice of claim,"" which is a filing required in many areas before a lawsuit can occur. ""At no time before or during the storm surge in Breezy Point (a Queens beachside neighborhood), and in the Rockaway Peninsula, generally, did respondent Long Island Power Authority suspend provision of electricity in those areas,"" the plaintiffs state. The notice of claim maintains that despite flood and storm warnings, and knowledge that Breezy Point was in the mandatory evacuation zone, LIPA failed to shut down or ""de-energize"" power in the area, which would have prevented the blaze. Wind, rain, snow and fire: The storm that broke records -- and hearts . A spokesman for LIPA, Mark Gross, said Tuesday: ""We reviewed the notices of claim, and have no comment at this time."" The claim quotes New York City Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano as saying the fires ""were sparked by sea water impacting electrical systems and components in and around these structures."" Referring to the plantiffs in the case, the notice of claim declares, ""The Breezy Point neighborhood, including (plaintiffs' houses), turned into an inferno ... The fire spread to destroy more than 130 homes and severely damaged approximately 30 others."" The filing also contends that LIPA knew the risks posed by the impending floodwater, and says that the company took necessary precautions in other parts of Long Island and had taken similar steps in Breezy Point during past storms. ""There's no rational reason for not cutting the power,"" said Bob Sullivan, a partner at Sullivan, Papain, Block, McGrath & Cannavo, the firm representing the plaintiffs. ""To temporarily cut that power would have prevented these fires."" Interactive: Superstorm Sandy's victims . Linda Strong, one of the plaintiffs, was born in Breezy Point and lost the house she moved into in 1979 during the fire. ""I went to my son's in Bensonhurst and their power was turned off because of the water coming up,"" Strong told CNN. Sitting in candlelight at her son's house, Strong thought the same precautionary measures had been taken in her community. ""I had no idea my house was burning down,"" she said. The 17 claimant families plan to seek $1 million each in damages, according to the notice of claim. Sullivan said he expects that additional parties will be permitted to make subsequent claims, given the circumstances surrounding the case. ""I think the lawsuit has teeth,"" Sullivan told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Of the 12 people killed in the July 2012 mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater, 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan was the youngest. Long after the moments of silence have ended, people around the country will still be at a loss for words to describe what happened to the fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, daughters and sons killed and wounded. Those close to the victims have an especially difficult task: finding words of solace for the incomprehensible. Grief experts say the loss of a child brings on a special kind of anguish. ""You think about all the things you'll miss: the graduations, the swim lessons, the dance recitals,"" says Patricia Loder, the executive director of The Compassionate Friends, a foundation that supports those who are dealing with the grief that follows the death of a child. Loder lost her two children in a car crash in 1991 and has since channeled her grief into helping others. 8-year-old Bombing victim greeted dad at finish line . ""One of the most important things is to listen to what the parents have to say. I call it 'the head and the heart.' Their head knows their child has died, but their heart doesn't want to believe it,"" says Loder. CNN's photo gallery of the Aurora shooting victims prompted many commenters to share opinions on what to say and what not to say when talking to bereaved parents: . CNN commenter ""Nellen"" said: ""When you want to comfort a parent whose child has died, please don't say 'I can't imagine...' I don't know why, but when people say this, and I hear people on air saying it all the time, it upsets me. My son died 2 years ago, and the way I interpret those words might seem skewed, but I can't help it. I hear those words as saying: 'That could never happen to me' or 'You are so different from me I can't relate' ... "" CNN commenter ""sallyforth88"" responded: ""When people, who are trying to comfort someone, say things like, 'I can't imagine,' they really, probably CAN'T imagine because it's never happened to them. Would you rather have someone say to you, 'I know what you must be feeling?' I find saying something like that is 10 times worse. But they are just trying to comfort you. Please don't be so sensitive when people are only trying to help ... some people don't know what in the heck to say."" Surviving with the guilt of living . Sometimes it's not what you say, it's what you don't say, according to psychiatrist Abigail Brenner. ""The best thing to do is be around and listen to the parents, and try not to inject your own opinion,"" says Brenner. ""Inevitably most people have never lost a child, so saying 'I know how you feel' is not going to help."" Even if you have lost a child, Brenner says the phrase ""I know how you feel"" is too subjective: every parent's response is different. Some people try to make the best of it; some people fall apart; some people get angry; some people try and channel it into something positive. ""They think they must say something. We're a society where we're uncomfortable with silence. We think we need to put a reason why this happened out there,"" says Loder. Sometimes just being present is the best thing you can do. Let the parents know you're there for them: pass them a tissue, rub their back, allow their tears fall onto your shoulder. ""You don't have to say a lot or try to take the pain away. Words like 'I am so sorry' or 'I am here for you' can be healing. It's important to acknowledge their pain and not change the subject or tell them it's not so bad,"" says clinical psychologist Melanie Greenberg, who specializes in grief and trauma. And while it's easy to try to find that proverbial silver lining or light at the end of the tunnel, Brenner says comments such as ""this will pass"" should be avoided, because while the grief may pass, the memories of the child won't -- and shouldn't. ""The whole idea of finishing grief doesn't mean you stop mourning a child or you get over it, but the thing is you have to have closure on the emotional life. You carry the memory. You want to be able to move on."" After loss, one father's walk to pound grief into the ground . Please share the words and actions that have helped you through traumatic events in the comments section below.","Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6, was the youngest to die in the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, shootings .

"(CNN) -- Forty-four workers were evacuated from a natural gas platform in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday after a blowout occurred, according to officials. Crew members aboard the Hercules 265 were preparing the well for production when they hit an unexpected pocket of gas. No injuries were reported. Officials had said earlier that 47 workers were evacuated. While gas is flowing from the well, ""no oil is being released,"" according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. The platform, about 60 miles southwest of Grand Isle, Louisiana, is leased by Houston-based Walter Oil & Gas Corporation. The company did not respond to CNN's requests for comment Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Will elementary and middle school students soon be able to put up their own Facebook pages? It looks like it. According to news accounts, Facebook is considering doing away with its rule that no one under age 13 may have a Facebook page. Cranky math instructors and tyrannical P.E. coaches must be at least a tad nervous at the thought of what the little darlings might post about them. But the change could be a good thing if it encourages a reasonable amount of parent involvement. The things the rest of us do on Facebook -- reveal what we had for lunch, post way too many photos of our kids and pets, comment on what Queen Elizabeth wore for her 60th anniversary jubilee -- are considered too dangerous for 10-, 11-, or 12-year-olds to do, even if their ""public"" consists only of people they've invited to be their friends. One result is that millions of pre-teens -- 7.5 million, according to a Consumer Reports account last year -- have established profiles on Facebook, some using fictitious names. Five million of them are younger than 10. What's most disturbing is that in many cases, parents have helped their kids circumvent the rules. What, pray tell, does that teach their children? The parameters of the policy under consideration at Facebook are undetermined but would work something like PG-13 movies. One idea is that the child's page would be linked through the parent's page -- a sidecar, if you will. Savvy parents would give their children as much privacy as possible even if wincing sometimes at what they saw. But they'd also have the opportunity to step in if they noticed something that was hurtful, dangerous or inappropriate. Schools of thought: My kids won't be on Facebook anytime soon . Despite what some adults might think or read, teens, at least by their own account, are pretty responsible when it comes to social networking. According to the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project, more than 7 out of 10 teens say that other teens with whom they're online are kind, not mean. Of course, they've seen instances of cruelty. But let's not forget they see that in school, too; in fact, according to what they told Pew, most of the bullying they see or experience happens in person. Only 15% say they've been victims of online cruelty -- interestingly, the same proportion of adults who report being hurt by other adults. According to Pew, teens are receiving lots of counsel about Internet safety and responsible behavior. Amanda Lenhart, who directs Pew Internet's research on teens, children and families, was struck by how many different advisers there were. Kids on Facebook? Some people think otherwise . ""Teens average five sources from which they receive advice about online safety and responsibility,"" she said. Parents give the most, followed by teachers, the media, siblings or cousins, friends and older relatives. Pew also found evidence that many parents and other adults are monitoring teens' online profiles. ""The village is active,"" Lenhart says. That's on behalf of teenagers. Just think how much guidance the under-13 set would receive. Some people will find it hard to believe Pew's findings. We don't hear or read much about what adults are doing to ensure, as much as possible, the safety of children and young people who go online. What we do hear about, particularly from companies that want to sell certain kinds of software to protect users, is the cruelty and misbehavior that the Internet makes possible.ÃÂ Certainly, one can buy commercial software that can, for example, track a child's texts, block texting altogether and monitor a child's location. But such software should be a last resort. A better first step is to share questionable online experiences with our preteens on sites like Facebook, in order that they learn how to handle such situations on their own. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Laura Sessions Stepp.","Facebook is considering changing rule to allow preteens to have their own pages .

"(CNN) -- Hezbollah denounced the European Union's decision to list its military wing as a terrorist organization, calling the move ""aggressive and imbalanced."" The Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite group is already viewed as a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel. In recent months, it has joined forces with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country's ongoing civil war. Hezbollah issued a statement Tuesday saying the EU's decision Monday was ""written by American hands using Israeli ink"" and that ""all (that) was left for the Europeans to do was to sign the document and approve the legislation."" Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said he hoped that the European Union had read data and facts about Hezbollah more thoroughly before making the decision, the state-run National News Agency reported. The report did not specify what data about Hezbollah the prime minister was referring to. Hezbollah leader acknowledges fighters' presence in Syria town . The EU move . The European Union agreed to target just the military component, a European diplomat told CNN. Critics of such an approach say designating part of an entity isn't effective or practical. But Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni's spokeswoman called the decision ""correct and just,"" adding that it ""puts an end to the wrong argument"" that Hezbollah's military activities are absolved by the group's political status. ""Even if Hezbollah is a political party, that does not whitewash and make legitimate their terrorist activities,"" the spokeswoman said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the move ""will have a significant impact on Hezbollah's ability to operate freely in Europe by enabling European law enforcement agencies to crack down on Hezbollah's fundraising, logistical activity and terrorist plotting."" ""As Hezbollah has deepened its support for the brutal Assad regime and worked to expand its global reach through increased involvement in international criminal schemes and terrorist plots around the world, a growing number of governments are recognizing Hezbollah as the dangerous and destabilizing terrorist organization that it is,"" Kerry said. The Syrian National Coalition, an affiliation of Syrian dissident groups, praised the EU's move -- but said the group could do more. ""We urge the European Union to extend their decision to include all of Hezbollah political officials who are part of the decision making"" of the party's military wing, the SNC said in a statement Tuesday. The SNC also called for ""the trial of all of Hezbollah's officials for their crimes of terrorism committed against our Syrian people and on our soil.""

The group has been accused of high-profile terror attacks over the years. Opinion: Time for G8 to make Hezbollah statement .

""Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah bombed the American and French Marine Barracks in Beirut, killing 241 Americans and 58 French service members with one of the largest explosive devices ever detonated during a terrorist attack."" The group also conducted a series of kidnappings, airplane hijackings and bombings in the 1980s and 1990s, Donilon wrote. He said the group has tried to portray itself as a political entity focused on social services and defending the country. ""But it is an illusion to speak of Hezbollah as a responsible political actor,"" Donilon said. ""Hezbollah remains a terrorist organization and a destabilizing force across the Middle East.""

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho might be feeling the pressure at Real Madrid, but the world's most famous soccer coach has taken time out to help a man from a tiny island nation who fully understands the importance of high-intensity decision-making. In one life, Lucio Antunes is an air traffic controller. In another, he is coach of the Cape Verde national football team, which this weekend will play at the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time. ""Mourinho is very friendly with the President of Cape Verde so when we qualified, the President spoke to him -- and Mourinho then invited me to Real Madrid for one week,"" Antunes told CNN's Human to Hero series. Mourinho is known as ""the Special One,"" a winner of major trophies at top clubs such as Real, Inter Milan, Chelsea and Porto in his native Portugal. He is one of the most sought-after coaches in world football despite his team's difficulties in Spain this season. Antunes is being hailed as Cape Verde's very own tactical magician, having in October guided the ""Blue Sharks"" through the final stages of the African qualification process for the first time since the country earned independence from Portugal in 1975. ""There is only one 'Special One,' "" laughs Antunes. ""He is fantastic, very intelligent and has a big heart -- it was a pleasure to meet him. ""I attended five training sessions and two matches, talked tactics with both Mourinho and some of the players, but the main thing I learned was his clarity in terms of his communication with his squad and technical staff."" The 46-year-old expects to return to the control tower at the international airport on the island of Sal after his stint as national coach ends, having taken time off his day job. He had to employ all his skills to take the islanders through a qualifying route that climaxed with a two-leg clash against Cameroon's Indomitable Lions -- four-time winners of the African trophy, and led by one of the world's leading players, Samuel Eto'o. ""In air traffic control, we have to think very fast and take decisions very quickly -- there is no time to wait,"" Antune says. ""There is a lot of pressure in air traffic control because there are a lot of planes. But the air traffic controller skills help me with coaching because I am also working with a lot of pressure in football as well."" He was appointed national team boss in July 2010, having worked as assistant coach for the previous year. He also led the nation's under-21 team to success at the 2009 Lusophony Games for Portuguese-speaking countries. ""It is far easier to be a football coach than an air traffic controller because you have enormous responsibility when there are so many planes flying around,"" Antune says. A fine all-round sportsman in his youth, he played for leading local football side Sporting Clube da Praia, competing in a league spread over nine of the 10 islands -- with a population of just half a million -- that make up Cape Verde's archipelago. But in 1990, a year when the islands' unemployment rate hit a high of 20%, Antunes -- who has also represented his country at basketball and table tennis -- leapt at the chance to train as an air traffic controller. Continuing his work while also playing football, Antunes went on to play for the national team, as did his father and all four his of brothers -- one of whom enjoyed a successful professional career in Portugal. One of the biggest challenges -- and ironies -- of his dual career is that the football federation's limited coffers mean the air traffic controller has been unable to fly to Europe to watch those expatriate players who have come on board for Cape Verde's continental mission. Over the years, the emigration from the islands has been so great that the number of Cape Verdeans and their descendants living overseas now exceeds the population of those at home, so Antunes is forced to use the very simplest of methods to follow his footballers' form. ""We have no money to fly to Europe -- as it's very expensive -- so this makes my job very hard,"" he says. ""So if players are playing for their European team, then we believe that they are good -- and then they come to the national team. Otherwise, we just watch on TV or on DVDs that we have been sent."" After achieving independence as a nation, Cape Verde had to wait 17 years before winning a competitive match. Team captain Fernando Maria Neves, known as Nando, sometimes has to pinch himself to realize the Sharks will be performing on Africa's biggest stage. The 34-year-old defender, who won his first cap back in 2002, has played club football in Tunisia, Qatar, Czech Republic and France, but this is a career highlight. ""To qualify my team is something special,"" Nando told CNN. ""It's a gift, first of all to even get to the Africa Cup of Nations, but then to open the tournament, I don't think there is something better than this."" Cape Verde will take on host nation South Africa in Saturday's first match in Johannesburg, and will also play Angola and 1976 champions Morocco in their Group A matches. Despite the team's lack of resources in the face of such experienced opposition, Nando says his team will be inspired by a sheer love of the game. ""Football in the Cape Verde is the same as religion. Everybody likes football in Cape Verde. Here it's first you must go to church, after that you must play football."" And Antunes is fully aware of his team's responsibility to meet the aspirations of the Cape Verde fans. ""We recognize the effort the country has made to support us, so we will do our best to repay our country,"" he said. Cape Verde's touchdown at the tournament should certainly be eased by having Antunes at their helm, no matter what turbulence the debutants may encounter on their maiden flight into the unknown.","An air traffic controller coaches Cape Verde's national soccer team .

"Washington (CNN) -- Lou Klein, 64, shot his first gun when he was 11. ""My dad bought me a single-shot .22 rifle at an Ace Hardware store in Chicago for $19.95,"" Klein remembered. ""I used to take that gun on the bus when I was 11 years old and go down to the shooting range. You couldn't do that now; you would have the FBI on you."" Those bus trips to the firing range started a lifelong passion for the Vietnam veteran and lifetime National Rifle Association member and recruiter who owns Lou's Sporting Goods in Bowie, Maryland. Why would someone own a military-style rifle? His shop sells everything from handguns to AR-15 semi-automatic rifles -- the military-style weapon used in several mass shootings, including the one last week in Newtown, Connecticut, that claimed 28 lives, including 20 children, their principal, the shooter's mother and gunman Adam Lanza, who took his own life. Klein's business is booming. And like many gun owners, he said he doesn't think limiting firearms will prevent another massacre. Parents defend right to keep guns in the home . ""Gun control is not the answer; it's about education and about responsibility,"" said Klein, who supports background checks, a waiting period, gun safety courses and mental health screening. Klein and millions of other small-town gun shop owners, hunters, housewives, former police officers and just plain everyday folks who proudly defend their right to bear arms have walked a tenuous line in the week following the Newtown shootings. They've tried to balance responding to the nation's grief and horror at a crime that ended so many young lives, while worrying about what gun rights advocates see as a threat of knee-jerk legislation that could tread on their constitutional rights. ""I believe the Second Amendment provided that the average American citizen should have the same rights to armaments as the military. But do I want my next-door nut job neighbor to have a bazooka? No,"" said Noel Flasterstein, a Florida attorney and gun rights advocate. Mike Zammitti, a young gun owner in New England, agrees. Zammitti, 22, lives in Boylston, Massachusetts, and has three guns -- a .22 rifle, a .25-caliber pocket pistol and a .22 Luger handgun. He also is a Class-A license holder, which allows him to ""conceal and carry"" his guns with him. But that doesn't mean that he does it. iReport: Was your gun banned? His weapons, he said, are for protection. He also said he doesn't need an assault rifle to protect himself in his home and doesn't think other people need them either. ""I absolutely think we should ban assault weapons,"" Zammitti said. ""There is no reason to have assault weapons on the market. ...Those are people killers; they are not meant to go hunting."" Still, even though he believes in some gun control laws, Zammitti said he fully supports the right to bear arms. The NRA, a powerful gun lobby with roughly 4.3 million members, spoke out on Friday, calling for armed guards at schools to protect the nation's children. The group signaled no willingness to consider any of the various proposals offered this week to change gun laws regarding access to assault weapons, universal background checks, limits on sales at gun shows, increased use of trigger locks or any other gun control regulation. Instead, the group pointed at media sensationalism, violent video games, gun-free zones, the failure to enforce gun laws already on the books, issues with the nation's mental health system and other societal problems. Policies banning guns at schools create a place that ""insane killers"" consider ""the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk,"" Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA said on Friday. LaPierre said U.S. society has left children ""utterly defenseless."" ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" he said. In the days following the school shootings, individual NRA members took to Twitter, Facebook, the airwaves and the comment sections of websites such as CNN.com to explain their position. It usually went along these lines: They are not all gun-toting villains. They are, they proudly proclaim, patriots. ""Guns are what's kept this country free, and it's what's keeping our country free,"" Klein said, pointing to the militias in the Revolutionary War that fought against the British. NRA breaks silence after shootings . The NRA plans to speak out Friday and ""is prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again."" Not everyone is buying the ""meaningful contributions,"" however. ""I think the statement they just released is a bunch of garbage; they just wanted to get ahead of the issue,"" Zammitti said. ""If you look at their history, they are hard-core 'guns don't kill people, people kill people.' ""As soon as little kids get hurt, they try to get ahead of the picture saying, 'We're going to do something.' "" This week, President Barack Obama tapped Vice President Joe Biden to help lead a White House effort to craft proposals aimed at preventing another tragedy such as the Newtown shootings. The recommendations are due sometime in January. That same month, several lawmakers have promised to introduce or reintroduce gun control legislation, ranging from a reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons to banning the sale of high-capacity magazines. The NRA, which is regrouping in anticipation of that massive legislative push, will make its presence felt through congressional testimony and wielding the type of political sway the pro-gun lobby has carefully amassed over dozens of election cycles, experts said. ""I want to see legislators make correct appraisals, not emotional responses,"" said Richard Feldman, who was regional political director for the NRA during its rise to power in the 1980s and is president of a gun rights group called the Independent Firearm Owners Association. The list: Despite emotions, little happens legislatively after mass shootings . Across the rest of the nation, attitudes about guns appear to be changing. A CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday indicates that a slight majority now favor major restrictions on owning guns or an outright ban on gun ownership by ordinary citizens and more than six in 10 favor a ban on semi-automatic assault rifles. The number of Americans who favor major restrictions or an outright ban has typically hovered just under the 50% mark in recent years; now that number is 52%. That's a rise in 5 percentage points from a CNN survey conducted in August following the mass shootings at a movie theater in suburban Denver that left 12 dead and shootings at a Sikh temple in suburban Milwaukee, where six people were killed. The 5-point rise is within the poll's sampling error. Forty-three percent said the elementary school shootings in Connecticut make them more likely to support gun control laws, a 15-point increase from January 2011 following the Arizona gun rampage that wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Half of those questioned said the school shootings have not changed their opinions on gun control, down 19 points from January 2011. But that's just roughly half of the country. The other half is made up of the kind of people who have flooded Klein's suburban Washington shop after the Newtown shootings. People who, like Klein, believe that if Sandy Hook Elementary School teachers were armed, they would have been able to kill the shooter before he killed all those children. Lanza's guns: What we know so far . ""Last night I didn't get out until 10,"" Klein said through a mouthful of a rushed lunch. He's almost sold out of AR-15s, he said. He just sold two Wednesday morning to a man who wanted them for his sons. Since the gun sales are not reported, trends in gun sales are typically tracked by the number of background checks the FBI conducts each year. In 2011 -- a record year -- the FBI conducted 16,454,951 background checks. In 2012, not counting the month of December, the FBI has already conducted 16,808,538. This includes the run on guns after Obama's re-election but does not include the recent sprint to buy up weapons after the Newtown shootings. And Klein's store's sales are not an anomaly; gun stores across the country are reporting record sales in the week following the Newtown shootings. Klein said gun owners are worried they won't be able to purchase semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 in the future, so they are buying them up now. Those concerns are rooted in the fear that tampering with Second Amendment rights could lead to a slippery slope of infringing on other constitutional rights, gun policy experts said. ""With respect to assault rifles, I have a constitutional right to have one. ... That's what our founding father and mothers recognized,"" said Feldman of the Independent Firearm Owners Association. ""It's what it protects us from -- the possibility of a tyrannical government. ""I don't think we're going to have a tyrannical government, and I don't think Obama (is going to bring about a) tyrannical government. If we take away the Second Amendment, maybe it would.""

"(CNN)  -- Thor Hushovd won a brutal third stage of the Tour de France which saw Fabian Cancellara reclaim the leader's yellow jersey and the hopes of a number of race favorites, including Lance Armstrong, dented. The 213 kilometers from Wanze to Arenberg contained seven stretches of cobblestones, which caused the peloton to split into small groups after a series of crashes and punctures. Hushovd and Paris-Roubaix winner Cancellara were in a six-strong group which forged ahead to gain valuable time on their rivals. Neither man is a serious contender to win the Tour de France, but the group contained two men who are, Cancellara's Saxo Bank teammate Andy Schleck and world champion Cadel Evans of Australia. Hushovd took the sprint for the stage honors from Britain's Geraint Thomas, the Sky rider moving up to second overall for his efforts, with all six awarded the same time. Behind them, Sky's Bradley Wiggins, fourth overall last year, improved his chances by finishing in the second group, 53 seconds down, with Russian Denis Menchov, a former winner of the Giro D'Italia and Tour of Spain. Race favorite and defending champion Alberto Contador came in a further 20 seconds down after puncturing in the run in to the finish. But seven-time Tour winner Armstrong lost valuable ground on his main rivals after a puncture held up  the Radio Shack team leader as he conceded two minutes and eight seconds to the leading group. He has slipped to 18th in the overall standings, two minutes 30 seconds behind Cancellara. Armstrong admitted it had been a ""very frustrating"" day for his team and that for all his preparations on the cobbles it had proved daunting. ""When we hit the key sections -- I can't lie, I was on the limit. So it was a lot different to training,"" he told AFP. And for Schleck's brother and Saxo teammate Frank, the race is over after a heavy crash on the cobbles. France's Sylvain Chavanel, who held the yellow jersey after winning the second stage, also punctured twice and lost too much time to remain in the lead. The stage victory for Cervelo's Hushovd strengthens his grip on the points leader's green jersey with arch-rival Mark Cavendish of HTC-Columbia out of the placings. Like Cancellara, Hushovd is a specialist in the Paris-Roubaix one-day classic which also features the feared pave cobblestones which caused such havoc to the Tour riders.","Norway's Thor Hushovd of Cervelo team wins third stage of the Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- Even at the age of 41 Lance Armstrong's thirst for competition remains undimmed. But the disgraced doper's quest to take part in a swimming event in Texas has been sunk before he's even hit the water. Armstrong was banned from cycling for life by the United States Anti-Doping Agency after they accused him of running the ""most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program"" the sport had ever seen. He refused to cooperate with USADA's investigation and was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles, later admitting taking performance enhancing drugs in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. Armstrong had hoped to compete at the Masters South Central Zone Swimming Championships in his home town of Austin this weekend, thinking it was not subject to USA or World Anti-Doping Agency codes. But after news of his entry in the 500, 1,000 and 1,650-yard freestyle events, swimming's governing body FINA stepped in to object to his participation. Lance Armstrong's demise: How an all-American hero fell to earth . Now Armstrong's camp say he won't take to the pool. Rob Butcher, executive director of U.S. Masters Swimming, who are staging the event, told CNN: ""The word back is that he is not eligible to participate in our competition because FINA follows the WADA code -- the World Anti-Doping Authority code. ""And, as such, we are bound -- through a couple layers of separation down -- to our events as well. ""So the takeaway is: while he has entered and you'll see him on a heat sheet, he is not eligible to participate in that event. Or any other U.S.M.S competition."" Two Lance Armstrong moves in the works . Butcher said upon informing Armstrong's camp on Thursday morning, he will now withdraw from the event. Butcher added: ""After giving them this news, his people, not talking to him directly but his management team, said, 'You know what: we don't want to cause harm to your organization. We're not trying to create a sideshow circus for you guys. He's just going to withdraw or not show up for the event.'"" In a statement issued Thursday, U.S. Masters Swimming clarified its stance on the matter further. ""Lance Armstrong is not eligible to race in U.S. Masters Swimming competitions,"" it read. ""The former competitive cyclist has been a member of U.S. Masters Swimming for several years. The spirit and purpose of USMS is to encourage adults to swim. ""USMS is affiliated with FINA (Federation Internationale de Natacion) through United States Aquatic Sports. ""When we became aware that Mr. Armstrong entered the 2013 South Central Zone Championship in Austin, Texas, April 5-7, a local event sanctioned by USMS, we contacted United States Aquatic Sports and FINA to clarify our responsibilities in this case. The event in question is conducted in a 25-yard pool, a non-Olympic course not contested on the international stage. ""After discussion with United States Aquatic Sports and FINA, it was agreed that although Mr. Armstrong is eligible for membership in U.S. Masters Swimming, he is not currently eligible to compete in sanctioned swimming competitions, regardless of the type of course. ""The World Anti-Doping Agency has banned Mr. Armstrong from competition. FINA accepts the WADA Code and USMS, as a member of United States Aquatic Sports, recognizes and respects adjudications under the Code."" Armstrong had posted on his Twitter account last month that he was in swimming training but he will now have to wait to make his competitive debut in the pool. A statement posted on FINA's website confirmed the competition was under the jurisdiction of U.S Masters Swimming and quoted FINA rule DC 15.1. It reads: ""The Testing, therapeutic use exemptions and hearing results or other final adjudications of any Signatory to the Code which are consistent with the Code and are within the Signatory's authority, shall be recognized and respected by FINA and its Member Federations."" As a result they added: ""FINA wrote a letter to the U.S. Masters Swimming (with copy to US Aquatic Sports and USA Swimming) requesting not to accept the entry of Mr. Lance Armstrong in the above mentioned competition.""

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A court handed down a 20-year sentence Thursday for an Indonesian man convicted of helping assemble the bombs that killed more than 200 people in Bali in 2002. The Jakarta court found Umar Patek, 45, guilty of taking part in premeditated murder and conspiracy to smuggle explosives and firearms for use in terror attacks. Patek had faced a maximum penalty of death, and the courtroom was packed for the verdict delivered by a panel of five judges. He stared at the floor and showed no emotion as the verdict was read. He shook the judges' hands and hugged his lawyer before he was escorted to a car waiting in the basement of the courthouse for transportation to a jail on the outskirts of the city. Patek, who has expressed remorse for his actions, will consider appealing to a higher court, said his lawyer Asludin Hatjani. Hatjani said he was ""very disappointed"" by the verdict. ""Umar Patek did what he was accused for because he was under pressure from his seniors, and he failed to convince them to prevent the attacks, although he already tried hard to do so,"" Hatjani said. Patek was one of Indonesia's most wanted terrorists, with a $1 million bounty on his head from the U.S. government's Rewards for Justice program. Three of the masterminds of the Bali bombings -- Imam Samudra, Amrozi bin Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron -- were executed in 2008. Patek was the last of the accused to stand trial in Indonesia. The October 12, 2002, blasts tore apart two nightclubs in Kuta, a town popular with tourists on the Indonesian island of Bali. At the time, the country's police chief called the attack ""the worst act of terrorism in the country's history."" Among the dead were 88 Australians and seven Americans. Patek eluded investigators looking into the 2002 attacks for many years until his capture in January 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the same village where U.S. Navy SEALs shot and killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden several months later. Patek was extradited to Indonesia in August. He faced six charges, including premeditated murder, for his part in the Bali bombings, as well as helping build bombs used in a series of attacks on Christmas Eve in 2000. He also was accused of smuggling firearms from the Philippines to Indonesia and planning a militant camp in Aceh in 2010. Patek denied all the charges but admitted helping mix a relatively small amount of the total quantity of explosives used in the Bali attack. The first bomb detonated in the busy Paddy's Bar on Jelan Legian just after 11 p.m., according to a report from the Australian Federal Police. Seconds later, as survivors fled the first blast, a second larger bomb hidden in a van exploded outside the crowded Sari Club. A third bomb went off later near the U.S. Consulate in Renon, a suburb of Denpasar, the Australian police said. Hundreds were reported missing in the confusion that followed the blasts. Many of those killed were foreign vacationers, although some residents were also caught in the attack. According to testimony given May 31 during his trial, Patek said that when he arrived in Bali, 950 kilograms of explosives had been combined, and he reluctantly agreed to mix the remainder. ""When I saw Sawada, aka Sarjiyo, looking exhausted and nervous, finally I agreed to helped him and both of us mixed the explosive ingredients that were less then 50 kg. I did it lazily because it didn't come from my soul and it was contrary to my conscience,"" he said, according to an English translation of his testimony. Sarjiyo was sentenced to life in prison in 2004 for his role in the attacks. During his trial, Patek asked for forgiveness for the bombings, which he said he ""even suggested canceling."" After the attacks, he said, he felt ""remorse and regret."" ""I said that it was my last involvement on that kind of action in Indonesia. Please know that whether I came to Bali or not, the Bali bomb would still have happen(ed),"" he said. Patek's lawyer argued that his client was not directly involved in the planning of the bombings. He doesn't deny helping assemble the bombs but was unaware how they would ultimately be used, his lawyer, Hatjani, said during Patek's trial, which started in February. Hatjani slammed the prosecution's case as ""vague and far from the truth"" and argued that an anti-terrorism law introduced in Indonesia in 2003 could not be used retroactively for the 2002 attacks. Prosecutors have used several articles under the penal code, the emergency rule law and the 2003 anti-terrorism law to charge Patek. Patek is one of the last figures associated with a splinter group of Jemaah Islamiyah, an al Qaeda-linked terror group behind the Bali bombings and other attacks in Indonesia. Many in that group, like Patek, trained and fought in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the early 1990s and were deeply influenced by bin Laden's teachings. Patek fled to Mindanao in the southern Philippines with several other Indonesian militants. One of them was Dulmatin, another former Jemaah Islamiyah member, who returned to Indonesia and helped set up a military-style training camp in province of Aceh. He was killed in a police raid just outside Jakarta in October 2010. Patek returned to Indonesia from the Philippines in 2009. Prosecutors allege that he was involved in preparing firearms for the Aceh training camp, a charge the defense disputes. ""Patek was only in transit in Indonesia and was not involved in training of firearms,"" Hatjani said. ""He was there to attend a wedding and he didn't even see the firearms."" Indonesian authorities have tried and convicted hundreds of terrorists since the 2002 Bali bombings. The arrests of senior militants with combat experience have weakened the terror network and its ability to launch major attacks. Radical Indonesian cleric sentenced to 15 years in prison . According to recent reports by the International Crisis Group, the terror threat in the country remains but has shifted to attacks on Indonesian authorities, with smaller groups or radicalized individuals targeting the police.

"(CNN) -- The White House confirms that Syria has crossed a ""red line"" by using chemical weapons in its war with rebel forces, prompting the United States to boost the ""scale and scope"" of its support for the opposition. The determination, disputed by Syria, comes as forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have made gains in the past few weeks. Also, the militant group Hezbollah has become more active in the fighting on behalf of the regime. The opposition has warned it could face crippling losses without immediate support. What's next? The Obama administration was resisting calls to arm the rebels, worried in part about the influence of radical groups and that weaponry might wind up in the wrong hands. But it has now changed course. It is going to provide military support including small arms, ammunition and potentially anti-tank weapons to the rebels, according to two officials familiar with the matter. The weapons will be provided by the CIA, the officials said. The White House said earlier said no decision had been made on whether to impose a ""no-fly"" zone. That is something rebels have said is needed to halt air attacks on their strongholds. The United States has also ruled out sending troops, or putting ""boots on the ground"" in Syria. What's been the U.S. response? The Obama administration had previously authorized non-lethal assistance, including communications equipment, medical supplies and food. The first direct U.S. support arrived in March. Obama signed off on a new package of non-lethal aid April. That assistance was expected to include body armor, night-vision goggles and other military equipment. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also ordered the deployment of up to 200 additional U.S. troops to Jordan in April as the violence spreads from adjacent Syria. Those forces included communications and intelligence specialists aimed at assisting the Jordanians and ""be ready for military action"" if Obama were to order it, a Defense Department official said. A number of U.S. special forces troops have been in Jordan for the past year assisting that nation's the Jordanians. Jordan is a crucial U.S. ally in the Middle East and has experienced an influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees from the fighting in Syria. The United States is also deploying a Patriot anti-missile battery and F-16 aircraft to Jordan as part of military exercises taking place this month. It is not clear whether any of those assets will remain in Jordan once the regional exercises are complete. The Syrians possess Scud missiles. The United States also has deployed Patriot missiles to Turkey, which also borders Syria. Officials say those missiles are defensive in nature. Syria employs SCUD rockets. Would NATO join the U.S.? Questions still remain about whether NATO would assist the U.S. militarily, similar to its help in enforcing a ""no-fly"" zone over Libya during that country's period of civil unrest. In the past, NATO has flatly ruled out military intervention and the United States has no plans to put boots on the ground. But on Friday, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the international community had made clear that any use of chemical weapons is ""completely unacceptable and a clear breach of international law."" Speaking in Brussels, he said he welcomed ""the clear U.S. statement"" on Syria's alleged chemical weapons use and that it was a matter of great concern. ""As for NATO, the Patriot deployment will ensure effective protection for Turkey against any missile attack, whether the missiles carry chemical weapons or not,"" he said. Additional military options? Ã¢â¬Â¢ Targeting Syria's air defenses with Patriot missile batteries in Turkey as part of a ""no-fly"" response, NATO has said. But Turkey only allowed the missiles there for defensive purposes and NATO nations would have to agree before they could be used otherwise. Ã¢â¬Â¢ Airstrikes: The U.S. military has enough air power in the region to take action against Syria, according to officials. That includes fighter jets and bombers spread out across air bases in the Middle East and nearby aircraft carriers. The Navy also has warships equipped with Tomahawk missiles, which could be used to hit chemical weapons supplies. But such strikes pose a danger of releasing chemical agents into the air around civilian populations in Syria, U.S. officials told CNN in March. Complicating military involvement . What complicates any U.S. military support for the opposition is that many of the rebel fighters are militants with pro-al Qaeda sympathies, the same stripe of militants America has battled in Iraq and Afghanistan. In April, Hagel cautioned lawmakers on the Senate Armed Services Committee about the difficulties surrounding any direct U.S. military action in Syria. ""It could embroil the United States in a significant, lengthy and uncertain military commitment,"" he said. He called military intervention ""an option but an option of last resort."" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said the United States could send troops to Syria if al-Assad's government fell, if needed, to secure chemical weapons.

"(CNN) -- After President Barack Obama made his tepid endorsement of same-sex marriage last week, the pundits, from Fox News all the way to The New York Times, quickly pivoted from asking why to whether it will hurt him politically. But there is a more interesting question: How, in less than a decade, did America go from being a country in which some states punished gay sex with criminal penalties to one in which the highest elected official in the land now champions the right of same-sex couples to marry? The answer can be found in the interaction between supporters of marriage equality and the Christian conservative movement over the past few decades. As late as the 1980s, same-sex marriage was on virtually no one's radar screen. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court found the idea of a legal right of same-sex couples to marry so outlandish that it dismissed a Minnesota case presenting the issue without bothering to write an opinion. At the time, the gay rights movement was understandably focused on combating private violence and public discrimination. No single factor explains the movement's shift to the goal of marriage equality, but much of the credit must go to the very religious conservatives who assiduously campaigned against same-sex marriage, thus forcing the issue onto the front burner of American politics. It happened like this: In 1993, in the case of Baehr v. Lewin, the Hawaii Supreme Court decided that the state's prohibition on same-sex marriage was discriminatory. In 1998, Hawaii's voters passed a referendum giving the legislature the right to declare same-sex marriage illegal, but in the meantime, social conservatives had taken the issue to the national stage, where it promised to pay handsome dividends. Same-sex marriage was still so unpopular that in 1996, tremulous Democrats joined Republicans in overwhelmingly passing the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, signed by President Bill Clinton. That act defined marriage at the federal level to mean only heterosexual marriage and authorized states to deny recognition to same-sex marriages performed in other states -- even though, at the time, no state had authorized the practice. DOMA was thus a preemptive strike by the opponents of marriage equality. But the act helped to call into being the very marriage equality movement it aimed to combat. Encouraged by their surprising, if temporary, success in Hawaii, and outraged by the blatantly homophobic arguments that had been made in favor of DOMA, the lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender movement reluctantly began to turn its energy and resources toward the goal of marriage equality. This was a fundamental shift, not made without controversy within the movement, where many worried that calling for marriage equality would unleash the fury of the Christian Right. Whereas many activists had given higher priority to such issues as employment discrimination, HIV/AIDS education and protection against hate crimes, the denial of marriage equality now came to be seen as a broad symbol of second-class citizenship for LGBT Americans. Obama's declaration of his support for marriage equality the day after North Carolina residents banned both same-sex marriage and civil unions in a referendum is only the latest encapsulation of the dialectical interaction of movement and countermovement: Each effort to limit marriage equality has led to a countereffort on behalf of equal rights. As the first African-American president, Obama could not be seen to stand on the wrong side of the most prominent civil rights struggle of our time. Americans increasingly see laws that deny a person the right to marry someone of the same sex as reminiscent of the ugly laws that once forbade interracial marriage. The rest is, if not yet history, at least a well-known story. Although same-sex marriage remains illegal in most of the United States, and the issue may yet play to Mitt Romney's advantage in November, time is on the side of equality. Those of us who favor same-sex marriage are rightly grateful to Obama for having come off the fence. But we should also thank religious conservatives for having put the president on the fence in the first place. Were it not for their opposition to same-sex marriage, it might have taken much longer for Americans to take up the cause. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael C. Dorf and Sidney Tarrow.","Michael Dorf and Sidney Tarrow: How did gay marriage issue move to forefront so quickly?

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- I wonder if black people would be still in the fields picking cotton today if the 13th Amendment -- the one abolishing slavery -- was placed on the ballot back in 1865. I wonder if Hillary Clinton would be at home baking cookies instead of serving as secretary of state if women's suffrage was put to a vote back in 1919. In other words, I wonder just how far along we would be as a society if the oppressive majority held all of the legislative and judicial power over the oppressed minority, essentially yanking the teeth out of Congress and the Supreme Court. I'm sure you've heard a lot about the gay agenda, but may not know what's in it. Here's what you do: Download a copy of the United States Constitution, read it. Everything the LGBT community wants is in there. Sounds like an oversimplification? It's not. TED.com: What you don't know about marriage . There's not a single issue regarding the LGBT community that has been covered in the media or deliberated in courts that is counter to the articles of the Constitution. On the other hand, the fact that in 29 states it is legal to fire someone just because they're gay flies in the face of the 14th amendment, particularly the passage that says ""No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States."" That may not be consistent with one's religion, and that's fine. But the Bible and the Constitution are not the same thing. I can't think of a single major civil rights victory that came by way of a general election and so I am not surprised that all 32 states that have voted on marriage equality, voted against marriage equality. It is human nature to resist change, especially change that may bring significant inconvenience to the vast majority of the people, those who are enjoying the spoils of the status quo. ""If it's not broke, don't fix it,"" was never said by the community that was demanding their rights. TED.com: Will our kids be a different species? It was always the mantra of those who liked their slaves; who liked their women barefoot and pregnant; who felt uncomfortable working next to someone with cerebral palsy; who get squeamish at the thought of two men falling in love. We elect members of Congress to lead us, not appease us. This is why our history has so many civil rights victories come by way of Congress or the courts and so few if any civil rights victories by election. When it gets right down to it, culturally we're like children who have to be forced to eat our vegetables. We like the Constitution when it can be used to endorse life the way we think it ought to be and we ignore it, or vote against it when the Bill of Rights or the various amendments challenge our world view or force us to make accommodations -- however big or small -- for others. This week election officials in the state of Washington announced that a referendum seeking to nullify the recently passed law legalizing same-sex marriage has qualified for the November ballot. Washington joins Maryland, Maine and Minnesota as the next round of states that will put the civil rights of some of their citizens to a vote. Early polls indicate that at least one of them will indeed vote in favor of marriage equality, which is a victory for the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. Though it's a bit of a shame that the Constitution needs such victories and that history has taught us nothing.

"(CNN) -- Three years ago, when Scott Hamilton moved from New York to Oklahoma for work, his marriage, and all the rights that went with it, dissolved in the transition. That's because Oklahoma -- a deeply conservative place -- is one of 38 states that bans marriages between same-sex couples. To make the move, Hamilton, 52, and his husband, Wayne Johnson, 59, who got married in Connecticut in 2009 and have been together since 1991, had to come to grips with the fact their relationship would no longer matter under the eyes of the law. They had to redo their wills and create new trusts to ensure their assets would be passed smoothly if one of them were to die. If they were put into long-term care in Oklahoma, he said, the men would have to occupy separate rooms. They must file their taxes separately. And it's almost impossible for them to use the word ""husband"" without comment. ""Well, who are you? Are you his driver?"" a nurse recently asked Hamilton when he was pushing Johnson through a hospital in a wheelchair, as he related it to me. ""No, I'm his husband."" ""Oh, good God,"" she said, dismissively. Oh-good-God is right. How does it make sense that a couple's love for each other would be recognized by one state and mocked in another? For lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, the United States has turned into a complicated mess of 50 Americas -- most of which discriminate against them. Opinion: America is at a crossroads on gay rights . For what other group -- with the possible exception of pregnant women seeking abortions -- are state borders so important? If you're Jewish or tall or Christian or black or fat or old or poor or sad ... your fundamental rights as a human don't change if you drive from the panhandle of Idaho, where same-sex marriage is banned, into Washington state, where it's legal, or from the yellow plains of West Texas, where employees can be fired because of their sexual orientation, to New Mexico, where LGBT workers are protected from institutionalized bigotry. It makes sense speed limits and marijuana laws would differ. But not basic rights to dignity and inclusion. America deals with a host of issues that affect LGBT people -- not just same-sex marriage -- in this sloppy, checkerboard fashion. You can explore some of them with CNN's handy new ""LGBT rights calculator."" The point, to me, is that this patchwork of laws makes no coherent sense. Some states allow same-sex couples to adopt. Others, such as Mississippi, ban it. That leaves couples such as Sara and L.B. Bell -- whom I met on a recent trip to Mississippi, a state that, according to my calculations, ties for having the fewest protections for LGBT people -- to fear that if and when they have a child, it may be difficult for both to maintain custody. Some states protect LGBT tenants from being evicted because of who they are. Others, such as Louisiana and Montana, don't seem to think that matters. Some states let teachers talk about homosexuality in schools -- a healthy step toward ensuring future generations continue to be more accepting of all people. Others, such as Alabama, require teachers to mention ""in a factual manner and from a public health perspective, that homosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public and that homosexual conduct is a criminal offense under the laws of the state."" Never mind that homosexuality is not a crime, as the U.S. Supreme Court held in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003. And that about half the nation is cool with same-sex marriage these days, a percentage that only will grow with time. Each state is so different we might as well put up signs on the borders. Welcome to Oklahoma ... Oh, you're gay??? Please turn around. We can fire you for that here. ... At least then the statutory inequalities would be visible. It seems LGBT people have already taken notice. Opinion: Gay marriage, then group marriage? A recent Gallup survey of 206,186 people found states with more accepting laws and cultures tend to have higher percentages of openly LGBT residents. Washington, D.C., for example, which allows same-sex marriage, has a 10% LGBT population. North Dakota, where laws and the culture (""Fargo"" may have something to do with it, too) are less favorable, is only 1.7% openly LGBT. That may be because LGBT people in conservative states are less likely to be open about who they are, particularly with a pollster, Gary Gates and Frank Newport write in an explanation of the survey on Gallup's website. ""It is also possible that LGBT adults make conscious choices to reside in certain states rather than others,"" they said, ""but this possibility is difficult to assess and seems less likely."" Plenty of gay people, Hamilton included, hope the Supreme Court, which is hearing two cases related to same-sex marriage next week, soon will expand rights for same-gender couples in this country. But even in a favorable scenario -- if California's same-sex marriage ban is invalidated, and if the federal government starts recognizing same-sex marriages -- LGBT people still will be subject to vastly different laws depending on where they live and work. Folks like Hamilton, who moved from New York to Oklahoma, might as well be going from Alaska to Russia. States, of course, shouldn't give up their right to self-governance. But when it comes to civil rights issues, they have an awful history of clinging to laws long past their expiration dates. In 1967, 16 states banned interracial marriage. The Supreme Court overturned that. Mississippi and others fought against racial integration in schools. But level heads, and courts, prevailed. I'm no legal scholar, and I'm not sure exactly what the best strategy would be for ensuring gay people are seen as equal under the law in all states. But I do know that it's far too complicated right now. Hamilton, the man who lived in New York, decided to move to Oklahoma, where he had grown up, to take a job as executive director of the Cimarron Alliance, a statewide LGBT rights group. The nonprofit asked him, he said, if he wanted a corner office in the new community center the group is unveiling this month. It has nice big windows, the group told him. Hamilton turned it down. He worries he would be targeted. Listen: Voices from the Southern closet . ""We are seeing an uptick in anti-LGBT violence here,"" he told me on the phone. (In one instance, last year, a Tulsa man said he was beaten up because he's gay). ""And I think that's part of the change process. When people feel like they're really losing their grip or their hold, oftentimes violence results."" If, heaven forbid, Hamilton were to be victimized because of his sexual orientation and because he's a leader of an LGBT rights group, Oklahoma's state laws wouldn't treat it as a hate crime. On the federal level, as of 2009, LGBT people are explicitly protected. Kansas, a two-hour drive to the north, lists lesbian and gay people as specifically protected from hate crimes, but does not extend rights to transgender people. Sounds fair, right? Either we live in a nation that supports LGBT equality or we don't. But we can't have it 50 ways. The views expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","John Sutter: LGBT rights break the country into 50 parts .

"(CNN) -- The advance buildup has all been about Lance Armstrong as he prepares to enter the church of Oprah and seek absolution for his sins. But this much-anticipated television moment is as much a test for Oprah Winfrey as for the disgraced former cycling champion. For while Armstrong is no longer the hero of old, Oprah isn't the same old Oprah, either. The interview, to be conducted Monday, won't take place on Oprah's old blockbuster show, but on her little-watched cable channel. It's part of a 90-minute special airing Thursday that could help Winfrey reclaim a bit of the limelight that faded when she gave up her throne as America's talk show queen to build her cable brand. It's hardly surprising that Armstrong would choose the Oprah route for dropping his decade of denials about doping. (I instantly knew that what was he would do. You don't go on Oprah after being stripped of your championships and repeat the same old excuses. USA Today reports that Armstrong will admit to using banned substances after his camp had floated the idea in a leak to The New York Times.) Watch: Does Oprah have the cultural clout to revive Lance Armstrong's career? After all, she has been the go-to gal for famous folks in trouble. Whitney Houston talked about drug use with Oprah. Track star Marion Jones talked with Oprah about going to prison for lying about using banned substances. Even author James Frey, who touted on Oprah an addiction memoir that turned out to have significant fabrications, went back on the show to submit to her castigation. When Oprah was syndicated on ABC stations, her program was appointment viewing. How many people even know where the Oprah Winfrey Network is on their cable system? Winfrey has acknowledged that she's had a rough go in the cable world, which has included management turmoil, layoffs and the canceling of Rosie O'Donnell's show. ""I certainly did not expect the velocity of schadenfreude -- meaning people sort of lying in wait for you to fail, or make a mistake,"" she has said. Watch: Was Joe and Mika's fight on MSNBC riveting or revolting? What made Oprah a powerful cultural force, beyond her ratings and big-name interviews and ability to sell books, was her prowess at image rehab. If Oprah forgave you, could America be far behind? So the stakes in the Armstrong encounter are considerable for her as well. But Armstrong is no ordinary celebrity who did something naughty that can be erased with a few well-timed tears. The man became an icon after battling back from cancer to reclaim his place as the world's best bike racer. But then came the allegations from former teammates and others that Armstrong cheated, that he used performance-enhancing substances banned by racing authorities. Watch: Was New York Times right in depicting Obama White House as a boys' club? Armstrong denied these charges again and again. He lied to my colleague Buzz Bissinger, who produced a Newsweek cover story titled ""I Still Believe in Lance Armstrong."" And he lied to me in two interviews. He was fervent and passionate, not just in saying he had never used banned substances but in accusing U.S. anti-doping officials of conducting a ""personal vendetta"" against him. That was then; this week is Oprah. Armstrong's motivation is obvious. His career is in ruins. The Livestrong cancer charity he founded is struggling. He faces possible litigation. He wants to compete again and needs somehow to put this phase of his career behind him. But that is not so easy for athletes who cheat, as we were reminded by last week's vote to exclude Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa and Roger Clemens from baseball's Hall of Fame, based almost exclusively on alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs. Watch: Why are media swooning over Time cover star Chris Christie? They never apologized; perhaps Armstrong intends to do so. But if millions of people aren't watching him on Oprah -- if most of the country just sees a 20-second clip later -- does it have the same effect? Oprah might forgive Armstrong, clearing the way for others to do the same. Or she might scold him, fostering a sense that he was publicly shamed for his conduct. Either way, Oprah Winfrey will, for the first time in a long while, occupy center stage once again. For Lance Armstrong, though, the spotlight might prove less flattering.

"Washington (CNN) -- If you want to understand the historical magnitude of President Obama's re-election victory, start with this fact: He lost the white vote by 20 points. In 1988, Mike Dukakis lost white voters by 19 points. He was crushed in a 40-state landslide. Obama's victory is a testament to a changing America. The president won a second term in the face of a weak economy by reassembling the bulk of his 2008 coalition: Hispanics, African-Americans, younger voters and single women. Mitt Romney's support was older, whiter, and more Protestant than the president's -- a faded shadow of a time gone by. It also bore a striking resemblance to Sen. John McCain's coalition four years ago. Re-election puts Obama to the test . A few specifics: Obama won Latino voters by nearly 40 points -- a slightly larger margin than his total over McCain four years ago -- while the Latino share of the total vote crept up from 9% to 10%. Romney's tough talk on illegal immigration and self-deportation may have helped him win the GOP nomination, but it cost him in the fall. See data on who voted for whom . Black voters were 13% of the total electorate, the same share as in 2008 but a bump up from typical modern turnout levels. The first black president's share of the black vote actually dropped a couple of points, but was still far north of 90%. Talk of black alienation because of resistance on issues like same-sex marriage was overblown. Voters age 18 to 29 comprised a slightly larger share of the electorate than in 2008, an outcome contrary to the media narrative of a disenchanted youth alienated from the political process. Obama's share of the young vote declined a bit, but he still won it well in excess of 20 points. What we learned from the election . In the final days before the election, hopeful Republicans played up polls showing Romney running away with the independent vote. It didn't pan out. Romney won independents by 4% -- a healthy 12-point swing for the GOP compared to 2008 -- but it wasn't nearly enough to save the former Massachusetts governor. Republicans also hoped a 7-point Democratic Party ID turnout edge over the GOP in 2008 would shrivel this time around. It didn't. Democrats maintained a 6-point edge on Tuesday. In the critical Rust Belt state of Ohio, Obama may have been saved by the 2009 auto industry bailout. Ohio voters approved of the bailout by a 23-point margin, and bailout supporters in the Buckeye State backed the president over Romney by about 50 points. Obama makes history again . Perhaps in a related vein, Obama won 42% of working class whites in Ohio, compared to 36% of working class whites nationwide -- a critical difference in the tightly contested state. Where does the GOP go from here? The Republican brand remains extremely strong among southern whites and religious voters in particular. Conservative leaders can find solace both in their tightening grip on the House of Representatives and a promising political bench featuring rising stars like Wisconsin rep. Paul Ryan, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, to name just a few. But even the most cursory glance at the results of the past two presidential elections makes it clear that the Republican Party is now facing a growing demographic problem. It risks permanently losing a new generation of Americans -- a generation central to Obama's twin White House victories. How Republicans address this problem will play a huge role in determining the shape of American politics long after Obama himself has exited the political stage. Analysis: Obama won with a better ground game .","Obama's victory is a testament to a changing America .
Romney's coalition bore a striking resemblance to John McCain's four years ago .

"(CNN) -- Lance Armstrong, who for years vehemently denied cheating while winning a record seven Tours de France, told Oprah Winfrey that he used performance-enhancing drugs to advance his cycling career, according to media reports. ABC News, the New York Times and USA Today, citing unnamed sources, reported Monday night that the former cyclist finally admitted to using steroids during an interview he and Winfrey taped Monday night in Armstrong's hometown of Austin, Texas. Armstrong was emotional at times during the session, a source, who was familiar with the interview, told CNN. The person refused to discuss the specifics of what Armstrong said, including whether he confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs as ABC and USA Today reported. Armstrong also might pay back part of the money he received from the U.S. Postal Service, which sponsored the cyclist and his team while he was winning six of his Tours de France, the source said. The source said Armstrong was in negotiations to repay some of the money. ESPN reported in 2011 that the agency -- which is not taxpayer funded -- paid more that $31 million to sponsor the team during the final four years of its agreement. A spokeswoman for the postal service said: ""We are not in a position now to discuss any of the legal issues associated with these developments and the prior relationship between the U.S. Postal Service and Mr. Armstrong, but we will do so at an appropriate time."" Armstrong won the Tour de France a record seven straight years, beginning in 1999. The postal service sponsored the team from 1996 to 2004. Tim Herman, one of Armstrong's lawyers, had no comment about the interview. Winfrey tweeted after the interview: ""Just wrapped with @lancearmstrong More than 2 1/2 hours . He came READY!"" The interview will be edited down to 90 minutes, Winfrey has said. ""We are not confirming any specific details regarding the interview at this time,"" a spokesperson for OWN said Monday night. The disgraced cycling legend earlier apologized to the staff of the cancer charity he started, a publicist for Livestrong Foundation said. Armstrong was tearful during the 15-minute meeting and didn't address the issue of steroid use in cycling, Rae Bazzarre, director of communications for the foundation, said. Bazzarre added that Armstrong offered to the staff a ""sincere and heartfelt apology for the stress they've endured because of him."" He urged them to keep working hard to help cancer survivors and their families. Armstrong's sit-down in his hometown of Austin, Texas, with Winfrey was his first interview since he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles in October in a blood-doping scandal. Read more: Oprah interview with Lance Armstrong airs January 17 . For more than a decade, Armstrong has denied he used performance-enhancing drugs, but he was linked to a doping scandal by nearly a dozen other former cyclists who have admitted to doping. What Armstrong said or did not say to Winfrey could have ramifications. Some media outlets have reported that Armstrong has been strongly considering the possibility of a confession, possibly as a way to stem the tide of fleeing sponsors and as part of a long-term redemptive comeback plan. But such a confession might lend weight to the lawsuits that could await him. The interview will air at 9 p.m. ET Thursday on the Oprah Winfrey Network. Winfrey has promised a ""no-holds-barred"" interview, with no conditions and no payment made to Armstrong. But the speculations swirled Monday. ""I don't think we're going to get an out-and-out confession,"" says CNN sports anchor Patrick Snell. ""I think we're going to get something like, 'This is what went on during this era of trying to compete at the highest level.'"" Livestrong bracelet: To wear or not to wear? Armstrong, 41, has repeatedly and vehemently denied that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs as well as illegal blood transfusions during his cycling career. Winfrey will ask Armstrong to address the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's October report, which said there was overwhelming evidence he was directly involved in a sophisticated doping program, a statement from her network said last week. The International Cycling Union, which chose not to appeal the USADA's lifetime ban, stripped Armstrong of his record seven Tour victories. The World Anti-Doping Agency also agreed with the sanctions, which means Armstrong may not compete in sports governed by that agency's code. Before the ban, he was competing in Ironman triathlons and had won two of the five events he had entered. Since the ban he has entered two non-sanctioned events. Report: Armstrong offered to donate $250,000 to anti-doping agency . Why now? So, why would Armstrong choose to make a confession now? ""I would suspect that he sees this as certainly his best way forward,"" Snell says. ""He would have taken strong legal advice, of course. When you look at the kind of stuff that Oprah's done over the years, it's a chance to get ... heartfelt emotions across."" The New York Times has reported that Armstrong was contemplating publicly admitting he used illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Such an admission might lead toward Armstrong regaining his eligibility. One of his attorneys denied Armstrong was in discussion with the two anti-doping agencies. Herman, in a recent e-mail to CNN Sports, did not address whether Armstrong told associates -- as reported by the newspaper -- that he was considering an admission. But such an admission could open him up to lawsuits, something Armstrong is likely well aware of. ""He is surrounded by the best legal advice, the best legal team,"" Snell says. ""It's very hard for anyone to imagine him going into this without having been fully briefed, made aware of absolutely every scenario."" Share your view on Armstrong . Drug tests . In the past, Armstrong has argued that he took more than 500 drug tests and never failed. In its 202-page report that detailed Armstrong's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions, the USADA said it had tested Armstrong less than 60 times and the International Cycling Union conducted about 215 tests. The agency did not say that Armstrong ever failed a test, but his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided the tests altogether. The New York Times, citing unnamed associates and anti-doping officials, said Armstrong has been in discussions with USADA officials and hopes to meet with David Howman, chief of the World Anti-Doping Agency. The newspaper said none of the people with knowledge of Armstrong's situation wanted to be identified because it would jeopardize their access to information on the matter. Awaiting Armstrong's 'last word' Armstrong: The legend and the fall . Armstrong has been an icon for his cycling feats and celebrity, bringing more status to a sport wildly popular in some nations but lacking big-name recognition, big money and mass appeal in the United States. He fought back from testicular cancer to win the Tour from 1999 to 2005. He raised millions via his Lance Armstrong Foundation to help cancer victims and survivors, an effort illustrated by trendy yellow ""LiveSTRONG"" wristbands that helped bring in the money. But Armstrong has long been dogged by doping allegations, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after failing a drug test -- making a series of claims in 2011. Armstrong sued the USADA last year to stop its investigation of him, arguing it did not have the right to prosecute him. But after a federal judge dismissed the case, Armstrong said he would no longer participate in the investigation. In October 2012, Armstrong was stripped of his titles and banned from cycling. Weeks later, he stepped down from the board of his foundation, Livestrong. Kurtz: Can even Oprah save Lance Armstrong?

"Moscow (CNN) -- Prisoners in ice, more than 100 Beluga whales in far eastern Russia risk death unless rescued soon. The flock of gentle ghost-white whales was trapped in ice floes in the Sinyavinsky Strait off the Bering Sea near the village of Yanrakynnot, said a statement from the Chukotka Autonomous Region. Fishermen reported that the whales were concentrated in two relatively small ice holes, where, for now, they can breathe freely. But the Belugas' chance of swimming back to water is slim due to the vast fields of ice over the strait. The whales have little food, and the ice floe is increasing, the statement said. They are at risk of rapid exhaustion and, ultimately, death by starvation or suffocation. Trapped whales are also susceptible to predators like polar bears and killer whales. The Chukotka Autonomous Region government has sought help from federal authorities and asked for an icebreaker to help rescue the Belugas. A rescue tug, Ruby, was in the area helping a Korean cargo ship that ran aground on the southern coast of Chukotka but it would take one and a half days for it to reach the whales, the statement said. Trapped belugas are a frequent phenomenon in the Arctic waters but are not often detected by people. In Chukotka, the last relatively successful case was recorded in 1986, when an ice-breaker helped free trapped beluga whales.","More than 100 Belugas are trapped in ice floes off the Bering Sea .

"(CNN) -- They were the liars. The ""trolls."" The bitter, vindictive and jealous. They were Lance Armstrong's first and fiercest critics, frequently castigated by the once-dominant athlete and celebrity cancer survivor, shunned by sponsors, race organizers and many of the cyclist's loyal followers. Now, on the cusp of the broadcast of an interview in which Armstrong is said to finally acknowledge what he had fiercely denied for years -- that he used performance-enhancing substances -- they are finally feeling vindicated. ""He was Tony Soprano,"" author Dan Coyle, who wrote a book about Armstrong, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""When you crossed him, he cut you dead. You were gone. The question is, is he going to apologize to the people he hurt along the way? "" Former Armstrong teammate Frankie Andreu also talked about Armstrong's wrath . ""Anybody that crossed his path or didn't go along with his plan, he set out to take them down. And he was very powerful and influential and did take them down,"" Andreu told ESPN radio host Colin Cowherd on Tuesday. Interview won't reduce sanctions . ""So it's kind of a big turnaround, it's a big surprise now with him going on 'Oprah' and supposedly admitting to doping during his career, which of course he's always denied,"" Andreu said. Winfrey, appearing on ""CBS This Morning,"" appeared to confirm media reports Tuesday that Armstrong acknowledged using performance enhancing substances in his interview with her. She didn't reveal details of his statements, which will run on her OWN cable network and on the Internet on two nights beginning Thursday. Armstrong has long denied using performance enhancers during what had been a record-setting cycling career. But in a scathing report last year, the U.S. Anti Doping Agency accused him of being at the heart of a sophisticated doping program. Andreu and his wife, Betsy, say they fell into disfavor with Armstrong after testifying in an arbitration case filed against Armstrong by a company seeking to avoid paying out bonuses to him for race victories during which he was accused of doping. In their testimony, they told of a 1996 incident in an Indianapolis hospital room in which, they said, Armstrong told doctors treating him for cancer that he had taken a variety of performance enhancing drugs. Public takes shots at Armstrong in advance of interview . ""After that, it was all-out attack, war on my wife and I,"" Andreu told Cowherd. ""They ripped us apart. I lost a lot of jobs, lost a lot of money. It's been a very long, long fight. Now things are changing."" Betsy Andreu said she was pressured to sign a statement disavowing the story, and when she refused, she was ""vilified."" ""I became, in Lance's words, 'bitter' and 'vindictive' and 'jealous,'"" she said in an affidavit included in the USADA report. She recently told CNN's Anderson Cooper that her husband's career fell apart and the couple felt intimidated. The claims, the attacks, the legacy: 12 Lance Armstrong quotes to know . ""If he wants to send a message and bully you, he can intimidate you and be very, very mean,"" she said. She said she wasn't sure what to make of Armstrong's pending acknowledgment. ""The person you see is the image he wants you to see,"" she said. ""He's a chameleon."" Other Armstrong critics also are likely to be watching the interview closely. Armstrong's former masseuse and personal assistant, Emma O'Reilly, told CNN last year that she went through ""two and a half to three years of hell"" after first speaking out about doping. ""I got subpoenaed, I got ... kind of ostracized. And just the stress levels,"" she said. ""... And all for telling the truth. As well as feeling feelings of guilt because I knew then that there were certain people now who would not speak to me again, and have never spoken to me again, and it's a shame because I lost those friendships."" Reports: Armstrong admits to Oprah he cheated during cycling career . Former Armstrong teammate Tyler Hamilton also accused Armstrong and others in cycling of intimidating him into staying quiet about his own doping, which he finally admitted in 2011. ""I believed that was my only way back into the sport,"" he said. ""It is a bit of a mafia. It's a powerful group. You can say the wrong thing, and next thing you know. ..."" Another former teammate, Paul Willerton, said redemption will be tough for Armstrong to earn. ""When you sue people that you know are telling the truth, that is really difficult to forgive,"" he said. David Walsh, a British journalist who co-wrote a book that detailed the allegations against Armstrong, said a confession ""won't be enough."" ""He's got to make reparations to the people he wronged. He's got a lot of apologizing to do,"" Walsh said. Walsh's book prominently featured O'Reilly's accounts of doping in the cycling world. Armstrong later sued over the book, including a libel lawsuit against The Sunday Times, which published excerpts. The Times is now suing to recover the settlement it paid Armstrong in the case. How Armstrong will make money now . ""My feeling is that he came forward because he's been in a pretty bad place since the truth has emerged, and the only way that he can rebuild to begin his life is to make a full confession of all the things he did,"" Walsh said. Unlike some of the other critics, Walsh said he didn't feel any vindication at Armstrong's expected about-face. But he said he feels ""tremendous satisfaction for the people who helped me,"" people he said told the truth ""at great cost to themselves."" ""They were vilified. Their characters were assassinated, and they were in a bad place,"" he said. ""Betsy Andreu has said she spent 13 years telling people she wasn't a liar, and that's a very difficult place to be."" Next month, Walsh will have the catbird seat when he takes part in a university symposium in Leeds, United Kingdom. There he'll discuss his years of reporting on Armstrong, reporting that appears to have finally caught up with the onetime star. The event is called, simply, ""The Pursuit of Lance Armstrong."" Willerton, Armstrong's former teammate, says he's just glad the truth appears to be finally coming out. ""We have Lance Armstrong versus cancer. We had Lance Armstrong versus everyone in the Tour de France. But Lance Armstrong versus the truth? That's one that he really couldn't win in the end.""

"Manchester, England (CNN) -- A former teammate of once acclaimed, now embattled former cyclist Lance Armstrong said Friday that there was no question why U.S. Postal Service team members doped during big races. ""It was done by the team, but it was done for the Tour de France so I could be a good teammate for Lance Armstrong,"" Tyler Hamilton told CNN on Friday. ""He wanted you to be riding your best in the biggest races."" Hamilton, who admits he's not Armstrong's ""biggest fan,"" is one of 26 witnesses who testified to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency as part of its investigation into doping by Armstrong and other riders on the team. Armstrong's legacy may withstand accusations . In its report, released Wednesday, the organization tasked with keeping banned substances out of U.S. Olympic-sanctioned sports said it had uncovered ""overwhelming evidence"" that Armstrong had participated in and helped run the cycling team's doping program. Armstrong's lawyer Tim Herman dismissed the USADA report as a ""one-sided hatchet job"" and a ""government-funded witch hunt"" against the seven-time Tour de France winner, who has consistently denied doping accusations. Armstrong decided to give up fighting the agency's investigation in August, after a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit he had filed seeking to stop the probe. Hamilton was one of two former members of Armstrong's cycling team who spoke to CNN Friday about the doping allegations. Emma O'Reilly, a former part masseuse and part personal assistant to Armstrong and his cycling team, said she hoped her decision to talk about doping -- which she first did nearly a decade ago and more recently through the USADA report -- will help make the sport of cycling better, rather than simply bring Armstrong down. ""I think that now, more than ever, this is the opportunity for riders to have the choice to ride clean and stay clean if they choose to,"" O'Reilly told CNN. The USADA sent its report -- chronicling what it called ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen"" -- to international cycling authorities, who are considering a request to strip Armstrong of his Tour de France titles and other wins. And the International Olympic Committee said Friday that it also is examining the agency's evidence to decide if it should consider taking away the bronze medal Armstrong won in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, according to spokesman Andrew Mitchell. Meanwhile, the RadioShack Nissan Trek cycling team announced Friday that it is parting ways with Johan Bruyneel, who managed the U.S. Postal Service and Discovery racing teams on which Armstrong raced. In its report, the USADA said ""the overwhelming evidence in this case is that Johan Bruyneel was intimately involved in all significant details of the U.S. Postal team's doping program."" Bruyneel is among three former U.S. Postal Service and Discovery team officials who are fighting the charges. The Radio Shack Nissan Trek team said the mutual decision ""is necessary to make this decision since Johan Bruyneel can no longer direct the Team in an efficient and comfortable way."" On his website, Bruyneel said he was ""surprised and extremely disappointed"" the USADA released its findings before he could review them. ""I still hope to be able to defend myself in a forum free from bias, although I now fear that USADA's calculated action may have irreversibly prejudiced my case,"" he said. Armstrong teammates recount tricking drug testers . In her affidavit, released Wednesday, O'Reilly reiterated allegations she first made in a 2003 book ""L.A. Confidentiel"" by two journalists on allegations against Armstrong. She told the agency she engaged in clandestine trips to pick up and drop off what she assumed were doping products and said she was in the room when Armstrong and two other team officials came up with a plan to backdate a prescription for corticosteroids for a saddle sore to explain a positive steroid test result during the 1999 Tour de France. ""Now, Emma, you know enough to bring me down,"" she says Armstrong told her after the meeting. ""The quote has got a bit dramatized,"" she said. ""History has shown that I didn't have enough to bring him down, and I never wanted to bring him down. Never, ever wanted to bring Lance down."" Doping was commonplace in cycling in the '90s, O'Reilly said, as integral to the sport as the bikes that bore riders up and down the French hillside. She said she tried to distance herself from doping activities but felt some pressure to go along. She said she first came across doping by the team in 1998, when she said a man gave her a package that he described as testosterone for team cyclist George Hincapie. The man, whose name is redacted from the affidavit, warned her not to travel to the United States with it, O'Reilly said. Hincapie acknowledged using banned substances in his affidavit to the USADA and in a statement released the same day. That same year, she says, Armstrong gave her a small plastic-wrapped package after a race in The Netherlands and asked her to dispose of it. O'Reilly said Armstrong told her it ""contained some things he was uneasy traveling with and had not wanted to throw away at the team hotel."" O'Reilly also recounted buying makeup for Armstrong to conceal what she said he described as bruise from a syringe injection during a race. While O'Reilly said she never saw Armstrong use banned substances -- though she felt sure that he did -- Hamilton had a different story, saying ""the first time I ever blood-doped was with Lance"" and that Armstrong was well aware and involved with everything that happened. The Massachusetts-born cyclist recalled how the U.S. Postal Service team had a French man, whom he referred to as Motoman, who followed the tour on his motorcycle to deliver the performance-enhancing drug EPO at different stops. Your Armstrong questions answered . Asked why few cyclists on his team were caught despite what he characterized as repeated doping, Hamilton said they just did as they were told. ""The team doctors told us what we could take, when we could take it, how long it would stay in our system,"" he said. ""So if we followed those simple rules, 99 times out of 100, we would pass."" Having first tested positive for doping in 2004, Hamilton said he continued to lie -- pointing to what he called omerta, or ""the code of silence ... within the top tier of cycling."" ""I believed that was my only way back into the sport,"" he said. ""It is a bit of a mafia. It's a powerful group. You can say the wrong thing, and next thing you know ..."" It wasn't until last year, with an interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" and the publication of a book the following year, that Hamilton came clean about being a chronic user. He said telling the truth has been cathartic for him, while expressing understanding about his former teammate's continued denials. ""I lied for a long, long time. And you start believing some of your lies,"" said Hamilton, who accused Armstrong of trying to intimidate him a year and a half ago. ""And he's got himself really backed into a corner.""

"(CNN) -- After an astounding debut on Friday, Facebook's shares have tumbled for the most part. Is the most highly anticipated technology IPO in recent years a failure? It's too early to know. As we probe every aspect of Facebook's initial public offering, we should remember that the long-term performance of a company or its stock bears virtually no correlation with its first week's or month's market performance. In fact, the early days of Amazon.com's stock chart looked similar to Facebook's. Amazon's stock has done just fine since then. Facebook has smartly capitalized on new market forces on a scale never seen in the history of commerce. But the jury's still out -- and will be out for a while -- on whether Facebook is a ""phenom"" or a real, growing company. Facebook and its bankers did their jobs superbly well. They extracted the maximum amount of money possible from Wall Street and Main Street investors, raising $16 billion at eye-popping valuations and making it one of the largest IPOs ever. Some observers wondered, ""what's it worth?"" while others yammered about the market-cap-per customer calculus, knowing full well that no one really knows what that number is today or in a few years. With all the hoopla surrounding Facebook's IPO, is it surprising that something went wrong? Facebook's IPO process is now being scrutinized closely, with regulators looking into impropriety on the part of the banks. There were ""leaked"" upbeat memos about the company. There were last-minute reductions in revenue forecasts while the bankers were pumping the price higher and higher. Some investors may have had more information than others. There were even technical glitches with NASDAQ's systems that disrupted trading. More ""innocent"" mistakes than a toddler makes in years. Maybe the IPO was mishandled. If we had a more functional Securities and Exchange Commission, perhaps it would have made Facebook redo its IPO filing documents, which would have given some investors pause, and might have forced further tuning of a variety of key accounting metrics, all in full public view. Moving forward, Facebook needs to do one thing right: Mature into a great company that constantly innovates based not on just Mark Zuckerberg's vision alone, but with lots of help, feedback and direction from its nearly 1 billion users. Ask Rupert Murdoch and MySpace about the importance of staying exciting, compelling and relevant to customers. Or Yahoo, or dozens of other companies that were so focused on their quarterly numbers and stock prices that they lost focus of their users and watched them drift away. Was a $38 FB share a great deal? Don't ask me this week -- ask me a year or two from now. The Facebook IPO is remarkable for another reason, though: It could change the investing culture of Silicon Valley forever. Startups can now think about a ""total available market"" in the billions of users (smart phones, tablets, PCs, etc.) and try to reach a customer base that was unimaginable even decades ago. And as more people use their devices/apps 24/7 -- possibly in some sort of social way -- the potential revenue that can be generated would be enormous. For that reason, investor money is suddenly racing toward social media. Years ago, a great venture capitalist could make a solid return on an investment in about a decade or less. Now, a simple photo-sharing app like Instagram can be valued at $1 billion in less than three years. But what's great for making tons of money may not be the same as what's great for innovation or for our country. In Silicon Valley, the investor flight to social media marks the beginning of the end of the era of venture capital-backed big ideas in science and technology. Social media is the pot of gold that everyone wants a piece of right now. Will it change the way people interact? Stay tuned. Will it make the world a better place? Hard to say. In the meantime, there isn't a whole lot to be learned in Facebook's first week or month of trading. We'll just have to see if this social media giant grows into a solid and profitable company over time.

"(CNN) -- Lance Armstrong will give his first television interview since being stripped of his Tour de France titles to Oprah Winfrey, her network announced Tuesday. A news release from the Oprah Winfrey Network said the 90-minute ""no-holds-barred"" interview will air at 9 p.m. ET January 17 and will be simulcast on Oprah.com. Winfrey will ask the disgraced cycling star to address the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's report, which said there was overwhelming evidence he was directly involved in a sophisticated doping program, the statement said. The International Cycling Union, which choose not to appeal the USADA's lifetime ban, stripped Armstrong of his record seven Tour victories in October. The World Anti-Doping Agency also agreed with the sanctions, which means Armstrong may not compete in sports governed by WADA code. Before the ban, he was competing in Ironman triathlons and had won two of the five events he had entered. Since the ban he has entered two non-sanctioned events. Report: Armstrong offered to donated $250,000 to anti-doping agency . According to his Twitter feed, Armstrong has been biking, running and swimming in Hawaii. The Winfrey interview will take place at Armstrong's home in Austin, Texas. The New York Times reported last week that Armstrong, 41, was contemplating publicly admitting he used illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Such an admission might lead toward Armstrong regaining his eligibility. One of his attorneys denied Armstrong was in discussion with the two anti-doping agencies. Attorney Tim Herman, in a recent e-mail to CNN Sports, did not address whether Armstrong told associates -- as reported by the newspaper -- that he was considering an admission. Armstrong has repeatedly and vehemently denied that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs as well as illegal blood transfusions during his cycling career. In the past, Armstrong has argued that he took more than 500 drug tests and never failed. In its 202-page report that detailed Armstrong's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions, the USADA said it had tested Armstrong less than 60 times and the International Cycling Union conducted about 215 tests. The agency did not say that Armstrong ever failed a test, but his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided the tests altogether. The New York Times, citing unnamed associates and anti-doping officials, said Armstrong has been in discussions with USADA officials and hopes to meet with David Howman, chief of the World Anti-Doping Agency. The newspaper said none of the people with knowledge of Armstrong's situation wanted to be identified because it would jeopardize their access to information on the matter. Under World Anti-Doping Agency rules, an athlete who confesses to using performance-enhancing drugs may be eligible for a reinstatement. Awaiting Armstrong's 'last word' Armstrong has been an icon for his cycling feats and celebrity, bringing more status to a sport wildly popular in some nations but lacking big-name recognition, big money and mass appeal in the United States. He fought back from testicular cancer to win the Tour from 1999 to 2005. He raised millions via his Lance Armstrong Foundation to help cancer victims and survivors, an effort illustrated by trendy yellow ""LiveSTRONG"" wristbands that helped bring in the money. But Armstrong has long been dogged by doping allegations, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after failing a drug test -- making a series of claims in 2011. Armstrong sued the USADA last year to stop its investigation of him, arguing it did not have the right to prosecute him. But after a federal judge dismissed the case, Armstrong said he would no longer participate in the investigation. In October 2012, Armstrong was stripped of his titles and banned from cycling. Weeks later, he stepped down from the board of his foundation, Livestrong. It is unclear whether Armstrong would face criminal prosecution for perjury should he confess. Armstrong was involved in several cases where he gave sworn testimony that he never used banned drugs. CNN's Jillian Martin and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Lance Armstrong has agreed to 90-minute interview, Oprah Winfrey's network announces .

"(CNN) -- It will take more than a television interview to reduce sanctions against Lance Armstrong, the World Anti-Doping Agency said Tuesday as Oprah Winfrey spoke out about her interview with the disgraced cyclist. ""Only when Mr. Armstrong makes a full confession under oath -- and tells the anti-doping authorities all he knows about doping activities -- can any legal and proper process for him to seek any reopening or reconsideration of his lifetime ban commence,"" agency Director General David Howman said. Armstrong came ""ready"" for the interview Monday with Winfrey, the long-time TV talk show host said Tuesday. The interview will air in two parts, Thursday night and Friday night, on Winfrey's OWN cable network and the Internet, she said. Speaking with her close friend Gayle King on ""CBS This Morning,"" Winfrey would not give specific quotes from the interview. But she appeared to confirm multiple media reports that the former seven-time Tour de France champion used the occasion to acknowledge having used performance-enhancing drugs. Asked whether she thought it was difficult for him to ""come clean"" to her, Winfrey responded, ""Yes. I think the entire interview was difficult."" Public takes shots at Armstrong in advance of Oprah interview . Word of what Armstrong apparently told Winfrey is accelerating calls by anti-doping agencies for the disgraced cyclist to come clean to them about all he knows. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency accused Armstrong in October of involvement in a sophisticated doping program while he was a professional cyclist. The world governing body for cycling, the International Cycling Union, stripped Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles following the report. He's also been banned from the sport for life. Winfrey said the former cyclist was forthcoming in the exhausting and intense interview taped Monday in Armstrong's hometown of Austin, Texas. ""We were mesmerized and riveted by some of his answers,"" she told CBS. While the interview was revealing, Winfrey said, his demeanor surprised her. ""He did not come clean in the manner that I expected."" She didn't elaborate. Winfrey said her team and Armstrong's camp had originally agreed not to leak details of the interview, and that she was surprised to find that not long after the interview, news reports were saying part of what Armstrong told her had ""already been confirmed."" It was not immediately clear why Armstrong apparently chose to acknowledge doping after years of vigorous denials. Juliet Macur, the New York Times reporter who broke the news on January 4 that Armstrong was considering an admission of doping, said he is too driven to accept life without sports. ""He has had (several months) to think about how he is lonely, how he doesn't have the adulation of fans at the finish line and nobody to beat right now,"" she said. ""And it's driving him nuts."" Armstrong has been seeking to participate in triathlons sanctioned by U.S. Olympic authorities. Armstrong excelled at triathlons as a teenager and went back to the sport after retiring from cycling. He has been banned from officially sanctioned events. Armstrong in talks to return Postal Service money . Paul Willerton, who raced with Armstrong in the early 1990s, said any confession would be ""just a starting point"" for the cycling star. ""There are a lot of people still lying,"" Willerton said, naming former Armstrong consultant Dr. Michele Ferrari, and Johan Bruyneel, the one-time director of Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service team. ""These guys are still perpetrating the lies and deception that Lance ruled over, and Lance holds the keys. He wants his control back, and he desperately wants to be liked by the American public. And you can't have it all."" The USADA suspended Ferrari for life in July, naming him as part of a large-scale doping conspiracy. Bruyneel is battling similar charges by the agency and said in October that he was ""stunned"" its findings on Armstrong revealed details of the allegations against him. Meanwhile, fallout continued over legal wrangling concerning doping and Armstrong's involvement in the Postal Service team. The New York Times had reported that Armstrong was planning to testify against several powerful people in the sport of cycling who may have facilitated doping. The newspaper, citing one person close to the situation, also said he was planning to testify against officials from the International Cycling Union. A source with knowledge of the situation denied the reports. Then there is a whistleblower lawsuit filed in 2010 by Floyd Landis, a former U.S. Postal rider. In the suit Landis accuses the team's former management of defrauding the government of millions of dollrs because the team management knew about the drug use and didn't do anything. A source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN that lawyers for Armstrong are in discussions with the Justice Department regarding the case. The government has until Thursday to intervene, not intervene or ask for an extension, the source said. The Justice Department declined Tuesday to comment on potential civil action against Armstrong, saying the whistleblower suit is under court seal. A spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service told CNN it could not discuss any of the legal issues associated with Armstrong and their prior relationship.

"(CNN) -- It hardly seems fair. After a grueling campaign, Barack Obama will have virtually no time to celebrate his re-election. Enormous challenges await. For the victor and his party, there are many signs this may someday be seen as the ""be careful what you wish for"" election. Some of those challenges are well known and frequently discussed. Within days if not hours, the president will have to turn his attention to assembling and finalizing the team that will be at his side for the next four years. In addition, the fiscal cliff looms, as do critical decisions about whether -- and how -- to extend the Bush tax cuts. Share your reactions to the election outcome . Beyond these most apparent immediate challenges there are a host of other conundrums that will bedevil Tuesday's winner for months if not years to come. How can the United States create jobs more quickly? How can Iran be stopped from gaining nuclear weapons? How can we contain the threat of spreading unrest in the Middle East? How can we get China to play by the rules of fair trade? Can we do something to help prevent an EU meltdown from taking place and hammering the still fragile U.S. economy? What about immigration reform? Fill in your favorite pressing issue here: education reform, reducing the budget deficit, addressing flaws in the health care system, speeding up approvals of big new energy projects. There is an agenda for everyone and an army of special interest lobbyists in Washington raring to get back to work. Opinion: Five things Obama must do . But these issues, formidable and contentious as they are, are really just the tip of the iceberg. Beneath the surface there are far greater questions that many in Washington will be less inclined to address, or even give any attention at all. But it is really these more profound challenges and how we adapt to them that will ultimately determine how the next administration is judged and indeed, how we are judged as a generation. At the core, the deeper challenges have to do with what must change in order for America to keep growing and leading as we have for generations. The problems we must fix are deep, complex and interrelated. We are not able to grow our economy as we have in the past. That does not just mean we are unable to provide the jobs that perhaps as many as 25 million Americans want but cannot get. It also means that the wages those jobs pay are not rising fast enough, that we are not training workers for the jobs that may be available, and that across our society inequality is growing as never before in our history. Opinion: Obama's victory won't transform America . In our cities, roughly half of minority students never finish high school and thus are consigned to lives of deprivation and frustration. At the other end of the spectrum, and regardless of your political affiliation, you must acknowledge the social risks created when the top 1% benefit so disproportionately to the rest of a population. From 1979 to 2007, the income of the top 1% grew more than four times faster than any other group. Despite what you may have heard during the political campaign, however, these are not problems that necessarily can be solved by invoking the political formulas of the past Ã¢â¬â cutting taxes or increasing social programs. The world has changed. America will never get back the manufacturing jobs that once were the bedrock of our middle class. It is not just that some have been outsourced overseas. Most have been outsourced to the past. Automation and enhanced productivity are making it possible for companies to do much more with fewer people. Opportunities exist for us to create better jobs if we retool for a new era in which we can use our better schools, tradition of innovation, intellectual property protection and cheap domestic energy sources to give us a competitive edge in new industries. But to do so we need to embrace new models, invest in new infrastructure, welcome foreign investment, simplify regulations and tax codes, and fight America's most dangerous special interest group: the anti-change lobby. But we find ourselves unable to make many of these changes not just because they are big and difficult and not well understood but also because our political system is broken. Look at this most recent campaign season. Six billion dollars spent, vastly more than any other nation in the world spends on political campaigns. But our voter turnout, if this election followed the pattern of recent ones, lagged the standards set by much of the rest of the world. News: Hot-button ballot initiatives . Much of the money came from shadowy contributions through super PACs and big checks from fat cat ""bundlers,"" giving influence to the few. Further, for all that, not much was expected to change in terms of the composition of Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, which is just as our political leaders want it. They have built a system that is good at gridlock, name-calling and blame-gaming and not much else. It is thick with such strategies as gerrymandering districts, fostering extra-constitutional rules on filibustering and using senatorial prerogatives to hold up presidential nominations . A country facing great challenges that has a system resistant to the changes we need is at a dangerous crossroads, one that could determine its future place in the world. Interestingly, tellingly, we are not the only great nation to face such a choice this week. China, too, the world's second largest economy and most populous country, faces a once-in-a-decade leadership change. While its system is very different, it, too, is designed to allow the few to hold on to power and to resist change. And while our two countries face very different challenges, China also needs its new leaders to confront deeper issues and embrace more sweeping political and economic transformations. World worries as U.S. fiscal cliff looms . Ironically, as I have traveled across Asia during the past several weeks, many leaders I have spoken to have worried aloud that it is the nation that is best known for openness and for periodic reinvention of itself that has less of a chance of embracing the big changes it needs than the one known for being closed and repressive. While I don't believe that must be so, it puts the central challenge facing President Obama into perspective. The stakes have never been higher. To meet that challenge our president will have to lead only as great presidents have: confronting his own party as well as the opposition, but most importantly, confronting conventional wisdom and old models and demanding the rarest of all the things Washington produces: real creativity. This is the time not just for change we can believe in. This is the time for change we can actually see. If not, it could well be that the other leadership change taking place this week, the one taking place on the other side of the world, may be seen as more consequential than that which took place in the United States on Tuesday.

"Western Cape, South Africa (CNN) -- In cafes across Cape Town, brewing the perfect cup of rooibos has become a fine art. Measuring just the right amount of tea is key while great care is needed to not allow the leaves to swirl for too long. Once ready, the rooibos cups, gleaming in a sumptuous deep red color, bring with them a reedy scent that greets the noses of the customers waiting to enjoy a sip. Grown only in South Africa's Western Cape province, the naturally caffeine-free tea used to be a specialist drink appealing to only some taste buds. But in recent years, its refreshing taste and inviting aroma, coupled with its health benefits, have turned rooibos into a popular choice for tea lovers across the world. ""Germany really was the start of the big export boom,"" says Martin Berg, managing director of Rooibos Limited in South Africa, the largest rooibos tea processing factory. ""Since then, Holland, UK, USA, Japan -- all the first world countries, rooibos has grown in there, grown in popularity,"" he adds. Read more: S. Africa ostrich industry hit by major bird flu outbreak . The increasing popularity of rooibos, an Afrikaans word that means ""red bush,"" has created an industry worth around $23 billion. Some 15,000 tons of rooibos are harvested every year and at least half of that is then exported to the increasingly health-conscious consumer. Willem Engelbrecht, whose family have been farming rooibos for four generations, believes that the natural herb's popularity has increased because of the plant's health benefits -- documented in several studies -- including its anti-oxidant properties. ""It's also got a soothing effect, and that is what we need for our everyday high-speed lifestyles,"" says Engelbrecht. ""The Japanese did a lot of research early in the 1990s. Once that research became public and also South African research, people all over the world started to drink the product, not only for its very exceptional taste, but also for its wonderful health attributes."" In Western Cape, the rooibos industry is a major employer during the summer months of harvesting. Under the hot South African sun, the workers, who are paid per kilogram, are constantly cutting down and piling up the tea to satisfy the increasing demand from abroad.

The intense sunlight in the Western Cape slowly then turns the rooibos into its rich dark red color . After it has been processed and sterilized, the tea is ready for the consumer. This trade has become so lucrative that the industry is now trying to protect the rooibos name and its heritage. Producers are lobbying for the tea to be given geographical indication status (see fact box) to protect this unique brand -- a lengthy lawsuit with a U.S. company, which tried to use the rooibos name, went the way of the South Africans. But farmers, like Engelbrecht, believe more should be done. ""There is not currently the legislation in South Africa to protect the word rooibos as a geographical indicator or G.I., similar to what exists in France, where the French government makes sure that champagne can only be used by the wine producers in the Champagne region of France,"" he says. ""I think it is the responsibility of government to make sure that legislation come in place, because we need to protect our cultural assets,"" adds Engelbrecht. Read more: Rise of the 'repats': Africans shun crisis-hit West for jobs back home . But while the industry waits for government reforms, plans are already in place for further expansion into new markets, such as India and China. As a result, laboratory tests are underway to develop new products to broaden the tea's appeal and suit different palates across the world. ""We now have a vast array of different rooibos products, from the traditional unflavored tea to all the flavored tea, cappuccinos made from rooibos, cosmetics, rooibos used in cooking,"" says Engelbrecht. Back in Cape Town, customers are already enjoying some of these new products. There's a whole new menu of fruit-flavored rooibos teas, rooibos cappuccinos and even espressos. But despite this extensive range, the perfected traditional cups of rooibos remains the firm favorite.","An increasing number of tea lovers are turning to rooibos for its health benefits .

"(CNN) -- President Obama is visiting my hometown of Chicago -- the city I hate to love. The president's visit focuses attention on gun violence, and comes soon after the funeral of Hadiya Pendleton, the 15-year-old who was shot down in Chicago after participating in the president's inauguration festivities. I know way too much about urban gun violence; three people I love were shot and killed, like Hadiya, on Chicago's streets. I grew up on the South Side in the late '70s and early '80s. I was very young, but I recall the evening of my dad's death vividly. We had a green phone mounted on our kitchen wall. One night as my mom and I were sleeping in her bed, the phone rang. My mom awoke and went to the kitchen to answer. She leaned against the wall, that green phone in her hand, with a look of despair and horror as her sister-in-law told her the news. The Chicago police then banged on the door, saying, ""We just found your husband dead."" At that moment our lives changed. Chicago's ruthless streets had stolen my father. Ezekiel Taylor was shot and killed in a robbery, on his way home from church. He died four minutes away from the house where Michelle Obama grew up. And so my mother, Velma, was left to raise me in a single parent household. Without her husband's income, she struggled to keep me in private school and extra curricular activities -- from ballet, to tap, to flute lessons, to drum lessons. Her sacrifice can never be repaid. She taught me how to be a survivor, and imparted strong values, standards and morals. Chicago's record murder rate: Don't blame guns alone . She also taught me the lesson of forgiveness. I forgive the two men and woman who killed my father because you can't go forward if you don't. In high school, my great friend and honorary ""big brother"" died in the same street violence. Ron Hollister was intelligent, upstanding, funny and a good student . He was gunned down in a robbery on a summer day when he was home from his freshman year at college. He had gone to get his car washed. As a senior in high school, I vowed to get out of Chicago, to escape the pain and tragedy. I worked hard and landed a full four year scholarship to Clark Atlanta University. I never looked back. But in March of 2010, Chicago reached me in Atlanta with another horrifying phone call. My grade school buddy Steven Lee -- kind, funny and generous -- was leaving his birthday party and was caught in the crossfire of two gangs. Steven was killed by a stray bullet and his killer was never captured. To add to the tragedy for his family, his older brother was a Chicago police officer who was killed in the line of duty in August 2001. My hometown is a war zone. Too many innocent children and young adults have died. Chicago police reported that 506 people were murdered in the city in 2012, about 16% more than 2011. Compare that with the fact that 310 American troops were killed in Afghanistan in 2012. Chicagoans can be proud and hopeful that our president is going to the city to bring attention to this epidemic of violence. Too many mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers of murder victims have been suffering for too long. Leaders like Chicago Police Commissioner Garry McCarthy and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel need to figure out why murder rates in cities like New York and Los Angeles are plummeting while Chicago's continues to soar. My view: How we talk about guns in my Chicago classroom . And parents, religious leaders, teachers and community organizers also need to help take back the streets. The city needs an action plan to save innocent people from becoming victims like Ronnie, Steven and Hadiya. It needs more community centers to offer a safe haven and alternative to gang banging for kids. Young people need direction and mentors -- people like my mother, who instilled in me the values you need to rise above the challenges of poverty and despair. I love Chicago because it made me who I am. It has the best pizza, a great skyline, gorgeous Lake Michigan, museums and a diversity of cultures on every corner. Obama called it home. It gave us Oprah, Michael Jordan, Nobel Prize winning author Saul Bellow -- and the great University of Chicago. It gave us Michelle Obama, who was also raised on the South Side. But it's the city I hate to love, and I won't go back -- especially now that I'm raising a son. I don't want to lose him to the streets of Chicago. I hope President Obama's visit will inspire the city to save itself, so young people in the future will feel they can live and raise a family in the city they love. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tenisha Bell.","President Obama's visit to Chicago brings attention to city's extreme gun violence .

"(CNN) -- Red Bull have left all other Formula One teams trailing in their wake in recent years, and now it would seem the reigning drivers' and constructors' champions are also the quickest in the pit lane. The Malaysian Grand Prix was overshadowed by a Red Bull row which saw Sebastian Vettel ignore team orders, overtake Mark Webber and clinch his first race win of the season. In addition to taking the checkered flag, the Red Bull team say they clocked the quickest pit stop in the history of the sport. Australian Webber's second stop at the Sepang International Circuit was timed at just 2.05 seconds, with Red Bull claiming to have broken the record on five separate occasions during the race. Prior to 2013's second race, the record was held by McLaren, who changed the tires on Jenson Button's car in 2.31 seconds at last year's German Grand Prix. ""We went under that in Malaysia with Seb's first stop being 2.13s,"" read the Austrian-owned team's website. ""Mark's first stop, two laps later was also 2.13s. ""The crew then lowered the new benchmark to 2.05s when Mark came in again, and his two subsequent stops were 2.21s and 2.26s. ""These times are all taken from the car data which each team uses to record the stationary times."" Red Bull went on to suggest the record could be lowered once again in the future. ""What you won't hear, however, is anyone using the word 'perfect',"" said the team's website. ""There's always a quicker stop out there, and it's possible this season we'll see the magical two-second barrier breached at some point. ""However, rather than chasing individual times, improving consistency is always the thing coveted by the crew: breaking records is merely the consequence of doing that well.""

"Boston (CNN) -- Graphic testimony from a forensic anthropologist, including images of decomposing bones and brain matter, continued Thursday in the federal case against Boston's reputed mob boss, James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Dr. Ann Marie Mires, a Massachusetts state forensic anthropologist, showed jurors gruesome photos of human remains found in shallow graves in the Boston area. One grave was at Tenean Beach in Dorchester, and two sets of remains were excavated along the Neponset River. The remains at Tenean Beach were found in a 3-foot grave in September 2000, Mires told the court. Jurors were shown several photos of the remains there, including parts of a pelvic bone, a fractured skull with decomposed brain matter and a claddagh ring with part of a decomposed finger bone. Earlier this week, Kevin Weeks, Bulger's longtime crime associate, told jurors that at this location, Bulger said, ""Drink up, Paulie,"" in reference to Paul McGonagle. Authorities believe Bulger killed McGonagle, who was a leader of a rival gang in Boston. Expletives fly between Bulger and ex-partner . Most of McGonagle's remains were severely decayed due the shallow grave and the corrosive damage from the water, Mires explained. Some of his remains were very much intact, though. Jurors were shown a picture of a pair of shoes, socks and leg bones extending straight out of the socks. Bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades when prosecutors say he ran Boston's Irish mob. He also faces charges of extortion, racketeering and money laundering. Two set of remains that were found along the Neponset River had also been damaged by water and tidal currents, Mires said. The first set of remains was excavated there in late September 2000, and it included part of a skull with a bullet hole, she said. The remains were found with a bulletproof vest, a navy, three-piece suit, driving gloves and a claddagh ring around a finger bone. Mires testified that these were the remains of Thomas King. John Martorano, one of Bulger's hitmen, testified earlier in Bulger's trial that Martorano himself shot King in the back his head, and he knew where King's body was dumped. ""I was driving over Neponset Bridge (in Boston) one day, and Whitey said, 'tip your hat to Tommy .... He's over there,' "" Martorano testified. The remains of Debra Davis were discovered about a month later along the river. Most of her remains were discovered in plastic bags along with rope around the bags, Mires explained. Almost all of Davis' bones were recovered. Because her body was in bags, even some of her hair was preserved. Mires showed the jury photos of the remains, the hair found on the skull, and how the tidal movement corroded Davis' skull. Her hair, along with pieces of her bones, were tested for DNA and were positively identified as the remains of Davis, according to Mires. One of the shortest and more emotional testimonies of the day came from Elaine Barrett, the widow of alleged Bulger victim Arthur ""Bucky"" Barrett. Earlier in the trial, Weeks testified that he saw Bulger shoot Barrett in the back of his head after Barrett had tried to buy his way out of death. ""He called at 11, said he wouldn't be home for a while; he had to get money,"" Elaine Barrett told the court. ""Did your husband, Bucky Barrett, ever come home?"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Wyshak asked the widow. ""No."" Barrett answered, tearing up. She said she never saw or spoke to her husband again. Earlier in the day, before the jury entered the courtroom, the judge heard a request from J.W. Carney, Bulger's attorney, to postpone the trial until next week. He said the defense team needed more time to go over the materials and evidence and that Bulger, 83, was tired. Bulger imitates machine gun, talks about a killing in recorded jail visit . Assistant U.S. Attorney Zach Hafer argued against the motion, telling the judge that the victims and their families have waited long enough for justice and the defense had enough time to go over the materials. U.S. District Judge Denise Casper dismissed Carney's request. Thomas Donahue, a son of one the alleged Bulger victims, told reporters outside of court on Thursday, ""I don't care if he (Bulger) is tired,"" in response to Carney's request. ""Like it was said in court he (Bulger) had 16 years to relax... He will be fine,"" said Steve Davis, brother of Debra Davis. Bulger's trial continues Friday when the prosecution plans to call a forensic dentist as well as Steve Davis.","A forensic pathologist walks jurors through photos of the remains of alleged Bulger victims .

"(CNN) -- As his family, friends and co-stars mourn the loss of ""Glee"" star Cory Monteith, there looms a very real issue for the popular series. How will the show handle the death of the man who portrayed one of its most beloved characters? Monteith, 31, was found dead Saturday in a Vancouver hotel room. An autopsy is pending. The actor portrayed Finn Hudson, a high school quarterback whose love affair with glee club diva Rachel Berry was a central plot in the show and also spun off a real life romance between Monteith and his co-star Lea Michele. With Monteith's passing, Deadline noted that the show's writers ""will consider what to do about the first two episodes in which the return of Monteith's character was to have played an important part."" ""The first two episodes of the fifth season had been written before the traditional long summer hiatus, in order to get a jump on the new season; production had been scheduled to start next week,"" the site reported. ""The return of Monteith's character, hunky high school football star turned glee club darling Finn Hudson, was much anticipated by fans, Monteith having been absent from the final episodes of last season to check himself into a drug treatment facility late last March."" ""Glee"" creator Ryan Murphy has never been one to shy away from either controversy or weaving real life drama into his shows which have included ""Nip/Tuck,"" ""American Horror Story"" and the now canceled ""The New Normal."" In April, ""Glee"" was criticized after airing an episode about a school shooting in the wake of the Sandy Hook elementary school tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut. That ""Glee"" will address the tragedy is not in doubt, but how it will remains to be seen. Remembering Monteith as Finn . It won't be the first television show to have to address the loss of a major character. Most recently, TNT's ""Dallas"" lost Larry Hagman who had played the iconic J.R. Ewing in both the original series and TNT's reboot. That series decided to take his death in November 2012 from complications from cancer as an opportunity for a creative story line that would both address the beloved Hagman's death and thrill fans. ""Larry's death was terribly sad and sudden and we'd certainly rather make the show with him than without him,"" co-star Jordana Brewster told EW. ""That said, I think the writers really came up with a brilliant way to cope with the loss. It could have ruined the show and derailed everyone, but instead they made the best of it and actually came up with some really great stuff."" When actor John Ritter died of an aortic dissection in 2003 while filming his popular series ""8 Simple Rules,"" ABC incorporated his character's death into the show and brought in actors David Spade and James Garner. The show was eventually canceled in 2005. While Monteith was not the main star of the ensemble cast of ""Glee,"" his character was a central one and a fan favorite. Writing for Vulture, Lauren Hoffman said ""The loss of Finn alters the show's landscape permanently and irrevocably."" ""Whenever Glee has been at a loss for story in the past, it's circled back to three key relationships: Kurt and Blaine, Brittany and Santana, and Finn and Rachel,"" Hoffman said. ""Monteith's death and Heather Morris' (who played cheerleader Brittany Pierce) departure further destabilize a show already on shaky ground as it struggles to take on a more mature tone following the graduation of several of its main characters from high school."" Having concluded season four, ""Glee"" has grappled with lower ratings and ingratiating new characters into the hearts of fans. When Monteith's character along with several others graduated, new actors Melissa Benoist, Jacob Artist, Becca Tobin, Blake Jenner and Alex Newell were introduced. Even before Monteith's death, it was announced that the new group would be bumped up to regulars in season five, while original stars Mark Salling, Amber Riley, Heather Morris and Harry Shum, Jr. would have reduced roles. It was also recently revealed that ""American Idol"" runner-up Adam Lambert would be joining the show. There is already fan speculation as to how ""Glee"" should handle the tragedy. Might the new group of students be pushed more to the forefront in the wake of the loss of Monteith? Selina Wilken, a writer from Hypable which bills itself as being ""for fans, by fans,"" suggested that producers could do anything from allowing Monteith's Finn a happy ending off screen to ""breaking the fourth wall"" and directly addressing the audience. ""Of course you could argue that there is no 'good' or 'right' way to handle this situation. Right now, in the face of such a devastating tragedy, the future of a TV show seems like the most unimportant thing in the world,"" she wrote. ""But at the same time, we want Cory Monteith to be remembered. We want his life celebrated. We want Glee to honour both Monteith and his character, because that's what he deserved."" No matter how the storyline is altered to accommodate Monteith's death, it is clear that the loss is a huge one for the show. ""The musical comedy faces special circumstances, appealing as it does to a youthful demographic, swaths of which idolized or even 'carried a torch' for Monteith,"" wrote TVLine's Matt Webb Mitovich. ""Viewers also will know the pain his on-/off-screen love, Lea Michele, herself must feel, every time they see Rachel.""","""Glee"" producers must now decide how to handle death of beloved actor .
Other shows have also had to address the loss of stars .
Fans are speculating as to what the show will do ."
"London (CNN) -- Environmental campaign group Greenpeace has warned that if oil leaks from the stricken cruise liner Costa Concordia it could cause an environmental disaster, threatening marine life including birds, whales and sharks. At least six people died when the huge ship hit rocks and slid onto its side. The vessel -- containing hundreds of tons of fuel oil -- is now partially submerged off the Italian island of Giglio, which lies inside the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals. The sanctuary was set up 10 years ago in an agreement between France, Italy and Monaco, with about half of it existing in international waters. Pelagos is a haven for many marine species including the fin whale, sperm whale, bottlenose dolphin, tuna, swordfish and sharks, as well as supporting sea bird populations. Greenpeace has previously criticized what it called a lack of management of the sanctuary and warned regional governments about ship congestion, particularly in the straits between Corsica and Sardinia. In a 2010 report the group highlighted the large number of ships in the area and says it has spoken to cruise companies about the risk of pollution from their ships. Greenpeace Pelagos report (in Italian) ""If all this fuel is lost it is going to be a serious disaster,"" said Greenpeace Pelagos expert Alessandro Gianni. ""Fuel oil is much worse than diesel. It's sticky, very heavy. They must ensure they clean the tanks as fast as possible and then remove the shipwreck,"" he said. Italian Environment Minister Corrado Clini told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: ""We have to hurry because if the weather changes the situation could get worse. We must protect our natural heritage and landscape."" Clini has already given backing to a plan to restrict cruise ships in the Venetian lagoon and said in an interview with La Stampa that he would consider a levy on passengers to protect the coastline. Greenpeace is particularly concerned about the Mediterranean fin whales which it says spend the winter off the northern coast of Africa and then migrate to summer feeding ground inside the sanctuary. They are the second longest whale in the ocean after the blue whale, and the International Whaling Commission has previously reported concern about the high number of collisions with ships. ""If there is pollution this could have a big effect on the migration of the whales,"" said Gianni. Costa chairman and chief executive Pier Luigi Foschi confirmed that the vessel is carrying 2,300 tons of oil, split between heavy fuel oil and gas oil. ""It is in a sea we want to protect,"" he said. ""We are taking steps to avoid environmental issues."" In a statement, Costa Cruises said: ""We have engaged the services of a worldwide leader, a specialized salvage company to develop an action plan and help establish a protection perimeter around the ship."" A company spokesman added: ""The main risk is the fuel. We are not aware of any leakage. At the moment we are not aware of any other contents which could be a problem."" The search for survivors and victims was suspended on Monday because the ship began to move. Greenpeace is concerned that other toxic substance that may be on board -- such as lubricants and paints -- could spill into the sea and get into the food chain.","The Costa Concordia, which grounded off Giglio, contains more than 2,000 of tons of oil .

"Rome (CNN) -- Thrust from obscurity to notoriety overnight, Capt. Francesco Schettino is the man at the center of the questions and recriminations over the Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster. As transcripts emerge of his conversations with the Italian coast guard on the fateful Friday night the ship ran aground, the 52-year-old's every word is being pored over for clues as to what happened. A picture is beginning to develop of a man who spent decades at sea, but who his employers say did not live up to his training or responsibilities at the helm of his ship. With at least 11 deaths confirmed and about two dozen people still missing, Schettino may face charges including manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board, chief prosecutor Francesco Verusio has said. It also has been widely suggested Schettino may have been ""showboating"" when he sailed the luxury cruise liner so close to the island of Giglio, where submerged rocks tore through the hull. Schettino, who has said he will cooperate with investigators, says the rocks were uncharted, and his lawyer says Schettino did everything he could to preserve the lives of crew and passengers. Read court documents on the case against Francesco Schettino (trans. by La Repubblica) A native of Castellamare di Stabbia, near the southern city of Naples, Schettino comes from a seafaring family, Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper reports. He graduated from the well-regarded Nino Bixio nautical institute in Piano di Sorrento, in Naples province, 30 years ago, according to the news agency Adnkronos. He joined Costa in 2002 as a safety officer, served as a staff captain, and was appointed captain in 2006, according to the cruise line. Like all Costa masters, the cruise line said, Schettino ""has been constantly trained, passing all tests."" Costa chairman Pier Luigi Foschi said Schettino had never been involved in an accident before. He also played down the possibility that alcohol may have played a role in the disaster, saying he did not believe Schettino drank, and that all crew were subject to random drug and alcohol tests by Costa Cruises. But Foschi placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes. Corriere della Sera reported that Schettino came close to Giglio to salute Mario Palombo, a legend among Costa Cruises' commanders, and as a gesture to the only Giglio native on board, chief steward Antonello Tievoli. Schettino, who according to the Virgilio newspaper was well thought of by fellow sailors in Naples, is under house arrest at his family home in Meta di Sorrento, where some residents have come to his defense. Judge Valeria Montesarchio told a court in Grosseto, the provincial capital, that there was substantial evidence against Schettino and spoke of ""the grave imprudence and inexperience"" that had marked his behavior. The court heard that Schettino was accused of abandoning about 300 people who were unable to look after themselves, and to whom he had a responsibility as captain, when he left the ship before they did. He made no serious attempt to get back on board the ship and was ""totally incapable of managing"" the emergency, the judge said. The judge said the captain admitted to to making a mistake and that, at the time of the collision, he was navigating by sight. But, ordering his house arrest, Montesarchio said he had shown no signs of trying to flee the scene after the accident and that there was no danger of him tampering with the evidence. There was also no risk of him committing the same offense again, Montesarchio said, saying Schettino had expressed ""intent to change his life"" and no longer work on ships. For the time being, Schettino is confined to his family home, and can only communicate with those he lives with, the judge ordered. It was to his mother, Rosa, that Schettino made a call at 5 a.m. Saturday, according to the Repubblica newspaper, telling her that ""a tragedy"" had occurred and that he had ""tried to save as many passengers as possible."" The captain reportedly told her ""not to worry because it was all over."" A rather different picture has emerged from the transcripts of conversations between Schettino and the Italian coast guard published by Corriere della Sera. In those, the captain gives conflicting accounts of what happened when the ship hit rocks just off Italy's western coast, leading to what passengers described as a chaotic and surreal scene as they rushed to evacuate. Schettino initially appears to play down the scale of the disaster, saying only that a ""technical failure"" has occurred. Schettino then tells an official he has abandoned the vessel, according to the transcripts, which prosecutors say match those used in their investigation. But as the official questions his decision, Schettino appears to reverse course and says he did not abandon ship but was ""catapulted into the water"" after the ship ran into a rock, began taking on water and started listing. As the night unfolds, the coast guard commander repeatedly questions why Schettino, as captain, is not on the ship when passengers are still aboard. But Schettino appears unwilling either to go back on board or to take charge of the desperate evacuation efforts, the transcripts reveal. Prosecutors have ruled out technical error as a cause of the accident, saying Schettino was on the bridge at the time the ship ran aground and made a ""grave error"" that led to the disaster. The Italian coast guard and Costa Cruises are still investigating why Schettino took the ship so close to shore in an area known for its rocky sea floor. Costa Cruises has said that ""preliminary indications are that there may have been significant human error on the part of the ship's master, Capt. Francesco Schettino, which resulted in these grave consequences."" ""The route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,"" the statement added. In addition to questions over how Schettino handled himself after the wreck, questions also lingered about whether the captain should have ordered an evacuation sooner and why no ""mayday"" distress signal was sent. The captain's attorney, Bruno Leporatti, said in a statement Monday that Schettino was ""shattered, dismayed, saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed."" But, he said, Schettino is ""nonetheless comforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver ... bringing the ship to shallow waters."" That move, Leporatti said, saved the lives of many passengers and crew members. The eyes of the world will likely remain on Schettino as investigators come to their own conclusions about the role he played in a catastrophe some have likened to the sinking of the Titanic a century ago.

"Porto Santo Stefano, Italy (CNN) -- At first, Vivian Shafer said, she thought it was part of the magic show aboard her Mediterranean cruise. During the show, aboard the Costa Concordia, staffers had been ""playing with the lights"" and using smoke, ""so we really weren't that alarmed"" as things began happening on the ship, she said Sunday. Shafer said she and her traveling companion, Ronda Rosenthal, returned to their cabin after the ship gave a ""shudder,"" but were reassured by their cabin steward the ship was experiencing a ""small technical difficulty."" And as the two got into bed, someone speaking on behalf of the ship's captain made an announcement saying there was an electrical problem that would be fixed soon. However, it became clear that something was amiss aboard the 1,500-cabin luxury vessel, after the two heard announcements regarding lifeboats and muster stations. They dressed, grabbed their life jackets and went to investigate, coming upon a chaotic scene. ""We peeked around the corner to kind of see what people were doing ... and my gosh, people were actually getting in a lifeboat,"" Shafer said. At least five people died after the Concordia ran aground on the tiny island of Giglio Friday night. Several others remained unaccounted for. Survivors recounted a frantic rush by passengers to get on lifeboats, while the crew appeared helpless and overwhelmed to cope. ""There wasn't anybody to help you,"" Shafer said. ""I mean, the passengers were loading the lifeboats by themselves."" Carnival Corporation, the parent company of Costa Cruises, said in a statement Saturday that it was ""working to fully understand the cause of what occurred. The safety of our guests and crew members remains the number-one priority of Carnival Corporation ... and all of our cruise lines."" Costa Cruises on Sunday said crew members on board the Concordia ""acted bravely and swiftly to help evacuate more than 4,000 individuals during a very challenging situation. We are very grateful for all they have done."" It said preliminary indications are that there may have been ""significant human error"" on the part of the ship's captain. Compounding the evacuation problems was that only one side of lifeboats was available as the ship was listing. Passenger Laurie Willits, from Ontario, Canada, said some lifeboats on the higher side got stuck, leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the sounds of children crying and screaming. ""It was so crowded, and there was no room for us,"" said Brandon Warrick, who was sailing with his siblings. They arrived late, he said Sunday, and ""it was just bad, like mad scrambles to get into the lifeboats. Nobody followed any procedure. The crew was yelling for people to wait their turn and pretty much it was just a giant every man for himself, to get onto the lifeboat."" He said his family hung back because ""we didn't want to make it worse."" His sister, Amanda Warrick, said she thought several times that she might die, as they waited at least an hour and a half for more rescue boats after all the lifeboats departed. As the ship took on water and listed to the side, ""We were just holding onto the railing, trying not to fall,"" Brandon Warrick said. ""I just remember standing on the decks,"" Amanda Warrick said. ""There were barely any people left."" She said she didn't see any crew members ""until the very last minute"" and they were given no information about how long they would have to wait or whether any more help was coming. Her primary concern, she said, was staying with her brothers. ""There was no way that we were going to be separated."" Costa Cruises said Sunday its crew members hold a certificate in basic safety training and are trained to assist in emergency situations. Every two weeks, the company said, all crew members perform a ship evacuation simulation. Shafer said the only help they received from the crew was one young woman who approached her and told her to tighten her life vest. ""I was really disappointed and surprised,"" she said. ""The crew was so young. You would have thought they could have handled it better."" She said she thinks passengers should at least have been told to grab their coats, shoes and warm clothing. Rosenthal said she believes the two waited at least 40 minutes to get on a lifeboat. The two had just embarked at the Italian port of Civitavecchia, she said, and had not undergone the mandatory safety drill, scheduled for the next evening. However, she had just taken a cruise and so she knew where the life jackets were stored, she said. ""Lack of communication was a big thing for me,"" she said, ""and it wasn't the language barrier ... it wasn't handled at all like the previous cruise I had been on."" Even on shore, she said, people were wandering around aimlessly. She said once she and Shafer got on board a lifeboat, people were angry with them, as the boat was crowded. She did not clarify whether the crew members or other passengers were angry. Passenger Benji Smith on Saturday recounted making his own rope ladder to save himself and his wife. ""It was the Marx brothers, watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat,"" he said. ""I felt like the disaster itself was manageable, but I felt like the crew was going to kill us."" After helping passengers, some said, crew members jumped overboard and swam ashore. Smith said even the safety presentation was more of a ""sales pitch"" for shore excursions.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson ""had a real monkey on his back"" with a longtime drug addiction his family kept secret from the world, and it led to his overdose death, a lawyer for AEG Live said. The concert promoter's defense against the Jackson family's wrongful death lawsuit begins Tuesday and will include testimony from ""all of the many, many doctors"" who treated Jackson over the past decades, AEG Live attorney Marvin Putnam said. It will also include a parade of Jackson family members, including a return appearance by matriarch Katherine Jackson, who just concluded two days of testimony as her lawyers presented their case. ""They kept his private world private as best they could and now they would like to blame somebody else for things that only they knew privately,"" Putnam said. Michael Jackson's mother and three children contend AEG Live, which was producing and promoting his comeback concerts, is liable in his death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray. Jackson's mom faces cross examination in death trial . Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, which the coroner ruled was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol. The doctor told investigators he was using the drug to treat Jackson's insomnia as he prepared for his ""This Is It"" debut in London. Jackson, not AEG Live, chose and controlled Murray, Putnam argued. He said in his opening statements at the start of the trial 12 weeks ago he would show jurors ""ugly stuff"" about Jackson to prove that AEG Live executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments the doctor was giving in the privacy of Jackson's bedroom. The appearance of Katherine Jackson, Michael Jackson's 83-year-old mother, as a concluding witness in her case gave Putnam a chance to probe what family members knew about Jackson's drug abuse history. ""There are a lot of enormous inconsistencies in what is being said and what the truth is,"" Putnam told reporters Monday after he finished his cross-examination of Katherine Jackson. She ""reported to the world and to the press that he never had a problem with prescription drugs,"" that he never entered drug rehab and that the family never attempted an intervention to stop his drug use, he said. ""As we now know, Michael Jackson had a longtime problem with prescription drugs, so what had been told to the world during his lifetime wasn't true."" The Jackson family's lawyer, Brian Panish, said AEG Live executives were ""in the best position to help Michael Jackson"" when they saw his health deteriorating in the last two months of his life. Show director Kenny Ortega sent a series of e-mails to top AEG Live executives warning them that Jackson showed ""strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behavior"" at a rehearsal. ""I think the very best thing we can do is get a top psychiatrist in to evaluate him ASAP,"" Ortega wrote. ""It's like there are two people there. One (deep inside) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not waiting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state."" Production manager John ""Bugzee"" Houghdahl sent an e-mail to producers saying he ""watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks. He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now."" ""They knew he was having a problem,"" Panish said. ""He needed them for this concert. They could have easily told him, 'Look, until you go see the appropriate doctor and come back, we're not going on with the rehearsal.' They're the only ones that really had the ability to do something about it and they chose not to."" Ortega testified this month that he thought AEG Live should have halted production on the show until Jackson was well. Mother: 'I want to know what really happened' Despite the e-mail evidence and testimony, Putnam insisted Monday that AEG Live executives knew nothing about Jackson's failing health. ""They had little interaction with Michael Jackson in terms of the production and promotion of that,"" Putnam said, adding that the executives ""certainly"" did not know ""that he was having any problems."" But Panish said the executives should have known: ""He was deteriorating in front of their own eyes."" ""They watched him waste away,"" Katherine Jackson testified. Jackson testified in her first day on the stand Friday that she filed the lawsuit ""because I want to know what really happened to my son."" During cross-examination, the AEG Live lawyer played a clip from an interview she gave to NBC a year after her son's death in which she said Michael Jackson had hired the doctor. In response, her lawyer argued she made the statement before seeing AEG e-mails indicating that the company hired him. Putnam questioned her about a statement she and several of her children signed in 2007 accusing People Magazine of publishing ""untrue and inaccurate information"" about Michael Jackson's drug use. ""We categorically deny ever planning, participating in, or having knowledge of any kind of intervention, whatsoever,"" the statement read. Katherine Jackson acknowledged, however, that she participated in an attempted intervention with her son at his Neverland Ranch in 2002. ""I wanted them to stop lying,"" she testified, referring to the magazine. ""I was worried about all the lies they were telling about the family."" ""Was it a lie to say your son had a problem with prescription drugs?"" Putnam asked. ""He did not have a problem,"" she insisted. Putnam later asked Jackson's mother if she liked to ""shut your ears to bad things."" ""I don't like to hear bad news,"" she said. Jackson appeared combative at times when Putnam cross-examined her, punching back at his questions. ""What does this have to do with my son dying?"" she replied at one point. ""I think she was badgered, but that wasn't the first time,"" Panish told reporters later. ""In her deposition, she was asked questions like, ""Does your husband ever beat you?'"" Doctor: Promoter knew about Jackson's drug dependency . For the pretrial deposition, she was questioned for about 12 hours over three days. Putnam denied he was being overly aggressive in his questioning of her. ""I just wanted to know the facts from her and there was no reason to be aggressive with her,"" he said. ""She was combative, but you can't blame Mrs. Jackson for that. None of us want to find ourselves in a situation where we're having to confront the very public death of our child."" Putnam refused to discuss why he asked Katherine Jackson in the deposition if her husband, Joe Jackson, ever beat her. ""What occurred in those depositions was confidential at Mrs. Jackson's request, therefore I am not at liberty to go into to the private matters that we went into in that deposition,"" Putnam told CNN. However, Katherine Jackson and her lawyer both brought up the question in court Monday. ""I am not going to go into what we went into about the very tragic history Michael Jackson had with his parents and father over the period of his life,"" Putnam said. ""That is something we did not go into on the stand because it is not relevant. I'm not bringing that up.""

"(CNN) -- Costa Cruises introduced seven new safety measures over the weekend during a ceremony celebrating the delivery of the company's new $665 million flagship. A new real-time route monitoring system, electronic tracking of guest safety training and changes that will allow more crew members to issue orders, are among the initiatives being adopted by the company in the wake of the Costa Concordia disaster. Under the new rules, Costa cruise guests will receive emergency training before the ship leaves port and officers in uniform must be present during safety training. ""This ensures the training has proper solemnity and gives guests an opportunity to ask any questions or express concerns they might have directly with an officer,"" Costa said in a document outlining the new procedures. At least 30 people were killed when Costa Concordia ran aground on January 13 off the shore of the Italian island of Giglio. Some survivors complained that they had not been instructed in emergency procedures. International regulations require that passengers receive instruction within 24 hours of departure. In February, three cruise industry associations announced new standards exceeding that rule by requiring muster drills before leaving port. Under Costa's new rules, guests will receive an electronic card to be scanned during safety drills. Guests who miss the initial training will be tracked electronically and invited to attend training the following day. Guests who do not attend either session will receive written safety guidelines. Officers will be more involved in decision making under a new bridge management model. ""According to the new model, the Captain maintains intervention power as required by law, but is no longer the only person who issues orders,"" the Costa document said. The Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, remains under house arrest while he is investigated for possible criminal charges. He faces allegations of manslaughter, causing the shipwreck, abandoning ship and failing to report the accident. Costa will also limit access to a ship's bridge during critical navigation phases, following a standard established by Cruise Lines International Association last month, and a new monitoring system will allow Costa to control the position and course of all of its ships in real time. The cruise line's new ship, Costa Fascinosa, was delivered in Venice on Saturday, along with sister ship Costa Favolosa. Costa Fascinosa, a $665 million ship that can carry up to 3,800 passengers, is the largest Italian-flagged cruise ship afloat. ""The delivery of the Costa Fascinosa is an important stepping stone on our Company's road to recovery,"" Costa CEO Pier Luigi Foschi said.","New Costa safety rules allow crew members to issue orders .
Guest safety training will be tracked electronically .

"(CNN) -- Chaos and a lack of communication are common threads among American survivors' stories of the Costa Concordia sinking, and making it to shore was only the beginning of a long ordeal for passengers trying to get home. Melissa Goduti of Wallingford, Connecticut, boarded the ship about three hours before it ran aground Friday night, killing at least 11 passengers. ""All of a sudden, the boat leaned over like on a 70-degree angle, and everything just started falling -- dishes were falling, trash cans were falling, everything was falling,"" Goduti told CNN affiliate CTNow. ""Then the lights went out and everything was blacked, out and then the lights came back on."" Lynn Kaelin of Puyallup, Washington, told CNN affiliate KCPQ that it was ""like having the Titanic without the water gushing through."" ""I called my husband, not knowing if I'd see him again,"" she said. ""I thought we were going to die."" There were no announcements for a long time, and Goduti and her mother didn't see signs directing them toward lifeboats. ""We were running around trying to ask what floor the lifeboats were on, and all the crew kept saying is, 'you don't need them, you're fine, everything is fine, we just got hit by a big wave,' "" Goduti told CTNow. ""All they kept saying was it's a generator issue, just a generator issue and that the boat was floating along and just needed to get stabilized,"" she said. Nancy Lofaro of New Rochelle, New York, said the crew tried to do what they could, ""but when we asked them, they said they had no information. They just didn't have any information to give us."" Lofaro estimates the first announcement came 30 to 40 minutes after the ship ran aground. Goduti and her mother feel lucky they found a lifeboat. ""When our lifeboat dropped, it dropped. It wasn't an easy letdown by any means, but at least we got into the water and were safe, which is a lot better than, unfortunately, some people,"" she said. Costa staff in Lofaro's lifeboat were debating who would drive the boat, and they didn't seem to know what to do, she said. Joan Fleser of Duanesburg, New York, seconds that opinion, calling the crew ""inexperienced and untrained."" In a letter to passengers, Costa Cruises CEO Pier Luigi Foschi disputes that assessment: ""The crew of the Costa Concordia acted bravely and swiftly in an extremely difficult situation and succeeded -- despite the terribly demanding conditions -- in evacuating more than 4,000 people in the shortest possible time: we are proud of our commitment and dedication to your safety."" He goes on to outline crew training, safety procedures and regulatory oversight. Survivors of the disaster say the scene on land was equally chaotic. Fleser said the lifeboat ride to the Tuscan island of Giglio was the last she saw of Costa Cruises employees until she, her husband and daughter reached a hotel in Rome on Saturday. The people of the island came out in force to help the stranded travelers, and a local priest opened up the church. Fleser and her family stayed at the home of a local family overnight. ""The people of the island were wonderful,"" Fleser said. Nancy Lofaro and her husband wandered around on shore, finding a church, a local cafe and a small hotel all packed. ""There was no organization. There was nobody, and the staff was in shock as much as we were. There were no announcements. We saw Costa people ... walking around with a bullhorn, not using it,"" Lofaro said. Fleser and her family were herded onto a ferry to the mainland the morning after the wreck, ""but we had no idea where we were going."" Triage doctors, members of the coast guard, the Red Cross and other volunteer organizations met the cruise passengers and took them to a local school, where more local services were provided. Her daughter received a pair of sneakers there because she was still wearing high heels from the night before, Fleser said. The family then boarded a bus to Rome, where they were dropped off at a hotel. ""The Marriott had no idea we were coming. All these refugee boat people land on their front door, and they say, 'Who are you? But we'll take care of you,' "" Fleser said. There were two Costa cruise representatives at the hotel, ""but every time we asked them if they could do something for us, they said they had no authority,"" she said. The cruise line did pay for food, the hotel and their airfare home, Fleser said, although they booked them on a flight to Albany, Georgia, instead of Albany, New York -- a mistake the family discovered in the Atlanta airport. ""Oh my god, we were just ready to lose it at that point."" More than 1,100 Costa employees have been working to assist passengers and crew since Friday night, Foschi said in his letter to passengers. The CEO of Costa's parent company, Carnival Corp., pledged support to passengers: ""I give my personal assurance that we will take care of each and every one of our guests, crew and their families affected by this tragic event,"" Micky Arison said in a statement. Before Fleser and her family could make the journey home, they needed new passports to replace those lost on the sinking ship. The U.S. Embassy's response was a big disappointment, Fleser said. ""Other than getting our temporary passports, they gave us no assistance whatsoever. No food, no clothes, no money, no transportation. They told us to borrow some money, get a cab, come on down."" A hotel shuttle took Fleser and other Americans to the embassy, she said. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the agency arranged with the cruise line to have American passengers transported to a Rome hotel and to the embassy for documents. More than 100 emergency passports have been issued to stranded travelers. ""We also provided all kinds of advice, telephone contacts to families, helped families create travel funds, provided them with passport photos, warm clothes, there were even a couple of families that needed diapers,"" she said during a State Department briefing Wednesday. Fleser and her family arrived home shortly after midnight Tuesday. They received a voicemail from Costa saying the family would be reimbursed for the cruise and articles lost on the ship, she said, but the message didn't offer details of how those amounts would be determined. In addition to arranging lodging, transportation and counseling for passengers, Costa will address possessions lost on board and is in the process of refunding cruise fares and costs incurred while on board, the company said in a statement.","U.S. passengers tell stories of ""inexperienced, untrained"" crew .

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney is a paradox. If you saw a photo of him and didn't know who he was, you might assume from the square jaw, trappings of wealth and arcane haircut that he was the perfect country-club Republican. But that would be too simple, especially in this election. Romney only looks like an insider. But in many ways, he has remained an outsider. Politics: Romney's 'all' proved not enough . For one thing, the Romney-Ryan presidential ticket, which lost the election Tuesday to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, was the first in history not to include a Protestant. (Romney would have been the first Mormon president, Rep. Paul Ryan is Catholic.) He's a Republican who won election in a blue state. The people of Massachusetts may know the former governor as a bipartisan moderate, yet he sold himself on the national stage as ""severely conservative."" In his own state, he invented what many regard as the prototype for Obamacare, yet he repeatedly vowed to repeal Obama's version of it. Kennedy: Obama's win won't transform America . Is he moderate or is he conservative? The same question could be asked of the Republican Party -- and the GOP's own lack of ideological clarity is probably the exact reason why it nominated him. Cometh the hour, cometh the multidimensional man. Today's Republicans find themselves in a dilemma. On the one hand, they have an enormous base of hyped-up voters who passionately subscribe to economic and social conservatism. They needed to energize that base to win. On the other hand, the margin of victory rested with a group of moderates and independents who like their politics a little more practical. The challenge of 2012 was to take the tea party agenda and rebrand it so that it could still appeal to the right but also win converts in the center. That was Romney's job -- and he didn't quite pull it off. Yet, if anyone could have, it would have been Mitt. Why Wall Street hates Obama . I suspect that the Republicans nominated Romney partly because he spent so much money acquiring the nomination but also because his personality seemed suitably vague. To be assigned to report on his rallies carried all the thrill of being asked to submit a 10,000-word critical analysis of a church picnic. His speeches were flat at best and goofy at worst. His attire was sensible trousers and shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and the family was so wholesomely large that you sensed they could swing a primary just by registering the grandkids. But squareness was just what the GOP was looking for. In an era of recession, his business experience seemed like a big plus and his polished-yet-gentle style was a nice contrast to Obama's flashy rhetoric. It was understood that he had been a technocratic governor of Massachusetts, with a record on social issues that at times wandered a bit to the left. As I always explained to my British colleagues bemused at the irresistible rise of Mitt Romney, one of his greatest strengths was that he didn't look crazy. You could trust this man with the nuclear codes, whereas putting the entire arsenal of the free world in the hands of one of his primary challengers, like Rick Santorum or Newt Gingrich, felt risky. But to win the primaries, Romney still needed the votes of that big block of conservatives. So he underwent a rebranding. For the record, the conservative movement never entirely bought Romney's conversion. That's why he lost Iowa to Santorum and South Carolina to Gingrich. Thereafter he was dogged for some weeks by Santorum, whose electoral coalition tended to be poorer, more religious, more conservative and more rural. In these truly competitive primaries, Romney's vote was often rich, moderate and elderly (no wonder Mr. Burns was such a fan). Mitt was, in fact, the country-club candidate. He won primaries largely thanks to the support of people like him, and he only won because there are so many people like him in the Republican Party. But all the while, his empty pitch to the GOP base moved him rhetorically further and further to the right. Share your opinions on the election results . Of course, philosophical conservatism isn't necessarily an electoral negative for the GOP. It worked for Reagan in the 1980s and George W Bush in the 2000s. But whereas Democratic populism is programmatic (health care for all, tax the rich) for the Republicans it has tended to be personal (dress like a cowboy, eat TV dinners). The problem was that Mitt lacked the requisite performance skills -- he's no Reagan -- which ended up converting his greatest strength into his greatest weakness. With unemployment running high and debt spiraling out of control, we might have expected Romney's ability to make money to be a plus. Instead, it only emphasized his difference from you and me. He had money nestling in the Cayman Islands. He only paid 14.1% on a fortune that would make King Midas blush. Worst of all, he had worked in private equity, and while he helped save a lot of jobs, he was probably responsible for downsizing a few, too. Romney insisted that he left Bain before it committed its greatest sins, but the image of Mitt cheerfully declaring, ""I like being able to fire people"" stuck in the minds of many voters. Romney's broader appeal was buried beneath a wave of scandal and political character assassination. It was the debates that allowed him to regain control of the narrative. In that first debate he was clever, funny, energetic and passionate -- and in many ways outclassed Obama. My theory is that Romney flourished because the format was like a corporate job interview: question after question, a little light sparring, an emphasis upon ""pep"" (""Gee, I'd just love to run your country. When can I start?!""). The inner-intern shone through and Romney behaved like a smart kid out of college who's hungry to get his foot on the corporate ladder. Kamarck: Five things Obama must do . His performance was so good that it was historic, transforming the election in a way that few have ever done. It worked because Romney did what the GOP was waiting for him to do all year. He appealed to the center by sounding reasonable and moderate but he also fired up the base by saying things to Obama that they wanted to hear said. This was Romney at his very best -- and it's difficult to image an alternative candidate who could have done better. But, ultimately, the contradictions inherent within both Romney and his party simply couldn't be overcome. The need to be both conservative and moderate confused and frustrated the electorate who were never quite sure what they were voting for. So the advantage fell to the incumbent. The ambivalent American public went with the devil they knew. What next for Mitt Romney? Don't be surprised if he returns to his church. He's a man of faith with a record of charity and it would be in keeping for him to dedicate himself to others. I hope the conservative movement and the pundits will be just as charitable to him . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Timothy Stanley: Romney, who lost presidential election, has long been paradox .

"Rome (CNN) -- Transcripts published Tuesday capture the dramatic conversations between port officials and a cruise ship captain, who a judge ruled can be held under house arrest while Italian authorities investigate his role in last week's disaster. A judge ruled that Francesco Schettino must remain in custody pending a later decision on whether to release him while authorities investigate the running aground of the Costa Concordia on Italy's Tuscan coast. But the judge said Schettino can be held on house arrest rather than in jail pending that decision, said his attorney, Bruno Leporatti. The captain has promised to cooperate with authorities, the lawyer said. Chief prosecutor Francesco Verusio said he did not know the grounds for the decision, which was made after the Tuesday afternoon court hearing. ""I am speechless,"" he said. An Italian port official swore in frustration at the captain of the stricken vessel after it struck rocks Friday night, ordering him at least 10 times to return to the cruise liner and coordinate rescue efforts, transcripts of the recorded conversations published Tuesday show. ""You get on board! This is an order!"" the port official told Schettino. ""You have declared 'Abandon ship.' Now I'm in charge. You get on board -- is that clear?"" the official said in one of the conversations published by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra. Schettino says at one point that he wants to go back on board, then refers to ""other rescuers"" and says something about a lifeboat being stuck. ""Get on board the ship and you tell me how many people are on board. ... Clear? You tell me if there are children, women, people with special needs,"" a coast guard officer tells Schettino. ""Get on board, (expletive)!"" the officer curses in frustration. During one conversation, Schettino first says he abandoned ship, only to appear to reverse course under questioning by an official, saying he was ""catapulted into the water"" but remained on scene to coordinate the rescue. ""I did not abandon any ship,"" Schettino said, according to the transcripts. Italian prosecutors confirmed that the quotes match ones in a transcript they were using in their investigation. Schettino is under investigation by Italian authorities for his role in the disaster, which has claimed at least 11 lives. Prosecutors say Schettino was on the bridge at the time and made a ""grave error"" that led to the disaster. The Italian coast guard and Costa Cruises, which owns the ship, are investigating why Schettino took the ship so close to land in an area known for its rocky sea floor. ""Preliminary indications are that there may have been significant human error on the part of the ship's master, Capt. Francesco Schettino, which resulted in these grave consequences,"" Costa Cruises said. ""The route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,"" the statement added. Corriere della Sera reported that Schettino came close to Giglio to salute Mario Palombo, a legend among Costa Cruises' commanders, and as a gesture to the only Giglio native on board, chief steward Antonello Tievoli. Speaking on Italian television, Schettino said the problem was an uncharted rock. ""On the nautical chart, it was marked just as water,"" Schettino said. But the Italian coast guard said the waters where the ship ran aground were well-mapped. Local fishermen say the island coast of Giglio is known for its rocky seafloor. ""Every danger in this area is on the nautical chart,"" coast guard Capt. Cosimo Nicastro said. ""This is a place where a lot of people come for diving and sailing. ... All the dangers are known."" Local authorities and residents said they believe that after hitting the rock, which tore a hole in the hull, the ship sailed at least half a mile north. They believe Schettino then turned the ship around toward land, where it toppled. In addition to questions over how Schettino handled himself after the wreck, questions also lingered about whether the captain should have ordered an evacuation sooner and why no ""mayday"" distress signal was sent. At one point after the ship struck the rock, the ship returned a radio call from port officials saying that all was well and the ship was suffering only a ""technical problem,"" according to the transcripts. Schettino joined Costa in 2002 as a safety officer, served as a staff captain and was appointed captain in 2006, according to the cruise line. Like all Costa masters, the cruise line said, Schettino ""has been constantly trained, passing all tests."" Schettino had never been involved in an accident before, said Costa chairman Pier Luigi Foschi. Foschi also downplayed the possibility that alcohol may have played a role in the crash, saying he did not believe Schettino drank, and that all crew were subject to random drug and alcohol tests by Costa Cruises. The captain's attorney said in a statement Monday that Schettino was ""shattered, dismayed, saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed."" But, he said, Schettino is ""nonetheless comforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver ... bringing the ship to shallow waters."" That move, Leporatti said, saved the lives of many passengers and crew members. Captain and consultant James Staples told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night that he was ""totally amazed"" by Schettino's actions. ""He should have stayed on board that ship and coordinated the rescue attempts from the vessel."" Staples said the Concordia should not have been so close to the rocky shore at night, with little or no room to maneuver. Passenger Alex Beach of New Mexico said crew members tried to assist passengers, but had no upper-level supervision. The scene around lifeboats, many of which could not be launched, was chaotic. ""It became a situation of every man for himself,"" she told Cooper. CNN's Holly Yan, Hada Messia, Dan Rivers, Brian Walker, Josh Levs and journalist Barbie Nadeau contributed to this report.","NEW: Captain and consultant tells CNN captain should have stayed aboard .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Italian rescuers and divers continuing their perilous work Tuesday located a second ""black box"" and the remains of five people in the wreckage of the Costa Concordia cruise ship. Eleven people were confirmed dead after the ship ran aground late Friday off a Tuscan island. With nearly two dozen people still missing from the ship, which is lying on its side off Giglio, a judge allowed its captain to be held on house arrest pending a later decision on whether he should be released. Capt. Francesco Schettino is under arrest and may face charges that include manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board, chief prosecutor Francesco Verusio said. Judge: Captain can be held under house arrest . In dramatic transcripts of conversations between Schettino and the Italian coast guard, published by the Corriere della Sera newspaper, the captain gives conflicting accounts of what happened when the ship hit rocks Friday night just off Italy's western coast, leading to what passengers described as a chaotic and surreal scene as they rushed to evacuate. At first, Schettino tells an official he had abandoned the vessel, according to the transcripts, which prosecutors say match those they are using in their investigation. iReporter recalls first Concordia crash . But as the official questions his decision, Schettino appears to reverse course and say he had not abandoned ship but was ""catapulted into the water"" at some point after the ship ran into a rock, began taking on water and started listing. In a later conversation, an Italian coast guard official demands Schettino return to his ship, the transcripts show. ""You get on board! This is an order!"" the coast guard official instructed Schettino. ""You have declared 'Abandon ship.' Now I'm in charge. You get on board -- is that clear?"" the port official said. Port Authority to cruise ship captain: 'Get on board, damn it' Rescue and recovery efforts continued Tuesday, with divers searching the ship for survivors and remains. It was unclear exactly how many people were missing. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely. Before the discovery of the five bodies Tuesday, authorities had said 29 people were missing, including 14 Germans, six Italians, four French citizens, two Americans, and one each from Hungary, India and Peru. There was continued confusion Tuesday about the number of missing Germans, according to the German Foreign Ministry. One person on the list of missing was found dead Monday, but authorities have not specified which one it is. A friend of two missing Americans, Gerald and Barbara Ann Heil of White Bear Lake, Minnesota, said their family is ""holding up very well"" despite the agonizing wait for word from Italy, where the retired couple had gone for ""their trip of a lifetime"" after raising four children and working in their community for years. St. Pius X Catholic Church will hold a Wednesday evening prayer service for the couple, according to CNN affiliate KARE. The Heils were on a 16-day vacation to Italy, with a planned visit to the Vatican. In addition to the dead and missing passengers and crew, the wreck has given rise to concern about environmental damage. The ship had about 2,300 tons of fuel on board at the time of the wreck, said Costa Cruises chairman and chief executive Pier Luigi Foschi. But he said that so far there was ""absolutely no evidence of fuel leaking into the sea."" The ship appeared stable and its fuel tanks were intact Tuesday, said Martin Schuttenaer, a spokesman for Boskalis, the parent company of Dutch Smit and Salvage, which has monitors in place to keep track of the ship's movement. He said equipment to begin transferring the ship's fuel will be ready on Wednesday, but the current priority is rescue and recovery. After sinking, some wonder: Is cruising safe? Divers have been searching the skyscraper-sized ship, working underwater in pitch blackness. Italy's Coast Guard said it has located a second ""black box,"" or data recorder, from the ship. Operations were under way to retrieve the recorder, said Coast Guard Warrant Petty Officer Massimo Macaroni. Information from the device, along with that from another that has already been recovered and is being analyzed by prosecutors, will provide authorities with ""a complete picture of how the disaster unfolded,"" Macaroni said. Micky Arison, chairman of Carnival Corp, parent company of Costa Cruises, said he was saddened by the reports of additional deaths. ""Our immediate priority continues to be supporting rescue and recovery efforts and looking after our guests and crew members, along with securing the vessel to ensure there is no environmental impact."" Survivors described the panic that ensued after the ship's collision with the rocks. Lauren Moore of Bowling Green, Kentucky, said many lifeboats were full when she and others reached the upper deck . ""People were crying. People were hysterical,"" Moore said. ""People were screaming at each other."" Cruise disaster hits Carnival stock, profits . Italian prosecutors have ruled out a technical error as the cause of the incident, saying the captain was on the bridge at the time and had made a ""grave error."" Prosecutors are considering whether others may share responsibility for the crash with the captain. Foschi placed blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, saying Schettino had deviated from frequently traveled routes. ""The captain decided to change the route and he went into water that he did not know in advance,"" Foschi said. Foschi said passengers would get ""material compensation for their loss,"" but declined to go into details. One person who was scheduled to board the Concordia on Saturday said he was offered a refund, but will not get the refund for three months. Built in 2006, the Concordia had been on a Mediterranean cruise from Rome with stops in Savona, Marseille, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Cagliari and Palermo. Questions have arisen over regulation of the industry, and the size of some cruise ships. Human error can't be regulated, said an official with Cruise Lines International Association, which represents the industry. ""The fact is that this industry is remarkably safe,"" said executive vice president Michael Crye. ""It has had a history that is very good compared to virtually any other means of transportation."" Nautilus International, a maritime employees trade union, called the accident a ""wake-up call"" to regulators. ""Nautilus is concerned about the rapid recent increases in the size of passenger ships, with the average tonnage doubling over the past decade,"" said Nautilus general secretary Mark Dickinson in a statement. ""Many ships are now effectively small towns at sea, and the sheer number of people onboard raises serious questions about evacuation."" Crye said regulations have kept pace with the increasing size of the vessels. Safety rules are set through the International Maritime Organization, an agency of the United Nations. It said Monday that while the investigation of the wreck is in its early stages, ""We should seriously consider the lessons to be learned and, if necessary, re-examine the regulations on the safety of large passenger ships in the light of the findings of the casualty investigation."" Maritime law attorney Richard Alsina said the agency has little teeth and is dealing with an industry that has a strong lobby. ""There is no general policing out there. They pretty much run their own show."" CNN's Livia Borghese, Hada Messia, Dan Rivers, Mary Snow, Christopher Cottrell, Diana Magnay and Richard Allen Greene and journalist Barbie Nadeau contributed to this report.","Prayer service scheduled for missing U.S. couple .

"Porto Santo Stefano, Italy (CNN) -- The 3,200 passengers aboard the Costa Concordia cruise liner were enjoying a night of entertainment and relaxation off Italy's Mediterranean coast. Then, at about dinnertime, the lights went out, an ominous scraping sound moaned through the hull, and the ship tilted to one side. The 1,500-cabin luxury vessel, which was also carrying about 1,000 crew members, had run aground on a rocky sandbar off the tiny island of Giglio. Chaos overwhelmed passengers and crew alike when, as the ship listed and water rose as if it were a scene from ""Titanic,"" everyone realized that only one side of the ship's lifeboats and rafts were reachable. Amid screams, the crew appeared helpless, according to one passenger who had to make a ladder of rope to save himself and his wife. ""It was the Marx brothers watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat,"" said Benji Smith, who was on the Concordia for his honeymoon with his wife, Emily. The couple live in Boston. ""I felt like the disaster itself was manageable,"" Smith added, referring to the grounding and tilting of the ship, ""but I felt like the crew was going to kill us."" The worst part came when a lifeboat crew member told everyone, ""Women and children first,"" Smith said. ""All these families who were clinging to each other had to be separated,"" he added. After helping passengers, some crew members jumped overboard and swam ashore. Search continues for missing passengers . At least three lifeboats apparently malfunctioned due to technical or crew error, Smith said. Life rafts were ""twisting and turning,"" and the crew pulled in some rafts and put the people back on the ship, but the crew never returned for them, Smith said. With the ship's staircases flooded, ""we made ladders out of ropes to climb down from the outer fourth deck to the third deck,"" Smith said. ""We waited clinging to those rope ladders for 3ÃÂ½ hours"" before being picked up by a lifeboat that returned from dropping passengers onshore, he said. Smith said he and his wife never heard from any of the officers or captain during the incident. The couple was eventually transported by bus to a hotel in Rome. ""I've been awake for 40 hours -- I still have never spoken to a person from Costa,"" he said, adding that no food, clothes, or money were provided by the cruise line. Many passengers complained about how the cruise ship staff handled the crisis and asked why they had not yet received an obligatory safety briefing when disaster struck, only hours into their journey. ""We attended a safety presentation on the first day,"" but he says it didn't turn out to have any safety information, he said. ""It was only a sales pitch"" for shore excursions, Smith said. Mark Plath of Little Rock, Arkansas, said 200 passengers swam about 100 yards to rocks, where they awaited further assistance. ""We were helping the staff more than they were helping us,"" Plath said of the ordeal. Rosalyn Rincon, a member of the cruise ship staff who worked as a dancer, was in the middle of a magician's act when the ship ran aground. She was inside a box during a magic show when, she said, ""I realized that everything stopped. The music stopped,"" she said. Everything on the stage fell on top of people because the ship listed dramatically, said Rincon, 30, of Blackpool, England. ""There was no signal as to what was going on until about 30 minutes into it,"" Rincon told CNN. Her boyfriend, an Italian engineer officer on the vessel, told her that there was a blackout and the ship crashed into something. ""They told us there was a fire,"" she said. Then another blackout occurred, and the ship went into darkness, she said. She put on her life vest in her cabin, she said. About 15 minutes later, ""the captain of the ship told us it was an electrical problem,"" Rincon said. Rincon thought to herself: ""If it was an electrical problem, why were we tilting,"" she said. Several minutes later, ""we were told to abandon ship,"" Rincon said. Then panic set in, she said. ""This is the problem: You've got 3,000 passengers, you've got 2,000 crew members, and you got only one side of usage of lifeboats and life rafts"" because the ship was resting on one side, Rincon said in a telephone interview from her Italian hotel. Rincon realized there was going to be a shortage of lifesaving watercraft, she said. ""You were going higher and higher, and you were on a vertical position. I was holding on to the railing. All you could see was noise and creaks. It was very, very scary,"" Rincon said. Rincon was able to get into a rescue boat -- after all the passengers were put on lifeboats or life rafts, she said. ""We were literally thrown into the boat,"" Rincon said. Several crew members jumped overboard and swam to the mountain shore, she said. One friend was rescued by helicopter from the top of the ship, Rincon said. Passenger Laurie Willits from Ontario, Canada, who was watching the magic show with her husband, told CNN: ""All of a sudden the lights flashed, and the boat tipped like it was turning, but it didn't return to level."" Emergency announcements in English and other languages were difficult to hear, Willits said. Panic spread as people scrambled to find lifeboats in the dark as the ship quickly leaned to one side. Lifeboats on the higher side got stuck, Willits said, leaving some people suspended in mid-air for a long time. The sounds of children crying and screaming could be heard. Willits and her husband managed to get into a lifeboat about an hour to 90 minutes after the alarm was raised, and were among the first to be taken to land. American Nancy Lofaro said she and her husband Mario were watching the magic show, when there was a ""grinding noise."" All the performers ran off the stage, she said, leaving the audience in the theater. She added that 30 minutes passed before there was any announcement, saying everything was under control. ""The crew tried hard but they kept telling us they had no information, and it wasn't until an hour into this situation that we got into a lifeboat and were lowered."" Lofaro described a chaotic situation on the lifeboat. ""At one point we were being lowered, and we were sliding off to one side. Everyone fell into one side of the boat and were slamming into the ship. This happened a few times over 30 seconds. And finally we were lowered into the water level. It took 30 minutes to get to shore... the lifeboats were slamming into each other. It was chaos."" At reception centers set up on shore Saturday, some passengers were still wearing pajamas, slippers or housecoats from when the alarm was first raised on the ship. Most were without their money, phones and valuables. Sirens blared as some of the injured were taken to hospital. Helicopters lifted some people from the badly listing ship. Rescue officials said their operation peaked between midnight and 3 a.m. Saturday, and calm seas prevented greater loss of life. Three people were confirmed dead and 20 injured. Many people spent the night in small churches and other buildings around the island before being ferried to the mainland to make their way home. The Italian cruise company, Costa Cruises, said it would help passengers return home. Costa is owned by parent company Carnival Corp. An investigation into the cause of the disaster is under way, officials said.

"(CNN) -- Now that the campaign is over and Barack Obama has won a second term, the hard business of governing begins again. There's a presidential inbox waiting and it's not too hard to figure out what's in it. Problems don't have Democrat or Republican stamped on them: they just are. So here are my top five issues facing the president. Finding our footing in the new Arab world . Obviously this election was about the economy first, second and third. But the world intrudes. Our election campaign did not keep terrorists from killing American diplomats in Benghazi, nor did it stop the violence in Syria. When all the ballots are counted and the parks swept clean of the debris from election night rallies, President Obama will have to figure out what is happening in this very volatile part of the world and what, if anything, we do about it. We intervened in Libya to get rid of an awful dictator, but so far we have not intervened to get rid of the awful dictator in Syria. As the violence escalates and the Syrian president wreaks ever more death and destruction on his people, will we be drawn into an intervention there too? After 9/11 we went to war with Iraq over a mistaken fear of nuclear weapons. Is Iran developing nuclear weapons or are we wrong to be concerned? Will we go to war with Iran too? Opinion: Obama will get little time to celebrate . Preventing the fiscal cliff . While President Obama has been crisscrossing the country looking for votes, the people left behind in Washington have been wringing their hands over the dangers posed to the fragile economic recovery by the severe combination of spending cuts and tax increases that are due to kick in on New Year's Eve. This so-called ""fiscal cliff"" was the result of politicians kicking the can down the road a few years ago. Will they do it again? Or will there be a grand bargain that actually puts the country on the path to smaller deficits? World worries as U.S. fiscal cliff looms . There are plenty of plans on the shelf waiting, including those put together by the big deficit reduction commissions such as Simpson/Bowles and Rivlin/Domenici. And there's the plan almost put together by President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner. The problem isn't the lack of plans; it's the lack of courage. The outlines of any deal have been clear for some time now: Democrats have to give up some spending, especially on entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, and Republicans have to allow for some new taxes. Each side has to hold it's nose if a deal is to be done. Which brings me to the next issue facing President Obama: . Opinion: Obama's victory won't transform America . Dealing with the Republicans . Obama must figure out how to deal with a Republican Party in Congress that has become dysfunctional. In 2010 a relatively small group of voters calling themselves the Tea Party launched a surprise attack on the leadership of the Republican Party. Under President Bush, the Republican Party had gotten a little too fond of world domination and a little too dismissive of the party's traditional concern for fiscal discipline. Frankly, they deserved a trip to the woodshed. But once their new majority in the House of Representatives was won, the leadership overreacted, and rather than forge a majority that could perhaps make some progress, they cowered before their new members like frightened children. The result? No progress. If the Republican leadership continues to tremble before their most radical members, the entire party risks a rightward slide off the face of the earth. And President Obama will have to figure out how to work around them. Analysis: Obama won with a better ground game . Cutting a deal on tax reform . It's been 25 years since a Democratic Congress and President Reagan cleaned out the tax code and achieved lower rates and fewer loopholes. But tax loopholes grow back like dandelions in the garden. The current tax code is a mess. It rewards some sectors of the economy and not others. It distorts business decision-making and it makes sure that those who don't need it have plenty of tax deductions. It's time to weed that garden once again. Amazingly enough in this era of extreme polarization, both presidential candidates have expressed support for lowering the corporate tax rate to 25% and simplifying the corporate side of the code. It's possible that they could agree on the easy stuff on the corporate side and move to the harder stuff on the individual side. Tax reform will be part and parcel of a long-term deficit deal. Tax cuts for the oil and gas industry are a favorite target of President Obama, and they are just one example of many industry-specific tax breaks that might get swept up in a big tax deal. Share your reaction to the election outcome . Climate change . And finally I come to the issue that was not mentioned in the presidential campaign: climate change. The Democrats' one attempt at climate change legislation died in 2010, a victim of the recession and also of the fear that confronting it would increase energy costs on a public still reeling from the meltdown. The failure of the climate bill began, however, the issue's long, slow slide into oblivion; a slide so complete that both candidates spent their debates falling all over themselves to prove they were friends of coal. But coal is the big culprit in climate change, a fact conveniently ignored when the votes of Ohio are at stake. How fitting then, that in the very last week of the campaign, a gigantic hurricane would destroy the Jersey shore and close down lower Manhattan. The seas are rising after all; there is something happening after all. What, President Obama, are you going to do about it? The options are plentiful, from taxing carbon to pouring more money into green energy. They just haven't been very palatable. Maybe hurricane Sandy can change that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elaine Kamarck .","Elaine Kamarck: In his second term, there are five immediate challenges for Obama .
She says he must find United States' footing in fragile Arab world .
Kamarck: He must reach a grand bargain with GOP to avoid fiscal cliff .

"(CNN) -- The American Civil Liberties Union has called on officials in Massachusetts and Florida to conduct independent investigations into the shooting death of a man by an FBI agent. Ibragim Todashev was fatally shot early May 22 during questioning about a 2011 triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts, as well as his relationship with deceased Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Law enforcement from Massachusetts and Florida as well as the FBI questioned Todashev at his Florida home. Details about the circumstances of Todashev's death have been few, and the gaps have been filled in by media reports quoting unnamed law enforcement sources. The reports have raised the question about how much of a threat Todashev posed before being shot. Father: 'Unarmed' son 'not crazy' enough to attack FBI agent who killed him . The FBI is conducting an investigation into the shooting, but the ACLU said that action is not enough. ""Florida officials are simply deferring to the FBI, allowing the FBI to investigate itself, but it is difficult to accept the FBI's honesty in this matter,"" Howard Simon, ACLU of Florida's executive director, said in a statement Monday. ""The FBI has offered completely incompatible explanations; they have failed to explain how these inconsistent stories found their way into newspaper accounts of the shootings, and have not offered any clarifying comment about what really happened."" The rights group sent a letter to Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley asking her office to investigate the role of officers from her state in the shooting. In Florida, the ACLU asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the role of Orlando police at the scene. A U.S. government official briefed on the FBI investigation told CNN in May that Todashev had agreed to talk to authorities and noted he was never arrested or handcuffed. Did missed connections in murder case open door to bombings? A samurai sword was in the room when Todashev sat down with two Massachusetts State Police detectives and a Boston-based FBI agent, but it was moved out of his reach, the U.S. official said. After one of the detectives left the room, the other noticed Todashev was acting odd, and he texted that sense to the FBI agent with him -- the U.S. official told CNN. Those two law enforcement officials were the only ones with Todashev, according to this account. Suddenly, Todashev knocked over a table -- knocking the FBI agent back into a wall -- and came at him with some sort of ""long-handled object"" that he'd grabbed from behind him, according to the official. The agent fired a few rounds, but Todashev kept on coming, the official said. He finally stopped after yet more gunshots. A law enforcement official told CNN that Todashev attacked the FBI agent with a broom handle, not a sword.

"Washington (CNN) -- Dennis Ross, one of the president's top advisers dealing with Middle East policy, announced Thursday he's stepping down from his post, leaving prospects for the administration's efforts to restart the peace process even more uncertain. He cited a promise he made to his wife to serve in the Obama administration for only two years. Ross, who has held key diplomatic positions during the administrations of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton as well as Barack Obama, issued a statement saying, ""It has been an honor to work in the Obama administration and to serve this president, particularly during a period of unprecedented change in the broader Middle East."" He added, ""Obviously, there is still work to do, but I promised my wife I would return to government for only two years and we both agreed it is time to act on my promise. ""I am grateful to President Obama for having given me the opportunity once again to work on a wide array of Middle Eastern issues and challenges and to support his efforts to promote peace in the region."" Ross's formal title is special assistant to the president and senior director for the ""central region,"" the key area that includes Israel, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Persian Gulf, and South Asia. His influence is hard to understate, having been handed a portfolio that includes the United States' most pressing national security interests and regions that have undergone significant turmoil over the past two years. Ross' departure comes at a particularly difficult time for the Obama administration, which has at times clashed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Middle East peace process and is dealing with the unpredictable aftermath of the Arab Spring. The departure also follows that of the special envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, who left the administration in May, only days before Netanyahu visited the White House. During his daily briefing Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney called Ross a ""remarkable contributor to this administration."" ""He is ... very much a part and an architect of the sanctions regime and efforts to pressure and isolate Iran, and has been at the forefront of our deliberations about handling the Arab Spring, the remarkable events we have seen in the Middle East and North Africa this year,"" Carney said. Asked how Ross' departure would affect the administration's efforts to forge a Middle East peace agreement, Carney said the White House will ""build on the good work he has done.""","Dennis Ross has held positions in two previous administrations as well .

"(CNN) -- With Syria limiting access to foreign journalists, Western media outlets are largely relying on amateur photos and videos to tell the story of violence on the ground. CNN, which is working to vet a wealth of material coming out of Syria, has obtained numerous graphic images of victims. Many of these cannot be aired or published because they depict scenes that could be too disturbing for the network's audience. The above gallery is a small collection of photographs, mostly from the Damascus-based Shaam News Network, an opposition media outlet. While the images contain disturbing scenes -- including slain children and a mass burial -- they help paint a portrait of the situation in Syria, which grew dramatically more violent Friday when dozens were massacred in the city of Houla. President Bashar al-Assad's regime insists it was not behind the massacre and blames terrorist groups. Opposition leaders say the massacre is the latest in Syria's crackdown against protesters.","Images from news outlets show bodies of slain children .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- The captain of the ill-fated Costa Concordia may have made ""significant"" errors that led to the vessel's wreck Friday and subsequent deaths of at least five people, the cruise line said late Sunday. ""The route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,"" Costa Cruises said in a statement. The ship's captain, Francesco Schettino, was detained Saturday for alleged manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board, chief prosecutor Francesco Verusio told Italy's ANSA state news agency. Schettino himself joined Costa Cruises as a safety officer in 2002 before being appointed captain four years later, the company said. First officer Ciro Ambrosio was being detained for questioning on similar charges, prosecutor Verusio said. Even with its admission that mistakes were made, the Genoa-based cruise company -- whose parent firm, Carnival Corp., did not respond Sunday to requests from CNN for more information -- defended the ship's crew in the face of criticism. ""It is becoming clear that the crew of the Costa Concordia acted bravely and swiftly to help evacuate more than 4,000 individuals during a very challenging situation,"" the company said, adding all crew members are trained, and the passengers earlier took part in an evacuation drill. Survivors have described the scene -- after the ship hit rocks near the island of Giglio, off the coast of Tuscany, and turned over on its side -- as ""chaos."" ""It was just battling, mad scrambles,"" U.S. student Brandon Warrick said of the fight to board lifeboats, describing it as ""a giant every man for himself."" His sister Amanda said she feared she was going to die as they waited for up to two hours for rescue. ""Waiting was definitely the worst. Because we didn't know who was going to be coming, how much longer we would have to wait,"" she said. Authorities have said at least 20 were injured due to the incident, in addition to those killed. That death toll includes two elderly people whose bodies were found, with their life jackets on, near one of the ship's restaurants, Italian Coast Guard spokesman Capt. Cosimo Nicastro told reporters Sunday. Hours earlier, crews rescued a ship employee trapped in a ship restaurant. The man -- an Italian purser whose name was not released -- was suffering from hypothermia when rescue crews found him, said Commander Filippo Marini, a spokesman for the Port Authority of Porto Santo Stefano. Earlier Sunday, before the two bodies were found, Giglio Mayor Sergio Ortelli said at least six ship workers and 11 passengers still had not been located. Authorities are reviewing passenger lists to confirm the exact number of missing people, said Giuseppe Orsina, a spokesman with the local civil protection agency. Many of those rescued in the early hours were taken to small churches and other buildings around the island for shelter. Some were still wearing the pajamas and slippers they had on, as the ship went down. ""These people could be still on the island of Giglio, in private houses or in hospitals,"" Orsina said. The U.S. Embassy in Italy, on its Twitter feed, said two of the 120 Americans who were aboard the ship still had not been accounted for. It was not clear Sunday as to the nationalities of other missing people, with CNN affiliates having reported Italians, Peruvians, Brazilians, French and Britons were all represented on the ship. There were fears the death toll could rise as rescuers searched the ship, which was nearly 50% submerged and had a gash in its hull, authorities said. As the search for survivors continued Monday, questions and criticism continued about what caused the shipwreck and the adequacy of the response. Speaking on Italian television, the ship's captain insisted the rocks that the Concordia hit were not marked on his map. ""On the nautical chart, it was marked just as water,"" Schettino said, adding that the ship was about 300 meters from shore. But Nicastro, the Coast Guard spokesman, insisted that the waters where the ship ran aground were well-mapped. Local fishermen say the island coast of Giglio is known for its rocky sea floor. ""Every danger in this area is on the nautical chart,"" Nicastro said. ""This is a place were a lot of people come for diving and sailing. ... All the dangers are known."" He said the Coast Guard was investigating why the ship took the course it did. ""We know where the ship was,"" he said. ""We know it was too close to the island. ... We don't know why."" Like a scene out of the film 'Titanic,' chaos consumed listing ship . Italian prosecutors seized the ship's data recorders Saturday, and expect to analyze them within days. Costa Cruses said Sunday that it can only access that information with authorities' permission. Built in 2006, the Concordia had been on a Mediterranean cruise from Rome with stops in Savona, Marseille, Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca, Cagliari and Palermo. The ship was carrying about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members when it ran aground and began taking on water Friday night. The crew kept going because they believed the vessel could continue sailing normally, said Nicastro, the Coast Guard spokesman. Realizing there was a significant safety problem, the commander steered the Costa Concordia closer toward the port of Giglio, he said. Authorities are looking at why the ship didn't send a mayday during the accident. Besides the two elderly people, the dead include two French tourists and a crew member from Peru, port authorities in Livorno said. One of the victims was a 65-year-old woman who died of a heart attack, authorities said. Rescuers overnight Saturday reached two South Korean passengers who had been trapped in the ship for more than 24 hours, authorities said. ""It's a miracle that we found the Korean couple alive, and we hope we'll find more people,"" said Nicastro of the Italian Coast Guard. The couple, both 29, were found in a cabin after they heard rescuers calling out and managed to make contact, according to Italy's ANSA news agency. Video showed the couple, reportedly on their honeymoon, being taken ashore and loaded into a waiting ambulance. CNN's Alexander Felton, Marilia Brocchetto, Livia Borghese, Hada Messia, Michael Martinez, Melissa Gray, Phil Gast, Chelsea J. Carter and journalist Barbie Nadeau contributed to this report.","NEW: 2 of 120 American passengers aren't accounted for, the U.S. embassy says .

"(CNN) -- Every week, there's a new Facebook thing to gripe about. This week, there have been two -- and it's only Tuesday. On Sunday, it was discovered that the 900 million-person social network was ""testing"" a feature that would let people see a digital list of the people who were nearby in real life. Called ""Find Friends Nearby,"" the app was pulled down by Tuesday morning after the Internet freaked out. Commenters said things like ""Hell to the naw"" and ""BAD FACEBOOK!!"" and generally complaining that the feature, which was difficult to find, much less use, invades privacy and will lead to stalking. If that's not enough, a company named Friendthem reportedly threatened a lawsuit, saying Facebook stole its idea for the location-aware feature. Apparently, Friendthem would like to share the heat. Item two: A blogger noticed over the weekend that Facebook, without asking permission, had changed the default e-mail addresses of all of its digital residents to @facebook.com accounts. It's easy enough to change back, as the site Lifehacker and others have detailed, but that little invasion of the hub of digital identity -- the Facebook Timeline -- was enough to make quite a few Facebookers fire back at their digital overlords. Security researchers called the move dangerous. Normal people felt violated. ""Up next: Facebook inside your underwear drawer!"" a commenter wrote on our site. So that was this week. But it seems like every week has been feeling a little like that. The fact that an anti-Facebook sentiment bubbles beneath the currents of modern life is, of course, nothing new. When the company introduced the now-popular News Feed in September 2006, users threw a fit -- and many abandoned the young network, at least for a moment. Let's put the brakes on for just a second and ask a few questions: . Are people mad about Facebook's individual decisions -- the e-mail, the tracking, the News Feed -- or do the roots of this discontent reach into deeper, darker places? If it's the latter, why are people so continually frustrated? Do we hold Facebook to too high of a standard? Is the social network turning its back on users? Or is it just that our digital lives are now so invested in Facebook that it would be nearly impossible to pull out at this point -- and, because of that, we feel helpless? Here are a few theories about what's actually going on with people's unhappiness with Facebook. Take a look and let us know which you think is most accurate -- or offer up a theory of your own -- in the comments. Facebook has become an octopus . And by ""octopus"" we mean it's got too many tentacles to manage. This theory is put forward by the blog the Next Web, which says Facebook is buying too many new companies -- Instagram, Glancee -- and trying too many new things. (This is a critique more commonly lobbed at Google, especially when it was launching one product after the next that flopped: Google Wave, Google Buzz, etc., etc.) ""When you start packing in more features while you're removing none of them, feature creep will happen and users will start to ask the question 'Why can't they just make it easy for me to talk to my friends?' "" Drew Olanoff wrote. ""After all, that's why people started leaving MySpace to go to Facebook in the first place, because it simply tried to do too much."" Writing for Forbes, Kashmir Hill puts it this way: ""Facebook would love to be the all-inclusive resort of the Web, replete with complementary digital daiquiris (that you're forced to chug) upon entry."" Facebook is a technocracy, and we want a democracy . As Alexis Madrigal writes for the Atlantic, Facebook has evolved into a ""technocracy"": a government of sorts that's run by engineers who value efficiency above all else. When you complain to the real-world government, you can expect a response -- or you can use your voting power (or run for office) to push for change. At Facebook, 2 million complaints per week are handled largely by computers and a staff of a few hundred people. Their aim is to process as many issues per day as possible, to help people connect and, as Madrigal puts it, to stop people from leaving the site ""by minimizing their negative experiences."" ""Facebook's desire for efficiency means democracy is out and technocratic, developer-king rule is in,"" he writes. Even when the site does give its users a chance to weigh in on policy, Madrigal says, users don't take up the offer. In a vote about a recent privacy policy change, 0.038% of users participated. There's no competition . Hope and pray all you want, but there's no other online social network with 900 million people. Chances are, most of your friends are on Facebook, so even if you try to go to a competing network like Google+, it might be as fun as talking to your cat. Here's a list of alternatives from our What's Next blog, but none of them seems like actual competition in terms of numbers. Facebook cares more about investors than users . Facebook went public this year, leading to criticisms that the site's motives have changed. Is it focused on cash instead of users? While that complaint may be premature -- CEO Mark Zuckerberg maintains a majority stake in the company, so he doesn't have to listen to investors and his board all that much -- the company's IPO, and the billionaires and millionaires who resulted from it, doubtlessly cloud how people see Facebook's motives. And it doesn't help to know that, in mid-May, you were worth only $1.21 to Facebook. ""How much does Facebook value its users? In strictly monetary terms, about as much as a bag of chips,"" David Goldman wrote for our sister site CNNMoney.com. Or, as Slate put it, Facebook is ""conducting an experiment in corporate dictatorship nearly without precedent for such a large and high-profile company."" Facebook is no fun (anymore ...) I put the question of what's really wrong with Facebook out on my Google Plus feed, in part because that network is a hotbed for Facebook defectors. Several followers brought up interesting points, the simplest of which is that Facebook, as it grew, became un-fun. ""Facebook started as a social network that was 'fun' to update your friends and classmates (since it started for-college students only) and grew into something that can affect your career, reputation and invade your privacy,"" one user, identified as Julie Hancher, wrote. Here's another thought, from a person identified as Robert Sons: . ""Bombardment with stories you don't care about from people you barely care about. Depression that you're jealously stalking other's lives instead of living your own. Shallowness of content. The more content you absorb, the less valuable your own posts seem."" And I'll give the final word to Carlos Ochoa, who wrote, simply: ""Everyone uses Facebook but nobody likes it."" Let us know what you think in the comments below.","Two incidents this week cause backlash against Facebook .
The company changes users' e-mail addresses, tests ""Find Friends"" feature .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Nine bodyguards for Iraq's finance minister have been arrested, Abdul Sattar al-Berqdar, a spokesman for the Supreme Judicial Council, told Iraqi state TV on Friday. The announcement came a day after Finance Minister Rafei al-Essawi, who is Sunni, told the opposition Sharqiya TV that 150 members of his staff and their guards had been kidnapped. But a spokesman for his office, who cited the sensitivity of the issue in asking not to be identified, said Friday that only the guards were detained, and that they were arrested, not abducted. In addition, the Supreme Judicial Council spokesman told Iraqiya state television that the security commander of the finance minister's protection regiment was arrested Wednesday. Al-Berqdar told the channel that the security chief had admitted during interrogation that he committed ""terrorist"" acts. The finance minister said Thursday that he holds Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki responsible for the safety of the people who were abducted when ""a militia force"" raided his house, headquarters and ministry in Baghdad. The Shia-led Iraqi government says they were detained by police, not by any militia. Read more: 150 kidnapped from Finance Ministry, minister says . Members of al-Essawi's staff and guards were among those kidnapped Thursday from the ministry, the finance minister said. He also said that his computers and documents were searched at his house and headquarters. He said his security commander had been arrested Wednesday for unknown reasons at a Baghdad checkpoint and that the compound had no security. Al-Essawi, who has a large base of Sunni support, said he had tried without success to reach al-Maliki. ""My message to the prime minister: You are a man who does not respect partnership at all, a man who does not respect the law and the constitution, and I personally hold you fully responsible for the safety of the kidnapped people,"" al-Essawi said Thursday. He called for the release of his staff and guards and for a no-confidence vote against al-Maliki in parliament. Al-Maliki on Friday rejected al-Essawi's assertions, suggesting that some politicians chose to ""fabricate political crises"" when they disagreed with the action taken by authorities, judicial or not. ""Based on arrest warrants issued by the Iraqi judiciary, a police force has carried out its duty and arrested 10 people of the finance minister's bodyguards after checking their identities, and they are now in the custody of the Iraqi judiciary,"" al-Maliki said in a statement issued by his office. ""We were very surprised by linking the issue of detainees with the political differences and even by trying to drag the whole country toward sectarian strife,"" he said. The leader said the Iraqi people had already paid a high price for sectarian conflict and could not return to it, and he criticized the finance minister for calling the Iraqi security forces ""a militia force,"" saying many of them had sacrificed their lives to achieve stability and security in the country. Earlier Friday, thousands of people in Falluja, a predominantly Sunni city west of the capital, protested the arrest of the bodyguards. The protesters also demanded the immediate release of those kidnapped. ""Stop this charade!"" they chanted in a reference to what they said were al-Maliki's actions. The incident highlights a growing distrust between Sunni and Shiite politicians in Iraq, as well as concerns about the independence of Iraq's judiciary. Read more: Iraqi president heads to Germany for medical treatment . Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlaq, who is Sunni, addressed reporters on behalf of the Iraqiya List, which won the largest number of seats in the March 2010 national elections. ""The Iraqiya List demands either to ensure the integrity and independence of the judiciary system in Iraq or it will withdraw completely from the Iraqi parliament and from the political process in general,"" al-Mutlaq said. The multi-sectarian Iraqiya List, headed by former Shiite Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, garnered most of the Sunni Arab vote. Sunnis largely boycotted the 2005 elections, leading to the emergence of a Shiite-led government. The move left the once-ruling minority disaffected, which contributed to years of bloody insurgency and sectarian warfare. The incidents follow the troubles of Iraq's fugitive Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who was sentenced to death in September, accused in the deaths of a lawyer and an army general. Al-Hashimi, who is Sunni and now lives in Istanbul, denies the charges and says the accusations are politically motivated.","Nuri al-Maliki rejects claims against him, says Iraq has seen enough sectarian strife .

"(CNN) -- The possibility of sinking is the last thing you want to think about when booking a carefree vacation at sea. Yet colorful ads depicting people having the time of their lives on cruise ships are now competing with frightening footage of Costa Concordia passengers, some still elegantly dressed for dinner, on a desperate quest to escape the ship. The vessel struck rocks off the western Italian coast Friday night and rolled onto its side, leaving at least 11 people dead. ""This isn't some tugboat off Italy. This is a very modern cruise ship, very similar to ships that are currently in the Caribbean,"" said Fran Golden, a cruise expert and contributor for Budget Travel. ""I don't think anybody could predict that a modern, beautiful cruise ship only six years old would hit a rock and sink,"" she told CNN's Early Start. So it's no wonder some travelers may be questioning just how safe cruising is. ""It sure does frighten me, a longtime cruiser,"" wrote Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor-in-chief of CruiseCritic.com, about how quickly things went wrong on the Concordia. ""This was a systemic failure that should rock the cruise line to its core."" But the cruise industry says there's very little to worry about, despite the incident. About 16 million people took a vacation at sea last year, according to the Cruise Lines International Association, which represents 26 major cruise lines. The group called Friday's incident a terrible tragedy, but asked travelers to keep it in perspective. ""Accidents such as this one are an extremely rare occurrence in the cruise industry, and cruising continues to be one of the safest means of travel among all types of vacationing,"" the association said on its website. Modern cruise ships have sophisticated equipment designed to keep them on course, steer them away from bad weather and keep them steady in rough seas. Still, accidents and unpredictable acts of nature do happen. Overheard on CNN.com: Worst-case scenario . Some recent examples include the Louis Majesty, part of the Greece-based Louis Cruise Lines. In 2010, two passengers were killed and 14 were injured when 26-foot waves crashed into the ship off northeast Spain. In 2007, the Sea Diamond, a Greek cruise ship that was carrying 1,156 passengers and 391 crew members, sank off the Aegean island of Santorini after slamming into a volcanic reef. Two passengers were reported missing after the incident and were never found. To know how to survive an emergency, cruise passengers are required by law to attend a safety briefing within 24 hours of embarkation. Costa Cruises says most passengers on board the Costa Concordia took part in an evacuation drill. During a typical muster drill, the ship sounds the signals that would call people to their lifeboat stations so they know what to do if there is something wrong. But passenger Benji Smith said the safety briefing was more of a ""sales pitch"" for shore excursions. Others, who embarked at Civitavecchia, about an hour's train ride from Rome, had yet to have the briefing. Nancy Lofaro, a passenger from New Rochelle, New York, said the drill was scheduled for Saturday, a day after the disaster. Lofaro also said it appeared the crew didn't really know what to do during the emergency. The confusion may have been caused in part by communication problems, Golden said. Unlike ships cruising in the Caribbean, Costa gets passengers from many countries and thus passengers speak different languages. ""I can only imagine the chaos of trying to communicate to passengers from, maybe, eight different languages how to get off the ship,"" Golden said. What caused the cruise ship disaster? The incident underscores the importance of safety drills and paying attention to them, she added. ""People go on a cruise, and they think they're in this protected wonderland, and the reality is you always need to have safety in the forefront of your thinking,"" Golden said. ""I've seen passengers go to the life boat drills and the crew do honest efforts to have you learn how to put on your life vest, and meanwhile, people are trying to get drinks and take photos."" Crew training in emergency response also is key. A lot of the training is done by the cruise lines themselves based on international maritime standards, Golden said. The Coast Guard inspects foreign-flagged cruise ships in U.S. waters twice a year, studying the competency of the crew during fire and abandon-ship drills, said Cmdr. Buddy Reams, chief of the U.S. Coast Guard's Cruise Ship National Center of Expertise. Still, no matter how many safety and training protocols are in place, the image of a submerged Costa Concordia will stay burned in people's minds when they decide if they're going to take a cruise, said Jonathan Bricker, a psychologist at the University of Washington. To prevent any decline in bookings, the cruise industry will have to communicate how safe cruising actually is, he added. That said, ""The vast majority of people who are planning to take a cruise are probably still going to take the cruise. And they're going to be fine,"" Bricker said. CNN's Katia Hetter and Marnie Hunter contributed to this report.","""It sure does frighten me, a longtime cruiser,"" editor-in-chief of CruiseCritic.com writes .

"(CNN) -- Julian Assange considers himself the ""lightning rod"" for WikiLeaks, which has been beset by internal strife over the past several months. And while Friday he wanted to talk about the release of Iraq War documents he said showed ""compelling evidence of war crimes"" committed by U.S.-led coalition and Iraqi government forces, Assange faces both professional and personal challenges. In an exclusive interview Friday with CNN, the WikiLeaks editor-in-chief dismissed reports of internal disputes within the organization, chalking them up to a small handful of disgruntled employees who had been suspended. Assange, who is being investigated by Swedish authorities in two separate cases of rape and molestation, would not discuss its potential impact on the organization. Since the July publication of the Afghan War Diary, a massive, searchable database containing more than 70,000 classified documents about the Afghanistan War, some in the mostly secretive group of volunteers have quit, citing disagreements with the way the group conducts business and Assange's personality and style. ""This organization does not let anyone hang out to dry,"" Assange said Friday. ""We always expect tremendous criticism. It is my role to be the lightning rod ... to attract the attacks against the organization for our work, and that is a difficult role."" ""On the other hand,"" he said, ""I get undue credit."" Some of the attacks have come from within WikiLeaks. Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a longtime volunteer and spokesman for WikiLeaks, quit last month. He told CNN that Assange's personality was distracting from the group's original mission: to publish small leaks, not just huge, splashy ones like the Afghan War Diary. WiiLeaks' new spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said the material WikiLeaks publishes is far more important than the organization or Assange, and it has tried to convey that. ""In the history of Wikileaks, nobody has claimed that the material being put out is not authentic,"" he said. When he left WikiLeaks, Domscheit-Berg said the site was flooded with new submissions from several countries that have not been published. ""There is now more information than can be handled,"" Domscheit-Berg said. In the past few weeks, a large number of new volunteers have joined WikiLeaks to replace volunteers who have left, he said. WikiLeaks may be down, he said, but it's far from out. Money has also been an issue. Last week, a British company that had been collecting donations for WikiLeaks ended its relationship with the organization. Examining leaks is ""a very expensive process,"" Assange said in August. Shortly after the Afghan War Diary leak, prosecutors in Sweden announced that they are investigating Assange in two separate cases of rape and molestation. ""There is reason to believe that a crime has been committed,"" Marianne Ny, Sweden's director of public prosecutions, said in a statement last month. ""Considering information available at present, my judgment is that the classification of the crime is rape."" She said more investigation is necessary before she can make a final decision. Assange has maintained he's innocent and told the Arabic-language television network Al-Jazeera the accusations were a ""smear campaign."" This week, his application for residency in Sweden was rejected because it failed to fulfill all the requirements. A Swedish immigration official declined to elaborate. Assange, who is mercurial in interviews, answered CNN's questions Friday about strife within WikiLeaks, but repeatedly declined to answer questions about the rape and molestation investigation and what the allegations may mean to the organization. ""This interview is about something else. I will have to walk if you are,"" Assange said. ""If you are going to contaminate this extremely serious interview with questions about my personal life."" Moments later, Assange walked off the set in London. ""OK, sorry,"" he said. CNN's Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Editor-in-chief Julian Assange says he is WikiLeaks' ""lightning rod""

"(EW.com) -- It's official: The Duchess of Cambridge has given birth to the future monarch of the United Kingdom. Of course, as I write this, mere moments after the blessed event, very little is known about the newest member of the House of Windsor. Will the little prince have its mother's good looks or its father's good looks pre-baldness? Where does it stand on the phone-hacking controversy? Will he marry North West or Blue Ivy Carter? One thing's for sure: The royal baby is going to have a wild life ahead of him. He'll probably live for at least a century, if the genes are any indication. He will need to learn some valuable lessons. And what better place to begin the Royal Baby's education than Game of Thrones, a TV show about crisscrossing royal bloodlines and fancy accents? Like the George R. R. Martin books that inspired it, Thrones is set in Westeros, which is basically England in the Middle Ages with more dragons and fewer magical swords. Here are ten lessons that'll guarantee that King No-Name doesn't lose his head, metaphorically speaking. 1. Stay on good terms with your family members. All of your family members. Siblings, parents, uncles, even embarrassing cousins. Seriously, you have to spend the rest of your life with these people, and if you aren't careful, one of them might send their illegitimate magical shadow-baby to stab you in the back. 2. When traveling, it's always better if you can speak the local language. Daenerys Targaryen Ã¢â¬â aka Daenerys Stormborn, aka Khaleesi, aka Dragon Lady Ã¢â¬â spends most of her days traveling from foreign city to foreign city. Local lords always think they can fool her. But she speaks the local language and studies the history of every spot she visits; very often, she becomes more popular with the local citizens than their own government. (Sometimes, she becomes the local government.) 3. Pay attention to your subjects in the outer provinces. Because everyone on Game of Thrones is too busy with the palace intrigue in Game of Thrones, nobody ever pays any attention to the poor Night's Watch, even though they keep sending increasingly-urgent messages about an army of attacking ice-zombies. What I'm saying is, don't forget about Canada, okay? 4. Don't trust eunuchs. Although they make excellent bodyguards. 5. Don't trust your friends. They will betray you. 6. Don't trust your enemies. They don't play fair. 7. Actually, don't trust anyone. Especially not in Vegas. 8. Winter is Coming. Since you live in England, it's pretty much always winter. Put on a coat! 9. The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. Since you have no actual political power, the moral of this lesson is basically that you should carry a sword on you at all times. You're royalty, gosh darn it! If you can't carry a sword, who can? You think Prime Minister David Cameron can wield a sword? Yeesh, speaking of eunuchs, amiright? #BritishPoliticalHumour . 10.

"(CNN) -- Should young children be able to use Facebook? And if so, under what conditions? Those are the questions bloggers and Twitter users are batting around the Internet on Monday following a news report saying Facebook is looking into ways it could let kids under the age of 13 use the site with parental consent. Currently, Facebook bans children younger than 13. Data from Microsoft Research and Consumer Reports, however, show that many kids use the site anyway, often with their parents' knowledge. A 2011 Consumer Reports survey found 7.5 million people younger than 13 use the site; nearly a third of 11-year-olds and more than half of 12-year-olds use Facebook with their parents' knowledge, according to a 1,007-person survey supported by Microsoft Research. Proponents of lifting Facebook's under-13 ban say letting young kids on Facebook with the help of adults would allow them to use the social network more safely. ""Whether we like it or not, millions of children are using Facebook, and since there doesn't seem to be a universally effective way to get them off the service, the best and safest strategy would be to provide younger children with a safe, secure and private experience that allows them to interact with verified friends and family members without having to lie about their age,"" Larry Magid writes at Forbes.com. Magid says Facebook for kids should not have ads and there need to be ""extra privacy protections"" that would involve parents helping their kids to use the social network safely. Others say Facebook is trying to profit from the under-13 crowd. Common Sense Media, an advocacy group, compared Facebook to ""Big Tobacco."" Poll: Should kids younger than 13 be allowed to use Facebook? ""With the growing concerns and pressure around Facebook's business model, the company appears to be doing whatever it takes to identify new revenue streams and short-term corporate profits to impress spooked shareholders,"" the group's CEO, James Steyer, said in a statement. ""But here's the most important issue: There is absolutely no proof of any meaningful social or educational value of Facebook for children under 13. Indeed, there are very legitimate concerns about privacy as well as the impact on the social, emotional and cognitive development of children. What Facebook is proposing is similar to the strategies used by Big Tobacco in appealing to young people -- try to hook kids early, build your brand, and you have a customer for life. ""What's next? Facebook for toddlers?"" The Wall Street Journal on Monday published a front-page report saying Facebook is looking into ways to give younger children access to the social-networking site, which has more than 900 million users around the world and which made its lackluster stock market debut last month. ""Mechanisms being tested include connecting children's accounts to their parents' and controls that would allow parents to decide whom their kids can 'friend' and what applications they can use,"" the newspaper said, citing anonymous sources who are familiar with the dealings. ""The under-13 features could enable Facebook and its partners to charge parents for games and other entertainment accessed by their children, the people said."" In a statement issued to CNN and other news outlets, Facebook did not deny looking into the issue but said it does not have anything formal to announce: . ""Many recent reports have highlighted just how difficult it is to enforce age restrictions on the Internet, especially when parents want their children to access online content and services. We are in continuous dialogue with stakeholders, regulators and other policymakers about how best to help parents keep their kids safe in an evolving online environment."" What do you think? Let us know in the comments below.","Wall Street Journal: Facebook is looking at ways to let young kids onto the site .

"(CNN) -- A lot of Americans probably look at the teachers strike in Chicago and think that this is just another labor dispute with workers making demands and causing a work stoppage until they get what they want. But the Chicago teachers strike, which is causing turmoil in the nation's third-largest school system by shutting out of the public schools more than 350,000 students, is about a lot more than that. It's not really about money. The deal on the table isn't too shabby. City officials are offering teachers a 16% salary increase over the next four years. Chicago teachers already earn an average annual salary of $74,236, according to a study by Northern Illinois University in DeKalb. These aren't exactly blue-collar workers in hardhats trying to scratch out an existence. Even Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis has said that the city's offer is ""not far apart"" from what the union is seeking. This strike is about teachers unions testing their boundaries with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. They're hitting back at him for what they perceive to be the anti-union hardline position he took shortly after assuming office last year. More importantly, the strike is about something that isn't often discussed in the media or in politics: Democrats are divided on education reform. In one camp, you have reformers who believe that all children can learn and that teachers and schools have to be held accountable for making sure that happens. In the other camp, you have teachers unions, whose job it is to protect their members but who now interpret that mandate to mean that they should protect teachers from public demands for greater accountability, higher standards and a better education for our children. The strike is testing the relationship between unions and the Obama administration, with which Emanuel is closely aligned having served as White House chief of staff. These days, support for Obama from organized labor is lukewarm at best. Labor unions did not spend as much money as they typically do in support of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. This was in part because union officials were angry that the event was held in the right-to-work state of North Carolina. Plus many of them do not think that Obama has been responsive to their concerns. Teachers unions are especially angry with Obama, and with Education Secretary Arne Duncan, for adopting a policy that closely resembles that of their nemesis. George W. Bush had ""No Child Left Behind."" Obama has ""Race to the Top."" Both advocate high-stakes testing where teachers and schools are evaluated based largely on the academic performance of students and rewarded accordingly. (By the way, judging producers by their products happens all the time in the private sector. Only in a public school system where mediocrity and low expectations are the new normal would that be considered a radical concept.) The Chicago Teachers Union has never gotten over its resentment for Duncan, who served as Chicago superintendent of schools from 2001 to 2009 and implemented many of the same accountability measures that Bush and Obama embraced. That's why Lewis this week said this at a rally in downtown Chicago, ""The revolution will not be standardized. The assault on public education started here. It needs to end here."" And, as Lewis sees it, who started the ""assault"" on public education? Arne Duncan. With the strike, the Chicago Teachers Union is sending a strong message to Washington -- to both Obama and Duncan -- that it is in charge of what goes on in the public schools, and it won't be dictated to by politicians in Chicago or Washington. And not even Democrats, especially not Democrats to whom teachers unions have given tons of money over the years. The teachers unions want politicians to know that the teachers they represent are sick and tired of standardized tests, merit pay and attempts to lengthen the school day. Maybe they just want to be paid more and more while less and less is expected of them. After all, tragically, that's the modern American Way. So will the strike affect the presidential election at all? Mitt Romney wasted no time in criticizing the Chicago strike. That was a low-hanging fruit. His Republican base does not look favorably on unions and strikes anyway, and they know the score -- that the money that unions pour into elections on the side of Democrats often makes it harder for them to elect Republicans. For Obama, the strike could turn into a headache. He would clearly love to stay out of it, but that might not be possible if the work stoppage drags on much longer. Obama will have to do something that he is often reluctant to do when it could alienate supporters -- show leadership. Obviously, when it comes to education, Chicago Democrats are one big dysfunctional family that is feuding. Well, it's time to put a stop to it. Emanuel needs to assert control over this situation. The strike has gone on for a full school week. That's long enough, especially since it isn't really about achieving a better deal for members as much as it is sending messages and settling scores. If the teachers aren't back in their classrooms on Monday, the mayor needs to decertify the union, fire the teachers and hire replacements. It's been done before. In February 2009, at Central Falls High School in Rhode Island, the school board voted to dismiss the entire faculty -- including more than 70 teachers -- as part of a dramatic turnaround plan. The school had a graduation rate of less than 50%. The teachers were hired back a few months later after they agreed to certain concessions. At the time, Obama and Duncan supported the firing, which is another reason why teachers unions don't like this administration. ""Rahm-bo"" has a reputation as a tough guy in standing up to Republicans. Now, if he wants to be a public servant and not just a partisan, it's time for him to be just as tough in standing up to members of his party. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Chicago teachers strike is affecting more than 350,000 students .

"(CNN) -- Facebook's IPO was all the rage Friday. Retail investors -- people like you, me and our neighbors -- flocked to the offering in hopes of returning to those glory days when a dramatic rise in stock price was a given. But, alas, like so many recent IPOs, Facebook languished near its offering price on its first day and dropped on subsequent days of trading. It could have been worse. Disgruntled investors had ample opportunity to sell Friday afternoon once technical issues at Nasdaq were resolved. Those who chose to sell did so at a profit. Investors in some other IPOs never have the chance to recoup what they put in. For example, PetroLogistics, a company that owns the world's largest propane processing plant, began trading below its offering price in early May. Nearly a month later, the stock still trades below what original investors paid. So if profits aren't guaranteed, why the uproar over Facebook's IPO? Because an analyst at Morgan Stanley, the investment bank which set the offering price, released a report lowering the financial forecast for the company just before the offering. Angry stockholders allege the report was released only to a select circle of institutional investors, who then headed for the door. Consequently, most investors were left to shoulder the loss. If this feels unfair to you, you're not alone. After all, why should you have to lose out? After the dot-com crash, WorldCom and Enron, Congress included provisions in the much maligned Sarbanes-Oxley legislation to address potential conflicts of interest. Among other things, the bill led to a so-called ""Chinese Wall"" separating communication between investment bank research analysts and underwriters. However last month a bipartisan bill, innocuously named the JOBS Act, rolled back these and other investor protections for companies with less than $1 billion in revenue, deemed emerging growth companies. Once again, research analysts can communicate directly with management and if desired share favorable (or unfavorable) reports. Under these new rules it is only a matter of time before an enterprising young analyst crosses the line and writes an ethically questionable report. Prior to Sarbanes-Oxley, researchers at Cornell and Dartmouth universities found that analysts affiliated with the underwriting bank issued buy ratings to prop up dropping stocks, only to watch the stocks drop further after the buy rating was issued. This was in direct contrast to reports written by unaffiliated analysts, where stocks rose following a buy rating. The differences in performance were staggering. For markets to function effectively, investors need to trust the information reported by companies, and research analysts need to be able to act independently. Investors should remember that any stock can lose value no matter how much hype surrounds the company, and that research analysts have many bosses -- not just the small investors on the streets. Congress must create a level playing field such that every investor has a fair shake, not just those who have special access. Facebook was just a warning. The real risk lies in the countless other IPOs less likely to receive so much scrutiny and spotlight. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Wessels.","Investors are suing Facebook about withholding information on the company's IPO .

"(CNN) -- Singaporeans don't normally gather in public protest. Decades of single party rule and an iron hand when it comes to dissent has shaped a somewhat meek public. But a proposal by the government to allow more immigrants to come to Singapore in the next few decades to make up for a population shortfall has emboldened citizens to go public. On Saturday, several thousand Singaporeans gathered in a small downtown park near an area known as ""Speaker's Corner"" to vent their anger. Organizers estimated the crowd to between 3,000 and 4,000 and said it was the largest gathering since post-independence Singapore in 1965. Singapore police told CNN they don't give crowd estimates. At the heart of the issue is a so-called ""White Paper on Population"" recently issued by the government that proposes allowing the population to rise from 5.3 million to as high as 6.9 million by 2030 in order to keep the economy growing and to keep it a magnet country for business. The government also says foreigners are needed to take care of the country's own rapidly aging population. Protesters on Saturday insisted they didn't fear foreigners but worry about the loss of Singaporean jobs to foreigners, depressed wages and overcrowding that has taxed Singapore's infrastructure, including housing and transportation. Protesters also say the government's plans will make them a minority in their own country. ""Imagine a place where you can be a stranger in your own home,"" a protester said. Like many developed nations, not enough people are having babies. For more than three decades, the country's fertility rate has been below replacement level, meaning Singaporeans aren't having enough babies to replace themselves. This has had a huge impact on a tiny country striving to be a booming economy. The government has relied on foreigners to fill executive ranks, as well as to perform low-wage jobs from construction to cleaning. While the country is one of the world's wealthiest, it also has an enormous income disparity between rich and poor. Protesters say Singaporeans would have more babies if they were more confident of their economic prospects, and that the government should rely less on cheaper foreign labor and improve the wages of Singaporeans.","Singapore government wants to increase population by allowing more immigrants .

"(CNN) -- In what the interior minister calls one of Spain's largest operations against al Qaeda, security services said Thursday they arrested three suspected terrorists who might have been plotting attacks on U.S. or British targets. Two of the men were arrested Wednesday and the third Thursday, Spanish Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said. The Interior Ministry said the men were ""ready to act in Spain and Europe."" One of the men is Turkish, and the other two are believed to be of Russian-Chechen origin. Police sources said they had gathered enough explosives to ""blow up a bus."" The two men arrested Wednesday were on a bus traveling to France when police detained them, and Diaz said they ""resisted fiercely."" Police sources said they were stopped in Almuradiel, a town about midway between Madrid and the country's southern coast. Previously on CNN.com: Spanish ETA terror suspects arrested in London . The third was held in the province of Cadiz on Spain's southern coast. The investigation is in its early stages, but Spanish security services say the men were most likely plotting to attack the joint U.S.-Spanish naval base at Rota or British interests in Gibraltar, according to Fernando Reinares, a senior international terrorism analyst at The Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid who was briefed by Spanish security services on the investigation. They base their belief on a number of factors: The group's capabilities; the proximity of the targets -- Rota is in Cadiz and Gibraltar is adjacent to it; and the fact that several of the men had mastered flying motorized paragliders, which leads investigators to believe the group may have been plotting to launch an attack from the air. The Turkish man also worked in Gibraltar, Reinares said. According to Reinares, Spanish security services believe the alleged cell might have also been plotting a terrorist attack in France, leading to the two arrests on the bus to France. Security services don't rule out the possibility they had planned an attack elsewhere in Europe, though no intelligence indicates they were a threat to the London Olympics, Reinares said. Explosives were found in the apartment of one of the suspects in the area of San Roque, just across the border from Gibraltar, and security services believe more explosives were removed from the apartment in the past two days, Reinares said. Spanish police are still searching for explosives in the neighboring town of San Roque, where they suspect the men had stored bombs and documents. Wiretaps indicate that the Turkish citizen's wife had ""removed evidence from the house"" before the arrest. They are also analyzing the computers and files on a laptop that belonged to one of the arrested men. Read more about al Qaeda on CNN's Security Clearance blog . One of the Chechen suspects was a ""true specialist in chemicals,"" security services told Reinares. Authorities did not release the men's names, but a police source gave the Chechen suspects' initials as A.A.A. and M.A., and the Turkish suspect's initials as C.Y. The source said the men were carrying no documentation when they were arrested. Spanish security services suspect the alleged terrorist cell of having ties to the Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, Reinares told CNN, and they believe one or more of the trio received terrorist training in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The alleged cell was first detected in Spain around a month ago but had been previously tracked by other Western intelligence agencies, according to the Spanish Interior Ministry. Spain's interior minister said the suspects had information about remote-controlled airplanes, and some of them ""have experience producing explosives and car bombs and training in shooting."" Reinares said the alleged terrorist cell's operation was different from other recent terrorist plots in Spain that were the work of ""self-starting, self-radicaling"" Islamist militants. He said Spanish investigators believe this cell was dispatched from overseas to carry out a terrorist attack. Reinares said this was not the first alleged terrorist cell linked to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba to be arrested in Spain. A group linked to a militant with ties to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba who had trained in Kashmir was arrested in Barcelona in 2004. Indian and Western intelligence officials suspect that Lashkar-e-Tayyiba is responsible for the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks and that it has established closer ties with al Qaeda in recent years. One of its members was David Headley, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani descent, who was convicted of helping to plan the Mumbai attacks and plotting to attack a Danish newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. According to court documents, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba commissioned Headley to research targeting the newspaper, but the group never went through with the plot. A jihadist website associated with al Qaeda posted a request earlier this year asking for ""lone wolves living among the enemy"" who could speak Spanish, a request that Spanish police interpret as a call for suicide bombers. Journalist Javier Ruiz contributed to this report.","NEW: Security services: Men were most likely plotting attacks on U.S., British targets .

"(LifeWire) -- At Sara Champion's previous job as a project engineer for one of the country's top construction firms, visible tattoos for professional staff were against company policy. Sarah Champion's former employer told her that she had to conceal her tattoos while at work. She found this ironic -- not to mention frustrating -- given that her position entailed inspecting job sites filled with tattooed construction workers. ""I was out on site all day, and I wasn't allowed to show any of my tattoos,"" says the 28-year-old Florida native, whose six large tattoos on her arms and back include a brightly colored sunflower, a marigold and a rendition of a Dia de los Muertos bride and groom on her upper left arm. ""Ninety-eight degrees and long sleeves is not so cool when you're in Miami."" After six years with the construction firm, Champion decided to move north and find an employer that wouldn't needle her about her body art. She found her ""perfect job"" in Danbury, Connecticut, as a project manager at a design and branding agency. Now, ""I have no problem showing up to meet a big client in a T-shirt and jeans,"" tattoos in plain view, she says. ""I wish more companies were like this."" iReport.com: Share your tattoo stories . The times, they are not a-changing? According to a 2006 report in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, 24 percent of Americans ages 18 to 50 have at least one tattoo, and 14 percent have at least one body piercing. Researchers questioned 253 women and 247 men via random telephone survey. So, does the fact that body art is as prevalent today as mullets were in the 1980s mean that the tattoo-friendly tide is turning in the workplace? ""That question is best answered by [corporate] culture and by industry,"" says Jackie Valent, director of human resources in the Milwaukee office of accounting giant Deloitte. ""If you look at a company like Google, a very entrepreneurial, Silicon Valley organization, tattoos are more acceptable."" ""But if you look at the other end of the spectrum, which is where I happen to [work],"" says the 20-year human resources veteran, ""the answer is absolutely not. If you have six piercings and a big tattoo, we're going to tell you to cover the tattoos and take out the piercings."" (For the record, a Google spokesperson said that the company does not have a policy on tattoos.) Amy Derick, a dermatologist from Barrington, Illinois and a co-author of the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology study, isn't surprised that a few companies or industries are still opposed to body art. ""Eight percent of people with tattoos report trouble at work,"" from being forced to hide them to being restricted from performing certain tasks, Derick says. For example, a grocery store employee with a tattoo on their hand might be asked to perform tasks less likely to bring them into contact with the public, like stocking shelves instead of working a register. Better safe than cited . What's the solution for body art aficionados who work in one of the more conservative business sectors? Hide your body art or starve? Pretty much, says Dave Kimelberg, who photographed 15 professionals with large-scale tattoos they conceal at work for the book ""INKED Inc."" and runs InkedInc.com, a related Web site. ""I think in some ways, it's a 'don't ask, don't tell' understanding,"" says the 37-year-old Boston lawyer, who works as general counsel for a venture capital firm. ""There's kind of this Superman element to it, like this crazy blue and red skin-tight suit underneath my Clark Kent exterior."" Like many of the secretly inked doctors, lawyers, and architects he's met over the years, Kimelberg sticks to tattoos he can easily conceal under clothing at work -- in his case, three-quarter ""ink sleeves"" that extend from each shoulder to the middle of his forearms but allow him to roll up his shirt sleeves on warm days. And while the ink's out of the bag now that Kimelberg's published his book, he still keeps his tats under wraps for fear of them being ""a distraction in the workplace."" The same goes for Kasey Broach, a public relations specialist at a Phoenix law firm. To commemorate turning 25 and getting her MBA this year, she got a small omega symbol tattooed at the base of her neck in ultraviolet ink, which can only be seen with a black light. ""No one knows about it unless I show them,"" she says. ""I have to bring the black light out from my high school years."" Where the body art roams . But what if you're not a doctor, lawyer, or accountant, but a creative type determined to find a job where you can bare your body ink? That's when it's time to play detective, says career coach Janet Scarborough Civitelli. ""Visit the employee parking lot to see how they are dressed and whether many of the employees have visible tattoos,"" says the psychologist and founder of Bridgeway Career Development, a career counseling firm in Seattle. ""Also ask colleagues and friends if they know anyone who works there who can give you some insider info."" ""The Web is also a gold mine of information,"" she says, adding that the Web site ModifiedMind.com, which is dedicated to body art and other modifications, features a database of companies reportedly open to tattoos. Then again, if a no-tattoo policy is your deal breaker, you could take a gamble like Sara Champion did during the interview for her current position: . ""I said, 'Are you tattoo friendly?'"" Fortunately, the answer was yes. LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers. Michelle Goodman is a freelance writer and author of ""The Anti 9-to-5 Guide: Practical Career Advice for Women Who Think Outside the Cube.""","Report: 24 percent of Americans ages 18 to 50 have at least one tattoo .

"(CNN) -- Facebook really wants to know what you look like. The social network this week acquired Face.com, a face-recognition technology company whose Facebook and mobile apps can identify people's faces in photos. One of Face.com's apps, KLIK, aims to identify Facebook friends' faces on mobile-phone photos as they're taken. ""Fire up KLIK and watch as your friends' names instantly appear next to their faces before or after you snap a photo,"" the company says on its iTunes page for the app. ""If KLIK doesn't recognize a face use the new 'Learn' mode to train and improve recognition."" Another app, PhotoTagger, works with Facebook to ""auto-tag"" faces in photo albums. It's unclear exactly how Facebook plans to incorporate the technology and employees of Face.com, which it purchased for between $55 million and $100 million, according to news reports. (The exact terms of the deal haven't been disclosed.) But Mike Isaac, a blogger at All Things D, says it's likely that Facebook wants to use the company's mobile experience to improve the face-detection technology on its smartphone and tablet apps. ""Currently, Facebook's tagging suggestion feature does not work for mobile devices as well as it does on desktops, so it's possible that Face.com could make it faster for mobile users to tag from their mobile uploads with less friction,"" he writes. ""And that timing makes sense, considering that Facebook just recently launched Camera, a standalone photo app that makes it even easier for users to snap and upload photos to Facebook without going through the cumbersome -- and, frankly, rather clunky and slow -- iOS and Android applications."" In a post on the company's blog, Face.com CEO Gil Hirsch also indicates its products could help boost Facebook's mobile offerings. ""We love building products, and like our friends at Facebook, we think that mobile is a critical part of people's lives as they both create and consume content, and share content with their social graph,"" he writes. ""By working with Facebook directly, and joining their team, we'll have more opportunities to build amazing products that will be employed by consumers -- that's all we've ever wanted to do."" Facebook issued the following statement to CNN in an e-mail: . ""People who use Facebook enjoy sharing photos and memories with their friends, and Face.com's technology has helped to provide the best photo experience. This transaction simply brings a world-class team and a long-time technology vendor in house."" A company spokeswoman declined to comment further because the Face.com deal has not been closed. All of this is important because Facebook is the most popular place on the Internet for photo sharing. According to the Silicon Valley-based company, people upload an average of 300 million photos to Facebook every day. That's nearly one for every person in the United States. Facebook already employs face-detection technology to help (some might say prod) users to identify themselves and their friends in the photos they upload to the site. When friends tag each other in photos, they make it more likely that other people on the network will see the pictures. But, for some Facebook users, the existing face-detection feature is either unwanted or unworkable. ""I try to time and time again (to use the feature), but Facebook always manages to claim I'm someone I'm not. The detection technology isn't quite there,"" wrote one Twitter user, @DanieljGross. In response to @cnntech's query on the subject, another person wrote that Facebook's auto-tagging feature confuses their friends for their siblings. ""It's a bit scary to be honest,"" wrote another Twitter user, @earthtonadia. Facebook gives users the option to turn off face detection. To do so, go to your privacy settings (click the arrow at the top right of the homepage to get there) and then edit your ""Timeline and Tagging"" settings. At the bottom of the list, Facebook asks, ""Who sees tag suggestions when photos that look like you are uploaded?"" Change that setting to ""No One"" if you don't want to have your face detected. Users also can choose to review the photos they're tagged in before the tags show up on Facebook. Or, if you want to get funky, you could always wear bizzaro hats and makeup that prevent face-detection technology from working. For more on that, read about this project from CV Dazzle.","Facebook buys face-recognition site Face.com .

"(CNN) -- Following a period of freak-out on the Internet on Monday, Facebook appears to have pulled a controversial feature that let the social network's users get a digital list of other Facebookers nearby. The ""Find Friends Nearby"" feature was not accessible in a CNN test on Tuesday morning, and other media outlets, including CNET, reported that Facebook had pulled the service. In a statement e-mailed to CNN, a Facebook spokeswoman declined to elaborate. ""This wasn't a formal release -- this was something that a few engineers were testing,"" the spokeswoman wrote. ""With all tests, some get released as full products, others don't. Nothing more to say on this for now -- we'll communicate to everyone when there is something to say."" When Facebook users logged on to the Find Friends Nearby site, they were supposed to be able to see friends and other Facebook users who were in close proximity. Facebook users did not show up on those location-aware lists unless they intentionally logged into that site, which was accessible on Monday at http://fb.com/ffn. The site came to the public's attention on Sunday after news of the feature was leaked to the tech press, according to news reports. A Facebook engineer who claimed to have designed the feature said in a message to the blog TechCrunch that it could be used to quickly look up and ""friend"" someone who you'd met in person. ""For me, the ideal use case for this product is the one where when you're out with a group of people whom you've recently met and want to stay in contact with,"" that developer, Ryan Patterson, wrote. ""Facebook search might be effective, or sharing your vanity addresses or business cards, but this tool provides a really easy way to exchange contact information with multiple people with minimal friction."" Patterson wrote that he developed the app as part of a coding competition, or hackathon. ""Social discovery"" apps like Highlight and Glancee, which Facebook recently purchased, already perform similar functions and have not been hit with the same backlash Facebook received. Facebook says it was ""testing"" the feature and that it had not become a formal part of the site, despite the fact that it was available online on Monday. The company had not promoted the feature. ""We are constantly testing new features but have nothing more to share at this time,"" a company spokeswoman told CNN in an e-mail on Monday. The blog ReadWriteWeb dubbed the feature a ""stalking app,"" and news of Find Friends Nearby received a cold reception on the Internet, where Twitter users and bloggers panned the idea -- saying Twitter-y things like ""Hell to the naw,"" ""Oh lawd!"" and ""BAD FACEBOOK!!"" Furthermore, a company called Friendthem claimed Monday that Facebook had stolen its concept and was threatening the much-larger social network with a lawsuit. ""I was amazed on Sunday to read that Facebook is blatantly stealing our idea with what they are calling, 'Find Friends Nearby,'"" Friendthem CEO Charles Sankowich said in a statement posted on VentureBeat and on other tech news sites. What do you think of the idea of knowing which Facebook users are nearby? Could this be useful for finding new friends and looking up new contacts? Or does it cross a line in terms of privacy?","Facebook pulls 'Find Friends Nearby' feature .

"(CNN) -- Islamic radicals linked to al Qaeda have seized the northern half of Mali, one of Africa's largest nations, and there are widespread concerns that the region could soon become a terrorist haven. The militants have been able to capitalize on the instability of the country, which has seen a rebellion and a government coup within the past few months. Now, about 500,000 Malians have fled their homes in fear of the violence and discrimination that come with the radicals' strict interpretation of sharia law. CNN's Erin Burnett has been meeting with rebels and refugees this week and reporting on the growing crisis in Mali. She talked to CNN.com about the security concerns, the desperate humanitarian issue and how the United States might respond. CNN.com: Why are some referring to Mali as ""the next Afghanistan""? Erin Burnett: We've talked to senior sources in the U.S. government and local rebels who say al Qaeda wants this to be their next haven. There is no government in northern Mali right now: it is remote and hard to access. Former intelligence officials tell me this is Qaeda's last chance of a country as their haven, like Afghanistan was before this. I was told by locals that extremists are giving people satellite phones and saying, ""Call in when you see Westerners."" They're paying people money in Timbuktu to become ""informants."" One man told me that families he knows were given 10 times the amount of money they would earn from herding (their normal work) to join the cause. But there are reasons it's not like Afghanistan. One of them is that the type of Islam practiced in northern Mali and the areas around northern Mali is much more relaxed. Locals are not receptive to extreme interpretations of Islam: For example, the extremists banned music, putting a DJ I spoke to out of a job. This is a country that is world famous for loving music! CNN.com: How did we get to this point? Burnett: In the northern part of Mali, the Tuareg tribe has always wanted independence. Since Mali became independent from France in 1960, they've staged several rebellions. But the catalyst for what is happening here now is what happened in Libya. As Moammar Gadhafi was killed and Libya really fell into disarray, his weapons became available. The Tuareg -- many of whom fought for Gadhafi -- seized the weapons and went and fought against the Malian government and declared independence. In the southern part of Mali, people were really frustrated at the government's inability to do anything about the rebellion, and they felt the government was corrupt and inept. So there was sort of what I understand to be an ""accidental"" coup. Some of the commanders went in to complain, and the president left. Mali ended up without a government. Then, the Islamic radicals, who have long sought a bigger presence in that part of Africa, came in and fought the Tuareg. They overpowered them, and the north of Mali is now controlled by Islamists. There are some Tuareg fighting within northern Mali, and I am aware of camps they operate in the country. But they tell me they don't have the weapons that the Islamic-linked militias have. Even the prime minister of Mali told me that his army has essentially no weapons to fight, and he needs them from the United States. Mali Islamists destroy tombs in Timbuktu . CNN.com: Who are these radicals, and where did they come from? Burnett: People refer to them as al Qaeda, but they're also referred to by the names of their militias, such as Ganda Koy or Ansar Dine. Some are religiously motivated, and some are opportunists: They want control and money but aren't driven by religious beliefs. We discovered that they're coming to northern Africa from several places: specifically, Libya, Algeria, Afghanistan. And there is one major radical militia (Ansar Dine) that is also Tuareg. The leader of that group is a Malian Tuareg who spent time in Saudi Arabia. CNN.com: A large majority of Malians are Muslim. How do they differ with the radicals? Burnett: The brand of Islam is different, so there's not a receptiveness to some of the more dramatic and restrictive parts of what the Islamic radicals want to do: for example, the full covering of the women, and women and men being separated. When I called the military leader of the main extremist group linked to al Qaeda, the leader would not talk to me because I was a woman. There's no question that the local population does not want this. But still, some people buy in and go along with it. CNN.com: How serious is the outside threat posed by these extremists? Burnett: I asked some Tuareg fighters what these Islamists say about America. They said that the Islamists tell people that Americans are like animals and like dogs. Some of that is the kind of propaganda that you expect to hear from al Qaeda-linked groups at this point. And saying these things is very different than saying someone's going to be planning an attack on the United States. But their leaders have said their intention would be to use this as a base. Tuareg rebels were adamant in telling me that the radicals plan attacks on the U.S. and Europe. One expert who is concerned about the risk highlighted to me that 10% of the population of France has links to northern Africa. The question is, at what point will the extremists be at a level of organization and stability to do this? CNN.com: How many refugees are there, and how are they faring? Burnett: There are about 250,000 of them, according to the U.N., and the number is growing. Those are people who have left the country. There is also another 175,000 people internally displaced within Mali, according to humanitarian groups. It's a very serious humanitarian problem. The World Food Program told me that they only have food for one more month in July. We saw people who are hungry. And there are diseases as well because of the conditions in the camps. What's it going to be like if the food runs out? CNN.com: How has the U.S. responded to this point, and how might they respond in the future? Burnett: On the humanitarian side, the U.S. is the biggest donor to the efforts here. The CIA headquarters for Africa is reportedly based in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, and U.S. government sources told me the Islamic radicals tried and failed to shoot down a U.S. surveillance drone over Mali. But the president of Burkina Faso told me that if the U.S. is operating drones from his country, that's not in the deal he has with the U.S., and he'd demand a new agreement. So the situation is ambiguous. And it's also bad timing politically for President Obama. This week at a fundraiser, Obama said he has al Qaeda ""on the run."" That's been the administration's message for the past year. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said it; CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus has said it. As al Qaeda and its offshoots grow in northern Mali, that message may sound off. And I think it's important to mention something we experienced: that the ""state"" borders are meaningless. The Islamists are also spilling over the border into neighboring countries, such as Burkina Faso. We went to that border, and the villagers were terrified of the Islamists, as they found out that one of the leaders was nearby that day. This leads to another question that matters to the U.S.: Could these radical groups destabilize other governments in the region? It remains to be seen.","Al Qaeda-linked militia groups have taken control of northern Mali in Africa .

"(Mashable.com) -- At WWDC 2012, Apple unveiled the next generation of iOS, its mobile operating system. iOS 6 sports more than 200 new features and upgrades â including the new Apple Maps, deep Facebook integration and improvements to Siri. Although iOS 6 won't be available on compatible devices until sometime this fall, the first beta build is currently available to developers. We've installed iOS 6 on our new iPad (64GB Verizon LTE model) and poked around with the new features. While it is clear that this is a beta â certain features aren't fully baked, and there is some crashing and inconsistency with a few existing apps â it's equally clear that this is a solid OS update. Mashable.com: iOS 6: Everything You Need to Know . Because we've tested iOS 6 on an iPad and not an iPhone, we can't explore all of the new iOS 6 features. But this release, more than any other, is intended to unify iOS across platforms. Maps . Apple's decision to eschew Google Maps in iOS 6 is a big deal. Mapping and location are an integral part of the modern smartphone experience. Google and Microsoft own their own mapping technologies, and it makes sense that Apple would want to make good on some of its mapping investments. These include Poly9, Placebase and C3 Technologies. The 3D models from C3 Technologies are immediately evident in Apple's new mapping app â at least, in the areas that have already been rendered. In our tests, certain areas â including Cupertino and the Apple Campus at 1 Infinite Loop â had beautiful 3D terrain overlays. In New York City, however, those images looked pretty bad. But again, this is a beta. The street mapping aspect of the new iOS Maps app pulls in data from Yelp and from what we can tell, Open Street Map. TomTom technology helps power the Turn-By-Turn navigation. While we haven't had a chance to go hands-on in a car with Turn-By-Turn, in our walking tests, it worked as you would expect. What didn't work as we expected was transit directions, and this could be a real wrinkle for Apple. In Monday's WWDC Keynote, Apple's Scott Forstall said that the company would highlight transit apps from the App Store in its mapping product. At the time, I took this to mean that it would highlight other location apps. What I didn't realize is that Apple is actually going to rely on these apps to power the transit directions within iOS. Now, we don't know what the final version of this product will look like â but if this means users will need to download a local area transit map or schedule tool in order to get transit directions in iOS 6, that's going to be a problem for many thousands of users that rely on their iPhones for public transit directions on a daily basis. I like third-party transit apps as much as the next person. But I also really, really like having a schedule built into my main mapping client, so I can quickly get directions in an area where I don't know the bus or train route layout. That quibble aside, our first experience with Apple's new Maps app is positive. In fact, with the exception of Turn-By-Turn nav, it doesn't feel that much different than the Google Maps app. That's a good thing. Facebook integration . We've already detailed a bit about how Facebook's integration with iOS 6 works. At this very early stage, the Facebook/iOS 6 integration works in a way that's nearly identical to Twitter's current integration with iOS 5. That is to say, it's part of the system â if you want it to be â and third-party apps can plug into the architecture for even better use. For sharing photos and websites, the ability to share directly to Facebook is great. In Safari and the Photos app, you can easily post to your Facebook account. You can also choose what level of visibility you want a post to have and attach a Facebook location to the object you are sharing. For now, videos cannot be shared directly to Facebook â only YouTube. But we expect that to change in the future. The real potential of the Facebook integration is within the App Store. Users can now ""like"" an app directly from the App Store on Facebook, and see what apps their friends like. This also works for Music and Movies. Apps that hook into the Facebook login in iOS 6 need only request permission to do so once. Actions still need to be explicitly performed; users just don't have to initiate a login each and every time. The nice part of all of this is that users can revoke access to an app at any time from the Facebook panel in the Settings app. This makes it easy to turn a feature on or off, without having to mess with a bunch of hard-to-find settings. As for Contacts and Events and Birthday integrations â these are nice features. Windows Phone has had them since its inception. Many Android skins, such as HTC Sense, also include the option. We appreciate that users can use Facebook but opt not to link a calendar or address book with the service. Siri . Siri is finally on the iPad! Well, the new iPad, at least. Siri works just as you would expect it to â except it now hooks into Yelp, OpenTable, Rotten Tomatoes, various sports score services and more. Users can also now launch apps, post to Facebook and send Tweets with their voice. In our tests, Siri worked as expected, though we did run into a few problems posting to Twitter. Still, the service works quite seamlessly on the iPad. For us, the more command-like nature of Siri â and the fact that various iOS tasks can now be started using voice commands â is a great step forward. Photo Stream sharing, Safari, FaceTime 3G and more . One of the features I'm really excited to use with iOS 6 is the new PhotoStream shares that are part of iCloud. Users can quickly and easily share groups of photos to a select group of other users. Just find your photo, choose ""Photo Stream"" from the share menu and add your contacts. You can choose to make the collection private or visible on iCloud.com. Users can then comment on photos and add their own to the collections. Removing a photo from a Photo Stream will remove it from everyone's device. It's a bit like Glassboard, but baked into the OS and tied to iCloud. Another new feature in iOS 6 is the ability to FaceTime over 3G or 4G. I tested this by calling my phone from my Verizon 4G LTE iPad. It worked exactly as you would expect. My only concern with this sort of feature is that it has the potential to use up more bandwidth than users might expect. Keep an eye on your data usage. Safari for iOS 6 has a redesigned sharing menu â icon-based this time â and the ability to sync with tabs across other iCloud devices. You can also now read items from Reading Lists offline â which can act as a low-level replacement for Instapaper, Pocket or Readability. In my experience, heavy users of those services (including myself) are unlikely to give them up for the built-in options, but it's a great way to introduce the concept of reading later to more people. Mail . Mail has received a few updates in iOS 6, most notably with the ability to FINALLY inserts photos or videos in a message directly from the Mail app. It's about time. Users can also craft different signatures on a per-mailbox basis. Apple has also introduced a new VIP feature that allows users to highlight email from important contacts in their own folder and with their own notification system. If you get as much email as I get, that's a great feature. The early verdict . I'm very excited about the potential of iOS 6. The first beta is remarkably stable and the new features are welcome. Still, as with all OS releases, the most interesting bits are usually what happens on the backend and not the flashiest user-facing features. Some of the early criticism of iOS 6 is that it isn't enough to compete with Android or Windows Phone. I don't think this is true at all. Third party apps are what define modern smartphones and tablets and in that respect, Apple remains the platform of choice for developers. With iOS 6, it looks like developers will have even more options to create great apps for users. Plus, this is just a taste â as the months go on, I expect we'll learn even more about what unearthed secrets remain in the OS. What are you most excited about in iOS 6? Let us know in the comments. Â© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.","Apple introduced the next generation of its mobile operating system, iOS 6, this week .

"(CNN) -- Are you better off today than you were four years ago? With 26 consecutive months of job growth, it seems like the answer should be yes. With an 8.2% unemployment rate, it's no wonder that in a recent Gallup poll, most said no. This disconnect is the reason some Democrats -- meeting for their convention this week in North Carolina -- are having a hard time finding an answer with the right tone. It also explains why Mitt Romney and the Republicans love asking the question: Nuanced answers to what appears to be a simple yes or no question sounds like spin, and voters hate spin. More important, the question tricks the middle class into condensing all of their money problems into the three-plus years of the Obama administration. I say ""trick"" because the truth is, the ""better off"" question does nothing to address the real reason why things are tight: Americans' wages haven't kept up with the cost of living for a good long time. And because of that, the middle class has been dying a slow death for the past 40 years, not four. Romney likes to say that he is a financial whiz, so you have to know that this bit of information is not news to him. That he doesn't bother bringing up that trend when talking about the economy is yet another sign that he's more interested in winning the election than helping those less fortunate than himself. Here's what I'm talking about: . In its recent report, ""The Lost Decade of the Middle Class,"" the Pew Research Center found that in 1971, 62% of the country's income was earned by the middle class, which at that time represented 61% of the population. In 1991, the middle class took in 54% of the income and represented 56% of the country. In 2011, the middle class represented 51% of the population, but its earning was down to 45%. Opinion: What Democrats need to do in Charlotte . None of this would be a problem if the percentage of Americans who became rich was in line with the amount of money the rich were taking in. Unfortunately, that is not the case. In 1971, the rich represented 14% of the country and took in 29% of the income. In 2011, the rich represented 20% of the country but took in a whopping 46% of the money. So Romney asking ""are you better off today than you were four years ago"" is a bit insulting; he's really just a rich guy preying on the emotions of a middle class in long decline. Maybe if he starts talking about the dramatic redistribution of wealth that's occurred since 1971 and the wage/inflation gap, I'll think differently. And that gap? Over a 12-month period ending in December, wages went up 1.8%, while through October, the consumer price index was up 3.5%. This is not an anomaly, it's been the norm. This is why Pew found that ""85% of self-described middle-class adults say it is more difficult now than it was a decade ago for middle-class people to maintain their standard of living."" We're working just as hard as in years past, but we're behind the 8-ball because for most of the country, wages are not even set to meet the cost of living. Indeed, some of us are closer to being poor than middle class and don't know it. The 2011 middle class median income started at $39,418 for a family of three. Yet Pew found some families making less than $30,000 still self-identified as middle class, even though they're closer to the nation's bottom fifth, according to the U.S. Census. How does this translate on the ground? The starting salary for K-12 teachers in 42 states is below the $39,418 bar of median middle class salaries. Beyond the basic necessities, such as food, housing and a car to get to work, many young teachers are paying back student loans. So if there's a young teacher with a family -- say in a state like Ohio, where the starting salary is $31,876 -- there's a good chance that person is poor, not middle class. The starting salary for a New York firefighter is $43,074. Now, that may sound like a lot of money until you realize that ""a New Yorker would have to make $123,322 a year to have the same standard of living as someone making $50,000 in Houston,"" according to the Center for an Urban Future. Depending on the neighborhood, full-time day care in New York can cost a family about $25,000 a year. I don't know about you, but I think it's kind of messed up that our teachers and firemen, professionals that used to represent a legitimate middle class -- only a short time ago -- are living check to check. That's not all about taxes and government. It's not about Obamacare or a ""war on the rich."" It's about a trend that has gone on under the radar for decades finally making its presence known. Apple has worldwide sales of $16 billion. But a New York Times article this summer reported ""about 30,000 of the 43,000 Apple employees in this country work in Apple Stores, as members of the service economy, and many of them earn about $25,000 a year."" Meanwhile, it went on: ""Last year, (CEO Tim Cook) received stock grants, which vest over a 10-year period, that at today's share price would be worth more than $570 million."" After much criticism, this summer, Apple gave all of its retail stores employees raises up to 25%, and last I checked, the company is still making a lot of money. In fact, both Obama and Romney acknowledge that big business is doing OK, remarks supported by Wall Street. So why are so many of us still struggling? ""Are you better off today?"" is not a question looking for a productive answer. It's a rallying cry for those opposed to the Obama administration -- an administration that has certainly made its share of economic mistakes but is hardly the reason why this generation is projected to make less money than the one before. If Romney wants to show the nation that he is the truly the best man for the job and not just another candidate seeking it, he will start talking about ways to turn things around for the middle class.

"(EW.com) -- Universal announced at its CinemaCon presentation today that it plans to produce a ""Pitch Perfect"" sequel that would hit theaters sometime in 2015. The reveal doesn't come as too much of a surprise to anyone who's been paying attention. 'Pitch Perfect' cast reunites for MTV Movie Awards opener . ""Pitch Perfect"" earned $112 million worldwide against a slight $17 million budget, and in the months since its theatrical run has kept hitting new high notes. According to Universal, the film has earned over $90 million across all home market platforms, and it currently stands as the studio's third highest-grossing VOD title ever behind blockbusters ""Ted"" and ""Bridesmaids.""

"(CNN) -- A week into Facebook's debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange, its initial offering price of $38 per share dropped to $31.91. Retail investors' fears deepened as they realize they are losing a lot of money. The Facebook IPO did not follow the usual script. Instead of launching the largest social media company in the world as a legitimate and valuable business, the IPO has laid bare all of the questions and doubts about its potential performance. So why did the Facebook IPO bomb as badly as it did? In a lawsuit filed last week, some investors contend that Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter of the IPO, withheld key information about a negative financial forecast from them while sharing it with their institutional clients. In this conspiratorial tale, the bad guys are the insiders at Facebook, the investment bankers and the favored institutional clients of these bankers. The bankers set the offering price at $38, knowing that the stock was not worth that much, the insiders in the company unloaded their shares at the offering price and institutional investors stayed on the sidelines. Individual small investors who bought at the offering price suffered as the price collapsed. In other words, the suckers are the rest of the world. Opinion: Was Facebook IPO a bust? But I don't buy this story. First, unlike many others who have seen the crises of the last few years as evidence that bankers are evil, I see them more as inept. Facebook's IPO is just proof that if you want something valued, you should not ask a bank to do it. None of the actors in this story can be happy with how Facebook's IPO has unfolded in its first week. The investment banks look like bad ""deal makers,"" which strikes at the heart of one of their few remaining revenue-generating skills. Any profits or commissions that Morgan Stanley booked on this IPO are overwhelmed by the reputation hit that it took and the consequences this will have on future deals. The Facebook insiders who remain have not only lost billions in value but have made it more difficult to unload their remaining shares down the road. And most of the shares at the offering price went to the institutional investors, who now face paper or real losses on those shares. Facebook IPO: Outraged investor cries grow louder . So, what happened? I think the investment bankers priced the offering based on how shares of Facebook were trading in the private market and their assessments of institutional demand. I don't think that revenue growth, margins, risk or any other fundamentals played much of a role in the pricing. I don't fault them for playing the momentum game, but they played it badly. By pushing up the offering price to its upper limit and by expanding the offering to allow more insiders to cash out, they broke the spell that momentum casts over investors. It would have happened eventually, but they did not anticipate how quickly the shift would occur. What are the lessons to take from this mess? First, don't assume that bankers, experts and analysts know what they are talking about. When they tout an investment, be especially skeptical if they have a stake in it. Reactions: Facebook IPO underwhelms Web, too . Second, much as it soothes the ego to think that your portfolio setbacks are because of a conspiracy, where large institutional clients make a killing and the individual investors get the crumbs from the table, it is institutional clients who lose the most in bad deals because they have more to lose. Finally, remember that markets make mistakes, and they can make bigger ones after a meltdown like this one. I would not be surprised if disappointed investors drive the price down to a point where you and I can have the ultimate revenge on Mark Zuckerberg: Buy his company at a bargain basement price and make money off him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aswath Damodaran.","A week into Facebook's debut on the market, its price was down .

"(CNN) -- The announcement of the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI came as a bolt from the blue to the world but not a moment too soon for many Catholics. The Catholic Church has continued to march backwards under Pope Benedict, seeming at times to be in a state of perpetual denial, whether the issue be that of child abuse, birth control, homosexuality or the role of women. At the heart of the church there lies a deep chauvinism that seems to have infected the whole edifice. More: Pope cites old age in resignation . Women may feel discriminated against in many institutions but few have made it so blatantly clear that the woman's place remains at the kitchen sink as the Catholic Church. The refusal to enter into a constructive dialogue about the possibility of having female clergy underlines just how male dominated the institution remains. Rubbing salt in the wounds in Britain has been the creation by Pope Benedict of the Ordinariate. This body facilitates the progress of those Anglicans who predominantly want to leave the Church of England because of the ordination of women into the Catholic Church. More: What next after Benedict resignation? This has seen a succession of married priests coming over, so providing a ready supply of candidates to fill the growing number of vacancies, due to lack of celibate males, in the Catholic Church. No one at the Vatican seems overly concerned about the contradiction that sees married Anglicans being allowed to join the Catholic Church and minister to the faithful, whilst a man ordained as priest in the Catholic faith who wants to get married has to leave in order to do so. It is this sort of heaping of contradiction on contradiction that has brought the church to its present position of crisis with people walking away in their droves. But perhaps the biggest crisis for the Church remains child abuse. It has shaken the whole edifice under the present pontiff's tenure, and no doubt taken its toll on him personally. Fulsome apologies have been made and actions taken to remedy abuse across the world. However, as cases like that of Cardinal Sean Brady in Ireland prove, many of those now in the positions of authority in the church are the very same who stood by, or worse still, colluded in the cover-up of abuse. More: World reacts to pope's resignation . There is no doubt still more to come. The church needs to face up to its responsibilities and show a greater concern for the victims than for protection of the institution at all costs. The laity feel largely ignored on these matters. They were not consulted over whether they wanted the Ordinariate nor over the recently imposed translation of the mass. A great number of the laity also feel hugely let down by the role of priests in abuse. Catholics worldwide must hope that the spirit moves the Cardinals when they gather in March to elect a new pope. Many will pray that the new pope is more in the mould of Pope John XXIII, who ushered in the Second Vatican Council that sat for much of the 1960s. This was a time of hope. Pope John called for the church to open its windows and engage with the world. Vatican II brought forward radical thought on issues from poverty and war to workplace justice and the family. The laity were given a say. Nothing less is required this time around. More: A traditional papacy ends with surprise . Vatican III would have to look at things like the dignity of the human person, empowerment of the laity, the role of women and the sex abuse scandal. In the case of abuse, change would mean examining those structures of the church that made these things likely in the first place. Central to this effort must be the role of the priest. The role must change to become that of one among equals. Priests, whether they be men or women, must become more accountable and not act in the authoritarian manner that many who hold the office do today. It would also be good to have a church that offers some ethical and moral leadership to the wider world. Views on things like climate change, war and peace, the present capitalist economic model and poverty would all be welcome contributions to the public discourse, rather than lectures on gay marriage. Stanley: Why pope will be remembered . If a new pope can kick start a Vatican III-style process that genuinely seeks to move the church forward beyond its most recent crisis, then there is hope for the future. The new pope may well come from Africa or Asia, given that it is in these areas where the church continues to grow. A southern perspective will no doubt help in bringing forth a more prophetic leadership in the church at this time. What is for sure is that more of the same will not do. A new pope who continues the backward approach of recent pontiffs will simply be one who continues to manage the decline of an institution that remains out of date for many in the 21st century.","Catholic Church continued march backwards under Benedict, writes Paul Donovan .

"(CNN) -- Rapper will.i.am can boast of an accomplishment that is out of this world: His latest single premiered from Mars, making it the first song to debut on another planet. The Black Eyed Peas singer wrote the song, ""Reaching for the Stars,"" to mark the successful landing of NASA's Curiosity rover on the Red Planet this month. A far cry from his regular hip-hop tunes, it features a 40-piece orchestra set to a futuristic beat. The song is set to transcend time and cultures, he said. ""Mars has always fascinated us, and the things Curiosity tells us about it will help us learn about whether or not life was possible there,"" said Charles Bolden, the NASA administrator. ""And what future human explorers can expect, will.i.am has provided the first song on our playlist of Mars exploration."" The song was unveiled during a news conference Tuesday at a NASA laboratory in Pasadena, California. The playback included Martian photos of eroded knobs, gulches on a mountainside and exposed geological layering. Flight director Bobak Ferdowsi, aka ""Mohawk Guy,"" gave a thumbs up and hit the play button, sending his teammates beaming, swaying and clapping. ""Why do they say the sky is the limit,"" will.i.am sings, ""when I've seen the footprints on the Moon."" The tune -- which aims to encourage youth to study science -- completed a trip of more than 300 million miles from Earth to Mars and back, according to NASA. ""And I know that Mars might be far, but baby it ain't really that far,"" will.i.am goes on. ""Let's reach for the stars."" In addition to the singer, students also attended the event in Pasadena, where they asked questions about the Curiosity mission and the song's interplanetary transmission. ""This is about inspiring young people to lead a life without limits placed on their potential and to pursue collaboration between humanity and technology,"" will.i.am said. While will.i.am has the first song, NASA also accomplished another feat this week. Bolden's became the first human voice broadcast from another planet. The space agency's accomplishments are the latest in a series of advances aimed at making science more cool. NASA beamed The Beatles' ""Across the Universe"" into space on February 4, 2008. The song marked the anniversary of the day The Beatles recorded the song and the 50th year of NASA's founding. An excited Paul McCartney welcomed the beaming of the song written by fellow Beatle John Lennon. ""Amazing! Well done, NASA!"" McCartney said in a message to the space agency at the time. ""Send my love to the aliens."" Despite the complexity of landing a 2,000-pound vehicle on another planet, Curiosity had a perfect landing on August 6, and most of the instruments scientists have tested appear to function. Curiosity is sending back more data from the surface of Mars than the combined results of all of NASA's previous rovers, the space agency said. Last week, it completed its first drive on Mars, setting the stage for it to venture farther afield. There's only been one glitch so far: a wind sensor on the rover's weather station was damaged and the reason might always remain mysterious, scientists say.","""Reaching for the Stars"" by will.i.am is beamed from the Red Planet .

"(CNN) -- Trayvon Martin went out to buy some Skittles -- and was shot dead before he made it home. The case is horrifying, maddening, grotesque. And -- perhaps worst of all -- there may be nothing Florida law enforcement can do about it. As the world now knows, the 17-year-old Martin walked to a store in Orlando to buy some snacks on the night of February 26. George Zimmerman, a volunteer Neighborhood Watch captain, thought the boy looked suspicious and called 911. The 911 operator told Zimmerman to keep his distance -- police would be sent -- but there was a confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin. Martin was killed with a single shot to the chest. Florida authorities have not arrested Zimmerman, and federal authorities recently joined the investigation. The legal question at the heart of the case involves Florida's so-called ""stand your ground"" law, which the legislature passed, at the behest of the National Rifle Association, in 2005. Before that time, Florida law resembled that of most other states; during confrontations, individuals had a duty to retreat rather than to respond to provocations. Under the new law, a person is allowed to use deadly force if he is in a place he has a right to be and feels reasonably threatened with serious harm. Weigh in on the Trayvon Martin case, share your thoughts on iReport . In this case, then, the question is whether Zimmerman was in such a place and felt reasonably threatened. The 911 operator told Zimmerman to keep his distance from Martin, but Zimmerman had a right to be on the street. That's where neighborhood watch volunteers work. Clearly, the question at the heart of the case is whether Zimmerman reasonably felt threatened. On this issue, the evidence currently seems murky. There appears to have been some sort of confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin. Police found Zimmerman with an injury to his head. Most important -- and most tragic -- the police will hear only one side of the story about this confrontation. Trayvon is not around to tell his story. The continuing investigation will surely focus on finding other witnesses. The facts of this case show why the ""stand your ground"" law is so important. The law focuses on the subjective understanding of the shooter. Was his understanding of the situation ""reasonable""? Ultimately, that would be a question for the jury to decide, but it still gives a lot of deference to the perpetrator of a violent act. The new law even allows a disproportionate response; if someone comes at you with a fist, you can reply with a gun. In light of the shift in the law, it's not surprising that since the law went into effect, reports of justifiable homicides have tripled, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Another case under litigation in Florida highlights the effect of the law. In September 2010, David James was playing basketball with his 8-year-old daughter on an outdoor court in Valrico. A boy was skateboarding on the court at the same time, and Trevor Dooley, a man who lived in the area, told the boy he shouldn't be skateboarding there. James stood up for the boy, and he and Dooley had a confrontation. Dooley was carrying a gun and wound up shooting James dead. Dooley asserted that he felt threatened by James, and has asked that the case be dismissed before trial under the ""stand your ground"" law. (The judge will soon make a ruling.) In both of these cases -- in the deaths of both James and Martin -- the legal defense for the shooters appears to rely almost completely on the ""stand your ground"" law. In the death of David James, prosecutors are doing their best against tough odds. In the death of Trayvon Martin, it's prosecutors who are taking the heat for failing, thus far, to bring any charges against George Zimmerman. But this outrage, understandable though it is, might be directed somewhere else as well. The Florida legislators who voted for the ""stand your ground"" law -- and Gov. Jeb Bush, who signed it -- have something to answer for as well. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Toobin.","Jeffrey Toobin: Trayvon Martin, 17, was shot dead out buying candy in horrifying case .

"(CNN) -- Flush with cash and drunk with power after its $100 billion IPO, Facebook could be caught secretly brainwashing millions of new users into signing up (mind-control hoodies, anyone?) -- and still I might not quit the world's largest social network. Ridiculous scenario aside, I'm pretty serious. Despite ongoing privacy concerns and rumblings of a backlash, it would take something drastic to make me leave Facebook at this point. More than just a daily habit, Facebook has become the place where I get important, often surprising glimpses into the lives of the 1,365 people with whom I've chosen to connect. (That's not counting friends-of-friends, for Facebook's tentacles are ever-extended). Why Facebook won't start trading at the opening bell . I'm not always in love with Facebook, of course. I get frustrated with the social network like everyone else. Every six months, Facebook introduces some huge new design of its site or engages in privacy-eroding practices that send many of its users howling into the status-update box. They threaten to shut down their accounts, write furious blog posts and organize ridiculous movements such as Quit Facebook Day, which got less than 40,000 people to commit to deleting themselves -- a tiny fraction of the network even back in 2010. But, in large part, the people who say they're leaving Facebook don't. Or they quit and come back. Me, I'm staying put. At this point, complaining about Facebook is like grousing about the electric company while watching TV, or saying how lousy politicians are but forgetting to vote. Facebook just is. It's become an institution -- one that's going to be around for a long while -- and all the missteps it's made in its young, eight-year life have never prompted significant user defection. Counterpoint: Why I quit Facebook, and am not looking back . Facebook is on track to hit a billion users sometime this year. A billion people. With just a few exceptions, that includes nearly every person I have ever worked with, a big chunk of my extended family, most of my friends going all the way back to elementary school and probably all the kids who were in my nursery at the hospital where I was born. There's critical mass, and then there's Facebook, the Death Star that deflects every effort to blow it up. Facebook has won the social-media wars because it's where all the people are. Those who have been waiting for something else to take its place, the way Facebook siphoned off the population of MySpace about five years ago, are still waiting. MySpace, even at its peak, never had the mainstream acceptance and durability of Facebook. Facebook's new billionaires . I post lots of random thoughts and news links on Twitter, share photos of my wanderings on Instagram and still check in on the increasingly hollow Google+ on a daily basis. But everything I post to those services also ends up on Facebook because it's the platform that feels the most robust and future-proof. Infographic: How we use Facebook . Since Facebook introduced its controversial Timeline design last year, my important personal milestones (college graduation, marriage, the births of my daughters, the ""Friday Night Lights"" finale) all have neatly filed themselves into the digital record of my life. That's what Facebook wants, of course. But I've come to stop resisting its voracious appetite for personal information. If I didn't share, and my friends and relatives and co-workers didn't share, I'd be less apt to know who just got engaged, who just celebrated a graduation or who in my online community just died suddenly. When my grandmother died earlier this year, it was the place my relatives posted photos of her I'd never seen before. It was where far-flung friends and family members offered their condolences for weeks after the funeral service. Sure, we've seen the inevitable backlash as Facebook has grown to include everyone from your grandmother to that third-grade classmate you never really wanted to hear from again. But lately, it feels like the arguments in favor of leaving Mark Zuckerberg's social network have gotten weaker as people become more resigned to the notion of a permanent Facebook. Timeline: Mark Zuckerberg's rise from child prodigy to Facebook billionaire . When Facebook recently bought photo-sharing app Instagram for $1 billion, Instagram users vowed to quit, complaining that their precious little network had sold out to a monolithic company. (Funny, that didn't stop Instagram from jumping from 30 million users to 50 million in about a month.) Would-be competitors who have tried to take on Facebook have largely failed to gain traction. Path, which has a lovely interface and is more focused on smaller circles of friends, just hit 2 million users a few months ago. And Diaspora, the open-source, nonprofit that was supposed to threaten Facebook's laissez-faire attitude toward privacy, has yet to crack half a million users. Facebook to hold all-night hacking session . Once Facebook has shareholders to answer to, things may change. But perhaps not as much as you'd expect. At a South by Southwest Interactive event in 2008, I saw Zuckerberg speak about his company to application developers. Even then, he stressed that the future of Facebook was not as a website or tool, but as a global communication platform upon which other things would be built. It's been amazing to observe how little he's veered from that vision during four years of astronomical growth. If something is ever going to take the place of Facebook once the company gets so big and complacent that it loses focus, it will probably be something built on top of Facebook. Perhaps a mobile app that accesses the social network's huge population, something Facebook-adjacent that takes what people like about Facebook and turns it into something more nimble and attractive than Facebook itself. Maybe then I'll think about pulling up stakes. Until then, I'm not leaving.","Omar Gallaga: Facebook is where I get important glimpses into 1,365 ""friends""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A new cable network for Latino audiences will mark the culmination of two decades of filmmaking for writer-director Robert Rodriguez, who is leading the ambitious effort. ""I've been on this journey for 20 years now ... and this seems to be the reason,"" "" Rodriguez said Friday during a conference of independent Latino filmmakers and documentarians. ""What's great about this is that no one is doing this for an audience that is growing so fast,"" Rodriguez said, referring to how Latinos are now the nation's No. 2 group in the latest census, surpassing the 50 million mark. ""When you think that there's nothing on television like this, it boggles the mind."" The El Rey network starts broadcasting between September 2013 and January 2014. It is a daunting venture as talk show queen Oprah has discovered at her struggling OWN Network, whose woes have resulted in recent layoffs. But the film maker of ""El Mariachi,"" ""Spy Kids"" and other features isn't deterred. ""I'm glad I'm so naÃÂ¯ve,"" Rodriguez said. ""I don't think about the obstacles too far in advance."" The response has been overwhelming, according to Rodriguez, who was attending the Friday opener of the annual NALIP conference. The network will allow Latino filmmakers to tell stories about the Latino community from their own point of view, he said. El Rey network will also appeal to general audiences, he added. ""It not only reflects the identity of a culture but shapes it,"" Rodriguez said of the new network. Rodriguez is Mexican-American with deep roots in Texas, where his family can trace its history to a land grant in 1760, he said. He grew up making movies in his backyard with a home video camera and proved to the world that a film can be made ""with very little money and no film crew"" when he enjoyed widespread success with ""El Mariachi"" in the early 1990s. The El Rey network will offer ""an action-packed, general entertainment network in English for Latino and general audiences that includes a mix of reality, scripted and animated series, movies, documentaries, news, music, comedy, and sports programming,"" according to Comcast. The Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Justice Department last year approved the merger of Comcast and NBC Universal, and now Comcast is starting the Aspire cable network for African-Americans led by Magic Johnson; the Revolt network for pop music by Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs and MTV veteran Andy Schuon; and Rodriguez's El Rey network, said NALIP board member Joseph Torres. The independent Latino producers group was formed in 1999 when film documentarian Maria Agui Carter and other Latinos banded together to address their under-representation in mass media, Carter said. ""We used to be few hundred people that started in 1999, very frustrated at lack of access, trying to kick down the doors"" of major media and film making outlets, Carter said. ""Through our own community building, we finally realized that we are the ones that we were waiting for."" The group now touts a newsletter of industry trends with 10,000 subscribers, and this week will address how the nation's second-largest group watches more television, buys more movie tickets and consumes more media than any other ethnicity -- and yet comprises less than 1% of executives in Hollywood. At its annual conference that began Friday in Universal City, California, the group will honor actress Rita Moreno, who has won an Oscar, an Emmy, a Tony and a Grammy Award, and will feature a keynote speech by Rodriguez. NALIP describes itself as the nation's pre-eminent association for Latino independent film and video makers. The NALIP 2012 conference, called ""Diverse Voices, Universal Content,"" is chiefly sponsored by Time Warner (the parent company of CNN) and the National Latino Media Council. ""We are celebrating the incredible explosion of Latinos in the media both in front and behind the camera,"" Carter said. ""There are great improvements in the representation of Latinos, especially in television, but there are very few directors, vice presidents and above, film and TV executives and very few at the major and mini-major studios and few in the (talent) agencies and the management companies,"" Carter said. ""That, of course, affects the opportunities that Latinos in the media are able to take advantage of,"" she said. The group points out how the presence of minority industry writers in film and television has been stuck at 6% since 1999 and the percentage of minority directors is even smaller. Meanwhile, Latinos are estimated to spend $1 billion on U.S. filmed entertainment and hold $1 trillion in general market buying power, NALIP says. On Saturday, the organization will discuss ""race and the media"" in a closing plenary that will look at how systemic, economic and cultural factors affect representation in mass media. Torres, co-author with New York Daily News columnist Juan Gonzalez of ""News for All the People: The Epic Story of Race and the American Media,"" said among the ways to remedy the inequities is continued training of ""the new generation of filmmakers."" Advocacy groups also need to hold media companies accountable through federal laws and policy, said Torres, who is senior director at the national media reform and public interest group Free Press. Government policy ""determines who are the corporate gatekeepers, who owns media outlets under mergers, and whether the Internet will continue to remain a communications network for people to express themselves,"" Torres said. The El Rey network would be ""the biggest opportunity, the biggest bellwether trend, for opening mainstream media to Latinos,"" Torres said. ""It's one of the biggest opportunities to come around in a while for Latinos, to have a presence in cable television,"" Torres said. ""It's going to be an opportunity for jobs and producing content.""","Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez will lead El Rey, a new Latino network .

"(CNN) -- A grainy sonar image taken hundreds of feet below the ocean's surface may help unravel a mystery that has baffled historians for decades. What happened to aviator Amelia Earhart, and where's her plane? No one has been able to answer that question since 1937, when Earhart, navigator Fred Noonan and their Lockheed Electra plane disappeared during a doomed attempt at an around-the-world flight. But information revealed by a team of researchers this week indicates they may have found a new clue. The sonar image was recorded by search teams scanning the ocean floor nearly a year ago near Nikumaroro Island, in the South Pacific. ""It's the right size, it's the right shape, and it's in the right place,"" The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery said on its website. But it wasn't until March that one analyst made the connection in an online forum for the group. The organization says experts have offered different interpretations. Some think it could be a man-made object, and others say it could be a geologic feature. ""So did (last summer's) expedition actually succeed in locating the wreckage of the world's most famous missing airplane? Or is this sonar target just a coral rock or ridge?"" the organization said on its website. ""Of course we're not going to know until we can get back out there, but until then the anomaly is worth close study."" CNN's Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.","A sonar image recorded last summer may show Amelia Earhart's plane .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court will hear the case of a frequent flier labeled a frequent complainer by one airline. Rabbi Binyomin Ginsberg claims his WorldPerks Platinum Elite membership was revoked after being told he had ""abused"" his privileges, repeatedly filing complaints for upgrades and other benefits. Northwest Airlines, which was consumed by Delta Air Lines in a 2008 merger, said it had ""sole judgment"" over the program's general terms and conditions to make such determinations. At issue is whether Ginsberg has a right under state law to bring his case or whether it is preempted by the 1970s-era law that deregulated the airline industry. That law prohibits parties from bringing similar state claims against airlines relating to a ""price, route, or service"" of the carrier. Ginsberg is dean of Torah Academy in Minneapolis and travels frequently to lecture and teach. He joined Northwest's WorldPerks frequent flier program in 1999 and reached Platinum Elite status in 2005. But in June of 2008, Ginsberg claimed a Northwest representative called him and told him his status was being revoked on grounds that he ""abused"" the program, according to court papers. Ginsberg said the airline also took away the hundreds of thousands of miles accumulated in his account. ""It didn't make sense. Initially, when they contacted me on the phone I thought it was a prank call,"" Ginsberg told CNN. ""When I pushed for a reason and clarification, they told me it was because I was complaining too much."" A month after that call, Northwest sent the rabbi a letter noting that he had made 24 complaints in the past eight months, including nine incidents of his bag arriving late at the luggage carousel, according to court papers. ""You have continually asked for compensation over and above our guidelines. We have awarded you $1,925 in travel credit vouchers, 78,500 WorldPerks bonus miles, a voucher extension for your son, and $491 in cash reimbursements,"" the letter said, according to court papers. ""Due to our past generosity, we must respectfully advise that we will no longer be awarding you compensation each time you contact us."" Ginsberg's lawyers countered the rabbi and his wife had been averaging about 75 flights on Northwest each year, and that Ginsberg estimated that only about 10 percent of the trips had resulted in a call to Northwest's customer care. ""I don't think I was a frequent complainer,"" Ginsberg said. ""They should have taken their time and analyzed: Were my complaints legitimate? Should they be doing something to improve their service and quality of product? Instead of worrying, we've got to shut up somebody who is complaining too much."" Later that fall, Northwest sent Ginsberg an e-mail, in which the airline quoted a paragraph from the fine print of the WorldPerks Program. It stated that Northwest could determine ""in its sole judgment"" whether a passenger has abused the program, and that abuse ""may result in cancellation of the member's account and future disqualification from program participation, forfeiture of all mileage accrued and cancellation of previously issued but unused awards."" Ginsberg sued for $5 million over a breach of contract in January 2009, but a federal judge in San Diego dismissed the class action suit, agreeing with Northwest that the Airline Deregulation Act preempted his claim. The airline's lawyers also argued that the WorldPerks general terms and conditions did not require Northwest to provide frequent fliers with lengthy explanations or reasons for its decision to terminate or demote a member's status in the program. But in 2011, a federal appeals court in San Francisco reversed, ordered it to reconsider Ginsberg's class action claims. It said that when Congress passed the deregulation law, it did not intend to ""immunize the airline industry from liability for common law contract claims."" There was no immediate comment from Delta to the high court accepting its appeal. Ginsberg -- who is still a frequent flier, but is no longer loyal to any one airline -- said he is hoping to get his miles back, have his status reinstated, and get fair compensation for what he's gone through. ""To me, it's outright fraud. You can't take somebody's mileage away when they've accumulated it,"" he said. ""We live in a country that was built on freedom and this to me is a tremendous abuse of freedom."" The case is Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg (12-462). CNN's A. Pawlowski contributed to this report.","Minnesota rabbi was a frequent flier on Northwest Airlines .

"(CNN) -- Every post you ""like."" Every friend you add or fan page you join. Every place you check in, and every Web page you recommend. To you, those are ways to enjoy, expand and improve your experience on Facebook. To Facebook, they're the building blocks of a multibillion-dollar company. In business, there's a well-worn line that could apply to the social-networking behemoth: If you're not paying for it, you're not the customer. You're the product. In this case, you're a product worth, to Facebook, an average $4.84 a year. As Facebook hits Wall Street this week with a public stock offering that could value the company at more than $100 billion, investors appear dazzled by the company's uncanny ability to put the right advertisements in front of its roughly 900 million users. ""The unique thing about these guys is the accuracy with which they can help advertisers and marketers understand who they're getting,"" said Arvind Bhatia, an analyst with Sterne Agee Financial Services. ""On Facebook, your information is authentic; they are able to basically make the ads, and your experience, more relevant. I think that is unique. It's unprecedented and the reach is unparalleled."" In documents filed in relation to its stock offering, Facebook says that about 85% of its revenue comes from advertising. The other 15% comes from payments made within apps that run on the site (a head-turning 12% is from a single source -- Zynga, makers of social games such as ""FarmVille."") As Bhatia suggests, Facebook's unprecedented advertising advantage is built upon the service it provides. As users interact with the site, they gradually build a fuller and fuller picture of themselves. That, in turn, lets Facebook sell advertisers on its ability to put their product in front of the people most likely to be interested. CNNMoney: You're only worth $1.21 (per quarter) to Facebook . How targeted ads work . For example, say a woman who has listed her hometown as New Orleans changes her relationship status from ""single"" to ""engaged."" Facebook suddenly has a hot prospect to offer up to a bridal retailer or caterer in the Big Easy. To dig deeper, if she lists her MBA from Loyola and has ""liked"" pages for, say, Saks Fifth Avenue and Mercedes Benz, you get a fuller picture of how much she might be willing to spend. ""With a reported 901 million members, Facebook is a great test bed for understanding consumers and their purchasing interests,"" said Jan Rezab, CEO of Socialbakers, a social-media analytics firm. ""Before Facebook, marketers relied on online surveys or focus groups to determine customer interest. Now, they can reach the customer directly on their Facebook page."" Facebook doesn't publicly give away the details of how its system works. But as it has begun wooing potential investors, the company has been more willing to talk about its advertising approach. Dan Rose, Facebook vice president of partnerships and platform marketing, discussed the appeal of its social ads at an event recently in Austin, Texas. According to research from Pew, the average Facebook user has 229 friends. When that user likes a product or company's ad, it serves as an endorsement to those friends from someone they know and, presumably, trust. ""When I raise my hand and say, I like Einstein (Bros.) bagels, and then one of my friends sees that ad, they're going to see my name in that ad,"" Rose said. Through Facebook's partnership with the media-research firm Nielsen, ""We found that when my friend's name is in an ad, I'm over 60% more likely to remember the ad, and I'm over four times more likely to purchase the product,"" he said. ""This is word of mouth. This is word of mouth at scale. This is what, as marketers, we've always been trying to bottle up and find a way to take advantage of. And the social Web is finally allowing us to do that."" In his 2010 book, ""The Facebook Effect,"" David Kirkpatrick recounts chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg's arrival in 2008, when she sharpened the company's focus on what would become the current advertising model. CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, remained focused on growing the site and improving user experience -- a focus he reportedly maintains to this day. Kirkpatrick writes of the level of detail a Facebook ad can reach: . ""Anybody can pick through endless combinations on Facebook's self-service ad page,"" he wrote, referring to the tool advertisers use to target their ads. ""You can show your ad only to married women aged 35 and up who live in northern Ohio. Or display an ad only to employees of one company in a certain city on a certain day. (Employers aiming to cherry-pick people from a competitor do this all the time). ""Customers for Facebook's more expensive engagement ads can select from even more detailed choices -- women who are parents, talk about diapers, listen to Coldplay and live in cities, for example."" In its Wall Street filing, Facebook listed its Average Revenue Per User at $1.21 per quarter, or $4.84 a year. That's less than rivals like Google and Yahoo and miniscule compared to companies with more traditional business models, like wireless providers and cable companies. But, as Rose says, it's all about scale for a company that will likely reach 1 billion user accounts by the end of the year. Are you living without Facebook? User data and privacy . Not that the model hasn't made some folks antsy. Time and again, tweaks to Facebook's privacy settings have prompted user backlash, occasionally to the point that the site has reversed or modified those changes. According to a recent Associated Press/CNBC poll, three out of five users say they have little or no faith that the company will protect their personal information. Half of those who use the site daily say they wouldn't make a purchase through it and 57% of all users claimed they never click on ads or other sponsored content. On a page about its advertising approach, Facebook makes it clear that it never sells user data, saying that ""if you don't feel like you're in control of who sees what you share, you probably won't use Facebook as much, and you'll share less with your friends."" Facebook officials also emphasize that while advertisers can market to specific users, they don't receive the data that was used to make the selection and never know the actual names of the people they've reached. Facebook's policy is to not actually look at user data except to check whether someone is violating the site's terms of service. Doubling down on user satisfaction is the most important thing Facebook can do, Bhatia said, even if it occasionally means passing up chances to max out the amount it could earn on the data users provide. ""For them, the user experience does come first and I think that's the right strategy for the long term,"" he said. ""Along the way, putting the user experience first makes a lot of longer-term business sense."" As an analyst, Bhatia is bullish on Facebook, leading the pack with an early ""buy"" rating at the beginning of this month. With Facebook reportedly looking at expanding into China and at monetizing its mobile app (an untapped resource even though the majority of time on the site is now spent on mobile devices) he expects its data-driven model to keep making money well into the future. ""Facebook is going to become just like search, [which] disrupted online advertising,"" he said. ""What Google did eight years ago -- that is what Facebook is doing now. The reach is unparalleled and they're just scratching the surface.""","Facebook's multibillion-dollar business model relies on user data .
Experts say the social network's targeted advertising can be uniquely precise .

"Washington (CNN) -- A bipartisan group of senators is scrambling to reach a fresh compromise they hope can propel a proposal to overhaul U.S. immigration policy toward passage in that chamber and provide momentum heading into the Republican-controlled House. A deal remained elusive, however, on Tuesday evening and it was uncertain whether the stark differences that have stalled immigration reform for years in Congress could be bridged with time running out on debate. Raising new questions on whether any immigration bill will get through Congress this year, House Speaker John Boehner said earlier in the day that he did not see any way of bringing a bill on that issue to the floor that relied on Democrats to pass. Under enormous pressure from conservatives opposed to the bipartisan Senate bill, Boehner has until now sidestepped questions about how he would move forward. ""I don't see any way of bringing an immigration bill to the floor that doesn't have majority support of Republicans,"" he told reporters following a closed-door GOP conference meeting where a source said he made similar comments to reassure members. Efforts to push forward immigration reform are emotionally charged as the issue has huge political stakes for both sides. President Barack Obama and Democrats want to fulfill a promise to Hispanic Americans, the nation's fastest-growing demographic, to address the limbo of immigrants living illegally in the country and maintain their overall support. Republican strategists are concerned about the GOP's long term viability in national elections if it does not win over the important voting bloc, which went strongly for Obama in November. The Senate bill negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators dubbed the ""Gang of Eight"" proposes a path to citizenship for some 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. But conservatives consider any measure offering a path to citizenship tantamount to amnesty for those who entered the country illegally. In addition, concerns about whether the bill will tighten security along the nation's porous borders, as asserted by backers of the plan, may make it difficult for conservatives to support it -- especially those up for re-election next year. Debate began last week and senators have been sorting through amendments. Sen. Marco Rubio, a key player in the Senate debate, senses that significant progress has been made in trying to bridge the gap. ""I think we're on the right track,"" the Florida Republican said. During a series of afternoon votes, members of the ""Gang of Eight"" huddled on the floor and separately with other key senators -- twisting arms, cajoling, convincing. In a rare scene, a large group of Republicans anxiously worked the room seeking compromises. The ""Gang of Eight"" and Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, and Sen. John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, are attempting to broker a compromise. As of now, it would tighten border security requirements primarily by having Congress dictate exactly how secure the border must be before immigrants in the United States illegally can begin the process of gaining citizenship. By shifting that responsibility to Congress and away from the executive branch, negotiators hope to pick up support from Republican senators who are reluctant to leave that determination to the administration. 5 things to know about immigration reform . The emerging deal also would include several other Republican priorities related to entry and exit biometrics, the E-Verify workplace verification program, and rules that would prevent immigrants from getting public benefits. ""Corker and I are trying to get enough of these together so you can get a meaningful bipartisan group on the bill,"" explained Hoeven, who said he hoped to introduce the proposal as early as Wednesday. A package of amendments is ""something that creates a momentum around the building that people are seeking,"" said Corker. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said time was critical as he threatened to end debate on the bill soon in order to keep a promise to finish the bill by the end of the month. Love or country: Immigration law means hard choices for gay couples . 5 things to know about immigration reform . A bipartisan group of seven House members -- three Republicans and four Democrats -- is still finalizing its own comprehensive immigration bill that mirrors many of the provisions in the Senate bill, including eventual citizenship for undocumented workers. A CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday shows a small majority of Americans support the approach in the Senate bill. The poll shows that 51% say they support a bill that would attempt to increase border security and create a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants, with 45% saying they are opposed to such a measure.

"London (CNN) -- The rock band Black Sabbath have created music history on both sides of the Atlantic with the release of their new album ""13."" The record has provided the band with their first number one album in the U.S. and their first album chart topper in the UK after an unprecedented 43 years. They have achieved the landmark by returning to their roots. It's the band's first album for more than three decades featuring vocalist Ozzy Osbourne along with fellow original band members guitarist Tony Iommi and bass player Geezer Butler. They credit producer Rick Rubin with helping them overcome their initial apprehension. ""He was really good for us"", says Butler ""and suggested we go back to the old spirit of how we used to do things like live in the studio, a jam, live in the studio kind of feel. And that gave us the direction to go in."" ""We tried it in 2001"" adds Osbourne ""and I think unconsciously we knew this was our last chance. If we had failed on this attempt people would have said 'ah it's never gonna happen.' I think it must be over 30 or 40 years since I listened to the first album because you know you move on and you challenge yourself. As I was saying earlier on, it's like asking the Beatles to go back to 'Please Please Me' and they would have gone 'what?'"" That first album was recorded in just two days in the English city of Birmingham in 1969. The band's name was inspired by seeing people queuing to see a horror movie at a cinema in the city. Osbourne recalls: ""Black Sabbath was an after-thought cos originally we were a blues jazz band and someone said 'people pay money to see horror movies and get scared, why don't we start writing scary music?'"" Playing scary music produced a legacy that has influenced generations of rock bands and labeled Black Sabbath as godfathers of heavy metal. But the band has an uneasy relationship with their musical offspring. ""I have never ever ever been able to attach myself to the word 'heavy metal' -- it has no musical connotations,"" Osbourne says. ""If it was heavy rock I could get that but the 70s was kind of like a bluesy thing, the 80s was kind of bubblegum-frosted hair, multicolored clothes and the 90s was kind of grungy. People come up to me and say 'your Sabbath work was a big influence on me.' I could go 'Oh yeah I can see that' but other bands... what part of that is inspired by us? Some of it is just angry people screaming down a microphone!"" The band had to overcome several obstacles to complete the new album. Original drummer Bill Ward was replaced by Rage Against the Machine's Brad Wilk on the new album after a contractual dispute. And Tony Iommi was diagnosed with cancer. ""If it was me I'd just go ""I'm out of here"" says Osbourne ""but he never complained once, he just kept it to himself, I'd be thinking this is the end if it was me. My wife beat cancer. I didn't know if anyone could beat cancer."" ""He was an inspiration to us during the album"" adds Butler. ""Nothing would stand in his way. He just got on with it and through it and I thought if he can do that then I can do that so we persevered with it."" Ozzy Osbourne recently apologized to his band mates and wife Sharon after admitting he'd relapsed into a cycle of drink and drugs. But he says he's been sober now for four months and ready to take the album on the road. They say the touring experience now is very different to their wildest days. ""It's great"" says Osbourne. ""I don't go to clubs or bars, I stay in my room."" ""Do the gig then go to bed!"" laughs Butler. Man had not long since set foot on the moon when Black Sabbath had their first number one album in the UK. It took a record-breaking interval of 42 years and eight months to repeat the feat. At times it may have felt like the beginning of the end for the band but in the words of one of their album's stand-out tracks it may in fact be merely the ""End of the Beginning."" Osbourne ends in reflective mood. ""Black Sabbath wasn't some band created by a London mogul. We were four guys who had a dream that became bigger than expectations. It's been the best thing that ever happened to me.""","Black Sabbath creates history with the release of their new album ""13""

"Eagar, Arizona (CNN) -- A huge wildfire in eastern Arizona grew Wednesday, prompting the Apache County Sheriff's office to order the full evacuations of two towns, home to about 8,000 people. Residents of Eagar and Springerville received the order late Wednesday afternoon, officials said. Other communities were warned they could be next. ""We had a lot of spot fires today,"" said Jim Whittington, public information officer for the Southwest National Incident Management Team. Hot and dry conditions, with winds out of the southwest, continued to make firefighting efforts difficult, Whittington told CNN. While firefighters battled the fast-moving blaze, residents in its path faced serious choices: whether to stay -- and what to take with them if they leave. ""We're going to get out of here because they want us out of here. That's the main reason,"" said Eagar resident Bob Meador. ""We don't want to go."" Authorities have evacuated thousands of people since the wildfire, known as the Wallow Fire, began sweeping through the Apache National Forest late last month. It had burned about 389,000 acres by Wednesday. Officials Wednesday said they feared flying embers could cause the fire to spread, and expanded evacuations. The fire was moving around the city Greer, subject of a Monday evacuation. It also was threatening New Mexico, where residents have felt the effects of smoke and ash. A firefighting team will operate out of Reserve, New Mexico, about 20 miles east of the border, Whittington said. On Wednesday, the front of the fire was just three miles away from the Meador family's Eagar Street home. Bob Meador and his son, Rodney, loaded what they could into a pair of pickup trucks. ""We packed up a bunch, we're just hoping it ain't going to burn, hoping and praying,"" Rodney Meador said. But not everything fit, forcing them to make tough decisions. The Xbox made the cut, but family photos stayed behind. Their 18-year-old dog, Tigger, got a seat in the cab of the truck, but the family cat remained at home. Firefighters are focusing on saving homes in Eagar and nearby Springerville. But Bob Meador said he wasn't ready to take any chances. As smoke filled their neighborhood, the Meadors hit the road, hoping they would have a home to return to once the fire passes. ""I've seen them wildfires in California just rip through places, so that's what I worry about,"" Bob Meador said. Next-door neighbor Dave Hunt, speaking before the evacuation order, said he was determined to stay, and was putting his faith in the roughly 2,500 firefighters who are battling the blaze. Earlier this week, Hunt -- a butcher at a local supermarket -- prepared 2,000 pounds of hamburger to feed fire crews. ""We have so many firefighters here that are so into their jobs and the have protected other small communities that I know they are going to do a good job protecting Eagar,"" he said. The driveway of Hunt's home is lined with white stones, each a souvenir of a trip his father and stepmother took to the nearby White Mountains over 17 years. Fire has already engulfed most of the mountains where they vacationed, but the stones are reminders of good times, he said. ""My dad built this place, and he's gone now, and I love this area so much. I've lived all over the country, and this is it. This is where I'm at,"" he said. Even so, he said he'll join the steady stream of residents heading for safer ground if conditions get worse. ""I'm not a dummy. When the wind shifts when the ash starts to get heavy, when the smoke changes, it's time to go,"" he said.

"DALAT, Vietnam (CNN) -- Dalat Nuclear Research Institute stands on a mountaintop in Vietnam's southern highlands. The nuclear reactor is not what most Vietnamese think of when they think of Dalat. The town, nestled in pine woods, is Vietnam's favorite honeymoon spot. Highly enriched uranium rods are laid out on a table at the research institute in Dalat, Vietnam. The institute is not a romantic place. Located in a cylindrical, concrete building, it contains a 500-kilowatt, pool-type reactor that had only recently been loaded with Soviet WWR-M2 fuel assemblies. Built in 1963 with U.S. help, it originally contained highly enriched uranium from the United States. In 1975, at the end of the Vietnam War, the reactor was closed, then reconstructed by the Soviet Union. In 1983, it reopened, this time using Soviet highly enriched uranium -- a Cold War marriage made in heaven. The institute created medical isotopes and carried out research, but few people if any, in those days thought about the possibility that terrorists might take an interest in the uranium.  Watch experts remove nuclear fuel and show how easily terrorists could hide it Â» . As I was soon to see for myself, fresh, highly enriched uranium is easy to smuggle. When clad with aluminum, its radiation is detectable only by specialized sensors. Approximately 25 kilograms are all that is needed to make a crude nuclear device. I had never heard of Dalat when, sitting at my desk in Washington last July, I got a call from a contact at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration. A dream I had had several years ago, when I was working in Moscow as CNN's bureau chief was about to come true: CNN was given the green light to be the only television network invited to shoot a secret joint U.S./Russian mission to remove the HEU fuel from the Dalat reactor. The Vietnamese government, once a U.S. enemy, had agreed to give up its HEU in exchange for converting the reactor to low-enriched uranium that cannot be used for a bomb. My contact gave few details over the phone. I went to the Department of Energy for a closed-door briefing. CNN cameraman Charlie Miller and I would travel to Ho Chi Minh City, where we would meet the Department of Energy staff, then fly to Dalat and drive to the reactor. According to DOE ground rules, we would be able to share only a few details of the operation with our senior editors. The timing of the actual transfer of the HEU was classified. We would learn it only after we had arrived in Vietnam. We would not be able to broadcast our report until the nuclear material was back in Russia. After our arrival in Ho Chi Minh City September 11, we, along with a U.S. and a Japanese newspaper reporter, met the other members of the team: two Russian nuclear experts and a representative from the International Atomic Energy Agency -- the nuclear watchdog of the United Nations -- who were to certify completion of the transfer. After a short flight to Dalat, we loaded into a van and set out on the serpentine road toward the research institute, passing ribbons of Vietnamese on motor scooters, the primary mode of transportation here. At the gate, a color poster of Ho Chi Minh greets us. Inside, we don yellow lab coats, cover our shoes with blue throw-away slippers and enter the cavernous room where the reactor stands, towering over us like something out of ""Dr. Strangelove."" The HEU fuel rods have been removed from the reactor and are stored in a large metal case. A Vietnamese scientist fumbles with the keys, then opens the top and begins handing the rods to the Russian experts, who lay them out on a table. The experts are wearing dosimeters to measure the radiation, but only one person wears gloves -- simple, rough cotton ones. They hand me a fuel rod and I hold it in my bare hands. Now I understand just how easy it would be for a terrorist to disguise the fact that he or she was carrying highly enriched uranium. The fuel rod looks for all the world like an aluminum leg to a small table. The experts lead us up steep metal stairs to the top of the reactor. I peer down into the pool of water into which a technician is lowering new fuel rods made of low-enriched uranium. Unlike highly enriched uranium, this fuel cannot be used to make a bomb. The Vietnamese are willing to cooperate, but they also want to verify that this new fuel will work as well as the HEU did. In the control room, they huddle in front of a wall of electronic gauges, waiting until the reactor reaches ""criticality."" As a blue gauge hits the mark, the room fills with applause. Professor Vuong Huu Tan, chairman of the Vietnam Atomic Energy Commission, tells me ""the most important part of the reactor is training our people in nuclear energy."" This is the other part of the equation: By complying with the U.S./Russian effort to remove vulnerable nuclear materials, Vietnam assures it will get international support for its quest to build nuclear power plants to generate energy. Both U.S. and Russian companies are eyeing Vietnam as a potential market. The Russians wrap the fuel rods in plastic, then insert them into two large, steel cylinders. The IAEA expert seals them. If they're tampered with, it will be obvious. The next day, a flatbed military truck backs into the reactor room. A crane lifts the cylinders and gently lays them on the truck's wooden bed as a Vietnamese military officer, in olive drab, looks on. The final and most vulnerable phase of the operation begins. The truck drives through the reactor gates and joins a convoy guarded by armed soldiers. Sirens blaring, we set out in a slow procession, weaving down the mountain road, traffic police on motorcycles waving riders on motor scooters out of the way. At Dalat's airport, the truck wheels onto the tarmac and stops near a Vietnamese military helicopter. A forklift lowers the cylinders to the ground and six soldiers heave them in slings to the helicopter. From there, they are flown to the military base at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where they are put onto a Russian transport plane. Until the last moment, it is unclear whether the Vietnamese military will allow journalists onto the base. As one soldier tells a member of the nuclear team, ""the last time Americans were here was when you bombed us."" But they do let us in. ""No pictures outside. Just inside the plane."" We climb the stairs into the belly of the Ilyushin 76 and see the two baby-blue cylinders filled with highly enriched uranium, nestled side by side, like two children of the Cold War, ready for a trip back to where they came from: Russia. At 2 p.m., right on schedule, the engines roar and the plane lumbers down the runway, off to its ultimate destination in the Ural Mountains. There, the HEU will be blended into a form that cannot be used for bomb-making. My instincts tell me to grab a phone and call CNN headquarters in Atlanta to report that the plane has taken off, but the embargo is strict: no broadcast until the HEU is safely back on Russian soil. On the sweltering tarmac at a military base in Ho Chi Minh City, as the plane rises in the sky, the team of nuclear experts, the Vietnamese soldiers and even we reporters break into applause. Three countries: Russia, the United States and Vietnam, intertwined in a complex page of history, brought together in a mission to make the world more secure. This is the 13th such mission carried out by the United States and Russia. Altogether, a total of 442 kilograms of fresh HEU from 11 countries, enough to build more than 17 crude nuclear devices, have been removed. But there is more to be done. The two countries still are only halfway there in securing vulnerable nuclear materials around the world.

"(CNN) -- The scattered bits of information you upload to Facebook might not seem interesting on their own -- a photo of a baby here, a happy birthday greeting there. But taken as a whole, your Facebook profile is a trove of data that can be analyzed to find patterns and stats about your online life (or your friends' lives). A new tool from Wolfram Alpha churns out an extensive and personalized analytics report all about you based on Facebook data. Go to the Wolfram Alpha site, type in ""Facebook report"" and click the button that reads Analyze My Facebook Data. You will need to give the Wolfram Connection app permission to access your Facebook profile and history. Once it's done computing, you'll be presented with a detailed, interactive, graph filled, time-killing report of your Facebook life. Get stats on the types of friends you have, including age ranges, relationship status and religion. See your most popular photos and posts, a chart of when you're most likely to post on Facebook, and a neat graphic showing how all of your friends are connected to each other and to you. There are over 60 sections of information to dig into, including word clouds, pie charts and maps. You can also get a report on your willing Facebook friends by typing ""Facebook Friends"" into the Wolfram Alpha search field. Wolfram Alpha is a computational search engine that is known for, among other things, being part of the brains that power Apple's voice-assistant, Siri. Dr. Stephen Wolfram, the founder of Wolfram Research, is deeply interested in the personal analytics field. In March, he shared detailed analytics of his own work life, using vast amounts of data he's been collecting about himself, including over two decades of e-mails, a log of every keystroke he's typed for years (100 million plus), meetings, phone calls and, thanks to a pedometer, steps taken. He looked at the data for trends that would give him clues about his own life and behavior, including when he's most creative . Most people don't have that extensive an amount of data on their lives, but they probably have more than they think. While Wolfram has been actively recording this data, most people have been creating trails without realizing it. E-mail archives, FitBits, Tweets, texts and geotagged images and check-ins are all usable stores of information about your life. it's just a matter of time until there are accessible tools to extract, helping make sense out of all of it. Wolfram says there are plenty more sources he hasn't tapped yet for his own personal number crunching, including medical data, his genome and motion sensors in his home. The Facebook tool is just the start for consumers too -- the company plans to add new tools and features in the future. The Facebook analytics tool is fun, but also a sobering reminder of just how much information we willingly share with social networks. It could inspire some people to clamp down on the amount of information they share online, and others to record even more and embrace all the interesting possibilities of tracking personal data. ""I've no doubt that one day pretty much everyone will routinely be doing all sorts of personal analytics on a mountain of data that they collect about themselves,"" says Wolfram in the blog post.","New tool from Wolfram Alpha analyzes your Facebook data .

"(CNN) -- From Cape Desolation and Bong Bong to Lake Disappointment and Woolloomooloo, Australia is no stranger to bleak, odd or evocative place names. Towns like Come By Chance, Home Rule and Wattanobi are perfectly normal within the Australian context -- and locals use them without thinking -- but the country's Geographical Names Board has proposed tightening the regulations on naming places. Local favorites like Curly Dick Road -- a place name in Meadow Flat in New South Wales which is stoutly defended by locals -- would likely remain, but those that could be considered offensive, such as Titswobble Drive, may be candidates for a future name cull. ""We don't want to stop Australia's tradition of weird and wonderful place names,"" Geographical Names Board deputy chairman Paul Harcombe told CNN. ""We will consider anything as long as it's not commercial or offensive. ""We realize that working street names like Curly Dick Road get a bit of a giggle, but provided they're not offensive we won't go back and change them."" He said some of the more colorful suggestions from local councils for streets in new developments were often rejected for practical reasons. A council in the New South Wales town of Cowra wanted to name a street .303, after the ammunition, to recall the town's military history. ""But can you imagine being part of emergency services and being called to number 33, 303 Street? It's simply not workable,"" Harcombe said. ""What we want is a unique name for every address in Australia -- we often get proposals that list a Railway Street North, a Railway Street South and a Railway Parade all within close proximity of each other. ""This is the sort of thing we want to avoid,"" he said. He said that under the proposals, existing place names would be safe for the time being but the board would consider applications to rename streets if there were compelling circumstances. The guidelines outline which new place names would be accepted by the board -- those with Aboriginal or multicultural origins are favored. He said the board often considered proposals to restore Aboriginal place names and had two official names for many well-known places such as Mt. Warning, which is also called Wollumbin. Aboriginal place names were particularly sensitive, however, especially if they marked known massacre sites. ""We had a problem with a place called Waterloo Creek which was named after a very one-sided massacre of Aboriginal people at the site,"" Harcombe said. ""In the end, the local Aboriginal council decided it was better to have the massacre site marked. There are some things you can't expunge from history."" Under the proposed guidelines, places and roads named after living people, or those holding public office, are to be avoided because ""community attitudes and opinions change over time."" He cited the example of Alan Bond Place in Marsfield, named after the man who backed Australia's winning America's Cup team in the late 80s but went on to be jailed for fraud. Cliches, too, are being weeded out and the board said it would prefer names that avoid repetition. For that reason, Sugar Loaf, Sandy, Back, Bald, Deep, Long, Kangaroo, Reedy, Rocky, Spring and Stony -- staples of many Australian towns -- have been placed on the ""avoid"" list. The regulations are not likely to please punctuation pedants, however, with the board saying it would eliminate apostrophes -- they've already been eliminated from places including Howes Valley -- and retain names that have been corrupted by long-established usage. Australia's most famous example of this is its highest peak Mt. Kosciuszko. Named after the Polish national hero Tadeusz Kosciuszko in 1840, the Geographical Names Board only reverted to the correct spelling (it was previously spelt Kosciusko) in 1997. Despite this, Australians still pronounce the name as ""koz-i-os-go."" The traditional Polish pronunciation of ""kozh-tshush-ko"" is almost never used. Harcombe said the missing 'z' from Kosciuszko had been particularly controversial, drawing representation from the Polish community in Australia, the Polish ambassador and even the Vatican. ""Kosciuszko is a national hero in Poland. It was described to me as leaving the 'j' out of Banjo Paterson,"" Harcombe said, referring to one of Australia's national poets.","Australia's Geographical Names Board proposes tightening rules .
Names considered offensive, like Titswobble Drive, could be changed .
Some proposals are rejected for practical reasons, others are just strange .

"(CNN) -- Facebook seems to be taking a beating these days. But guess what? That's actually good news. The world's most famous social media company's plummeting share price (from $38 on its first trading day to $19 today) is an indicator that we are not in a bubble, as investors refuse to buy into the temptation to blow tech offerings out of proportion. You know you are in a bubble when stocks soar regardless of intrinsic quality. Far from it, the current market is one of Dickensian realism: the best of times and the worst of times. Apple's value has soared because it has a clear and wildly profitable strategy. Facebook, Groupon and Zynga sank because their strategies are unconvincing. Put another way, companies with solid revenue models are richly rewarded while companies foolish enough to go public before proving their model are punished. It's worth noting the companies that have not gone public. Unlike Facebook, Twitter remains private while it continues to refine its business model. Enterprise social network company Yammer sold itself to Microsoft because its founders realized that a sale was the only way to get the resources needed for growth without the risks and distractions inherent in going public. Facebook's wounds are self-inflicted. The company did a poor job of managing its investor growth and was forced to go public because of Securities and Exchange Commission rules governing companies with assets of more than $1 billion and more than 500 shareholders. Facebook compounded its misery by setting its IPO price too high and offering too many shares. Imagine telling Facebook underwriters and founder Mark Zuckerberg: ""You can either sell a lot of shares at a lower price or fewer shares at a higher price. Make a choice."" Apparently the answer was: ""We'll take both."" The consequence was more shares, and more expensive shares, than the market could absorb. Facebook thought that user popularity would translate to investor appeal and counted on its members to buy shares in the IPO. This is what is known as the ""Disneyland effect:"" A family visits Disneyland, has a wonderful time and in the glow of memory when they return home, the parents purchase a few shares, which they then hold forever. The Disneyland effect didn't work for Facebook for two reasons. First, ordinary investors are still gun-shy after the 2008 market crash and not yet comfortable buying stocks in any volume. This left only professional investors whose purchase decision was unlikely to be swayed by how much they like using Facebook to keep up with friends and family. Worse yet, I think Facebook has overestimated its own popularity. There is a difference between using Facebook and loving Facebook. The company has repeatedly annoyed its users with everything from privacy policy waffles to aggressive ad placements. Facebook is the Microsoft of social media; used by everyone but truly loved by few. Facebook resembles Microsoft in other ways as well. Facebook's interface is nearly as clunky and inelegant as Windows, and like Microsoft, Facebook is struggling to migrate off the desktop and follow its users onto mobile platforms like smartphones and tablets. Unfortunately, Facebook's revenue model depends on ample screen real estate in order to please advertisers without annoying users. Ads that can be tolerated on a laptop become a major annoyance when hogging scarce and valuable space on a smartphone. Of course Facebook can get its groove back and it must start with leadership. Calls for Zuckerberg to resign as CEO are premature and pointless, given his iron grip on voting power. But Zuck must match Facebook's growth with his own personal growth as a leader and strategist and must do it quickly. Facebook also needs more talent. When I visited Facebook's campus two days before its May IPO, the company had 1.5 billion users, $3.7 billion 2011 revenues, and less than 3,000 employees. That isn't lean; it's anorexic. I believe that many of Facebook's stumbles, including its smartphone failure, are due to the simple fact that it has too few people to implement its current strategies. In this respect, Facebook's weak stock value is an advantage as it can offer new hires options at prices comparable to pre-IPO rates. Facebook's stumble is not evidence of a bursting bubble. The market may be punishing the company today, but if Facebook can refocus and deliver, investors will be more than willing to reward it down the road. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Saffo.","Paul Saffo: Facebook's plummeting share price indicates that we are not in a bubble .

"(CNN) -- After scouring hundreds of miles of waters off Australia's coast, authorities on Friday called off a search for two cruise ship passengers who are believed to have fallen overboard. The 30-year-old man and 27-year-old woman were reported missing when the Carnival Cruise ship Spirit docked in Sydney on Thursday morning, CNN affiliate Seven Network reported. The first clue came when they didn't claim their luggage. Maritime officers reviewed surveillance video from the ship and determined that Paul Rossington and Kristen Schroder went overboard Wednesday night. Authorities believe the couple fell about 150 kilometers (93 miles) off Foster, New South Wales. ""We believe that they were up mid-deck, which is halfway up the side of the ship, which is quite a way to fall,"" said Detective Superintendent Mark Hutchings of the New South Wales Police Marine Area Command. Read more: Carnival cruise line in more troubled waters . Late Friday afternoon, New South Wales police said they called off the search after finding no sign of the couple. The search, involving an Australian navy ship, the police force's marine unit and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, covered 1,360 square nautical miles, they said. The couple was sharing a cabin and traveling with family and friends on a 10-day Pacific Island cruise. Police said they are investigating the fall. Schroder's family issued a statement thanking ""everyone involved in the search for both Paul and Kristen."" ""We would appreciate privacy and understanding while we come to terms with our beautiful girl's tragic accident,"" the family said. Carnival has been plagued by a series of high-profile incidents recently. In February, an engine room fire left the Carnival Triumph adrift in the Gulf of Mexico, with passengers reporting overflowing toilets and human waste running down the walls in some parts of the ship. On a March cruise, the Carnival Dream lost power, and some toilets stopped working.

"(Mashable) -- Apple is well known for being a tight ship, but apparently one of its board members forgot to batten down the hatches. That would be the most famous member of the board: Nobel laureate and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Speaking at the Discovery Invest Leadership Summit in South Africa, Gore interjected the following aside into his speech: ""Not to mention the new iPhones coming out next month. That was a plug."" That may not sound like a huge blunder -- after all, the fact that the iPhone 5 is going on sale at some point next month currently ranks as one of the world's worst-kept secrets. But take note: nobody at Apple has officially confirmed it yet. Even the October 4 unveiling, leaked to AllThingsD Wednesday morning, is still just a report. Nary an invite has been seen. Note also the plural in Gore's aside. It is possible that he was referring to multiple copies of the iPhone 5, but that seems unlikely -- especially as we've been hearing rumors for months of a lower-cost, lower-memory version dubbed the iCloud iPhone. Gore has been an Apple board member for more than eight years, and this is the first time we've seen him let slip even the slightest detail on an upcoming product. Given the company's code of secrecy, such an unwarranted statement in a prepared talk -- he wasn't even being interviewed -- counts as a major breach of discipline. If this were an Apple employee, or even any other board member, we'd fear for his future at 1 Infinite Loop. Gore, of course, is a heavy-hitter at the company who's done a lot of work on making Apple products more sustainable and reducing his carbon footprint. We're guessing he gets a pass this time. But Tim Cook, take note: Your ship is not as tight as you might like. See the original article on Mashable.com . Â© 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- A British man was jailed Tuesday for raping two of his daughters and fathering nine children over 27 years, a case with echoes of Austria's Josef Fritzl. The two daughters were made pregnant 19 times; there were nine births, five miscarriages and five terminations. Seven of the children are alive but suffer genetic deformities. The father, who cannot be named for legal reasons banning the identification of his victims and the surviving children, pleaded guilty Tuesday at Sheffield Crown Court, northern England, and was sentenced to serve 25 life sentences to run concurrently. The judge said the minimum term the 56-year-old rapist should serve in jail should be 19Â½ years. South Yorkshire Police Chief Superintendent Simon Torr said, ""The victims of these terrible crimes have asked me to state the following: 'His detention in prison brings us only the knowledge that he cannot physically touch us again. The suffering he has caused will continue for many years, and we must now concentrate our thoughts on finding the strength to rebuild our lives.' "" Speaking for the police, Torr added, ""The main concern ... is for those who have been so badly affected: the victims who have suffered a terrible ordeal. We will continue to offer them our full support to try and help them get on with their lives. ""As far as the sentence goes, we are satisfied that this offender has received the strongest possible punishment for his heinous crimes. Now we need to ensure continuing support for those who have suffered as a result of his actions."" The daughters first told police about their ordeal in June, but the abuse dated to 1981. It emerged that in 1998 one daughter rang Childline, a charity to help abused kids, and asked for assurances about being able to keep her children if she came forward. When Childline could not make that guarantee, the daughter did nothing more to raise her plight.  Watch how the case came to light Â» . The UK's Press Association reported that the rapes began in 1981 with daily attacks and that for long periods, they would be raped up to three times a week, and the assaults would continue through pregnancies. Their only reprieve came after they had just given birth or when they were ill because of the abuse. If either daughter tried to refuse their father's attacks, they would be punched, kicked and or held to the flames of a gas fire, burning their eyes and arms, PA reported. Despite visiting hospitals and meeting with social workers over the 27 years of abuse, no investigation was launched into the family. The case comes in the wake of the death of a baby, known only as Baby P, which has dominated headlines in Britain. The baby endured horrendous torture and died despite being on the local authority's child protection register. In Austria this year, Josef Fritzl was arrested, accused of keeping his daughter in a basement dungeon and fathering seven children through the rapes.","Dad in UK sentenced to life in jail for subjecting daughters to rapes over 27 years .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Several people have been seized in a plot to kill Pakistan's prime minister, and the suspects claim they were getting orders from a militant in the country's volatile tribal region, police said. Police official Babar Bakhat Qureshi told CNN that officers arrested several suspects who were plotting to attack the compound of Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani. Shabir Anwar, Gilani's press secretary, had no comment on the alleged plot because it is a security matter. The plot to strike the compound, located in the Punjab provincial city of Multan, was in its ""final planning stages,"" Qureshi said. The location is about 395 kilometers, or 245 miles, southeast of the nation's capital, Islamabad. The suspects were planning to use a car bomb for the attack, and that they had acquired large amounts of fertilizer to manufacture an improvised explosive device, since confiscated by police, he said.

"(CNN) -- Activists are organizing the first national gay blood drive Friday in an effort to combat the Food and Drug Administration's ban on blood donations from gay and bisexual men. The FDA bans donations from men who have had sex with other men since 1977, saying there is an increased risk of exposure to and transmission of infectious diseases -- including HIV -- in male-to-male sexual encounters. ""FDA uses multiple layers of safeguards in its approach to ensuring blood safety,"" the government agency's website says. The FDA screens all potential blood donors based on risk factors and signs of infections. Blood banks have been instructed to ask male donors if they have ever had sex with a man. If the potential donor responds ""yes,"" he is instantly removed from the donor pool for life. The policy started in the 1980s when people didn't know how the deadly virus that causes AIDS spread. At the time, there wasn't a good test to detect whether HIV was present in donated blood, and HIV was getting into the nation's blood supply. Scientists also knew that a disproportionate number of gay men were affected by the virus. Ryan James Yezak, lead organizer of the blood drive, is making a documentary about discrimination based on sexual orientation. He said he wants to convey on a national level how much blood the gay community could potentially contribute to the blood supply if given a chance to donate. ""This ban is medically unwarranted, and this drive is the only way we can motion for change,"" he said. ""The gay community shouldn't be written off as diseased."" Blood donations were down by 10% across the country in June, according to the American Red Cross, which received about 50,000 fewer donations than expected. 2012: Blood donations decline, U.S. ban on gay donors is examined . The ban is not discriminatory or based on any judgment concerning a donor's sexual orientation, according to the FDA. The policy statement is based on the documented increased risk of transmissible infections. The American Medical Association voted in June to oppose the FDA ban. ""The lifetime ban on blood donation for men who have sex with men is discriminatory and not based on sound science,"" said AMA board member Dr. William Kobler. The AMA is advocating for a new policy to ensure blood donation bans or deferrals are based on an individual's level of health risks instead of sexual orientation alone. Yezak is urging gay and bisexual men on Friday to visit designated blood donation centers, where a mobile HIV testing center will be located. He's asking the men to get tested, and if their HIV results are negative, to try and donate blood. The HIV test results will be collected and sent to the FDA to provide evidence of rejected willing and healthy donors in hopes of lifting the ban.

"(CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban vowed to assassinate former President Pervez Musharraf if he returns to the country as planned Sunday, a spokesman for the terrorist group said in a video message online. Tehrik-i-Taliban will send out a ""death squad"" to kill him, Ehsanullah Ehsan said Saturday. One of the squad members addressed Musharraf in English, demanding the former president surrender himself. After resigning in 2008, Musharraf spent five years in self-imposed exile in London and Dubai. Ex-President Musharraf announces return to Pakistan . He plans to fly on a commercial airline into Karachi on Sunday, then attend a rally that will include Pakistani expatriates from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates, he has said in a statement. He plans to lead his political party into Pakistan's general elections slated for May. In 1999, the then-chief of Pakistan's army became its president in a bloodless military coup. He remained in power until resigning in 2008 -- a period that included the U.S.-led invasion of neighboring Afghanistan. A few months before he left office, Benazir Bhutto -- Pakistan's first elected female prime minister -- was killed in a gun-suicide bomb attack as she was wrapping up a campaign rally in Rawalpindi.

"(CNN) -- Thirteen people have died from consuming bacteria-tainted cantaloupe in what has become the most fatal U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998, according to records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported September 12, when the CDC said 15 people in four states had been infected. The illnesses were traced to consumption of Rocky Ford cantaloupes grown at Jensen Farms' fields in Granada, Colorado. As of Monday morning, it had grown to 18 states, 72 illnesses and 13 deaths, according to the CDC's latest statistics. In 1998, 21 people died from consuming tainted hot dogs, according to a CDC database. In the current outbreak, four people who ate contaminated cantaloupes died in New Mexico, two each in Colorado and Texas, and one each in Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. Public health officials also have reported illnesses in California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, North Dakota, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. On September 14, Jensen Farms voluntarily recalled Rocky Ford whole cantaloupes shipped between July 29 and September 10. The cantaloupes were distributed in 17 states -- Illinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The cantaloupes also were exported, and while the CDC did not name the affected countries, it said they had been notified of the recall. The cantaloupes may bear a green-and-white sticker that reads: Product of USA-Frontera Produce-Colorado Fresh-Rocky Ford-Cantaloupe, or a gray, yellow, and green sticker that says: Jensen Farms-Sweet Rocky Fords. Many of the cantaloupes, however, will not have a label, said CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden. He urged consumers either to check for a label or ask the supermarket where the cantaloupes originated. ""If they can't confirm that it's not Jensen Farms, then it's best to throw it out,"" Frieden said. Affected cantaloupes can still pose a danger if refrigerated, he said, because Listeria can grow even at low temperatures. Listeria also can take three weeks or longer to make a person sick, so more cases may emerge in the coming weeks, he said. Frieden said anyone who has eaten cantaloupe and now has flu-like symptoms, including fever, should see a doctor. Those who are older, pregnant, or have an underlying condition such as cancer should also consult their physician if they have eaten the fruit. Jensen Farms has now ended its cantaloupe harvest for the season, so no new contaminated melons will be entering the market, said Commissioner Margaret Hamburg of the Food and Drug Administration. The short two-week shelf-life of the fruit means any contaminated cantaloupes are being removed from store shelves anyway, Frieden said. ""Jensen Farms continues to stay committed to the highest levels of food safety and maintains many third-party safety audits, as we have for many years,"" said Ryan Jensen, a partner at Jensen Farms. ""We continually look for ways to enhance our protocol."" Frontera Produce, the supplier, issued a statement September 14 saying it was ""working with FDA and state health officials to determine where along the supply chain the Listeria contamination may have occurred."" The 1998 outbreak in tainted hotdogs sickened 101 people and left 21 dead, according to the CDC's Foodborne Outbreak Online Database. Listeriosis causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It is rarely a serious concern for healthy children and adults, according to the CDC, but it is particularly dangerous for older adults, people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women, in whom it can cause miscarriages, stillbirth and premature delivery, or bring on a life-threatening infection in a newborn. About 1,600 people become seriously ill because of the bacteria each year, the CDC reports, and about 260 die. Four families affected by the outbreak have filed lawsuits, said attorney Bill Marler, who is representing them. The suits include two in Colorado, one in Texas and one in Oklahoma. A fifth will be filed this week in Maryland, Marler said. The cases in Oklahoma and Maryland involve relatives of people who have died in the outbreak, Marler said. The other cases involve people who have been sickened. At least 10 other people have retained Marler's firm, he said. Jensen Farms and Frontera Produce are listed as the defendants in the lawsuits. An attorney for Jensen Farms and an official with Frontera Produce did not immediately return calls from CNN for comment Wednesday. Marler said the opportunity to ""put people under oath and have subpoena power"" allows information to come to light about how such an outbreak happens. The CDC's Frieden said that because of budget reductions in the past two years, 44,000 fewer people are working at state and local health agencies, which means it can take more time to identify an outbreak. Marler said he expects a court in Colorado to issue an order within days allowing his legal team to go onto the farm and the processing facility. ""My obligation is to try to figure out a way to compensate people who have gone through what these people have gone through,"" he said.","NEW: The CDC warns consumers to throw out suspect fruit and watch for illnesses .

"(CNN) -- The stock photo, posted on a Facebook fan page for the accused Colorado shooter, shows two young men in a movie theater turning around to tell the people behind them to be quiet. ""If you don't shut up,"" it says, ""we'll James Holmes your a--."" It's not new for Facebook pages to pop up in support of accused killers and other distasteful figures, but a few dozen Holmes fan pages -- including one with more than 800 followers that appeared the day Holmes is accused of opening fire on a theater in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people and wounding dozens -- are raising new questions about what constitutes free and appropriate speech in the digital age, especially on Facebook. The network, which has 900 million monthly active users, has long been regarded as a sort of brightly lit town square in an Internet that has some dark and seedy corners. People must sign up for Facebook under a real identity, so the trolling habits that anonymity seems to encourage tend to be less tolerated on Facebook than on sites such as 4chan or even YouTube. Still, Facebook can be fairly lenient about what it will let people say on its network. The company has decided not to take down the James Holmes fan pages, although employees are monitoring them closely for types of speech that would violate the social network's community guidelines, spokesman Fred Wolens said. The most popular page, ""while incredibly distasteful, doesn't violate our terms,"" he said. For that fan site to be taken down, it would have to post ""credible threats"" against specific people or post something that was intended to incite violence, Wolens said. Facebook declined to comment on whether particular messages or comments on that particular page had been removed because they met either of those two criteria. Facebook sometimes will remove comments, posts or photos without taking down an entire page. Wolens added that the Holmes fan pages are not representative of how Facebook users are responding. He pointed to several pages where Facebook users are rallying around the victims of the Colorado shooting by posting memorials, messages of support and by trying to raise money for a victim who was shot and now is in an intensive care unit. ""We are heartened that the vast majority of activity on Facebook surrounding this tragedy has been focused on helping the community cope and beginning the healing process in the wake of these events,"" the company said in an e-mailed statement. In the past, Facebook has been criticized both for leaving up certain Facebook pages and images and for taking down others. Last year, the site sparked outrage when it removed a support page for nursing mothers because it featured breastfeeding photos, but reinstated it two days later. It is now part of the site's guidelines to allow such images to be posted on the site. The social network in March 2011 took down a page calling for a Palestinian intifada after the Israeli government complained. It left up a Holocaust-denial page in 2009, saying that ""being offensive or objectionable"" does not mean a site can be removed. At the time, Dallas, Texas, attorney Brian Cuban urged the network to set tighter controls, saying: ""There is no First Amendment right to free speech in the private realm. This isn't a freedom-of-speech issue. Facebook is free to set the standard that they wish."" Facebook's ""Community Standards"" document, which is posted online, addresses violent and threatening speech in this way: ""Safety is Facebook's top priority. You may not credibly threaten to harm others, or organize acts of real-world violence. We remove content and may escalate to law enforcement when we perceive a genuine risk of physical harm, or a direct threat to public safety. We also prohibit promoting, planning or celebrating any of your actions if they have, or could, result in financial harm to others, including theft and vandalism."" The site also does not tolerate speech that promotes self-harm, hate speech, bullying or ""graphic content,"" nudity or pornography, according to that online policy. Other technology companies have become embroiled in similar debates about what is and isn't appropriate communication on online platforms. Apple is regarded as running one of the tightest ships, since it pre-approves apps that will be sold in its App Store. It also has been criticized, however, for rejecting apps that would compete with the company's own offerings or that it finds distasteful for one reason or another. In 2010, for example, the company initially rejected an app that featured the work of a Pulitzer Prize winning political cartoonist. The app later was approved by Apple, following pad press. Google+, that technology giant's social network, came under fire for initially requiring its users to sign in using their real names. Some groups protested the policy, saying that political dissidents in authoritarian regimes, for example, couldn't use the service without fear of violence. The company softened the policy in January, allowing nicknames. Twitter bans users from impersonating others, infringing on trademarks, using the service unlawfully and threatening violence, according to its standards document, called ""The Twitter Rules."" It bans using pornographic images ""in either your profile picture or user background,"" but does not seem to ban users from posting links to such material. Facebook is letting the Holmes fan page saga play out. Many users have commented that they find the page ""disgusting"" and ""sick minded."" ""You mock the death of these poor people? Seriously?"" one wrote. Others are calling for Facebook users to ignore the page in order to avoid giving it more power. ""He's just a troll with nothing better to do than to fish for negative attention on the internet. I actually feel sorry for him,"" one commenter wrote. The page's administrator, who has not revealed his or her identity on that fan page, doesn't seem bothered. ""Whatever you have to say to me, I don't care. Whenever you report me. This page isn't affected. (I've been reported over like a billion times and nothing has happened),"" the page's administrator writes, adding: ""Also, I don't believe in karma, and I don't believe in hell. Please keep this in mind when you post. Unless its something smart or funny, Please know; I'm just going to laugh at you and all you're doing is wasting your time."" While the page is whipping some people into a fury, Robert Thompson, a professor of pop culture at Syracuse University, cautioned against reading too much into a tiny piece of the Internet that has little value to the larger public discourse. ""Probably the amount of attention that we give to this stuff is totally disproportionate to how most people feel,"" he said by phone. ""But because anybody with the Internet has got an international distribution system at their fingertips, if you start something that is a pro-mass-murderer fan page, it's going to get the attention of people."" It's understandable that people would be outraged by the Facebook page, he said, especially since it mocks the victims of a mass murder that is not even a week old. But the page might be written in an ironic tone, he said, and it certainly isn't representative of mainstream views in America -- or anyone's view, other than its creator. ""The mistake is made when people say what does this page mean about America?"" he said, ""This page doesn't say thing about America, besides maybe that there are too many Facebook pages.""","Facebook pages backing the suspect in Colorado theater killings have popped up .

"Washington (CNN) -- Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to repeal the federal law that defines marriage as between one man and one woman. The vote that sends the proposal to the full Senate floor was considered symbolic because the measure has no chance of getting passed by the Republican-led House. All eight Republicans on the Judiciary Committee voted ""no"" Thursday, while all the 10 majority Democrats supported the measure that would provide equal federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. Democrats and gay rights advocates hailed the vote as historic in the continuing effort to legalize same-sex marriage and end separate treatment for legally married same-sex couples. Committee Chairman Pat Leahy, D-Vermont, called it ""an historic step forward in righting an injustice that goes right to the core of what we stand for in this country -- freedom and equality."" Senate passes jobs bill for veterans . However, social conservatives said the repeal measure disrespected the beliefs and wishes of mainstream America. ""Marriage is not some prize that liberals can award to a small, vocal and already well-off special interest group,"" said a statement by Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. ""Marriage between one man and one woman was created prior to the formation of any governments and is given benefits by governments because it uniquely contributes to a productive society."" Under the Defense of Marriage Act, passed in 1996, only legally married couples as defined by the law are entitled to more than 1,000 federal marriage benefits such as continued Social Security payments to spouses after death. Repealing the measure means that same-sex couples wed in the six states and the District of Columbia, which have legalized gay and lesbian marriages, would be eligible for full federal benefits afforded other couples, regardless of where they live, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who sponsored the proposal. Reid belittles 'phony' GOP tax concessions . Feinstein and other Democrats said the repeal would not require states to legalize same-sex marriage or otherwise impede on a state's rights on the matter. Republicans said the repeal would alter the institution of marriage between a man and woman, and also would increase the cost burden on the federal government by expanding the number of eligible beneficiaries. ""No one has paid into Social Security expecting benefits to be paid to same-sex partners,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Leahy responded that people who have paid into Social Security like anyone else should be able to receive benefits, whether or not they have legally married someone of the same sex. He and other Democrats said the issue was about equal treatment under the law. However, Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah complained of a broader impact, saying ""it is no secret that advocates want to use the courts to force states to legalize and recognize same-sex marriage."" To Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota, the repeal would be one step in the right direction. ""When we do pass it, straight people aren't suddenly going to become gay,"" he said, adding: ""We'll do just fine, really.""","The 10-8 vote is on strict party lines, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A one-day strike by India's unions closed businesses and slowed public transit Tuesday as workers protested rising prices and what they say are the government's anti-labor policies. Several markets were shuttered in West Bangal, a formerly communist-ruled state seen as a hotbed of union activity, residents said. ""Traffic is also very light,"" said Sikha Sengupta, a retired executive in Kolkata, West Bengal's capital. However, state police reported that government offices were functioning as usual. In the southern province of Kerala, the strike hit government-run transport services hard, authorities said. Most marketplaces in the state were also closed, Kerala police spokesman S. Sudhir said. Government offices were open, he added. Nationally, there was little impact on private services and there was no major disruption in rail services across the sprawling nation. Eleven trade unions called the one-day work stoppage, including a group affiliated with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's ruling Congress party. Singh's government faced massive street protests last year over its handling of corruption as a raft of scandals rocked his administration, now in its second term. Protesters are demanding social security coverage for workers in India's massive informal labor sector, as well as an end to contract-based jobs. The unions also have warned the government against selling its stakes in state-run companies. ""We demand the government come out with proposals in relation to our demands,"" said G. Sanjeeva Reddy, president of the Indian National Trade Union Congress that is linked to Singh's party. The strike appeared to have little impact in bustling New Delhi. The city's ubiquitous taxis and auto rickshaws largely stayed off the roads, but other vehicles still packed the streets. While markets in the city remained open, at least one branch of the State Bank of India in New Delhi was hit hard by the strike, with senior executives picking up the slack. Services appeared normal at private banks.","Strikers demand job security, anti-inflation measures .

"(CNN) -- One week after leaving, my mom's words still echo in my ears: ""Leave Gaza now, please. Don't think about us. I have many things to worry about."" I entered Gaza on November 5 to help an American delegation there until the morning of November 11. My intention was to help the delegation and then have two full days with my family after the delegates left. But with tensions ratcheting up, my family in Gaza was fearful the Rafah crossing with Egypt would be closed and I would be stuck. To leave my extended family in such dangerous circumstances and return to my husband and three children in Canada was heartrending. But now it is worse. To see American-made Israeli fighter jets pounding Gaza just days after my departure is agony. I lost the argument for an extra two days with my family the moment I said I ""planned"" to spend those extra days with them. My sister-in-law, Wafa, pounced on the words: ""Nothing can be planned here. Gaza is not Canada. Everything is in the Israeli military's hands."" She was right. The Israeli government can undo plans and dreams in an instant. Looking into my mom's eyes, I felt cowardly to desert them. I hugged her and told her to stay safe. But deep in my heart I knew that there is no safety in Gaza. That was evident on Sunday when the Israeli military bombed the Dalou household and instantly decimated three generations of the family. Read related: Gaza's victims too young to understand, but not to die . The terrifying power of the Israeli military was already made clear at the beginning of the latest onslaught with the haunting photograph of a young BBC journalist grieving his dead infant. Israel claims to operate with pinpoint accuracy, but consistently kills a high proportion of civilians. In fact, the American delegation spoke to the grief-stricken father and mother of Ahmed Abu Daqqa, a young boy killed on November 8 while playing soccer outside his home. These Americans are important witnesses against the claim that Palestinians bear full culpability for this escalation. In fact, it was our children being killed, not the Israelis children. As I joined the American delegation for the long trip back to Cairo, I was riven with emotion. Usually, the American delegates would greet me with cheers, claps and smiles. This time there was silence, grim faces, tears and no words. Everyone was waiting to hear from me. ""I have been ordered to leave,"" I said, ""and I am frustrated and angry."" I burst into tears. Will I see my family again? I don't know. War is unpredictable as Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Ehud Barak seem to have forgotten from their safe vantage points. What is unleashed today in the new Middle East is not the same as the wars Israel unleashed in the years since 1948. The Arab Spring means that the governments and people of the region are in much greater accord. The weak governments that looked the other way as Israel and the United States subjugated Palestinians have been replaced by governments that may yet assert Palestinian rights in ways that are not merely symbolic. West Bank Palestinians are now starting to confront the Israeli military in ways that the weak Palestinian Authority cannot stop as readily as it did four years ago during Operation Cast Lead. Read related: Rockets pound Israel, Gaza as Netanyahu alleges 'double war crime' As the situation deteriorates, it is vital to note that this war need not have occurred. A fragile truce had taken hold for 48 hours, notwithstanding Palestinian frustration over two separate incidents in the previous week when Palestinian youth were killed playing soccer. In the opinion of many Palestinians, Netanyahu planned this aggression. He wanted to be seen by the electorate as the man with the iron fist protecting Israelis in the south of Israel. Palestinians were in his way. Self-inflated analysts talk of ""mowing the grass"" to rein in Hamas and other groups. But that mowing is terrifying civilians and destroying their neighborhoods. What do they think will become of the traumatized children who endure such brutal attacks from the sky and sea? They will be no friends of Israel. No, Israel is proving once again that it has no interest in becoming part of the region. But Israel's actions have been largely the same for 64 years. The one period of brief hope in the 1990s proved fleeting because Israel failed to stop its illegal settlement activity and made clear to Palestinians its intent was not a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem but a series of disconnected cantons. Barak has pledged continued military action against Gaza and Netanyahu has stated he hopes Hamas and others ""got the message."" There is no doubt that his message of widespread death and destruction has been widely received by all Palestinians. I doubt, however, that the message will have the intended effect. Instead, the fury of having one's neighborhood battered by F-16s and shells will likely unite Palestinians against an outside power that has besieged Gaza since 2007 and controlled it since 1967. The inhumane blockade -- with approximately 80% of Palestinians reduced to receiving food aid as Israel counts our calories to allow for anemia and stunting but not outright starvation -- leads me to conclude that bleak days remain our lot. Yet there is one factor Netanyahu fails to grasp: The spirit and will of Palestinians -- from Rafah to Hebron to Jenin and the Palestinian refugee camps scattered throughout the Middle East -- to achieve our freedom and rights. We will not relinquish our legitimate rights any more than African Americans or black South Africans in the 1950s. We will be bombed and bullied by Israel and the U.S. Congress, but in the end we will still demand our rights. As long as my family walks the planet, we retain the right to one day walk back to our village of Beit Daras, a scant few miles from Gaza, and to live there with rights equal to our new neighbors. My grandmother, who is enduring this terrible onslaught, has an inalienable right, property deed in hand, to return to the village of her childhood -- as do her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.","Ghada Ageel's family begged her to leave Gaza as tensions escalated .

"London (CNN) -- Over two-thirds of Britons believe the ÃÂ£9 billion ($13.8 billion) bill for the London Olympics was worth it, but economists and business leaders argue it could take years to see the economic benefits. According to a poll by research consultancy ComRes, released on the first anniversary of the Games, 69% of participants said it was a good investment of public money. But only 22% of the public feel the Games have had a positive impact on the local economy in their area, with 67% saying the Olympics had no impact at all. Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said there was an obvious boost to UK economic growth during the Games but it was too early to see a legacy benefit. He told CNN: ""I think there are question marks over whether the ÃÂ£10 billion of public money spent on the games could have been better used... for example infrastructure projects such as transport, that could have yielded a higher economic return."" In the second-quarter of 2013, the U.K. grew by 0.6% -- double the rate of expansion for the first three months of the year -- suggesting Europe's third-largest economy is on track for a recovery. Tombs said the figures also showed growth in all areas of the economy, which he noted was was a first in recent years. The UK contracted for five consecutive quarters from the second quarter of 2008, and failed to grow for another nine months in late 2011 and early 2012 as the eurozone debt crisis raged. Although the cultural heritage of the Olympics is important, it could take years before we see its true economic value, according to Tombs. He said: ""You often fail to see a boost in tourism for the years after the Games and obviously it's very hard to reuse the facilities that have been built."" Director of Economics at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Mark Ambler, said the benefits may not be evident for at least another 10 years. He told CNN: ""On this basis, the evidence I have been involved in generating and that I have seen from others suggests strongly that the UK will get a good return on its investment, although I think important parts of it are still to come."" Investment boost . On Thursday, Mayor of London Boris Johnson said that the success of the Olympics and Paralympics has spurred investment in the U.K capital. Speaking at a press conference, he said: ""Remember the fate of the Olympo-sceptics is all I would say to anyone tempted to doubt the legacy."" But according to Matthew Jaffa, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, not enough is being done in the wake of the Olympics to promote ""Brand London"" as an exporter. He added: ""The Games have had more of an impact on London than the rest of the UK. 55% of the companies that won contracts, directly related to the Olympics, saw growth within the turnover of their business, which is positive."" Despite skepticism from some quarters of the business community, the ComRes poll -- which surveyed over 3,200 people -- also showed that nearly three-quarters of Britons would welcome the Olympic Games back given the opportunity. Andrew Simms, political economist and and co-author of the book 'London 2012 - How Was it For Us?' said the Games were ""a triumph of public endeavour... it's a very good example of what a very dynamic and focused public sector can do.""","ComRes poll: 22% of the public feel the Games have had a positive impact on the local economy .

"(CNN) -- The fire that severely damaged a drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico subsided Thursday as sand and mud stopped up a natural gas well that blew out earlier this week, federal regulators said. The blaze erupted Tuesday aboard the rig, located about about 60 miles off Grand Isle, Louisiana, in 154 feet of water. What remained Thursday was a small flame ""fueled by residual gas at the top of the well,"" the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement reported. The accident happened when workers aboard the Hercules 265 hit an unexpected pocket of gas while preparing the well for production. Forty-four workers were evacuated from the rig without injury, officials said. While the rig remained standing, parts of the structure above water had collapsed as a result of the intense heat, officials said. The BSEE said Wednesday that the only contamination so far had been a light sheen on the ocean that appeared to dissipate quickly. No oil was being released, the BSEE said. The rig's owner, Hercules Offshore, said Wednesday that it had brought in an environmental expert to keep an eye on wind and ocean conditions to track any possible contamination. It was not immediately clear what steps would now be taken to secure the well. Hercules Offshore had said Wednesday it was preparing to bring in another of its drilling rigs to prepare a relief well, if necessary. Tuesday's blowout was the second this month in the Gulf, where the worst oil spill in U.S. history occurred in 2010. Workers on a production platform lost control of an aging gas well while trying to plug it on July 8, resulting in a leak of about 250 gallons of liquid natural gas. There were no injuries. Most of the work being done in the shallow water off Louisiana now involves attempts to draw the remaining gas out of old wells or to shut down ones that are no longer profitable, said Eric Smith, associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute in New Orleans. In this case, the rig was set up next to an existing gas platform, drilling a ""sidetrack"" well to reach the remaining gas after an existing well became blocked, Smith said. In the aftermath of the blowout, the well operator is likely to close it off and abandon the site, he said. ""The platform is probably a write-off. The rig is definitely a write-off,"" Smith said. ""You're probably talking somewhere on the order of $50 million for the rig and $20 million for the platform and existing wells."" Unlike the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010, which released millions of barrels of crude oil and gas at high pressures, this week's accident ""is a much smaller blip on the horizon,"" he said. But the recent incidents are a reminder that offshore work is ""inherently risky"" and that blowouts ""aren't that infrequent,"" said Michael Bromwich, the former chief of the BSEE and its predecessor agency, the Bureau of Ocean Energy, Management Regulation and Enforcement. ""They generally don't lead to the kind of catastrophic consequences that we saw in Deepwater Horizon, but they are unfortunate events that happen,"" Bromwich said Thursday. ""And the fact that we've had two in the last month simply underscores that fact."" The drill rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank in April 2010, killing 11 men aboard. The well it was drilling was nearly a mile below the surface of the Gulf, and it took nearly three months to cap. BSEE oversees about 3,400 wells in the Gulf of Mexico. The agency investigated more than 70 accidents aboard rigs and platforms in the Gulf in 2012, including a November explosion that killed two workers about 20 miles southeast of Grand Isle. Rules were tightened after Deepwater Horizon, but Bromwich -- who led reforms of the Interior Department's offshore oversight agencies in that period -- said both industry and government need to remain vigilant about the safety of workers offshore. ""These all should be learning exercises,"" he said. ""What went wrong here? Where they errors in human judgment? What remedial or corrective actions should be taken by the company, and what can the industry and what can the regulators learn?"" CNN's Dave Alsup and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","NEW: Platform and drill are ""probably a write-off,"" analyst says .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, are expecting their first child after 19 months of marriage, the palace announced Monday. The royal revelation, which followed months of tabloid speculation, came as Catherine was admitted to a central London hospital with acute morning sickness Monday afternoon. She is expected to be in King Edward VII Hospital for several days, the palace said. Acute morning sickness: What is it? The palace said her illness is hyperemesis gravidarum, which involves nausea and vomiting more severe than typical morning sickness. Prince William spent much of Monday with his wife at the hospital, the palace said, but he was seen leaving Monday evening. Read more: Who can inherit the British throne? ""As the pregnancy is in its very early stages, Her Royal Highness is expected to stay in hospital for several days and will require a period of rest thereafter,"" the statement said. Catherine, 30, is not yet 12 weeks pregnant, Clarence House told CNN, so the palace is not announcing a due date for the child. William and Catherine's child will be next in line to the British throne after William, regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl, the British Cabinet Office said Monday. Planned changes to the law of succession that end the tradition of a boy jumping over an elder sister are already de facto in effect, the Cabinet Office said. William and Catherine were married at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011, in London's biggest royal wedding in three decades. The baby would be the first grandchild for the heir to the British throne, Prince Charles, and the late Diana, Princess of Wales. The news immediately became a top trending topic worldwide on Twitter. Former PM: William and Kate reinvigorated monarchy . British Prime Minister David Cameron was quick to tweet his joy: ""I'm delighted by the news that the Duke & Duchess of Cambridge are expecting a baby. They will make wonderful parents."" British Labour Party leader Ed Miliband tweeted: ""Fantastic news for Kate, William and the country. A royal baby is something the whole nation will celebrate."" Catherine is an art history graduate and the eldest child of Michael and Carole Middleton, self-made millionaires who run a party-supplies company. In photos: Duchess of Cambridge at 30 . Tabloid speculation about a pregnancy increased in September when Catherine substituted water for wine during a state dinner toast in Singapore. The buzz reached a boil two weeks ago when Australia's New Idea magazine quoted close friend Jessica Hay saying her former schoolmate, Catherine, would soon announce ""wonderful, happy news."" Life & Style magazine in the United States published its own ""exclusive"" with the same Hay quotes of a December announcement, which she said she had on ""the highest authority."" A family history website did the math last summer and predicted Catherine would be with child by November, according to a Time.com report. Genesreunited.co.uk calculated that ""the average period between a royal wedding taking place and the couple's child being born is 851 days."" Based on that, it predicted a pregnancy in November and a birth on August 27, 2013.

"(CNN) -- It's a truth of the digital age. When a person is plucked from obscurity, for good reasons or bad, the first thing curiosity-seekers do is turn to the Web. Facebook or Twitter. LinkedIn or Tumblr. We expect social media to shed light on a person's personality, especially when, as in the case of Colorado shooting suspect James Holmes, we're trying to explain the unexplainable. As it turns out, 24-year-old Holmes, who stands accused of killing 12 people and wounding dozens more during a shooting spree at a movie theater Friday, appears to have left virtually no digital footprint. Media and law enforcement investigating the shootings have found no traces of him online, aside from a possible account on Adult Friend Finder, a romantic meet-up site, according to police. Former colleague shocked that Holmes is theater shooting suspect . It's impossible, of course, to draw broad conclusions about his mindset based on the fact that he didn't share online. But Holmes' lack of an online presence has emerged as a piece of the puzzle for people looking for answers. ""We could ask the same questions about the lack of Web presence that we could for anyone who isolates themselves. Was he socially isolated in all senses?"" asked Dr. Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center. ""We know that social isolation can amplify the negative consequences of stress and increase the risk of developing psychopathology. Some research has shown that social isolation actually delays the positive effects of activities found to be emotionally beneficial, such as exercise. ... What we don't know is what caused Holmes to have such a break with reality."" Whatever his reasons, the lack of an online presence puts Holmes squarely in the minority among his peers. About 81% of 18- to 29-year-olds in the United States use social media at least occasionally, said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. And surveys show that college students like Holmes, who was a graduate neurosciences student at the University of Colorado, are even more likely to use the sites. But Rainie says it would be a mistake to draw a direct line between his decision to eschew social networking and a mindset that led to the alleged violence. ""It's not the norm for someone of this age to have such a limited presence, in any form: no blogs, no profile on a photo-sharing site and things like that,"" Rainie said. ""But it's also a mistake to think the everyone in this age cohort is living every minute of their lives with social media. That's not the case."" Massacre suspect spooked gun range manager . The survey didn't ask respondents for specific reasons that they choose not to engage online. But Rainie said Pew has heard numerous reasons, from concerns about wasting time to privacy concerns to simply preferring face-to-face interaction. In a Pew survey from November, two-thirds of respondents (67%) said that staying in touch with current friends is a major reason they use social media, and half gave similar importance to connecting with old friends. Only 3% said that finding a romantic partner was a major reason for their of digital networking tools. ""It's certainly an interesting element of his life that (Holmes) had such a limited digital presence,"" Rainie said. ""But it's not necessarily the case that this means anything about the quality of his social world."" Dr. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a professor of business psychology at University College of London, has studied the impact of Internet use on mental health. He too says it's impossible to nail down its significance at this point but listed a set of possibilities, from a sense of isolation to distaste for Facebook as an emblem of ""the status quo"" to something perhaps even more sinister. ""He (possibly) did not want to have any reputation other than for what he was planning to do, like someone who saves himself for the big stage or a single lead role,"" Chamorro-Premuzic said. Similar attacks in the recent past have, in some cases, painted a different picture. Jared Lee Loughner, charged in the January 2011 shootings in Tucson, Arizona, that killed six people and wounded congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, was active on MySpace and YouTube, among other online networks. Anders Behring Breivik was 32 when he killed 69 people, mostly teenagers, at summer camp in Norway in July 2011. Breivik was a prolific blogger who was active on Facebook, Twitter and other sites. He posted a video to YouTube only hours before his shooting rampage. By contrast, reporters looking into the mindset of Seung-Hui Cho, the 23-year-old student who killed 32 people and wounded 25 others in an April 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, found almost no traces of him online. Shooting survivors recount Colorado movie theater horror . The lack of a digital footprint for Holmes has created some unpleasantness for an unexpected group: people who share his relatively common name, live in the area of the shooting and do have a Web presence. ""It amazes me how insensitive, heartless and just plain old IGNORANT some people are in this world,"" a different James Holmes, this one a fitness instructor who, like the suspect, lives in Aurora, wrote on his Facebook page. ""In the last 24 hours I have received hate mail, racist remarks, and sexual advances. I have over 400 friend requests in which a quarter of those are ppl mocking the real killer to gain attention and this was all AFTER the identity of the real killer was revealed ..."" James P. Holmes, who lives in the Denver area, left a similar note on Facebook, albeit in a more wry tone. ""I am not a 24-year-old gun-slinging killer from Aurora, I am a 22-year-old book-slinging mass eater from Littleton ... ,"" he wrote. ""James Holmes happens to be a pretty common name, surprisingly, so try not to jump the gun. Regards, A different guy named James Holmes."" With few, if any, conclusions to draw, Rutledge said the most interesting observation about society as a whole may be how surprised we are that the suspect did not use social media. ""It's a testimony to how normal participating in the social media world is when we look at the lack of presence as an anomaly,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Italian authorities on Friday arrested eight people in possession of an estimated $6 trillion in counterfeit U.S. Treasury bonds, according to Italian paramilitary police and an Italian news agency. The discovery of the fake bonds -- made to look as if they were printed by the U.S. Federal Reserve in 1934 -- came about as part of an investigation into a local mafia association. The arrest order for the alleged criminals was issued by a preliminary investigative judge in the southern Italian city of Potenza, police noted. Italian authorities, working with their Swiss counterparts, learned about the counterfeit bonds by way of eavesdropping on wiretapped phones, police said.

"(CNN) -- A New York man who investigators say was infatuated with convicted killer Jodi Arias threatened to kill HLN anchors Nancy Grace and Jane Velez-Mitchell, authorities said Wednesday. The names of the anchors who appear on CNN's sister network were released by the Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff's department after the arrest of David Lee Simpson, 48. Simpson was arrested in Bath, New York, after his indictment last week by a grand jury in Phoenix on charges of stalking and computer tampering. After he was indicted, ""Simpson quit his job, and was driving out of Bath heading south when he was stopped by law enforcement,"" according to a statement released by the sheriff's office. A search of Simpson's car turned up several guns, shotgun ammunition, handcuffs, zip-ties, binoculars, a knife and a police radio, the statement said. Simpson has waived extradition and will be taken to the Maricopa County Jail in Arizona this week, the statement said. It was not immediately clear whether Simpson had retained representation. CNN, a division of Turner Broadcasting System, is not commenting on the case. Velez-Mitchell and Grace were allegedly targeted because of their coverage of the Arias trial. Arias was convicted in May of first-degree murder for killing her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander. A jury deadlocked on whether she should be sentenced to death. Simpson purportedly made threats on Twitter before and after the trial. He threatened to tie the anchorwomen to a ""tree naked and leave them to suffer all night"" and then ""slit their throats,"" according to the sheriff's office statement. He also is accused of threatening a Phoenix woman who defended the anchorwomen on Twitter.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- A single man stood silently in Istanbul's Taksim Square for hours Monday night, defying police who broke up weekend anti-government protests with tear gas and water cannon and drawing hundreds of others to his vigil. For more than five hours, he appeared to stare at a portrait of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish state. Police eventually moved in to arrest many of those who joined him, but whether Erdem Gunduz -- a performance artist quickly dubbed the ""standing man"" -- was in custody was unclear early Tuesday. Turkey has been wracked by more than two weeks of protests against the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But many of those who joined Gunduz late Monday said they were standing only for peace, not taking sides. Monday's hushed tableau came two days after police swept into Taksim Square and neighboring Gezi Park to clear out anti-Erdogan protesters. The demonstrators tried to return to the park on Sunday, only to be driven back by police. Trade unions put fresh pressure on Erdogan earlier Monday, mounting a nationwide strike. But a crowd that marched on Taksim Square dispersed when faced with riot squads backed by water cannon. The protests started at the end of May over authorities' plans to turn Gezi Park, central Istanbul's last green space, into a mall. They quickly turned into large anti-government demonstrations that included calls for political reforms. 'There is a level of desperation' While the protests are unlikely to threaten the rule of Erdogan, who has been one of Turkey's most popular leaders and is credited with overseeing a decade of economic growth, they are raising questions about what critics say is an increasingly authoritarian style of governing. iReport: Wedding in the midst of teargas . Some groups of demonstrators have shifted to protesting in their local neighborhoods in the city, putting up barricades. Meanwhile, the atmosphere in confrontations between police and protesters is turning uglier. ""Now it feels like there is a level of desperation,"" said Clare Murray, who was vacationing in Istanbul from New York for the past week. ""The police seem more comfortable with using aggression."" Since Saturday night, 116 people have been detained during protests in Ankara and 242 people have been detained in Istanbul demonstrations, said Huseyin Aslan, general secretary of the Progressive Lawyers Association. Erdogan remains defiant, accusing outsiders of taking advantage of the protests over the park. On Sunday, thousands of his supporters gathered at a rally a few miles from Taksim Square, waving flags and singing songs at a rally that was widely viewed as a re-election rally for the prime minister. Erdogan sought to contrast his supporters with the protesters. ""Hundreds of thousands in here are not like the vandals with petrol-bombs in their hands,"" he said. One-day strike . After the weekend tumult, the trade unions added their clout to the demonstrations with their one-day strike. The unions involved have hundreds of thousands of members across sectors that include public services and utilities such as electricity and water supply. They don't, however, have enough members to shut those industries down altogether. Under the Erdogan government, Turkish workers have been ""domesticated like animals by being kept hungry,"" one worker at a union office in Istanbul said. ""Gezi Park made us realize we are not animals in a herd; we are individuals,"" said the worker, who didn't provide his name. The previous strike during the anti-government demonstrations took place near the start of this month. Erdogan complained Saturday that demonstrators were not meeting him halfway. ""We have reached out with our hands,"" he said. ""However, some people returned their fists in response. Can you shake hands with those who reach out with a fist?"" He also ridiculed the protesters' assertions that they are environmentalists, calling them ""thugs"" and citing their honking of horns as evidence of ""noise pollution."" And he accused demonstrators of inciting sectarian violence by attacking a woman in a headscarf, kicking her, dragging her on the ground and snatching her head cover. Erdogan praised his government's performance over the past 10 years, citing a rising standard of living, a quintupling of the central bank's reserves and plans to build an airport. Root of protests . The unrest began in Istanbul roughly three weeks ago, when a small group of people turned out to protest government plans to bulldoze Gezi Park and replace it with a shopping mall housed inside a replica of 19th century Ottoman barracks. Protesters said the plans represented a creeping infringement on their rights in a secular society. Turkey was founded after secularists defeated Islamic Ottoman forces in the early 20th century, and many modern-day secularists frown on Ottoman symbols. The protests broadened into an outpouring in the square and throughout the country as security forces cracked down on demonstrators. The unrest also brought political risks for Erdogan, a populist and democratically elected politician serving his third term in office. Journalist Karl Penhaul and CNN's Gul Tuysuz reported from Istanbul, and journalist Ian Lee reported from Ankara. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Arwa Damon and Joe Duran in Istanbul and Antonia Mortensen in Ankara contributed to this report.","NEW: 'Standing man' inspires new protests in Taksim Square .

"(CNN) -- When Yuki Izumoto developed ugly white patches on her neck, hands and face nearly a year ago, her dermatologist had no answers for her. The 44-year-old Japanese housewife was embarrassed to show people her dotted hands, and the spots weren't going away. Her doctor told her ""it was a kind of disease, but the cause is unknown,"" she says. Now it seems likely that she and thousands of others may have developed white blotches on their skin as a result of a popular whitening product from Japanese cosmetics brand Kanebo. Izumoto says she used the product for several years. Reports of such symptoms from thousands of customers have led Kanebo to initiate a voluntary recall of all of its products that contain the ""quasi-drug ingredient"" known as Rhododenol. In a statement, Kanebo said 6808 customers had complained of vitiligo -- the appearance of irregular white blotches, or inconsistent de-pigmentation of the skin -- as of July 19. Kanebo advises customers to stop using the skin products in question immediately and to contact a dermatologist. The company has set up a task force with ""the mission of taking full responsibility for the care of all customers who experience vitiligo-like symptoms following the use of the affected products, through to the stage of full recovery."" Skin whitening is a near obsession for some women in many Asia countries, with both local and Western brands selling a variety of products designed to evenly lighten skin tone. Kanebo has sold nearly five million products containing the recalled ingredient across 11 Asian countries, including Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea. There have been very limited sales in the United Kingdom. The company plans to visit all customers who have complained of skin blotches. Meanwhile, Izumoto says she has yet to receive a visit and is angry at the company for not being in touch sooner. ""I used the products to become beautiful, but I was tainted by it,"" she says. She believes her skin may never return to normal. Saori Ibuki contributed to this report.","Yuki Izumoto developed white patches on her neck, hands and face .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to move forward swiftly with his plans to revive Japan's staggering economy after weekend elections gave his Liberal Democratic Party control of the upper house of parliament. The conservative LDP and its coalition partner together won 76 of the 121 seats in the House of Councillors, giving them a total of 133 votes in the 242-member chamber. Afterward, Abe said he wanted to press ahead with his plans -- including his economic programs -- ""with speed."" ""I would like to meet the expectation of the Japanese people,"" Abe said after Sunday's vote. ""Since the inauguration of my administration, we have been appealing that our policies are the only way to go. We believe that the Japanese people pushed us to make policy decisions and bring about the result."" The LDP controls the lower house of the Diet, Japan's parliament. But until Sunday, the House of Councillors was led by opposition parties that had made it difficult for Abe to get his program through the chamber. Abe took office in December, becoming Japan's seventh prime minister in six years and taking a second turn at the job. He immediately launched a program nicknamed ""Abenomics,"" a combination of coordinated government spending, structural reforms and central bank stimulus. The plan was to boost prices and end 15 years of deflation, leading to more robust growth for the world's third-largest economy. And Japan's economy surged in the first quarter of 2013, growing a faster-than-expected 3.5% -- but a stock-market skid in June raised questions about whether policymakers can pull off the high-wire act in the heavily indebted country.

"(CNN) -- A most awkward and revealing situation has emerged in the heart of Europe, forcing European governments to choose between their principles and their fears, and drawing an uncomfortable gap between Europe's words and its actions. Last July, a bus carrying tourists about to start their vacation suddenly exploded outside the airport in the Bulgarian city of Burgas. The bombing killed five Israelis -- including a pregnant woman -- and a Bulgarian driver. This week, Bulgaria's foreign minister blamed  Hezbollah, saying an investigation showed the attack was carried out by two members of the Iran-linked Lebanese organization. Hezbollah denied the accusation. But Bulgaria says it discovered strong links, with ""data showing the financing and connection between Hezbollah and the two suspects."" The news shines a light on a most surprising fact: Hezbollah has been conducting business rather comfortably in much of Europe over the years, openly raising money for its operations. Those operations, according to countless investigations in a growing number of countries, include plotting and attempting to kill tourists, diplomats and others. Washington, which labeled Hezbollah a terrorist organization in 1995 after a series of attacks in Lebanon and elsewhere that killed hundreds of Americans, has been pressuring the European Union to do the same. But the EU has resisted. The ""terrorist"" designation is more than a symbolic label. The label would allow European authorities to freeze funds, control the travel of Hezbollah operatives, and otherwise do what it can to prevent more loss of life. The new secretary of state, John Kerry, urged the EU to ""send an unequivocal message to this terrorist group"" now that Hezbollah has been linked to an attack on European soil. American officials have told Europe that their inaction is ""making it harder to defend our countries."" U.S. officials accuse Iran and Hezbollah not only of conducting attacks against civilians around the world, but also of actively supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's brutal repression at home in a conflict that has already left more than 60,000 dead. Opinion: Why Obama is going to Israel . According to a new report from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, authorities in various countries have uncovered and disrupted nearly 30 different terror plots by Hezbollah or Iran's Quds Force, an arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, in the last couple of years. But Europe, incredibly, continues to waver. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton reacted to the news from Bulgaria with a clammy statement that there is a ""need for reflection."" Hezbollah operates in Lebanon as a powerful Shiite political party, social services organization and an intimidating, heavily-armed militia. It has strong support among the country's Shiite population and bitter opposition from Sunnis. EU officials say they fear destabilizing Lebanon, a country perennial teetering on the edge of sectarian violence. They also worry about angering Hezbollah, fearing attacks on European peacekeepers in Lebanon or terrorist attacks on European soil. Judging by recent events, that particular outcome was not prevented by their timid approach. France, in particular, has resisted upsetting Hezbollah. Paris has taken the lead in fighting extremism in Africa, sending troops against militants in Mali and declaring that it is committed to ""a relentless struggle against terrorist groups."" But it is somewhat less relentless when it comes to Hezbollah. The French take a special interest in protecting their influence in Lebanon, a former colonial holding. A firm Western stance against the group, however, could strengthen Lebanon's struggling pro-Western opposition, which blames Hezbollah for the assassination of many of its members, including former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. A U.N. tribunal set up to investigate Hariri's 2005 assassination indicted four Hezbollah members. The pattern is well established. Argentinean prosecutors accused Hezbollah of carrying out and Iran of planning and financing the worst terrorist attack in that country, the 1994 bombing of a Jewish Community Center, which killed 85 and injured 300. Western experts generally agree with the assessment of the former U.S. homeland security secretary, who describes Hezbollah as ""the most potent terrorist organization in the world."" The government of the Netherlands already declared it a terrorist group and Britain named its militant wing a terrorist entity, as if it were separate from the rest of the organization. It is funded by Iran and closely coordinates its moves with Tehran. Over the years, it has been accused of carrying out attacks throughout the world, often in collaboration with Iran. In recent months, as tensions have risen between Iran, on one side, and Israel and the West on the other, Tehran and its Lebanese ally have stepped up their activities to a feverish pace, targeting Israelis diplomats and tourists in India, Cyprus, Thailand and elsewhere. Hezbollah and Iran were linked to a plot to kill the Saudi Ambassador in Washington. Hezbollah's protective ally, Iran, is enduring harsh economic sanctions from the West over its controversial nuclear program, and a number of Iranian nuclear scientists have been assassinated, as have a few key figures in the Hezbollah hierarchy. The circumstances of these assassinations have all been murky, but there is nothing vague about the bombing of buses full of tourists. By any definition of the word it qualifies as terrorism. And clearly, the question is not just symbolic. Europe is letting Hezbollah operate on its soil. By some counts, there are 950 Hezbollah-affiliated individuals in Germany alone. Europe wants to treat Hezbollah as a legitimate political organization, but the group's actions place it squarely outside the realm of legitimacy. As long as Europe closes its eyes to this reality and allows the group to organize, fundraise and hold meetings, it is guilty not only of hypocrisy, but also of passive complicity in Hezbollah's attacks on innocent civilians. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis .","Frida Ghitis: Bulgaria blamed Hezbollah in bus attack, yet EU still won't call group terrorists .

"(CNN) -- Last week, the College Board dealt parents, teachers and the education world a serious blow. According to its latest test results, ""SAT reading scores for the high school class of 2011 were the lowest on record, and combined reading and math scores fell to their lowest point since 1995."" The reading scores, which stand at 497, are noticeably lower than just six years ago, when they stood at 508. And it's just the second time in the last 20 years that reading scores have dropped so precipitously in a single year. Yet, according to the College Board, there is no reason to panic. The results, they say, ""reflect the record size and diversity of the pool of test-takers. As more students aim for college and take the exam, it tends to drag down average scores."" Since when has diversity and more students taking the test become a legitimate excuse for bad scores? A conservative certainly could not get away with blaming falling test scores on diversity. Imagine the outcry. Increased diversity and student participation are very good things, but we should not console ourselves with excuses for falling scores, especially considering the amount of money we spend each year on education. The 2011 budget for the Department of Education is estimated to top $70 billion, while overall spending on public elementary and secondary education is about $600 billion a year. By comparison, in 1972, before the Department of Education even existed, SAT critical reading scores for college-bound seniors were above 525, more than 20 points higher than they are today, while today's math scores are only slightly better than in 1972. As the United States increases education spending, our students' scores should not be getting worse. For a long time, I, along with other conservative reformers, have been saying that real reform means more than throwing money at the problem. Now, an unexpected voice from across the political spectrum is agreeing. Steven Brill, founder of Court TV and The American Lawyer magazine, and author of the new book ""Class Warfare: Inside the Fight to Fix America's Schools,"" has turned the journalistic magnifying glass on the nation's public schools and teachers' unions. Brill's book is one of the most in-depth and closely researched looks into the modern workings of the education ""blob"" in recent memory. And Brill is a liberal, a very thoughtful and careful liberal, and he is criticizing the heart of liberal power: the teachers' unions. Brill closely traces the modern education reform movement from Race to the Top, to KIPP Academies, to Teach for America, to such high-profile reformers as Michelle Rhee and Joel Klein, while lamenting obvious long-standing barriers to educational improvement such as the ""last in, first out"" policy that requires teachers to be laid off based purely on seniority rather than performance. Brill scours the inner workings of public school teachers' contracts, uncovering such gems as a New York City contract provision ""allowing the principal no say over the format of a lesson plan."" He recounts his exposure of New York City's infamous ""rubber rooms,"" where hundreds of teachers under investigation for misconduct or incompetence were sidelined for years at full pay with nothing to do but watch the clock tick down each day. The practice was discontinued after his reporting revealed it. In another illustrative case study, Brill compares Harlem Success I, a charter school, with P.S. 149, a traditional public school. Both schools happen to share the same building in New York City, with very similar students, parents, socioeconomic conditions and environments. But Harlem Success blows P.S. 149 out of the water. Eighty-six percent of its students were proficient in English in 2010, compared with 29% of P.S. 149's. Throughout the book, Brill uses examples like these to explain how fossilized teacher union contracts, lax or nonexistent teacher evaluations, and unmovable wages and benefits have straitjacketed any hope of real reform. The solution, Brill says, is to overhaul the public school education system in order to motivate and inspire better teachers. Rewriting union contracts and paying teachers based on performance, not seniority, are among the first steps Brill advises. The United States can afford to pay our nation's best teachers more, while holding bad teachers accountable and paying them accordingly. Brill's work represents a real tug-of-war inside the Democratic Party, between the teachers' unions and modern reformers, for control of the nation's education machine. The old guard of the Democratic Party, the AFT and NEA, believe that the blame for stagnant and falling test scores falls on anyone but them. Yet, new Democratic voices, such as Cory Booker, Geoffrey Canada and Rhee, are vocally questioning what was once unquestionable -- that contracts, wages, benefits, accountability and standards need sensible reforms. The latest drop in SAT reading scores should not be written off as a statistical outlier, but should be a wake-up call to heed the chorus of reformers, conservatives and liberals alike, whose prescriptions are timely, relevant and might be just what we need to turn our public schools around. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: SAT reading scores for 2011 high school class were lowest on record .

"Rome (CNN) -- An anarchist group claimed credit for a pair of mail bombings Thursday at embassies in Rome, vowing in messages that it plans more such acts to ""destroy the systems of domination,"" the state-run ANSA news agency reports. Police said that the Informal Federation of Anarchists -- an offshoot of the Italian Anarchist Federation, or FAI -- claimed responsibility for attacks at the Swiss and Chilean embassies. Computer-written notes were sent in small boxes along with both package bombs, according to ANSA. The messages read: ""We have decided to make our voices heard again, in words and deeds. We will destroy the system of domination. Long live FAI. Long live anarchy."" The notes also referenced Lambros Fountas, who was shot dead last March while protesting in Athens. The 35-year-old has since become a martyr for the international anarchist movement, particularly groups in Greece, Italy and Spain. Formed in 1945, Italian Anarchist Federation had seen a ""a slow but constant increase"" of supporters in recent years, said the website of an  umbrella group, L'International des Federations Anarchistes. The Italian organization aims for ""radical change"" in support of ""oppressed and exploited peoples,"" doing so with opposition to political powers and even the Catholic Church, the website said. There was no warning before a Swiss-born, 53-year-old mailroom worker was seriously hurt by an explosion while opening a package at the Swiss Embassy, according to police and the Swiss Foreign Ministry in Bern. One person was taken to a hospital when the second bomb exploded shortly afterward at the Chilean Embassy, police said. Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattin called the attacks ""a serious threat against foreign embassies in Rome."" He said that authorities were checking all embassies in Rome and Italian embassies aboard for suspicious packages. ""We should avoid being alarmist,"" Frattin said. Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said the incident is similar to a wave of letter bombs sent last month by an anarchist group based in Greece and claimed the bombs came from there. But Greek officials disputed the notion that anyone in their country was involved in the blasts. ""There is no evidence that the bombs originated in Greece,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoris Delavekouras said. In addition to the Swiss and Chilean blasts, a ""suspicious package"" was found at the Ukrainian Embassy in the Italian capital, police said, but it turned out not to be dangerous. There were also false alarms at the Slovenian and Estonian embassies. Police began their sweeps of all embassies and consulates after the blasts, the Italian ministers said. Many countries have two diplomatic missions in the city -- one to the Italian state and a separate one to the Vatican. Security around Rome was tight Thursday night, with barriers erected at embassies and some streets closed for enhanced protection. Bomb threats were also phoned in to City Hall and to another government office in Rome, the mayor's office said. No bombs have been found in either location. In November, police discovered 14 parcel bombs emanating from Greece, most of which were sent to various embassies in Athens. Police intercepted and destroyed most of them in controlled explosions, but a woman at a courier office was wounded by one of the devices and another device exploded in the courtyard of the Swiss Embassy. Other parcel bombs were addressed to European targets including the leaders of Germany and Italy. Two men accused of participating in the bombings were remanded into custody after they were arrested in Athens in possession of two parcel bombs, Glock pistols, a bulletproof vest and a wig. Panagiotis Argyrou, 22, and Gerasimos Tsakalos, 24, were also in possession of a delivery slip for another parcel containing an explosive device that had been delivered to a courier service and was addressed to the Dutch Embassy, police said. Hellenic Police spokesman Maj. Athanasios Kokkalakis called the two suspects ""important members of a terrorist group."" Before the attacks, Argyrou already faced an arrest warrant alleging his membership in an illegal organization called the Conspiracy of Cells of Fire.

"Washington (CNN) -- From rising rhetoric between the president and top Republicans over the economy to a marquee Senate campaign showdown, politics are heating up in the summer sun and could boil over in the week ahead. 1. Economic tug of war . With budget showdowns looming, President Barack Obama continues to try to take his case directly to the American people. The president travels to an Amazon distribution center in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Tuesday and will again speak on the economy, which remains the top issue on the minds of Americans. The White House touts the address as the first in a series of policy speeches on Obama's ""better bargain for the middle class."" John King: Obama thinks he's getting the upper hand . ""Tuesday's speech will focus on manufacturing and high-wage jobs for durable economic growth, and the president will discuss proposals he has laid out to jump-start private-sector job growth and make America more competitive, and will also talk about new ideas to create American jobs,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. The Chattanooga address follows similar speeches last week where the president's tone was sharper and more partisan than many had expected. Obama: I won't 'twiddle my thumbs' waiting for GOP . ""If the Republicans don't agree with me, I want them to lay out their ideas. If they have got a better plan to create jobs, rebuild our infrastructure, to make sure that they have great ports all along the Gulf, come on, let me know what your ideas are,"" the president said Thursday in Jacksonville, Florida. Congressional Republican leaders are pushing right back at the president -- with deadlines to continue funding the federal government and raising the nation's debt ceiling as well the date for implementing a crucial part of Obamacare on the horizon. Obama touts economic agenda; GOP says he's 'all sizzle, no steak' ""Look, this president is a terrific campaigner. We all recognize that. He has got a way with words, too. But at some point campaign season has to end and the `working with others' season has to begin,"" Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Thursday morning. ""His speech turned out to be all sizzle and no steak, that's assuming there's any sizzle left after you've reheated this thing so many times,"" House Speaker John Boehner chimed in later. With one week left before the congressional summer recess, both Democrats and Republicans will ramp up the rhetoric over the strong possibility of a government shutdown in the autumn. Both sides are pointing fingers in a heated blame game, and the fight will continue into the August recess as the action moves to lawmakers' home states and districts. 2. Marquee Senate showdown begins . What could ultimately be the most expensive and bitter Senate battle in the 2014 midterm elections formally begins Tuesday when Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes kicks off her Democratic challenge to McConnell, who's running for a sixth term in the Senate. In a preview of how nasty things could get, Grimes blames McConnell for greatly contributing to the gridlock in Washington, saying in a video previewing her rollout that the Senate Republican leader is ""the biggest part of the problem. He's wasted decades blocking legislation that would have helped Kentucky and our country. And over the last few years he's done it for the worst possible reason -- out of spite."" Web wars start in crucial 2014 Senate race . Even before announcing her candidacy this month, Grimes had already come under attack, both by an Internet ad put out by the McConnell campaign that poked fun at the amount of time she was taking to make a decision, and by a pro-McConnell independent group that went up with an ad that called her ""Obama's cheerleader in Kentucky."" McConnell is known for taking the fight to his political opponents, and he quickly welcomed Grimes to the race by linking her to the president, who is unpopular in Kentucky, a red state in presidential elections. ""Accepting the invitation from countless Washington liberals to become President Obama's Kentucky candidate was a courageous decision by Alison Lundergan Grimes, and I look forward to a respectful exchange of ideas,"" McConnell said in a statement this month. In her video, Grimes fired back, saying, ""I don't scare easy."" Next weekend both Grimes and McConnell will attend the annual Fancy Farm picnic in the rural western tip of Kentucky. The picnic is famous as a traditional political gathering that attracts statewide candidates. Also expected to attend that gathering is Matt Bevins, a Kentucky businessman who a few days ago formally launched a conservative primary challenge to McConnell, adding more political fire to an already combustible race. Conservative challenger takes on McConnell . 3. House GOP to make another statement . Pegged to the scandal involving Internal Revenue Service targeting some political groups for special scrutiny, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives will vote on a series of bills in the week ahead to curb the power of the IRS and other federal agencies. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor packaged 10 measures for floor votes and dubbed the final week before a monthlong summer recess as ""Stop Government Abuse"" week. Republicans to make big push on oversight legislation . In addition to the IRS, another chief target of the Republican legislative push is Obamacare, which the House GOP has continually tried to roll back. One bill sponsored by Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, would prohibit the IRS from implementing any provisions of the health care law. Since the IRS is the agency that would enforce the mandate that individuals must carry health insurance, this legislation essentially hamstrings the program. This bill is the latest in a string of more than three dozen times House Republicans have tried to repeal entirely or change parts of the health care law. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized the effort, saying, ""It is only fitting that Republicans would waste the last week at work this summer voting for the 40th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act and continue their record of no jobs bills, no budget agreement and no solutions for the middle class."" Many Republicans expressed outrage after IRS employee Lois Lerner was placed on administrative leave but is still being paid, which the current law allows. A GOP bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania, would change that law and allow federal agencies to suspend employees who are under investigation without pay. Other Republican bills would limit bonuses for federal workers and impose a ban on any new IRS conferences until new changes are in place. One topic the House won't address before its five-week break is immigration reform. The Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill last month, but Boehner said instead the House will take a ""step-by-step"" approach but has not given any details yet on when it will vote or what specific measures will be taken up on the floor. 4. Scandals from coast ... It's the tabloid political blockbuster of the summer: Amid falling poll numbers and a rising ""sexting"" count, New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner had a horrible week. Opponent: Weiner is immature, disconnected from the truth . But the former seven-term Democratic representative, who resigned from Congress two years ago following a similar scandal, has so far resisted calls to end his bid for a second chance in politics. All eyes will be on Weiner in the days ahead. Will Weiner's poll numbers continue to plunge? Will more women who had inappropriate online relationships with Weiner speak out? Will Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, a longtime top adviser to Hillary Clinton, continue to support her husband's bid for political redemption? Weiner acknowledged Sunday that campaign manager Danny Kedem has left his team. A lot of questions remain, and as of now, Weiner's still giving answers. Weiner says he has no response to Sidney Leathers . ""But there's going to reach a point fairly soon that I'm going to say I think I've said enough about it, and I'm going to keep just talking about other things,"" Weiner told reporters Friday. Stay tuned. 5. ... to coast . On the left coast, it's a similar story as another former Democratic congressman is facing calls to quit. San Diego Mayor Bob Filner is dealing with an explosion of sexual harassment allegations. Filner said Friday he will take a two-week hiatus for ""intensive counseling."" His move came one day after fellow Democrats called for his resignation. Amid calls to resign, embattled Filner to enter clinic . Saying he had apologized to his staff, the citizens and the ""women I have offended,"" the mayor said, ""It is simply not acceptable to explain away my conduct as the product of the standards of a different generation."" On Thursday, the San Diego County Democratic Party voted 34-6 to ask the mayor to step down. Seven women have said they were targets of the mayor's advances. A group has begun a campaign aimed at getting more than the 100,000 signatures needed to try and recall Filner, who was a five-term congressman before being elected mayor last year.

"(CNN) -- Unconscious. Brain dead. Rory McIlroy was in a brutally reflective mood in the words he chose to describe his opening round in the British Open . The world no.2 carded an eight-over-par round of 79 as the world's golfing giants made their first forays on Scotland's testing Muirfield course. All the golfers are contending with the rarities of a British heatwave but McIlroy said he was tortured by a long-term torpor. ""Sometimes I feel like I'm walking around out there and I'm unconscious,"" said McIlroy, a two-time major winner, told the media. ""I just need to try to think more. I'm trying to focus and trying to concentrate. ""But I can't really fathom it at the minute, and it's hard to stand up here and tell you what's really wrong . ""It's just so brain dead. Seriously, I feel like I've been walking around out there like that for the last couple of months. I'm trying to get out of it."" McIlroy lost his top ranking to Tiger Woods in March and the Northern Ireland golfer is still searching for his first win in 2013, having only chosen to enter seven tournaments before the Open. The 24-year-old's slump in form has also been linked to his switch to Nike equipment this year in a deal reported to be worth $250m. McIlroy struggled to the turn at Muirfield in one over before two painful double-bogeys and four bogeys on the back nine left him searching for answers. A comeback of epic proportions is required if McIlroy can make the cut for the third major of the year. ""I want to try to be here for the weekend,"" McIlroy said. ""But the thing that I need to do tomorrow is just go out there and freewheel it and try and make birdies and try and play with that little bit of whatever it is I have usually."" McIlroy faced questions about his dubious form on the eve of the Open with suggestions his high-profile relationships with Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki was a distraction. But he rebuffed that suggestion, saying: ""No, not at all, no, no. It's not that at all. No, I'm fully focused on the golf out there."" McIlroy wasn't the only golfer mired at Muirfield, where temperatures nudging 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26 Celsius) had hardened the course and sped up the greens. U.S Open winner Justin Rose finished on four over par after carding a 75 which included just a single birdie on the 17th hole. Fellow Briton Luke Donald, the world No. 9, finished five shots further adrift of Rose after going round the links course in 80 while Australian Masters champion Adam Scott settled for a par-round of 71. Tiger Woods, on the hunt for his first major win since 2008, was one over at the turn but clawed his way back into contention on the back nine. The 14-time major winner lashed his opening tee-shot into the rough and ended up taking a penalty drop but four birdies - and just one bogey - on the run-in helped him finish on two-under. ""There wasn't a lot of talking out there because we're trying to grind it out on that golf course, and it's one of those courses where it just got so difficult,"" Woods told reporters. ""As the golf course dried out it got quick. Some of these putts today, I mean, I putted the ball off the green today. And it really wasn't that bad a putt."" Eagle eye . Fellow American Zach Johnson, winner of the 2007 Masters, held the overnight lead with a five-under 66. It was a punchy round from the 37-year-old, who eagled the long par-five fifth and dropped just a single stroke at the 14th. ""Any time you shoot under par in an Open or a major, for that matter, you have to be putting at least decent and I putted great,"" Johnson told reporters. The American holds a one-shot lead over 57-year-old compatriot Mark O'Meara and Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello, who both carded 67. Next came a group of five players -- Americans Dustin Johnson, Brandt Snedeker and Tom Lehman, Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain and India's Shiv Kapur -- on three under. American teenager Jordan Speith, who beat Zach Johnson and David Hearn to the John Deere Classic title in a play-off earlier this month, joined Woods on two-under. That victory earned the 19-year-old the last spot in the British Open and the debutant is in relaxed mood at Muirfield. ""It has been a great couple of weeks,"" Speith said. ""I've kind of accomplished more than I'd thought possible this year."" What wouldn't McIlroy give to be able to say the same thing?","Rory McIlroy shoots an eight-over-par round of 79 in first round of the British Open .

"CNN -- Elton John may be famous for smash hits such as ""Tiny Dancer"" and scores for films such as ""The Lion King,"" but he's also made a name for himself in HIV/AIDS activism. Advances in treatments for HIV/AIDS have led to some people taking more risks, Elton John says. The singer-songwriter established the Elton John AIDS Foundation in the United States and the United Kingdom to support HIV prevention programs, efforts to eliminate stigma and discrimination associated with the disease, and care and support services for people living with the condition. The foundation has raised more than $150 million. John has said that Ryan White, an Indiana teenager who died of HIV/AIDS in 1990, inspired him to create this foundation. John sat down with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta before speaking Tuesday at the Bio International Convention in Atlanta, Georgia. Here is an edited transcript. CNN: What are you doing here today? Elton John: I'm doing a speech about the situation with AIDS in America basically, and how we need to address what's going on. We seem to be falling a little behind in America. I find this disease very cyclical. Every 10 years or so, after we spend a lot of money trying to educate people -- a new generation of people -- and we tell them to have safe sex and to abstain sometimes but have safe sex, wear condoms, we find that after 10 years another whole group of people come along. And we have to start all over again, which is really, really frustrating because it takes money for education. And we find that if we could get into the schools at a grass-roots levels, which we do in places like Africa where we get to kids at a young age and we tell them about preventive measures for not getting HIV, we find the success rate is tremendous.   Watch more of Dr. Gupta's interview with Elton John Â» . CNN: Sometimes in medicine, you can actually be a victim of your own success. When the medications are pretty good, you see a resurgence of high-risk behavior. How do you affect that? John: I'm a recovering alcoholic and drug addict. I know that when I used to use and drink, that my mind situation was altered completely. Your caution goes out the window and you think, ""Oh, well, we'll gamble, we'll have..."" and luckily, I was so lucky enough to not be HIV infected. Once you have that drink and that drug, your mind-set goes out the window and a lot of people think, ""Oh yeah, because there's medicine available now,"" as you say, ""We're going to be OK, and we have to take now one pill a day maybe,"" which is incredible, because initially people had to take God knows how many pills a day, various cocktails to get them through this disease. Now, people are going back into the work force, they're becoming alive again, they live for a much longer time, which is great. But, this is incredibly toxic medicine you're taking, and it doesn't work for everybody, and you're really playing... Russian roulette with your life. And it's sad -- you think that after all this time, and all of this education that has gone down, and with all the statistics and deaths that people have seen, and the Ryan White situation going down, that people would be a little bit more careful. But we're finding they're not. CNN: When you look at your foundation, and you're talking to the people who work with you, how do you measure your success? John: We're very small, and I've kept it small because I've always wanted to keep an eye on what was going on. We have two people basically running the organization in America and about seven or eight in Britain plus volunteers. In America for the last four years, I've measured the success by the fact that we have a four-star rating from the Charity Navigator for the last four years, which means that we are doing a fantastic job. We don't waste any money, we don't gamble with our money. CNN: You go to South Africa every year, I understand? John: Every year at the beginning of the year, we start the year on safari, we go and visit our AIDS projects, and as soon as you go there and see -- and you have to visit your projects from time to time, wherever they are, whether it's in America, South America, West Indies, whatever -- we go and visit these projects on a regular basis to see the results that we're doing, to see if it's working, to see if our money's being spent the right way, and to come back and feel ""yes, we're working, its working, so let's do more."" When you see something that's working, you want to do more. You say, ""This is fantastic."" CNN: What are some of those success stories? John: Well, in Kalicha, in Cape Town, there was a woman we visited about five years ago. Somebody left a baby on her doorstep one night, and the mother had thrown herself in front of a train, the baby was orphaned, and they gave it to Rosalia. And she took it in, and then everyone started leaving babies on their doorstep. So there were about 120 kids sleeping in a shack, her home, like six to a bed. And we were reduced to tears -- one woman and volunteers were looking after all of these kids. We said, ""One day, this whole street where you're living, we'll build you some homes, proper homes for these kids to live in."" Now there are six ""cluster homes,"" they call them, where they have running water, showers, proper bedrooms, they're like beautiful little houses. So that street now, there's no original shack left, it's got all beautiful houses for these kids to live in. You go there, you see how happy they are, and you think, God this is amazing. We were inspired because of this one woman. We do good work, but these people on the ground, these people that are actually in the trenches every day who are looking after AIDS patients, who are looking after orphans, they're the heroes -- we're not. We're just trying to make their lives a bit easier, and because they're doing such great humanitarian work. CNN: What is your routine like? John: Well lets put it like this: I have a musical nominated for 15 Tonys, I'm doing an animation movie for Disney that I'm writing the music for, I'm producing, we have a show called ""Spectacle"" which is on Sundance which is with Elvis Costello, which is an incredibly well-received show. I'm going to do an album with Leon Russell next year, I have a ballet going to be done by the Alberta Ballet, I have the AIDS foundation, I have my management company [in] which we manage lots of young artists, and I still have free time. I love my life and I'm 62, I've never felt better. I've never had more joy than I have in my life right now, and the AIDS foundation is a huge part of that.","The Elton John AIDS Foundation has raised more than $150 million .

"(CNN) -- One of four former Khmer Rouge leaders charged with crimes against humanity was ruled unfit to stand trial and could be set free, a spokesman for the special U.N. court in Cambodia said Thursday. Lars Olsen said the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia decided that Ieng Thirith, the 78-year-old former minister of social affairs in the Khmer Rouge regime, was ""not fit to stand trial as she has dementia."" Prosecutors have 24 hours to object to the court's decision, Olsen said. If there is no objection, Ieng Thirith will be released, he added. Opening statements by the defendants are scheduled for Monday. Ieng Thirith was the only woman among the four defendants in the trial, which charges surviving leaders of the four-year Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s with crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, genocide, homicide, torture and religious persecution. The other defendants are her husband, Ieng Sary, the former Khmer Rouge foreign minister; Khieu Samphon, the nominal head of state; and Nuon Chea, the prime minister, also known as Brother Number 2. The head of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, was known as Brother Number 1. He died in 1998, long before the U.N.-backed court came into existence. Under Pol Pot's leadership, the Khmer Rouge regime was responsible for the deaths of millions of ordinary Cambodians during a four-year reign of terror that was eventually halted in 1979 by invading Vietnamese forces. In 1975, the Khmer Rouge ordered people out of Phnom Penh, the capital, and other cities in Cambodia to work in the countryside. It is said to be responsible for about 1.7 million deaths, roughly a quarter of the population at the time. Its stated aim was to create a Communist utopia, but instead the regime forced Cambodians into what has been described as a living hell. City-dwellers were marched into the countryside and forced to work as farm laborers. Those already living in rural Cambodia were expected to produce enough food for the country while teaching farming to those who had never done it before. Currency was abolished, and anyone with an education was considered a threat. No one was allowed modern medicine, and the country isolated itself in an effort to become completely self-sufficient. The results were disastrous: People died of starvation and disease as soldiers tortured and killed anyone suspected of being disloyal. In the end, virtually everyone, including the soldiers, became a target due to the leadership's paranoia.","The special U.N. court in Cambodia decides Ieng Thirith has dementia .

"(CNN) -- A former supervisory FBI agent has been arrested and jailed on child pornography charges. Donald Sachtleben was taken into custody and charged Monday after a nationwide undercover investigation of illegal child porn images traded over the Internet. The 54-year-old resident of Carmel, Indiana, has pleaded not guilty and has a detention hearing in federal court Wednesday. A federal complaint alleges 30 graphic images and video were found on Sachtleben's laptop computer late last week when FBI agents searched his home, about 23 miles north of Indianapolis. The arrest was a result a months-long probe, said the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Indiana, Joseph Hogsett. ""The mission of our Project Safe Childhood initiative is to investigate and prosecute anyone found to (be) engaged in the sexual exploitation of children,"" Hogsett said in a news release. ""No matter who you are, you will be brought to justice if you are found guilty of such criminal behavior."" Sachtleben is currently an Oklahoma State University visiting professor, according to his online resume. He is director of training at the school's Center for Improvised Explosives, but all references to his work have now been removed from the university's website. There was no indication from the school as to whether it had suspended him. Calls to the university and his Indianapolis attorneys were not immediately returned. He had been an FBI special agent from 1983 to 2008, serving as a bomb technician. He worked on the Oklahoma City bombing and Unabomber investigations, according to his university biography. A separate LinkedIn profile filled out by Sachtleben says he is an ""accomplished investigator with more than 25 years of experience in FBI major case management, counter terrorism investigations, bombing prevention, post blast investigations and public speaking."" According to the criminal complaint, a federal-state joint task force had been investigating an Illinois man allegedly trading child porn images as far back as September 2010. That suspect was arrested in January, and a search of his computer reportedly led to Sachtleben, who was using the e-mail name pedodave69. According to the affidavit, an e-mail from that account was sent to the Illinois suspect last fall, along with nine images of child porn. ""Saw your profile on (a file sharing network). Hope you like these and can send me some of ours (sic). I have even better ones if you like."" Prosecutors say Sachtleben sent that e-mail. Sachtleben's wife was interviewed by agents during the execution of the search warrant and denied any involvement with child porn. She was not taken into custody. FBI officials in Washington had no comment on the arrest. If convicted, Sachtleben would face up to 20 years in prison on the charge of distribution of child porn, and an additional 10 years for possession. The Justice Department's Project Safe Childhood initiative was launched in 2006, leading to what federal officials call a more than 40% increase in the number of cases investigated. The project's website says 2,700 indictments were filed last year alone. The case is U.S. v. Sachtleben (1:12-mj-316).","Donald Sachtleben has a detention hearing in federal court Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- An intense cold front in southern Latin America continues to blanket the region, causing deaths, school and highway closures, and other woes. A total of 18 people have died in Bolivia as a direct or indirect consequence of low temperatures, the Peruvian state-run Andina news agency reported. The deaths were spread out throughout the country. On Monday, Bolivian officials said temperatures in the major city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra would reach 3 C (37 F), the lowest in 29 years, and in other regions the mercury dropped below freezing, Andina reported. As a precaution, Bolivian authorities canceled school from Monday to Wednesday, the official Bolivian news agency ABI reported. Police in Paraguay reported eight deaths from hypothermia and two from carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of heating devices. The government opened shelters for the poor, who are picked up at night by military trucks. Paraguayan authorities also estimated that 1,000 cattle died because of the cold. In Uruguay, local media reported two weather-related fatalities. The cold front hit the region on Saturday and was responsible for eight deaths in Argentina over the weekend. An area of low pressure in the southern hemisphere jet stream pushed deeper north allowing for cold Antarctic air to pool over Chile and Argentina. Below-normal temperatures are expected over the next 48 hours across the region. Argentina reported Monday that nine of its provinces were feeling temperatures below freezing. The intense cold will remain in the area at least through Tuesday, Argentina's official news agency, Telam, reported. Similarly, in Peru, the country's southern Amazon region was experiencing the coldest weather in three years, Andina reported, citing the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service. In the city of Puerto Maldonado, the temperatures fell to 9 C (48 F). In the Amazon region, the usual lows are in the 20s C (high-60s F). The cold was also affecting farmers in the Peruvian city of Arequipa, in the Andes Mountains. With temperatures falling there to -17 C (1 F), the cold was too much for the region's Alpaca herds. Pregnant Alpacas were losing their babies, and young Alpacas were dying, Andina reported. Some 10 percent of the region's 40,000 Alpacas were affected, the news agency reported. CNN's Judson Jones and journalists Sanie Lopez and Dario Klein contributed to this report.","An intense cold front continues in Latin America .
