"Iker Casillas made a mess of a first half free-kick and Diego Costa made it six games without scoring for Spain as the European champions were beaten by Slovakia in their first defeat in qualifying for eight years. Casillas’ clanger allowed Juraj Kucka to give the hosts the lead and with Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel getting the better of Costa it always looked as if Vicente del Bosque’s side would leave empty-handed. Spain substitute Paco Alcacer equalised with eight minutes left to make it two goals in two games for him but Michal Duris' cross was headed home by former Chelsea midfielder Miroslav Stoch three minutes from time and Slovakia took all three points.

Subs not used: Azpilicueta, Bartra, Raul Garcia, De Gea, Iturraspe, Casilla, Carvajal, Bernat, Rdorigo. Goal: Alcacer 82 . Costa’s international goal drought looked like coming to an end in the first half as his combination with Cesc Fabregas almost broke the deadlock inside the first 10 minutes. The midfielder crossed from the right and Costa’s header went fractionally wide. He was coming into the game having failed to score in his first six matches for his adopted country, in stark contrast to nine goals in nine games for Chelsea. The Brazilian-born striker had started brightly and was seeing plenty of the ball. Unfortunately Casillas did not see the ball at all at the other end of the pitch when he handed Slovakia a shock lead. The Spain keeper had made a brilliant save moments earlier from Robert Mak. Peter Pekarik crossed from the right, and with Casillas wrong-footed, PAOK striker Mak thought he had scored but the Real Madrid keeper changed direction and turned the shot away for a corner. But on 18 minutes Kucka drove a free-kick through a less than convincing Spain wall and with a slight swerve the driven shot seemed to confuse Casillas. Had he not moved he would have caught the ball but he had already gone right and when he readjusted his position, his fumbling block could not prevent the ball hitting the back of the net. It should have been a special night for Casillas, moving into second place for all-time international appearances for a European player, with only Latvia’s Vitalijs Astafjevs on 165 having played more. Spain and Barcelona defender Gerard Pique looks in dismay during his side's shock defeat by Slovakia . Vicente del Bosque named a strong team against Slovakia - with the likes of David Silva, Costa and Andres Iniesta all starting for La Roja . Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas also featured for La Roja against European rivals Slovakia . Costa, pictured on the receiving end of a tackle by Liverpool's Skrtel, played the full 90 minutes against Slovakia . Slovakia's match-winner spent four years as a Chelsea player, although he never started a Premier League game for the club. In 2010 the winger was sold to Turkish side Fenerbache, where he looked to have revitalised his career, scoring 14 times in his first two seasons. But no goals in 17 games in the 2012/13 season saw him fall out of favour, and Stoch was loaned to PAOK in Greece. After a decent spell he returned to Turkey, only to be loaned out again, this time to Al Ain in UAE, where he plays alongside former Sunderland striker Asamoah Gyan. So far this season he has scored twice in three games, as well as making two appearances off the bench for Slovakia, including Thursday's crucial cameo. But Casillas’ 158th game had been ruined by an error that now put Spain on the back foot. Fabregas and Costa led the charge to get back into the match and Costa in particular was everywhere, including in the face of Skrtel. The two clashed off the ball and were both spoken to by the referee. Ten minutes before the break Costa so nearly had his first goal for Spain when he headed Fabregas’ corner goalwards. Matus Kozacik pulled off a fine save and then saved Sergio Busquet’s acrobatic volley from the rebound. Costa was denied at the start of the second half and Fabregas also went close but the Chelsea pairing were unable to get Spain back into the game. It was in Slovakia nine years ago that Spain’s record goalscorer David Villa netted the first of his 59 goals and the reigning European champions had hoped Costa – the man they see as the heir to Villa’s throne – would also get off the mark here. But the curse continues. Despite his blistering form for Chelsea he played in a disappointing 1-0 friendly defeat by France last month and then missed their 5-1 win over Macedonia a few days later. Some Spanish fans even wanted that team – with Valencia youngster  Alcacer leading the line – to be used again for this game. Alcacer replaced Manchester City’s David Silva with 20 minutes left and scored the equaliser from Jordi Alba’s cross. It seemed that would set-up a grandstand finish and give Costa the opportunity to break his duck with the winner. Slovakia had other ideas though and from Duris’ cross Stoch got the winner.

"Jack Wilshere has revealed the secret behind England's new midfield - the 'five-second fury.'

'We've got a great, compact unit there in the middle, we get after the ball and we win it. 'We talk about the ""five-second fury"", when we lose it - go get it back. We are starting to do those things. 'In the first half we should have scored a few goals but in the second half we felt confident. 'Even when they went down to 10 men it might have made it a little bit harder, but we kept going and Wayne produced a bit of magic.'

"On the mean streets of Glasgow's Barrowfield a young man has two choices: make something of your life or... well, the other option isn't worth thinking about. An area renowned for gang warfare, drugs and crime, it has undergone a revamp in recent years but there is no escaping you need to be hewn from stern stuff to survive. James McArthur took the first option yet recognises the role Barrowfield played in shaping the man he is today. Scotland midfielder James McArthur, now playing for Crystal Palace, is grateful for his chance in football . 'Where I grew up it was a rough area but it's something I would never change,' says the Crystal Palace midfielder. 'It made me what I am. Every day was an education.' McArthur was one of many football-daft kids who played the game on the streets or on the red ash pitches in the shadow of Celtic's old training ground. They took on other streets, against boys and men of all shapes and pedigree. 'We had 22 kids or whoever playing against each other on whatever pitch we could find. It's not something you see too much of now and I think kids today are missing out. It was where we all came together and it taught me a lot. It toughened me up and made me sharper.' The 27-year-old, seen training, is adamant the current Scotland squad is good enough to qualify for Euro 2016 . McArthur was a second-half substitute in the 1-0 win over Georgia on Saturday but hopes to start in Poland . Temptation of a different life was never far away though. His friends boasted of great nights out drinking at 15 and 16 while McArthur confesses he once got involved in a gangfight but fear of his father's reaction meant once was more than enough. 'My mum and dad always kept at me about keeping to the right path and not getting involved. My dad James drove me up and down the country so that I could play my football and it's one thing I never forgot. 'As soon as I was able to help my family I did.' However Barrowfield is painted, it certainly provided motivation; McArthur's boyhood friends Graham Dorrans and Robert Snodgrass also went on to make professional careers and the values learned on their housing estate remain. The Scot, evading Jake Livermore of Hull, has impressed since joining Crystal Palace this summer . McArthur was a late substitute in Scotland's win over Georgia on Saturday and is keen to play a greater role against Poland on Tuesday night. He won't be rushing to swap shirts with Robert Lewandowski and Co though. McArthur was one of Scotland's star turns in their bold performance against Germany last month but defeat meant the 27-year-old wasn't in the mood for mementoes from any of their World Cup winners. 'I didn't go looking to swap shirts with anyone,' he says. 'You see it all the time now but what message does that send out to the fans? We lost the game. 'If I was a fan I wouldn't be happy seeing players running to swap shirts with a team they'd lost to. You want to play against those players, the best in the world, but I was more bothered by our result. It was a good performance but we were upset not to get something from it. I don't want a shirt to remind me of defeat.' Scotland manager Gordan Strachan talks his players through his instructions in training as McArthur looks on . Strachan will hope McArthur and the rest of the squad can perform heroically in Poland on Tuesday . McArthur, who names former Rangers and Scotland captain Barry Ferguson as one of his boyhood heroes, is confident Scotland can progress from what is a tricky group. 'We have a good group of players and we firmly believe we can qualify if we play to our potential.' Progress could be at the expense of his close friend James McCarthy the Republic of Ireland and Everton midfielder who played alongside McArthur at Hamilton Academicals before both moved to Wigan Athletic where they won the FA Cup but also got relegated; 'the highest and lowest points of my career and within a week of each other'. The two were often confused by commentators due to the similarities in their name and the matter was compounded when singer James Arthur won the TV show X Factor. 'I think my twitter following multiplied until they realised their mistake,' he jokes. Shaun Maloney's strike led to the winning goal in Scotland's 1-0 defeat of Georgia at Ibrox on Saturday . Scotland moved above Germany on goal difference after the world champions were beaten by Poland . McArthur and McCarthy faced each other as opponents for the first time shortly after McArthur's £7m summer transfer and it was Palace who came out victorious. 'We exchanged a few texts in the build-up, a few jokes, all good natured banter, but during the game I didn't get the chance to say anything as he ended up playing right-back. He's a terrific player though. 'He moans a lot but he's taking his game to another level now and he's going to be one of the best in the Premier League.' McArthur's transfer to Crystal Palace wasn't the only major change in his life last summer. Resplendent in kilt, he married long-time girlfriend Louisa, mother of their baby daughter Ella Rose, at the luxurious Cameron House hotel on Loch Lomond. Poland striker Arkadiusz Milik (R) celebrates with team-mate Kamil Grosicki after scoring against Germany . The family, complete with pet puggle dog Dexter, a pug and beagle cross before you ask, moved to London in August and are already settled. 'I was sad to leave Wigan because there were so many good people there. Leicester came close to signing me too but Palace agreed the terms and I knew it was the best move for my career and my family. 'We've adjusted pretty well already. We were in a hotel for a few days but we quickly got a house and that's made a huge difference.' POLAND (probable, 4-4-2): Szczesny; Piszczek, Glik, Szukala, Wawrzyniak; Rybus, Krychowiak, Mila, Grosicki; Milik, Lewandowski. SCOTLAND (probable, 4-2-3-1): Marshall; Hutton, Martin, Greer, Robertson; Brown, D Fletcher; Morrison, Naismith, Maloney; S Fletcher. Referee: Alberto Undiano Mallenco (Spa). TV & Radio: LIVE on Sky Sports 1 from 7.30pm and BBC Radio 5 Live from 7.45pm. Any upheaval has been helped by the presence of friend and fellow golf buff Barry Bannan while manager Neil Warnock has been quick to make him feel at home. 'He's a character,' says McArthur. 'I'm grateful to him for bringing me back to the Premier League and he's been excellent with me. He's obviously a passionate guy, you can see that on the touchline but he's always got a smile. 'He's very organised as a manager and he's always chirpy around the place, cracking jokes. He wants his team to win but I've not seen him going over the top, not yet anyway.' It seems the young James McArthur from Barrowfield has made all the right choices.","Grew up in the tough Glasgow neighbourhood of Barrowfield .

"Luis Suarez’s countdown to the Clasico continues and all indications are that despite playing just four friendlies in four months he will be ready to start against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu. Since the Spanish league computer decreed that Suarez’s ban for a bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup would end the same day as football’s most expensive fixture between two of its bitterest rivals, Suarez’s focus has been on winning the race to be fit to start the match. At first he was hampered by the demands of moving his family from Liverpool to Barcelona and by FIFA’s ban on him training with team-mates or even setting foot inside the club’s Joan Gamper headquarters. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Suarez kick the ball in his Uruguay team-mate's face . Luis Suarez is raring to go after starting on his Uruguay comeback in a friendly against Saudi Arabia . The former Liverpool striker played a key part in Uruguay's goal after making his international return . The countdown is on for Suarez (left) to make his competitive Barcelona debut against Real Madrid . When the ban on all football activity was lifted by the court of arbitration in sport on August 14, work could really begin on his comeback and the gruelling one-on-one training sessions with Barca fitness coach Juanjo Brau have gradually begun to pay dividends. Off the pitch he moved his family from his wife’s parents’ house in the Barcelona coastal town of Castelldefels to a new home in nearby Gava where coach Luis Enrique and defender Javier Mascherano also live. On the pitch a behind-closed-doors friendly with the B-team was followed by a specially organised match against an Indonesian Under-19 XI in which he scored twice and passed up on the chance to complete his hat-trick from the spot so that the B-team’s pre-designated spot-kick taker could score. He wanted former captain Steven Gerrard to present him with the Golden Shoe this week for his 31 goals scored at Liverpool last season. When Gerrard confirmed he would not be able to make it Suarez insisted on the next best thing – Kenny Dalglish the man who brought him to Liverpool in January 2011. Tenacious Suarez chases after the ball during Uruguay's clash with Saudi Arabia in Jiddah . The Barcelona star unleashes a venomous volley that hits the post, rebounding off a defender into the net . He also wanted the trophy to be presented to him at Anfield but Liverpool’s next home game comes the weekend of the Clasico so the Golden Shoe will instead be handed over on Wednesday in Barcelona. The player still wants the chance to show it off in front of the Kop before the season ends. Before the Golden Shoe presentation, he will play the second of two international friendlies in Oman on Monday. Whether for the third bite, or the signing for Barcelona — or both — his commercial value appears higher than ever. Uruguay’s matches against Saudi Arabia and Oman have earned their football association around £1,000,000 — that is twice what they would have been paid had the player, who is banned for eight further competitive internationals, not been part of the team. Friday’s pre-agreed 70 minute run-out was marked by all-but scoring Uruguay’s only goal in a 1-1 draw. A thunderous right-foot volley came back off the post and rebounded over the line off defender Hassan Muath Fallatah. He looked predictably short of match sharpness but a long way from the ‘overweight ex-footballer’ description given him by the pro-Madrid media after his last friendly. Suarez (standing on the football) takes it all in at Barcelona training as the players have a team meeting . The world's third most expensive player smiles despite his long four-month ban from competitive football . Barcelona supporters are hopeful the precedent of last season means he makes an instant impact on his return. After serving his 10-game ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic, Suarez scored twice on his league return. That afternoon a Sunderland side still reeling from the mismanagement of Paolo di Canio and under the temporary stewardship of Kevin Ball were the opponents, and not Real Madrid. Another precedent lends itself to the theory that his delayed start need not be a problem. When Johan Cruyff signed for Barcelona from Ajax in August 1973 for 120m pesetas (just over £500,000) a bureaucratic problem meant the team had already played the first seven fixtures before Cruyff could play. When he finally got to make his debut in the last week of October he scored twice against Granada in a 4-0 win. Speaking with Spanish radio on Friday night Everton manager Roberto Martinez said he thought Suarez had the quality to fit right in to any side in any league. ‘He created Liverpool’s great season without any doubt,’ he said. ‘He will give Barcelona something they didn’t have before.’ On Wednesday in Madrid Cristiano Ronaldo, who also scored 31 league goals last season, will be awarded his Golden Shoe. Ten days later the two top marksmen will come face to face in what Jose Mourinho always referred to as the match that stops the world — it will be the man who can’t stop scoring, against the man who can’t wait to start’. Barcelona striker Suarez surveys the lay of the land as his team-mates watch on at training . Suarez, Uruguay's top scorer with 40 goals in 78 caps, looked sharp as they took on Saudi Arabia .

"Carlo Ancelotti will not have to look too far in his search for a starting XI that copes with the absence of Gareth Bale – the team he put out on Saturday without the Welshman won 5-0 and gave Real Madrid's best performance of the season. Bale's injury now looks certain to rule him out of this weekend's Clasico as well as Wednesday night's Champions League group B game at Anfield. But with £30million Spain Under 21 European Champion and former Manchester City target Isco to come in there is no real concern that Real Madrid, who will also be without central defender Sergio Ramos, will be weakened. Some Madrid watchers even belive that for all of Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo's brilliance, against better sides who keep the ball well, Real are better with only one of their powerful sprint forwards in the team. Gareth Bale will miss Real Madrid's game with Liverpool after injuring a muscle in his buttocks . Former Malaga midfielder Isco (right), pictured in action against Levante, looks set to replace Bale at Anfield . Bale (left) was left on the bench as Isco (right) and Real thrashed Levante 5-0 on Saturday . Real Madrid's probable XI against Liverpool . Last season in the Spanish Cup final Ronaldo was missing and Ancelotti played a 4-4-2 with Bale and Karim Benzema up front and it was enough to defeat Barcelona in what was the first of two trophies Real won. On Wednesday night he will repeat that formula with Benzema pairing up with Ronaldo and James Rodriguez, Luca Modric, Toni Kroos and Isco making up a midfield four. One of Ancelotti's challenges when he arrived was to make Madrid play a little more like Barcelona – with that midfield he can send out a team capable of passing any rival into submission. Isco has had a difficult time since signing a year ago and soon being overtaken by Bale but now is his chance. 'What we have lost in gallop, we have gained in control' said one Madrid commentator on Tuesday underlining the sense that Isco will keep the ball better than Bale making up for the Welshman's more explosive qualities. Bale's injury to the pyramidalis muscle located deep with in the Gluteus muscle group could be related to a long term herniated spinal disc problem discovered during his Real Madrid medical according to Spanish specialist Ricardo Garcia Oviedo. He said: 'It could be related because a player can strain other areas in the lumbar region an attempt to over compensate for the hernia,' he said. Disc hernias are not uncommon in sportsman and Bale finished last season strongly scoring in the European Cup final but he has played 1,319 minutes already so far this season, including 180 minutes for Wales. He could now miss up to five games in a two-week recovery period. Cristiano Ronaldo looks set to start as a striker alongside Karim Benzema at Anfield on Wednesday .

Bosnia-Herzegovina and Belgium drew 1-1 in an entertaining Euro 2016 Group B qualifier after midfielder Radja Nainggolan cancelled out Edin Dzeko's first-half opener for the Balkan nation on Monday. A clinical strike by the lively Dzeko gave Bosnia the lead against the run of play before Nainggolan equalised thanks to a blunder by keeper Asmir Begovic, who had kept his team afloat in the first half. The result left the Belgians on four points from two games after their opening 6-0 home rout of Andorra while Bosnia have two points from three matches following a 2-1 home defeat by Cyprus and a 0-0 draw at Wales.

The Welsh top the group with seven points from three games after a 2-1 home win over Cyprus. Although the outcome in Zenica piled more pressure on the Bosnians, coach Safet Susic remained upbeat about his team's chances of reaching a second successive tournament as an independent nation following an early World Cup exit. 'The battle for Euro 2016 qualification will in all likelihood go down to the wire in our group and I am sure we will be in contention until the very end,' Susic told BHT television. 'The Belgians have acquired the kind of confidence you are accustomed to seeing from the likes of Germany and are hence so difficult to play against.' His counterpart Marc Wilmots said: 'We stayed calm. We knew chances would come our way and finally we equalised.' Begovic produced a string of superb saves either side of Dzeko's 28th minute opener, when the Manchester City striker buried his shot past Thibaut Courtois after Miralem Pjanic squared a perfect cutback into his path. But the Stoke City keeper committed a calamitous error shortly after the break, allowing a tame Nainggolan shot from 20 yards to trickle into the back of the net under his body. The Bosnians then gained the upper hand and twice came close when Vincent Kompany cleared Pjanic's shot off the line and Thibaut Courtois kept out a Dzeko header with an acrobatic save.

His Manchester City team mate Dzeko also had mixed feelings about the outcome. 'It was a very open match with plenty of chances at both ends and we have to be content with a point although we are disappointed to have conceded a soft goal. 'It will be a tough campaign as we rightly predicted that Wales would be in contention for an automatic place but I think we have it in us to do the job.'

"CLICK HERE to read the match report on Neymar's quite sensational performance. Brazil routed Japan in Singapore thanks to a quite magnificent individual performance from star striker and captain Neymar. The forward bagged all four of their goals - including a perfect hat-trick - in a 4-0 victory and he was brilliant throughout. For his first goal, Brazil's favourite son rounded the goalkeeper and slotted home, and then coolly passed one into the back of the net and completed his hat-trick with a rebound before heading in his fourth and final strike with just nine minutes remaining. Host commentator . Well that's all from me folks - but thanks for tuning in! CLICK HERE to read our match report on Neymar's brilliance. Words cannot actually describe how brilliant that performance was. Brazil were good in patches, but Neymar was just sensational. He contributes so much more than just his goals - and he managed to get four of those! Neymar scores all four of Brazil's goals - including a perfect hat-trick - in a thumping victory. A quite phenomenal display from the 22-year-old. He now has 40 international goals in just 58 games. Incredible, quite incredible. Brazil have been brilliant but Japan are still going and Muto bursts clear to force a corner. They cross the ball in but yet again it comes to nothing. Some people questioned him for Barca last season, but Neymar has proven on the international scene he is absolutely world class. Japan test Jefferson in the final moments, however, as Tanaka puts in a wicked cross and Okazaki nods it goalwards but it is tipped over. Japan are attacking and trying to find a consolation but the Brazilians are holding firm. To be fair, Gil and Miranda have been quietly impressive at the back as their captain has run Japan ragged up front. Brazil's countering has been phenomenal - as has Neymar. Kaka is reborn and he puts a wonderful cross with his left-foot and Neymar is at the back post to head past the helpless Kawashima. Wow - he is something special is Neymar. That's his hat-trick. Another blistering counter see Neymar cross the ball in and Kaka nod a header on to the bar. Coutinho then smashes a shot back in which the goalkeeper can only parry and Neymar is on hand to sweep it home. Robinho, Countinho, Neymar and Ribeiro are just dominating possession. They are more than happy just to pass the ball around and make the Japanese work to get it back. When they break, it is electric. Neymar uses his dazzling skills to bamboozle the Japanese defence before laying off Robinho, who slams a shot wide from the left-hand area of the box. He should do better. The second-half has seen Japan fade and they just cannot find a final ball into the box. The threat of Kobayashi has vanished and it looks like no way back for them at the moment. For a second Neymar thinks he is in behind again and in with a chance of getting his hat-trick after Filipe Luis smashes a free-kick forward. However, a late flag denies him the opportunity to bag a third. Japan are attacking well in spells but they cannot get the final pass away and Brazil are counter-attacking with serious pace. Countinho sprints with the ball, eventually it gets to Neymar and he plays it back to the Liverpool midfielder who curls his shot just wide of the far post. A blistering counter-attack from Brazil sees Neymar get the ball in the box and he jinks back before unleashing a wonderful shot just past the post and into the side netting. Ribeiro has been brilliant since he has come on. Neymar crosses in a dangerous corner and Miranda is completely un-marked in the box. He swivels on the ball and then smashes on straight at Kawashima who dives well to save it. It is turning into a bit of a stroll in the park for Brazil now. They are dominating possession and forcing Japan to commit fouls. Neymar whips in a free-kick which is headed back across goal by Gil but eventually cleared. Coutinho has barely been on the pitch for three minutes and he has provided a delightful assist. A lovely left-footed outside-of-the-foot pass through the middle splits open the Japan defence and Neymar coolly slots it past the advancing goalkeeper. Long way back now for Japan. Both sides make subs. Everton Ribiero ON, and Willian OFF for Brazil. For Japan, Honda is ON. Neymar's goal separates the sides at the break. Japan enjoy the last attack of the half as they get forward and win a corner. Shibasaki whips the ball in and a dangerous shot from Tanaka sees the ball put back in before Shiotani fires wide. Oscar fires in a free-kick from halfway inside the Japan half. The ball is flat and dips late, and Miranda is facing away from goal. He gets his head on the ball though and it floats over the bar. This has been a very interesting game so far. For all of Brazil's stars, Japan have looked very dangerous when they have attacked. Gil is struggling a little bit at the back for Brazil, and both Danilo and Luis Gustavo have been guilty of giving away unnecessary fouls. Japan are looking to counter and it seems like that will be their best way of causing Brazil regular problems. Sakai rushes down the right-hand side and whips a delicious cross into Kobayashi who gets in from of Danilo and glances a header past the far post. Lovely move. Neymar and Tardelli look very slick up front. In the match against Argentina, Tardelli scored twice but did very little else - here he is proving to be a perfect foil for Neymar but his lay-offs and hold-up play. Oscar is starting to look lively from midfield now too. The free-kick to Japan came to nothing but they have another one out wide. Tanaka fires a cross in and Tardelli can only half clear it before Shibasaku fires a poor shot over the bar from the edge of the area. Brazil deserve to be ahead but they must be wary of the Japanese here - they have some exciting attacking playrs with Tanaka and Co. The midfielder is causing all sorts of problems with his pace and trickery. And Japan's pressure forces Luis Gustavo to foul Kobayashi. Free-kick Japan in a dangerous position. Despite Neymar's brilliance, Japan have been dangerous too. And they almost net a wonderful goal through Kobayashi. A swift attack down the left sees the ball whipped into the box and the forward lashes a left-foot half-volley just over from 18 yards. He has started this game like a freight train and it really should be 2-0. Neymar strides past the Japan defence and lashes a fierce shot from the left-hand side of the area but it goes harmlessly past the goal. And Brazil after ahead - you guessed it, it's Neymar! A wonderful ball through the middle from Tardelli sets Neymar free and he coolly rounds the keeper to sweep it home. Brilliantly finished. Neymar runs with the ball again towards the Japan defence and, just as he gets in the box, he cuts back and tries to round Morishige. The defender is forced to drag him back and Brazil have a free-kick. The free-kick smashes the woodwork! So unlucky from Neymar, whose 20-yard effort got up and down almost perfectly. When he is at his best, there are few better players to watch on the ball than Neymar. The Brazilian forward picks up the ball on halfway and runs at the Japanese defence before being nudged over in the box. A bit soft so no penalty is awarded, which is the correct decision. The Japanese striker has started off in a lively manner and he is causing Danilo quite a few problems. Brazil are yet to really get into this game in the manner they would have liked. It's been an exciting start to the game and both Japan and Brazil have had chances. Neymar skipped past a few challenges early on and got close to the box but could not get his shot away. At the other end, Luis Gustavo put in a wonderful tackle to deny Japan. The excitement is building in Singapore as the teams take to the pitch for the national anthems. Neymar is out on the field and has completed his warm-up ahead of captaining his side once again. The Barcelona forward made some brilliant darting runs against Argentina and he will look to cause the Japanese defence all sorts of problems today. Japan beat Jamaica 1-0 in their previous friendly and most of their European-based stars have been rested. Seven of their starting line-up are based in Japan and Shinji Kagawa is among the big names to only make the bench.

"Tottenham Hotspur took to the training ground ahead of Thursday night's Europa League Group C clash with Greek outfit Asteras Tripolis. Mauricio Pochettino's men continued their preparations for matchday three of the competition at Tottenham's Training Centre complex in Enfield. Amid rumours Belgian defender Jan Vertonghen could  move away from the London club, Pochettino claimed the subject has never been discussed between the pair. Jan Vertonghen has been linked with a move away from Spurs but Mauricio Pochettino stressed the Belgian's importance to the club . Pochettino and Tottenham assistant head coach Jesus Perez look on during Wednesday morning's pre-Europa League training session . The Argentine hinted he may keep the defensive pairing of Younes Kaboul and Federico Fazio for their clash with Asteras on Thursday . '(Hearing) rumours and information and different situations... for me it’s easy I don’t read ever', the Argentine said. 'I know the players are affected and they call me about the rumours, but Jan is a very important player for Tottenham and for me.' On the possibility of the Belgian starting against Asteras on Thursday, Pochettino was honest: 'Kaboul and Fazio worked very hard here and are fresh and I give them the opportunity to play, but I haven’t changed my view on Jan. He is a very good player and a key player for us.' But with rumours surrounding Vertonghen's future at White Hart Lane the Spurs boss remained confident. 'He has four years on his contract. It’s a very long contract and he is happy inside. We have a very good relationship', he said. 'I never hear from Jan he wants to leave or change something. After (all) it is impossible to trust in other people than him because for me it is impossible when we have a chat inside my office. Jan never told me he wants to leave.

He is happy at Tottenham. Maybe sometimes he wants to play more but my decision is to take a decision. He is happy and I’m happy with him.' Spurs go into the game against Asteras at White Hart Lane after a demoralising 4-1 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday, despite some promising spells against the Premier League champions. Spurs have been equally underwhelming in Europe this season. They could only manage  a goalless draw at Partizan Belgrade in their opening Europa League match, and then dropped a further two points after a Demba Ba penalty saw them draw with Besiktas  earlier this month. Kane has played eight times in all competitions for Spurs this season and will be hoping to start on Thursday against Asteras . Roberto Soldado was given the nod by Pochettino against Manchester City on Saturday but his missed penalty did him no favours . Emmanuel Adebayor laughs during training but the forward has scored just one goal in eight appearances this season . Nabil Bentaleb, Kyle Walker and Kyle Naughton will all miss Thursday's clash through injury. Algeria midfielder Bentaleb picked up an ankle niggle on international duty, which ruled him out of the trip to Manchester City. Right back Walker remains absent after abdominal surgery while fellow full back Naughton is sidelined with an ankle injury.

"Lionel Messi and Neymar were able to take a pre-Clasico early cut against Ajax after scoring in a 3-1 win against the Dutch champions. With Saturday’s game looming large and Real Madrid still with Liverpool and the tail-end of hurricane Gonzalo to contend with, Barcelona took full advantage of playing the night before by taking off their two superstars midway through the second-half. It nearly back-fired in the closing stages as Ajax scrambled a late goal but a point would have been more than they deserved after the home side dominated the 90 minutes.

Young striker Ramirez (right) lashes home Barca's third goal against Ajax during their 3-1 Champions League victory on Tuesday . BARCELONA: Ter Stegen, Alves, Pique, Bartra, Alba, Rakitic, Mascherano, Iniesta (Rafinha 76), Pedro, Messi (El Haddadi 66), Neymar (Ramirez 61). Subs not used: Montoya, Xavi, Bravo, Samper. Goals: Neymar (8), Messi (24), Ramirez (90). Booking: Pedro (80). AJAX: Cillessen, Van Rhijn, Veltman, Moisander, Viergever, Andersen, Zimling (Riedewald 56), Klaassen, Schone, Sigthorsson (El Ghazi 73), Kishna (Milik 45). Subs not used: Duarte, Denswil, Boer, Menig. Goal: El Ghazi (88). Bookings: Veltman (32), Van Rhijn (69), Riedewald (90). REFEREE: William Collum (Scotland). On a night of goals galore in the Champions League the only surprise was that Barca had not put more distance between themselves and Ajax before Messi and Neymar were taken off, especially having opened their account so soon. They have had problems scoring early this season but they carved Ajax open on eight minutes when Pedro fed Messi who released Neymar before the Brazilian found the far corner of Jasper Cillessen’s goal. It was his sixth goal for club and country in a week. Messi could have doubled the lead on 11 minutes but shot over from the edge of the area. Ajax were open at the back and Barcelona were bright going forward, especially Pedro who was finally looking like a player who does not want to step aside and allow Luis Suarez to take his place. After a poor start to the season though, he may have left it late to stake that particular claim. Messi got the second on 25 minutes - running on to Andres Iniesta’s threaded pass. Cillessen got his hand to the shot but could not stop it crossing his line. It was his 69th goal in 89 Champions League games and it moved him to within two of Raul whose record breaking haul of 71 came in 144 games. The race to catch Raul could now be won by Cristiano Ronaldo who is also on 69 goals ahead of Wednesday’s game at Anfield. Messi released Pedro for what might easily have been the third on the half hour but the latter hit a post. Iniesta was the next to come agonisingly close, dribbling through the Ajax defence from Neymar’s pass only to be denied by Cillessen. It would have been the pick of the first-half goals and a corner, from which Barcelona rarely score, was scant reward for the brilliance. Ajax forced two corners late in the first-half, one blocked by Marc Bartra, the other by his central defensive partner Gerard Pique, who was also caught in possession on his own byline but recovered well to clear.

Messi resumed the goal hunt at the start of the second-half, scoring from Pedro’s saved shot only for an offside flag to rule the effort out. He then dribbled through Ajax’s six-yard box with mesmerizing close control, the ball never leaving his laces, defenders floundering, only for his shot to hit the side-netting. As the close control from Messi, Neymar and Alves reached new levels, Ajax’s defenders were made to look even more clumsy with Alves unceremoniously up-ended on the edge of the penalty area by Nick Viergever. On the hour they were at least spared further punishment from Neymar who was replaced by Sandro and Messi followed him five minutes later.

This was Luis Enrique showing who is boss, and Messi getting some extra rest ahead of Saturday’s Clasico. Ajax seemed to be breathing a little more easily after the changes and, with two minutes left, Anwar El Ghazi scored to make it 2-1 but before they could dare to dream of earning an undeserved point Sandro scored Barcelona's third.

"Instinct took over for James Rodriguez at Anfield. The Colombian superstar was left in a daze early on but it had nothing to do with his new multi-coloured boots. Instead, Real Madrid's Rodriguez suffered a nasty cut above his eye and was forced to change his shirt barely 15 minutes into the 3-0 win over Liverpool.

On 23 minutes, Rodriguez peeled away from his marker Alberto Moreno to find space in front of Liverpool's back four. The £60million man then played a sublime exchange with Cristiano Ronaldo. He expertly trapped the ball sumptuous one-touch control on his right, before splitting the defence with a deft flick with his left to return it into the path of his prolific team-mate, who duly buried it beyond a helpless Simon Mignolet.

"The Premier League could have five teams in the next season's Champions League after UEFA confirmed the top four and Europa League winner will qualify for Europe's elite competition. There was a suggestion the entry for the Champions League from England would be reduced to the top three and Europa League winner - making four - if Tottenham or Everton won the competition. But UEFA have told Sportsmail they will allow five teams to enter the Champions League if Mauricio Pochettino or Roberto Martinez's side are victorious. Everton will gain entry to the Champions League next season should they win the Europa League this term . Spurs will be keen to finish in the top four but have been given an extra route into the Champions League . Chelsea celebrate winning the Champions League in 2012, which denied Spurs a European Cup place . Emmanuel Adebayor on the final day against Fulham in 2012 - Spurs finished fourth but missed out on CL . Having each finished in the top four in the last decade, both Everton and Tottenham missed out after rival teams who failed to qualify via the Premier League went on to win the Champions League. In May a UEFA statement read: 'The Europa League winners could  gain direct access to the group stage, should the Champions League title-holders also qualify via their domestic league, thus freeing up a place in the Champions League group stage.' Everton, who had previously been tipped for relegation, enjoyed an incredible season to finish fourth in 2005 only for Merseyside rivals Liverpool to beat AC Milan on penalties in the Champions League after a stunning comeback from three goals down. UEFA decided that Liverpool, as winners, should not be denied a place in the competition and so both teams played in the following season's qualifying rounds. Everton, who had been tipped for relegation, finished in the top four after a stunning 2004/05 campaign . However, despite finishing fith, Liverpool won the Champions League and so both Merseyside team gained entry into the following season's competition . Everton's Duncan Ferguson celebrates only for his goal against Villarreal to be ruled out by Pierluigi Collina . While the Reds were eventually knocked out in the last 16 by Portuguese giants Benfica, Everton were unlucky to be beaten by Villarreal in the third qualifying round after Italian referee Pierluigi Collina ruled out a Duncan Ferguson header as the Spaniards went on to win 4-2 on aggregate before making it to the semi-finals. Meanwhile, in 2012, Tottenham were excluded from the Champions League, despite finishing fourth, because of Chelsea's triumph in the competition. Unlike the Toffees, the north London club went straight into the Europa League rather than being given entry to the Champions League qualifying rounds. After past disappointments, Everton and Tottenham will be desperate to take advantage of UEFA's recent ruling and make certain of their place on Europe's top table.","Europa League winners will gain entry to Champions League .

"Arsene Wenger admitted  on Thursday that Arsenal missed out on signing 'one more player' during the summer — something the Gunners boss will try to rectify in January. The Gunners are currently facing a severe injury crisis with nine players unavailable for Saturday's Premier League clash against Hull. But it is the defence that is most stretched with Laurent Koscielny (achilles), Mathieu Debuchy (ankle) and Calum Chambers (suspended) all missing. Arsene Wenger has vowed to strengthen his squad after missing out on 'one more player' in the summer . Speaking at Arsenal's Annual General Meeting, Wenger said: ‘I agree we could have bought one more player but we didn’t find one. ‘But we will try in January to rectify that because we are a bit short because of the injuries we've had.’ Here Sportsmail highlights seven of the defenders on Arsenal's scouting list. Matija Nastasic . Manchester City will sell the 21-year-old Serb and have strong interest from Juventus and Inter Milan but Arsenal have the ready cash. Valued at £12m, they may sell for less. Chances: 4/5 . Matija Nastasic has fallen out of favour at Manchester City and could be available for less than £12million . Virgil  van Dijk . Arsenal looked into the prospect of signing Van Dijk, 23, on transfer deadline day but couldn't get a deal over the line. The Celtic defender would fetch a fee of around £7m . Chances: 4/5 . Arsenal attempted to sign Virgil van Dijk on transfer deadline day but could not get a deal over the line . Stephane Sparagna . Age: 19 . Marseille defender can also play in defensive midfield which is ideal for Wenger’s plans. His contract runs out in December and he is available for nominal compensation should he leave. Chances: 3/5 . Stephane Sparagna can play also as a defensive midfielder and his versatility could appeal to Arsene Wenger . Ron Vlaar . Age: 29 . Aston Villa defender has yet to agree to a new contract and is free in the summer. Tottenham, Southampton and Manchester United are among others monitoring his situation. Chances: 3/5 . Ron Vlaar has been linked several clubs in recent weeks, including Tottenham and Manchester United . Winston Reid . Age: 26 . West Ham are hoping to open contract talks next week but the Kiwi looks set to see out his contract and leave on a free unless a deal can be struck. Not top of Arsenal list but an option. Chances: 2/5 . Winston Reid is out of contract in the summer and is an option for Arsenal, although he is not first choice . Liam Moore . Age: 21 . Leicester defender has been on Arsenal’s radar since he was a teenager and club scouts watched him last week playing for England Under 21. May not yet be at the club's desired level. Chances: 1/5 .

"With the European champions coming to town and giving Liverpool a lesson in a 3-0 defeat, fans at Anfield will have found it hard to take any positives home with them. Here's five things we've learnt about Liverpool from their Champions League struggles: . It might be time to give Rickie Lambert a go... Many thought a mouth-watering tie against the Champions League holders might be the sort of occasion that would get Mario Balotelli performing to his potential. Instead, the enigmatic Italian attempted just 17 passes and had zero shots on target before being hooked at half-time after swapping shirts with Pepe. It was always going to be a tough evening for the 24-year-old as a lone striker, but he wasted any promising moves started by his team-mates and his hold-up play was non-existent. Maybe it’s time to give Rickie Lambert a run in the side. He would at least look interested if nothing else. Mario Balotelli warms up alongside Rickie Lambert - Daniel Sturridge is still missing through injury . Balotelli underwhelmed in the first half and was hauled off by Brendan Rodgers at half time . Liverpool's centre back pairing just isn't working . The Anfield club’s first-choice centre backs Dejan Lovren and Martin Skrtel are undeniably strong in the air, but the pair look too similar to form an effective partnership on the deck. Both are aggressive and their tendency to dive into tackles leaves huge holes in and behind Liverpool’s back line. In the Premier League Liverpool play a high defensive line, which often allows opposition attackers a clear run on goal when the centre backs have committed themselves. They tried to compensate for this against Real Madrid’s myriad of attacking talent by playing deeper, but neither Skrtel nor Lovren looked comfortable in a more passive, covering role and Ronaldo and Co ran rings around them. Dejan Lovren and Martin Skrtel are very similar in style and haven't gelled well at the back for Liverpool . Three points from three games leave hopes hanging by a thread . The atmosphere at Anfield before kick-off may have been as electric as ever, but at the moment it’s the only thing that remains from Liverpool’s European glory days – besides Steven Gerrard, of course. Granted, they were playing the Champions League holders on Wednesday night but the Galacticos had never so much as scored against the Merseyside club before, let alone beaten them. This time it was emphatic - Liverpool's first ever home European defeat by three goals. Then there was the 1-0 defeat at Basel earlier in the month, as well as the laboured victory over Ludogorets in September. They’re halfway through the group stage and Liverpool’s Champions League status is already hanging by a thread – probably not the return to the big stage Gerrard had in mind. Steven Gerrard has been around for some of Liverpool's greatest European nights - this wasn't one . The Kop were in fine voice to begin with but were silenced by Real Madrid's first-half show of strength . The opening 22 minutes looked strong, but they tired . Liverpool were long odds to beat Madrid before the match, and understandably so, but their performance in the first 22 minutes may have had the bookies squirming in their seats. The Reds made an excellent start and surged into Real’s penalty box on numerous occasions, but Cristiano Ronaldo’s opener knocked them for six and they looked too exhausted to claw their way back into the game. Clearly, Sunday’s hard-fought win over QPR took a lot out of them – eight of the starting XI at Loftus Road began the match with Carlo Ancelotti’s side. Liverpool set about re-investing the money from Luis Suarez’s transfer in numerous players after it was adjudged that the size of their squad would not allow them to compete effectively in four competitions this season. However, the foreign signings are struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality of the English game, and it’s now clear how invaluable a player with the work-rate and engine of  Suarez really is. Philippe Coutinho was a key part of a strong start from Liverpool but they suffered later on . Raheem Sterling was among eight players to start here and at QPR in a 3-2 win on Sunday . A return to Europe's top table might have come too soon . Has the Champions League come too soon for Liverpool? It’s what the club and the fans were desperate for during their three-year absence from the competition, but their demolition by Real Madrid showed just how far off the pace they are. In order to bridge the gap between them and the current European big guns, they will need to re-establish themselves as a Champions League club and put together a long run in the competition, giving them the opportunity to build the level of squad required. However, with a decent run in this year’s tournament looking unlikely and their Premier League form shaky, Liverpool’s return to the Champions League might be their last appearance in the competition for some time. Liverpool have won five European Cups but perhaps their return to this competition came too soon? Cristiano Ronaldo was the star of the show and his world-class ability made it tough for Liverpool .","Rickie Lambert could be an option to replace disappointing Mario Balotelli .
Dejan Lovren and Martin Skrtel seem too similar at the back as a pair .
Their Champions League hopes are hanging by a thread now .

The 19-year-old burst on the scene under former boss David Moyes last season but has found himself on the fringes so far this term under Louis van Gaal. After five substitute appearances in the league, Januzaj was handed a chance to impress the Dutchman in his favoured No 10 role as he started alongside Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria in attack.

"Sunderland skipper John O'Shea has urged his team-mates to pay back the club's fans in the best way possible - by beating Arsenal on Saturday. The Black Cats players this week offered to refund the cost of tickets for supporters who made the trip to Southampton last weekend and witnessed a humiliating 8-0 Barclays Premier League defeat. However, the 33-year-old O'Shea knows victory against the Gunners would do even more to repair the damage. John O'Shea (above) wants Suderland to hit back from 8-0 Southampton defeat with a win against Arsenal . He told the Journal: ""Three points is the biggest thing we need to give everyone - fans, ourselves and the staff. Ultimately, you have to confine that to a one-off. ""Whatever team we were playing this weekend, we need to see what we had been seeing previously - intensity in our play, putting pressure on teams and stopping them playing. ""Arsenal are a good team, they'll have spells where they're going to have the ball. But we need to put them under pressure, particularly when they've got a few injuries at the back and a midweek Champions League game. Let's see if we can use that to our advantage. ""In terms of how the season had been going, that result was a big disappointment for the manager. Obviously he's spoken to us and that will remain in-house. But hopefully there'll be a reaction on Saturday and in the games coming up."" Sunderland were humiliated 8-0 by Southampton last Saturday, and players refunded the fans' ticket price . Sunderland manager Gus Poyet (above) has led the inquisition this week into how his team got thrashed . Head coach Gus Poyet and his squad tackled the grisly task of analysing just what went wrong at the St Mary's Stadium on Tuesday and ensuring it was a one-off. O'Shea admitted: ""It's been very raw. It's happened. You analyse everything and you have to make sure the level of intensity and tempo is maintained every week in the Premier League. ""It doesn't matter who you're playing against. We had maintained that up until Southampton. That was the disappointing aspect.""","Sunderland skipper John O'Shea demands three points against Arsenal .

"Cristiano Ronaldo has redefined the notion of 'world class', energising the tired term and catapulting it to a far higher plain. He has reinvented the manner in which we digest football numbers. Ronaldo has – albeit with the aid of Lionel Messi – driven back the boundaries of footballing capability. Cristiano Ronaldo is full of energy despite the rough weather during Real Madrid's training session at Anfield . The Portuguese star shows off some of his skills as Real gear up for their seismic clash with Liverpool . Raheem Sterling gets a handshake from Mario Balotelli (left) during Liverpool's run-out at Anfield . The Liverpool forwards showcases his trademark quick feet during the training session . Ronaldo (left), like Raheem Sterling, burst onto the Premier League scene at 19 years of age . On Wednesday night, the Real Madrid superstar – with 271 goals in 258 games for Los Blancos - comes up against another player – 10 years his junior - who is fast changing the criteria by which we judge emerging talent. At 19 years of age, Liverpool starlet Raheem Sterling is already the subject of national obsession within these shores, evidenced no less by the recent 'tiredgate' furore. Watch him on a football pitch, however, and it is easy to see why there is a fixation with his development. But can Sterling, like Ronaldo, take his potential and turn it into goals and assists, goals and assists, season after season, season after season? Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has netted  271 times in 258 games for Los Blancos . Ronaldo proudly holds up the 2014 Ballon D'Or award before Real's game against Granada CF . Ronaldo was once labelled a 'skinny kid' during his time at United but has since developed into a top athlete . After all, the England forward once said: 'I really look up to Cristiano Ronaldo, he is someone that has always been an idol to me. 'I try not to put pressure on myself, but I'm looking to improve my goals-to-game ratio and try to chip in more for the team. 'If I am not scoring I need to be assisting and making goals which is a massive part of my game which I need to improve on really. That is my main aim this season to get that goals-per-game ratio up.' Here, ahead of the Champions League showdown at Anfield, Sportsmail compares Sterling to a rookie Ronaldo during his early years at Manchester United… . Sterling, six weeks shy of his 20th birthday, has already made 68 Premier League appearances . Sterling's strength belies his diminutive size and here he holds off QPR midfielder Leroy Fer . Sterling's shooting accuracy (56.9 per cent) is vastly superior to Ronaldo (41.7 per cent) at the same age . Ronaldo (left) has, albeit with the aid of Lionel Messi, driven back the boundaries of footballing capability . Style . At 19, Ronaldo was all scissor-turns and step-overs. He still is, of course, only now he invariably sticks the ball in the back of the net after such pageantry. Sterling is already more direct, the tricks and flicks which characterised his game at 17 having made way for a more instinctive approach. Both, of course, catch the eye with what is an increasingly rare ability to weave between defenders, leaving opponents in their wake and so exciting observers. Stature . Don't forget, Ronaldo was once a 'skinny kid'. Only later did he develop the world's most recognisable – and muscle bound – torso. At 19 there was accusation that he toppled too easily and suspicion remained about his suitability for the Premier League. Sterling's strength belies his diminutive size and it is said he has few rivals when it comes to bench-pressing in the gym at Melwood. Opponents bounce off him in often comical fashion having under-estimated his power. Mentality . Ronaldo in action for United against Arsenal in 2004 . Roy Keane spoke glowingly of a teenage Ronaldo's mindest and attitude in his recent book. And it is that focus and determination which has allowed him to maximise his abilities. Forget physical attributes, it is – and always has been – Ronaldo's mental strength which tears him apart from the rest. Sterling, of course, has not been without his off-field distractions. They can be forgiven for one so young, but failure to learn from such will only hinder his progress on the pitch. How badly he wants to emulate the achievements of Ronaldo will ultimately determine his success. The Numbers . And so to the stats. Sterling, six weeks shy of his 20th birthday, has already made 68 Premier League appearances. Ronaldo was still 20, but a little older, by the time he reached that mark. But this, we feel, is fair ground for comparison… . Goals . Ronaldo 9 Sterling 14 . The Liverpool forward returned an impressive nine last season and already has three from five this time around. Ronaldo, meanwhile, made a slower start in front of the posts and only managed a total of nine during his first two campaigns. Shot conversion rate . Ronaldo 6% Sterling 19.4% . Ronaldo loves to shoot, he always has. But 10 years ago a staggering 94 per cent of his efforts failed to go in. Sterling fares far better, one in five of his strikes locating the back of the net. Even Sterling's shooting accuracy (56.9 per cent), outdoes Ronaldo (41.7 per cent). Assists (chances created) Ronaldo 8 (90) Sterling 9 (112) Sterling edges the goal assists by one, but perhaps he should look to his Liverpool team-mates for reason as to why that figure is not higher having laid on 112 chances. Dribbles completed . Ronaldo 182 Sterling 165 . What makes the pair so exciting is their willingness to get at opponents and Ronaldo boasts slightly better numbers in this respect. Sterling edges a young Ronaldo in goal assists . Win percentage . Ronaldo 58.8% Sterling 55.9% . Football, of course, is ultimately about winning matches. And it is Ronaldo who helped Manchester United to more victories during his early years, although only just. Verdict . The raw numbers have Sterling slightly ahead of Ronaldo at this juvenile juncture. But what the Portugal forward has gone on to achieve is sensational. He has, as alluded to at the top, reformulated football. Sterling can have no better role model, no better target to chase down. On Wednesday night, at Anfield, his idol becomes an adversary - there is no better stage for the boy to outshine the man he one day wishes to emulate.","Ahead of Champions League showdown at Anfield, Sportsmail compares Sterling to a rookie Ronaldo during his early years at Manchester United… .

"A priceless 700-year-old Bible 'dictionary' which gives a unique insight into the way nuns lived has gone on display for the first time. The Expositiones Vocabulorum Biblie by the 12th century clergyman William Brito - sometimes known as Guillaume le Breton - is written entirely in Latin. It is one of the few monastic documents which is still in its original location after surviving the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII in the 1530s, where the monarch disbanded monasteries, priories, convents and friaries in England, Wales and Ireland, and seized their assets and income. Artefact: A 14th century copy of an early Bible dictionary is one of very few monastic books to have survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII in the 1530s . Many treasures were lost under Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. The book has gone on display for the very first time and has been at the abbey for over 700 years . The hand written parchment book is thought to have helped nuns decipher parts of the Bible and contains explanations and the origins of difficult words. It is now on display at Lacock Abbey, Wiltshire, where the nuns lived, after it was recently bought in an auction by the National Trust. Sonia Jones, house and collections manager at Lacock, said the 14th century book gave an insight into how the nuns lived during their time in the abbey. She said: 'We know little about the everyday lives of the nuns at Lacock Abbey. Remnant: The book is a priceless survivor from the days when the nuns lived at Lacock Abbey in Wiltshre . Living history: The front cover of the 700-year-old hand written manuscript Bible dictionary . Written in Latin, it was part of the abbey library and even has earlier 13th century financial accounts of the abbey pasted into the binding . 'This one book gives us a remarkable rare glimpse, a short glance into how they might have lived their lives. 'It tells us that they studied the Bible closely and most would have been literate. 'There is scrap parchment in the bindings which are part of the accounts of the abbey, recycled when the book was bound. 'Those fragments let us see just a little of some of the business side of the abbey, selling wool to provide an income. 'It is a special and important book, . but to have it in Lacock and to be able to put it on display in the . abbey, in its original home is simply priceless.' Craftsmanship: A clasp mark on the book, which has a wooden cover . Treasure: The book was recently bought in an auction by the National Trust . It is also not known whether books such as the dictionary were ever written at Lacock or where this copy was laboriously hand written elsewhere. The book was already known to the Trust and had passed down through generations of the Talbot family who lived at the abbey. It was put up for sale and was bought by the National Trust at auction at Christie's.

"Lotus have confirmed they are to run Mercedes power units from 2015. The long-term supply arrangement comes as no surprise as Lotus have long been linked with a switch to Mercedes. The deal brings to an end a long-standing agreement with Renault, who recently made clear Red Bull were their number one team, effectively pushing Lotus to one side. As Lotus have struggled badly on track this season, partly via design faults and partly by being let down by the Renault power units, they will be hoping for a change in fortune next season. Formula One team Lotus have announced that, from next year, they will use Mercedes-Benz power units . With the contract announced ahead of this weekend's inaugural Russian Grand Prix, Lotus CEO Matthew Carter said: 'We are pleased to have been chosen by Mercedes AMG High-Performance Powertrains in a significant long-term deal. 'We intend to return to the front of the field with the goals of winning grands prix and being a strong championship contender once more, and we see this new agreement as one step towards this aim. 'The Mercedes-Benz power unit has shown good performance on track and it is our goal to marry this motive force to Enstone's chassis expertise. 'It is our desire that the new car heralds a new era of success for Enstone.' Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff said the deal was 'strategically important for Mercedes-Benz' The agreement means Mercedes will again be supplying three teams in 2015 - Williams, Force India, along with Lotus - as well as running their own works programme. For Mercedes, Lotus replace McLaren as the Woking-based marque return to Honda, with the Japanese manufacturing giant back in F1 for the first time in seven years. Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff said: 'It was strategically important for Mercedes-Benz to continue to supply three customers throughout this generation of power unit, in addition to the primary focus on our Silver Arrows works team. Lotus, ending their relationship with Renault, will take McLaren's place as Mercedes' customer . 'It was therefore clear we would be looking for a new customer from 2015. 'Lotus F1 Team is an impressive organisation that has delivered competitive on-track performances in recent seasons. 'We are pleased to welcome them to the Mercedes-Benz family and look forward to building a productive  working relationship in the years ahead.'","Lotus Formula One team will use Mercedes power units from 2015 .

"The Formula One teams are currently embroiled in a bitter internal dispute as to the way forward regarding engines. Following the introduction for this season of the 1.6-litre turbo-charged power units, Mercedes have thoroughly dominated, claiming 15 of 16 poles, 13 race wins and nine one-twos. In the constructors' championship, four of the top-six teams boast Mercedes' power, whilst in the drivers' campaign, eight of the top 11 have the German manufacturing giant behind them. Mercedes race to another one-two at the Russian Grand Prix after dominating the sport this campaign . Mercedes drivers Nico Rosberg (L) and Lewis Hamilton have won 13 of 16 races between them . It is why Mercedes are determined to block a requested unfreezing of the current regulations that would allow Ferrari and Renault to make gains and potentially close the gap. A vote is to be taken at a forthcoming F1 Commission meeting, in which all 11 teams will be present, along with F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, the FIA and race promoters, with unanimity required for any changes to come into force. Mercedes and their customers - Williams, Force India, and from next year, Lotus - are unwilling to co-operate. Determined Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff said: 'F1 needs stability. 'It's very easy coming from a position of force where we say our power unit is clearly the most competitive at the moment and then just block everything. But this is not the approach we have. Mercedes chief Toto Wolff (R) is understandably against changing the rules to allow rivals to close the gap . 'We have rules and we have governance, and the governance is in place in order to avoid quick, knee-jerk decisions being made that upset stability, upset the commercial set-up. 'I strongly believe you cannot change rules in October for the following year just because you think they don't suit you.' Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, whose team enjoyed four years of title-winning success with Renault up until this season, feels Mercedes should 'not be afraid of competition'. Horner appreciates an unfreeze could even prove beneficial to Mercedes as there is the possibility of them developing a more powerful engine. However, Horner feels Renault and Ferrari should at least be given an opportunity to level the playing field, otherwise Mercedes will be virtually unbeatable again in 2015. 'Mercedes are doing a super job,' said Horner. Red Bull boss Christian Horner (R) wants to level the playing field or face 'stagnation' in the sport . 'But it is healthy for F1 that Ferrari, Honda (who return in 2015 as supplier to McLaren) and Renault should have the ability to close the gap otherwise we are going to end up in a very stagnant position. 'It is a bigger issue than just about the teams. It is about what is right for the sport, what is right for the fans. 'It is easy to take a self-interest position, but when you look at what is the right thing for F1, it is to have competition. 'We need to be big enough to say let's open it a little bit and let's be responsible on costs - so there is no cost impact for customer teams - but have that competition. 'So we'll see what the outcome of the Formula One Commission vote is. 'FIA are in support, FOM are in support. Obviously the non-Mercedes teams are in support, so we'll see what that holds in approximately a month's time.' F1 supremo, pictured with Sebastian Vettel (L), will attend the F1 Commission to decide on changes . From Ferrari's perspective, team principal Marco Mattiacci said: 'Thinking of frozen engines, this is not Formula One. 'So I agree with Christian. Now we have the majority of the votes to move ahead on the idea to unfreeze the engine. 'Let's see what's going to happen during the F1 Commission meeting.'","Mercedes have dominated  after switch to 1.6L turbo-charged engines .

"Virgil van Dijk is a 23-year-old Dutch centre back who plays his football for Celtic. He’s been extensively scouted by a host of top English clubs. What’s his pedigree?

"Alex Jones is in no doubt: stepping on to the Strictly dancefloor is guaranteed to give you sweaty palms and a racing heart. ‘Being on that dancefloor on Saturday night in front of the studio audience is one of the most terrifying things I’ve ever done,’ she says. And it doesn’t seem to get any easier. Several weeks into the competition, and despite talking to Weekend fresh from performing a beautifully executed waltz that won praise from the judges, she’s still full of trepidation. ‘It was lovely to get some good comments but as soon as we go back to Latin I predict a dip.’ Her anxiety is understandable: The One Show presenter performed a distinctly underwhelming cha cha cha with her dance partner, James Jordan, on her first week on the show. Golden couple: One Show co-hosts Matt Baker, 33, and Alex Jones, 34 . ‘It was a disaster,’ she says. ‘I was like a rabbit caught in headlights. I had to have a word with myself afterwards and say, “Alex, get a grip.”’ Like many Strictly competitors, the 34- year-old is only just realising the extent to which Strictly requires not only physical but also emotional dedication. ‘People warn you how tough it is,’ she says. ‘Matt said, “It’ll take over your life.” But until you do it you have no idea how much.’ Matt, of course, is her 33-year-old One Show co-host Matt Baker, a graduate of the Strictly class of 2010. He reached the final and is proving a sounding-board, advice guru and potential partner to practise with. It is, Alex says, ‘only a matter of time’ before he squires her around the One Show studio. In fact, watching her co-host go through his Strictly paces last year was the main spur to taking part. ‘I always said if I was ever going to do that type of show, it’d be Strictly. Matt’s experience sealed the deal. I knew how much he’d enjoyed it. I also thought, “It’s good for our show, for our relationship.”’ Ah yes, their relationship. It’s nearly a year now since Matt joined Alex on The One Show, after their predecessors Christine Bleakley and Adrian Chiles’s muchpublicised (some would say catastrophic) move to ITV to launch Daybreak. On screen chemistry: Matt and Alex on The One Show . The onscreen chemistry between Christine and Adrian had set tongues wagging – though both denied an affair – and helped take The One Show to great heights, attracting audiences of more than five million. By 2009, however, viewing figures were dwindling, dropping below four million. A combined pay packet of £10million was too good to turn down, and Christine and Adrian finally jumped ship to ITV. For that sort of money, ITV must have been expecting TV gold – instead they got Daybreak, which is currently pulling in just 700,000 viewers, less than half the audience of its rival, BBC Breakfast. It hasn’t all been plain sailing at The One Show, either. When Alex, then a presenter on Welsh language channel S4C, was announced as the new female host she was dubbed a ‘Christine clone’ who lacked experience. Her male co-presenter, Jason Manford, meanwhile, resigned after just a few months after confessing to dubious online chats behind his wife’s back, and was replaced by Matt. And in September, more than 400 viewers complained about the behaviour of a dog trainer who appeared on the show, claiming he had been too aggressive towards a Jack Russell. But ratings these days are buoyant, averaging five million, and the Christine and Adrian era seems a distant memory. ‘It’s definitely been a rocky time but now it feels really secure, really solid,’ says Matt. Alex adds, ‘It seems to have just worked. And you can’t force that – if you try too hard it’s just awful. We wanted it to come naturally, especially as in the past the show has had a turbulent ride. Now it’s, well, settled.’ So settled, in fact, that guests are often struck by how laid-back they are on set – it’s been remarked that they come across like a happily married couple. ‘We’re always chatting away so it’d be quite easy for us to go on air without realising,’ says Matt. ‘Des O’Connor came on and he said, “Well, you two are incredibly relaxed; you just seem to be making this up.” We’re not but I guess it can appear like that.’ But for his part, he likes the show best when they’re doing something gritty. ‘We did some stuff with the riots that I was really proud of,’ he says. ‘We had a lot of victims who came on, we’d gone out on to the street to find them and I’d like to do more of that kind of reporting.’ Matt with Aliona Vilani last year (left) and Alex with her Strictly partner, James Jordan in the current BBC series (right) Matt is also doing his best to calm his . co-host’s nerves on the dancefloor. Alex admits she was left downhearted . by her first performance, labelled ‘starchy’ by judge Craig Revel . Horwood. ‘I felt a bit defeated before we got anywhere near the studio,’ she admits. ‘I remember James saying, “Pat my shoulder when you hear the strongest beat in the bar,” at our first meeting, and I couldn’t do it. He said, “Oh, God,” and I thought, “This is terrible.” Later, James admitted he was horrified when he saw me dancing because he didn’t think I’d be that bad. He said, “Just ask Matt – he’ll show you how to do it.”’ Matt certainly had natural flair, but he’s so busy with a new challenge now that he has little time for dance coaching: as you read this he is in training for Children In Need – he’s going to ride a rickshaw from Edinburgh to London with a different passenger for each leg of the journey. Today, he is sore after months in the saddle, yet still says, ‘I probably haven’t done enough preparation.’ At least he’s not expected to do the cycling wearing little more than two tiny pieces of cloth held together by dental floss, like Strictly’s female competitors. ‘Yes, I’ve worn more coming out of the shower than I did on the launch show, I felt completely naked,’ confesses Alex. ‘But people like to see you being a bit different.’ She’s only worried about impressing one . man, anyway – a chap she’ll name only as Charlie, who she met through a . friend and has been dating for the past five months. ‘He’s lovely. He’s . from New Zealand and wasn’t aware of The One Show when we met. It’s . going well, but he has nothing to do with the media, so I don’t want to . say too much, to save him embarrassment with his friends and . colleagues.’ You can understand her caution, having already seen the break-up of two long-term relationships, both with television types: shortly before she started on The One Show in August last year, her relationship with her boyfriend of seven years, presenter Matt Johnson, ended, while before that she had dated Steve Jones, front man on the US X Factor, for three years. It can’t be easy, of course, watching your beloved entwined with someone else. Some of the moves in Strictly are so steamy they should be X-rated. ‘I don’t envy anybody’s partner,’ Alex admits. ‘But Charlie said to me, “If I even have a hint that you’re worrying about what I think, I’ll be really annoyed.”’ Matt had the same conversation with his physiotherapist wife Nicola, 33, mother of his two children, Luke, four, and two-year-old Molly. ‘Nicola was brilliant,’ he says. ‘She said at the start, “If you’re not going to give it everything, don’t bother doing it at all.”’ Alex describes reporting for her One Show duties each evening following Strictly rehearsals as ‘like putting on a comfy pair of shoes. At the moment it’s a lovely contrast.’ The word ‘contrast’ is just the prompt her co-host needs for a spot of mickey-taking. ‘When you take part in Strictly, you get more and more tanned as the weeks go by. So I’ve asked the producers to introduce a split-screen format,’ he says. ‘That way we can just lower the contrast slightly on Alex’sside, for equilibrium.’ Equilibrium, of course, being a cherished asset on The One Show these days – one that its presenters are, no doubt, praying will last.

"The mother of two toddlers who drowned in a friend's pool while she slept inside was arrested yesterday after a four-month investigation in La Mesa, San Diego. Tassie Behrens, 26, faces charges of felony child abuse, being under the influence of drugs and possession of marijuana for sale, and is expected to be booked into Las Colinas jail, UT San Diego reported. The children, two-year-old Jason Bradford and his 16-month-old sister, Harley, were found floating in the pool of a La Mesa rental home on May 13. Harley and Jason Bradford (pictured) died in May after being found floating in a pool of a Le Mesa, California, home . The children's mother, Tassie Anne Behrens, 26, was asleep when her two toddlers ended up in the pool . Behrens told investigators her son . Jason woke her up that morning at 8am to ask for his sister Harley, but . she allegedly went back to sleep. The mother then found both children floating face down at 9:45am and Harley was pronounced dead just before 10.30am. Jason lived for another 13 hours before succumbing to his injuries. Behrens and a male friend who lived at the  house took the children to La Mesa Fire Station 13 (about 15 minutes away), where paramedics tried to revive the toddlers. Firefighters at the station were . unable to revive the toddlers, and they were rushed to Sharp Grossmont . Hospital, where Harley was pronounced dead at 10.27am. Her brother was . transferred to Rady Children's Hospital, where he died at 11.25pm. Tassie Behrens (pictured with her daughter Harley) faces charges of child abuse, being under the influence of drugs and possession of marijuana . Stressed: Behrens wrote on her Facebook page about her struggles of raising two young children on her own . Behrens . later told detectives that the reason she did not call 911 but rather . chose to drive her dying children to a fire station is because she did . not want to get her friend in trouble for failing to install a fence . around the pool, according to Lt. Glenn Giannantonio. Sherrif's . deputies later around 60 marijuana plants growing at the home and a . resident Larry Dangelo, 44, was arrested on drug charges and suspicion . of running the marijuana-growing operation out of the basement at the . house. The 26-year-old mother initially lied to officials by saying that the children were found in a pool in a Spring Valley mobile home park, but later admitted that they were discovered at the Le Mesa home. At least 60 marijuana plants and drug-making equipment were seized by members of the regional Narcotics Task Force. Court records obtained by the paper show Dangelo has a criminal record dating back to 2000, which included 18 charges ranging from forgery of documents to burglary. He pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree burglary and was sentenced to three years' probation after spending a years in jail. Arrested: Larry D'Angelo was led away from his home in handcuffs after being questioned by police about the marijuana plants in his house . The mother of the two children told authorities she had been asleep and woke up to find the two children unconscious in the pool . Detectives do not believe that Dangelo was the person who accompanied Behrens as she drove her children to the fire station. Behrens' male friend lives in a trailer on the property surrounding the million-dollar Sunset Avenue rental home. Posts on Behrens' Facebook page paint a portrait of a young woman who had been struggling with the responsibilities of raising two children on her own, especially while recovering from a broken ankle in April. 'This is so crazy chasing after 2 babies when I cannot even walk on my own,' she wrote April 13. 'At least I can take cast on and off.If anyone feels like helping me by giving me a break from chasing kids around feel free to message me.lol' In a message posted a day earlier, the 26-year-old lamented that no one offered her a helping hand, and she has vowed to do 'absolutely everything' on her own. 'Its [sic]only me n[sic] my two babies. the loves of my life,' Behrens wrote. Stash: All of these marijuana plants were found in Larry D'Angelo's home and taken away by narcotics division .

"At the Buddhist monastery in Darjeeling, the ancient Tibetan monk lit a fragrant stick and sprinkled herbs into a phial of holy water. His rumbling mantra sounded like a stream running over a bed of pebbles. 'Drink,' said Naresh, our Nepalese guide. The priest poured liquid into my cupped palms. I swallowed the brackish concoction and grimaced. 'He says there is too much going on in your head.' He was right. My head had been spinning and after a week of no sleep and rampaging blood pressure, my friend Ana persuaded me to seek holy help. The problem, I thought, was to do with high altitude and a lack of wine with dinner. The high life: The Buddhist Druk monastery sits atop a hillside in Darjeeling . But I left the Druk monastery with a spring in my stride and marched up the steep slope to Chowrasta Square to see the chemist. It was the first time I hadn't had to stop and catch my breath. 'I can't believe this,' he said, as he put his stethoscope away and handed me a handwritten bill for 23p. 'Last night your blood pressure was 160 over 130, now it's normal.' Little surprise, perhaps, in an area famous for levitating Tibetan magi. I strode up the Nehru road to the Mahakal Hindu temple at the top of Observatory Hill, past the beggars and monkeys, the prayer bells and flags. Below me, the verdant Himalayan foothills. Back at the verandah of the Elgin hotel, we watched the sun slide slowly behind the ridge of Ghoom. Then the clouds parted to reveal the snowcapped summit of Kanchenjunga. Tea time: A picker at work in the fields . The world's third-highest mountain was bathed in golden light as Sanjit the waiter arrived with a chilled bottle of Kingfisher. I was, at last, at one with this strange new world. The great tea town of Darjeeling is perched 7,000 ft up in the Indian sector of the Himalayan foothills and still has splendid remnants of the last days of the Raj. The Elgin was built in 1887 as a summer retreat for the Maharaja of Cooch Behar and is a living celebration of a bygone era, when Darjeeling was Queen of the Hill Stations. Here the top brass from British India retreated en masse during the summer from Calcutta. It still oozes Edwardian opulence. More than can be said for the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, which grinds its way up and down to Kurseong (and all the way to the plains of Siliguri, once the line is fixed). We went up to Ghoom, to the railway museum and the Choling monastery, where we spun the prayer wheels, passing within feet of rickety stalls selling fish, meat, mangoes and vegetables. The 2ft-guage 'toy train' is a World Heritage choo-choo and has been wheezing its way from the plains into the foothills, to its 7,500-ft high point, since 1881. From its carriages you get a glimpse into local life, as it weaves between beasts, shacks and people. At Darjeeling's Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, I couldn't resist touching the Union flag planted by Sir Edmund Hillary on the summit of Everest 61 years ago. You can see the kit they wore — Sherpa Tenzing's crampons look like medieval torture implements. It is a moving celebration of man's insuperable instinct to conquer. Bygone era: The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway grinds its way  down to Kurseong . The potholed roads here require a local driver and short journeys can take a long time. One of the high points was a 30-mile drive to Kalimpong, on the Silk Route between India and China. Lover's Point commands views into Sikkim and Western Bengal, across the valley where the rivers Teesta and Rangit join before flowing into the Ganges. Tea is, of course, the main business and we visited Happy Valley, suppliers to Harrods, and the Tukvar Tea Estate, where 1,500 women pluck the delicate leaves and stamens to make the white, black, green and oolong teas that command high prices around the world. The finest grow above 4,000 feet. Finest selection: Women carry their baskets through the fields of tea in Happy Valley . No trip to the hill stations would be complete without at least one night in the old capital of Calcutta. The driver dropped us in front of Mother Teresa's house, where the Missionaries of Charity carry out their work. Nearby is the Marble Palace, a treasure trove of Western art boasting Rubens, Reynolds, Titian, Murillo and a 10ft statue of Queen Victoria. We retreated to the air-conditioned splendour of the Taj Bengal hotel, where a tea wallah served up another wonderful brew. 'I have fallen in love,' said Ana. I knew exactly what she meant.

"Sam Allardyce has warned his West Ham side that their recent impressive form does not protect them from being dropped when key players return from injury. Mark Noble is set to be available for selection for the weekend trip to Burnley as the influential midfielder recovers from a calf problem. Skipper Kevin Nolan is still working his way back to full fitness following a dislocated shoulder and club-record signing Andy Carroll is closing in on a return after undergoing ankle surgery in pre-season. Sam Allardyce has fired out a warning to his in-form West Ham side that their places aren't guaranteed . Matt Jarvis and James Collins have also been sidelined with niggling problems but, even in the absence of such talent, the Hammers have impressed in the early stages of the season and sit seventh in the Barclays Premier League table. Allardyce is ready to welcome the selection headache he will be presented with when he is able to select from a fully-fit squad, as those who have thrived in previous weeks will have to maintain that level to stay in the side. 'I don't know whether it's a given or not,' Allardyce said, when asked if his injured players would come straight back in. Stiker Diafra Sakho rises to head home against QPR in West Ham's 2-0 victory earlier this month . 'The sooner you get all your players fit the bigger decisions you have to make as a manager. That puts you in a better position, even though those decisions are big ones, because you are going to start disappointing players on a more regular basis. 'The challenge for me is to make sure I pick the right team and formation in the game and how you are going to play against the opposition. 'When you have a full squad to choose from then you have to make big decisions and you have to disappoint people if they are all fit. That's what they have to accept. Experienced attacking midfielder Kevin Nolan is nearing a return to fitness . 'If we all want to do better - even though you are disappointed if you aren't selected - then you have to accept it and wait for your time to go in and make sure you play at your best so it's very difficult for me to leave you out.' Despite wins over QPR, Liverpool and Crystal Palace, West Ham are yet to record successive Premier League wins this season and it is consistency that Allardyce is hoping will come in time - starting at Turf Moor against newly-promoted Burnley. 'I just want to see on Saturday if the players have the mentality to show the same consistency as they have and whether they have got the right desire and determination to win back-to-back football matches for the first time this season,' he said. Playmaker Mark Noble (right) is available for the trip to Burnley this weekend . 'That is their first test against a Burnley side that are undoubtedly well-organised and make things very difficult, even if they have not won a game yet.

"Details surrounding JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald's ex-wife have emerged from the first time after she has spent the past half-century hiding from the public eye. Marina Porter, now a 72-year-old grandmother collecting Social Security, has lived in Rockwall,Texas since the mid-1970s with her second husband Kenneth Porter and three children. As the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination looms, sources claim that Marina refuses to believe that her former husband shot dead the president in his Dallas motorcade on that fateful November day. Marina Oswald Porter, widow of Lee Harvey Oswald who assassinated JFK, told a press conference in 1977: 'I believe that Lee acted alone in this murder and shot the President , ironically a man whom he respected and admired'. She now no longer believes he killed the president . Marina Oswald weeps as she views the body of her husband and JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before burial on November 25, 1963. She is holding her 22-month-old daughter June . Lee Harvey Oswald, his wife Marina, and his daughter June Lee, when they lived in Minsk in the USSR, shortly before they moved to the U.S. Marina, a Russian immigrant to the U.S., was living apart from Oswald when he shot dead President Kennedy on November 22, 1963. The night before the assassination she remembers him bringing his rifle to her home and putting it in the garage. The next day, she noticed it was gone. Due to her relationship with Oswald, Marina found herself the focus of intense scrutiny, so has spent many years hidden away in the small town, where a sign at the end of her driveway warns to 'Keep Out'. Two years after the JFK assassination, Marina married Kenneth Porter and they moved to Texas around ten years later. The family settled in Rockwall just 20 miles from Dallas. Assassin's ring: A wedding band worn by Lee Harvey Oswald until just hours before he killed President John F. Kennedy was sold at auction this month for $108,000 . She has two daughters by Oswald - June and Rachel - who confirmed to the National Enquirer that Marina does believe their father was innocent of the shooting and just a patsy for the Mafia and CIA. The Porters also have a son called Mark. The 72-year-old Mrs Porter has changed her mind about Oswald's guilt, according to the report, after reading books and watching documentaries on the assassination which has been mired in conspiracy theories for decades. A close friend, documentary filmmaker Keya Morgan, told the Enquirer: 'She certainly doesn't believe the official story - she always told me Lee Harvey Oswald loved President Kennedy. Banded together: Oswald is pictured wearing his wedding band as he and wife Marina leave Belarus in the early sixties for America. It sold for $108,000 at auction earlier this month . 'Marina says she remembers the day the Kennedys' premature baby Patrick died (August 7, 1963) and she found Lee sobbing.' Despite her change of heart over Oswald, Mrs Porter's neighbors in Rockwall told the National Enquirer that she is a much-loved member of the local community. Fred McCurley, who lives nearby, told the Enquirer: 'She and Ken are good people, the  best neighbors you could ever have.' In . July, Mrs Porter announced that she putting his wedding ring up for . auction as she breaks the final ties to what she describes as the 'worst . day of my life'. She had . given the band up to be auctioned in New Hampshire after it was returned . to her following 50 years lost in an attorney's folder of legal papers . from the trial. The ring sold to an anonymous Texas bidder on October 24 for $108,000. It is accompanied by a fascinating letter written by Mrs Porter which gives the background to the historical object. Previous life: Lee Harvey Oswald, his wife Marina and their daughter June Lee in 1962 . Fateful day: A snapshot taken of the moment JFK was shot in the head in 1963 while driving through Dallas, Texas . President and Jacqueline Kennedy arrive at Dallas Love Field a few hours before he was killed by a sniper, Lee Harvey Oswald . A small section reads: 'At this time of my life, I don’t . wish to have Lee’s ring in my possession because symbolicly [sic] I want . to let go of my past that is connecting with Nov. 22, 1963.' Mrs Porter will keep the proceeds from the sale. In the letter she writes that the ring, which has a . tiny engraving of a hammer and sickle, was bought by Oswald in Minsk in . 1961 shortly before the couple returned to the U.S. The ring was left on the couple's bedside table when Oswald set out to kill the President. Oswald was himself later shot and killed by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby while in police custody. She had refused to speak publicly as the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination approaches. The wedding band was discovered in 2004 stuck in a manila folder at a Forth Worth law firm. It was among the papers of Forrest Markward, a lawyer who represented Mrs Porter following the Kennedy assassination. After several years of legal tussles, the ring was returned by post to Mrs Porter in an envelope marked 'Treasury Department Secret Service'.

"With his long floppy ears and apparently docile demeanour, Toby the rabbit is hardly as threatening as a guard dog. But for one family, he has certainly proved just as effective. Kimberley May told yesterday how her huge pet rabbit scared off a burglar – by thumping his massive feet on the floor. Protector: Kimberley May and her three-year-old daughter Olivia with giant bunny Toby after he scared off a burglar by thumping loudly . She and her fiance Martin had only had . two-year-old Toby for a couple of weeks when an intruder broke into . their home in Plymouth. But his owners believe the raider was scared off thanks to the British Giant rabbit stomping his feet in his cage. Miss May, a hospital staff nurse, said . she was half woken in the early hours by Toby making ‘five loud thumps’ but she went back to sleep. In the morning, Martin went downstairs . and found a First World War medal, a  laptop and iPad were missing – . but a  lot of other valuables had been left behind. Miss May said: ‘We . went to bed on Wednesday at about 10pm. In the early hours of the . morning Toby our rabbit did five loud thumps. I sort of half woke up . then realised he’d stopped and went back to sleep. ‘When I went downstairs, every single . cupboard and drawer was open, there were bits out everywhere. Then we . started noticing that things were missing and we phoned the police. ‘They managed to take a laptop, an . iPad and my handbag with my purse and everything in, but the worst thing . was my great-granddad’s medal.’ Intruder: The thief broke into the family home in Plymouth without realising it was under the protection of a monster bunny . Raising the alarm: The 4.5kg, 2ft-long pet began stomping so loudly on the floor that the intruder fled . The medal was a King’s Liverpool . Regiment medal belonging to Henry Godwin Porter. It is silver and . inscribed with his name and regiment. Miss May added: ‘My gran died in . 2007, she lived in a council house all her life and hardly had any . possessions. That was the one important thing she had.’ Miss May said she found a hoard of . items left piled up on the sofa which she thinks the burglar was . preparing to take but left behind. ‘We think that when the rabbit thumped . it scared off the burglars and they left all the stuff they were going . to take,’ she added. The couple, who have a three-year-old . daughter, Olivia, are due to get married in nearby Plympton on August . 30. Miss May said: ‘They also took a box which had all our wedding . invitations and favours in it as well as paperwork which I was due to . give to the church and reception venue. Reward: Toby's delighted owner has bought him a new tunnel to play with as a thank you present . Hero: When Miss May came downstairs she found a hoard of items left piled up on the sofa which she thinks the burglar was preparing to take but left behind . ‘I’ve had to go to the library to get proof that I used to live in Plympton so I can get married at the church – they just don’t think about the impact it has to take things like that.’ After the break-in, Toby was left ‘traumatised’ and even tried to attack the policeman who came  to investigate. The 4.5kg rabbit is nearly 2ft long and 10in tall, and he could yet grow more – British Giant rabbits can reach up to 5.9kg. Toby is so big he lives in a cage built for a labrador. The family got their prized pet from an animal adoption centre which had taken him in. Miss May said: ‘He’s playful, really friendly, and he doesn’t mind my three-year-old crawling all over him. He’s like a small dog really. ‘When he thumps on the floor it’s incredibly loud – you can hear it echoing around the house.’ Police are appealing for information about the break-in, which happened a week ago. PC David Walters said: ‘They had the rabbit in the kitchen and mentioned that he was making a noise in the night. But there was nothing to say the burglar was definitely scared off.’","Hulking Toby, a British Giant bunny, weighs 4.5kg, and is two-feet long .

"A cowardly bear was caught running from a dog in hilarious pictures taken this week. The brave pooch, named Rooster, chased off the craven bear Friday during an aversion training program sponsored by the state of Nevada. Bear aversion training has been credited with saving almost 400 bears, according to the state. Scaredy bear: A male black bear runs up a tree to get away from Karelian Bear Dog Rooster . Though the bear was tranquilized earlier in the day, all credit goes to Rooster. Rooster is a Karelian Bear Dog, according to the Nevada Department of Wildlife. Karelian Bear Dogs were originally bred by farmers and hunters in Finland and Russia specifically for the task of handling bears. ‘Their job is to chase the bear, bark in its face and making it run away or climb a tree,’ the agency says. They grow to be only 40 – 60 pounds, but have ‘an instinct for handling bears safely,’ according to the DOW. Spineless: rooster chased the craven bear straight up into the tree . No thanks: The bear wanted no part of the steely pooch . The training program has been run by the state since the late 1990s, but Rooster joined in 2005, quickly becoming the leader of the team, according to the DOW. ‘His tenacity, quickness and fearless personality kept him from getting injured during over 300 bear encounters,’ the agency boasts. Rooster and Stryker, another Karelian Bear Dog on the DOW roster, were featured on a National Geographic special called Animal Extractors.","Rooster, a Karelian Bear Dog, is bred specifically for chasing off bears .

"Execution: 60 per cent of American still support the death penalty. Pictured, the execution chamber and the lethal injection table at California's San Quentin State Prison, in San Quentin, California . Sixty per cent of Americans still favour capital punishment for convicted murderers, a poll has shown. The survey demonstrates a clear majority for the ultimate punishment,  although it is the lowest percentage since 1972, according to a Gallup poll released yesterday. At its peak in the mid-1990s, capital punishment support was at 80 per cent, the polling group said. 'The current era of lower support may be tied to death penalty moratoriums in several states beginning around 2000 after several death-row inmates were later proven innocent of the crimes of which they were convicted,' Gallup said. Since 2006, six states have repealed death penalty laws outright, including Maryland this year, Gallup said. Eighty-one per cent of Republicans, 47 per cent of Democrats and 60 per cent of independents support the death penalty, according to the poll. The largest decrease was found among Democrats, 75 per cent of whom supported the death penalty in 1994. Gallup has been measuring Americans' attitudes about capital punishment since 1936.

"With matches as richly entertaining as this one, even UEFA could warm to the Premier League Under 21 International Cup. West Ham’s youngsters tasted defeat in their first experience of European competition as Athletic Bilbao claimed the points but both teams played their full part in an eight-goal thriller. This new 16-team competition, set up in defiance of UEFA interference, will offer all kinds of intriguing contests between the best of English talent and the continent’s production lines. Athletic Bilbao's Aitor Sequin is congratulated after scoring his side's second goal against West Ham . West Ham United: Raphael Spiegel; Kyle Knowle, Joshua Pask, Emmanuel Onariase, Lewis Page; Matthias Fanimo (Kieran Bywater 68), Sebastian Lletget, Danny Whitehead, Djair Parfitt-Williams, Elliot Lee, Jordan Brown (Moses Makasi 68) Subs not used: Tim Brown, Amos Nasha, Olatunji Akinola, Grady Diangana . Scorers: Fanimo 18; Lee 77; Bywater 90 . Booked: Lee . Athletic Bilbao: Alejandro Remiro, Markel Exteberria, Gorka Perez, Unai Bilbao Arteta, Urtzi Iriondo, Inigo Baque (Urtzi Urcelay 63), Gorka Iturraspe (Martin Bengoa 55), Mikel Vesga, Aitor Seguin (Gorka Guruzeta 81), Jorge Luis Garcia, Mario Barco . Subs not used: Hodei Oleaga, Imanol Corral, Jon Aguirrezabala . Scorers: Luis Garcia 2, 89; Seguin 19; Pask own goal 32; Barco 90+1 . Booked: Iriondo . Referee: Ashvin Degnarain . And on a soggy evening at Upton Park, it was one-nil to the Europeans - but only just. The Basque club, who take enormous pride in their ‘Cantera’ policy of only fielding players from their own region, looked vastly superior in the first half and goals from Jorge Luis Garcia and Aitor Seguin, followed by a Joshua Pask own goal, saw them establish a commanding 3-1 lead. But the Hammers, with a proud academy track record of their own, had equalised at 1-1 through Mathias Fanimo and stayed in touch thanks to late goals from Elliot Lee and Kieran Bywater. It meant Bilbao needed two late goals of their own - from Luis Garcia again and then Mario Basco - to claim the spoils and take an early advantage in a group that also features Fulham and PSV Eindhoven. A hastily-arranged opening game, played before a sparse crowd of a few hundred hardy souls who braved torrential rain, hardly felt like history in the making but the Premier League deserve immense credit for getting this idea off the ground. Concerned that a continental competition at Under 21 level would impact on the Under 19 Youth League, itself only in its second season, UEFA had scuppered the initial masterplan of staging games right across Europe. West Ham's Matthias Fanimo is congratulated after equalising to make the scores 1-1 at Upton Park . But the Premier League persevered, adroitly outmaneuvering the UEFA red tape and regulations by playing all the matches in England under their own jurisdiction. A worthy tournament is born, and let’s hope many stars of the future flourish in it. They couldn’t have asked for a better start. The two teams posed for a photograph together ahead of the kick-off - a nice souvenir for the annals - and the only thing that remained was to see who would have the honour of scoring the International Cup’s first goal. We didn’t have to wait long to find out. Inside two minutes, Bilbao’s very first attack had the Hammers defence slipping and sliding, allowing Luis Garcia to pinch the ball ahead of grounded goalkeeper Raphael Spiegel and roll it into an empty net. The hosts responded very well and a nicely-worked move down the left involving Elliot Lee and Jordan Brown led to the unmarked Matthias Fanimo curling a shot over the bar. West Ham are one of a number of Premier League clubs taking part in this season's brand new competition . Winger Djair Parfitt-Williams then struck the outside of the post after a moment of hesitation in the Bilbao defence saw him connect with Danny Whitehead’s perfect through ball. West Ham were on top and they equalised on 18 minutes. Lewis Page combined well with Parfitt-Williams on the left and his deep cross found Fanimo unmarked. He found the net via a deflection and it was England 1-1 Spain. Not for long. Straight from the kick-off, Bilbao won a free-kick wide on the right and Seguin had only one thought in his mind. His immaculate inswinger evaded everyone and nestled in the net at the back stick. Think Angel Di Maria for Manchester United against QPR a few weeks ago, albeit a little closer in. West Ham were again unbowed by a setback - Fanimo was found at the back post again, this time by Lee, but Alejandro Remiro blocked at his near post. The miss proved costly as Bilbao claimed a third before half-time. West Ham were again guilty of loose defending and Urtzi Iriondo at the back post drilled across goal, the ball hitting Pask and then Emmanuel Onariase as it ricocheted in. This new competition, created despite strong opposition from UEFA, brings together eight U21 Premier League teams and eight development sides from the continent. European football’s governing body blocked the initial proposals to have a tournament along similar lines with games played right across the continent, fearing it would overlap with their Youth League competition for U19s. But the Premier League have managed to out manoeuvre UEFA by staging all matches at English venues. As well as West Ham, the English clubs involved in the tournament are Chelsea, Everton, Fulham, Leicester, Manchester City, Norwich, and Sunderland. Benfica, Borussia Monchengladbach, Celtic, Schalke, Porto, PSV Eindhoven, and Villarreal join Bilbao on the list of teams participating from outside England. Group matches will be played between October 15 and January 31 with all games organised by the Premier League. The groups have been drawn as follows: . Group A: Chelsea, Norwich City, Porto, Borussia Monchengladbach . Group B: Fulham, West Ham, Athletic Bilbao, PSV Eindhoven . Group C: Leicester City, Manchester City, Benfica, Sevilla . Group D: Everton, Sunderland, Celtic, Villarreal . The rain abated but Bilbao’s pressure didn’t. Spiegel saved well from Mario Barco and Pask was needed to hack away another shot close to the goalline. But out of nothing, with just 13 minutes left, West Ham gained a lifeline when Lee pounced on Pask’s knock-down from a Kieran Bywater free-kick to apply a simple finish. And they could have equalised when Pask’s headed was blocked on the line. Then a flurry of late goals kept the match swinging in the balance. First, Bilbao re-established their two-goal cushion when Garcia fired home from an indirect free-kick after Spiegel had picked up a backpass. But as the clock ticked over into stoppage time, West Ham again had hope as Bywater fired high into the net from the edge of the box. The hope didn’t last too long - Basco flung himself at a right-wing cross to beat Spiegel with a diving header and set the seal on the Basques’ win.","West Ham Under 21s beaten in first experience of European competition .

"Karim Benzema looks to have secured at least another season at Real Madrid not least because of his exploits at this World Cup. France striker Benzema has hit three goals and been credited with two assists enhancing his reputation as a world-class striker. But for some time the Real Madrid hierarchy have seen him a disposable asset and it was thought he would be put up for offer this summer with the club looking to sign Luis Suarez. All white on the night: Karim Benzema has scored three times for France at the World Cup, including a double against Honduras . In training: Benzema is put through his paces for France ahead of their last-16 clash against Nigeria on Monday . Just to confirm what already know (that Germany are better than England), since the 1966 World Cup win the German's have advanced further than England all ELEVEN subsequent World Cup finals. Real though have backed off their pursuit of Suarez with Barcelona now in pole position to sign the disgraced Liverpool striker. And manager Carlo Ancelotti, who he retained his job by winning the Champions League, has argued the case to keep Benzema with the club's hierarchy. The player has also benefited from the support of former France World Cup winner Zinedene Zidane, who is being groomed as Real's next boss, having just left his role as Ancelotti's assistant to take charge of Castilla, Real's feeder club. Nigeria's Stephen Keshi is the first African manager to lead an African side into the knockout stages of a World Cup. On the previous nine occasions African sides have gone beyond the group stages they have been managed by overseas bosses. This is the fourth time Nigeria have made this stage. As a player Keshi played most of his football in Belgium, was captain of Nigeria in 1994 but was then controversially dropped and last year as Super Eagles manager led them to African Nations Cup success. VIDEO France favourites over stormy Nigeria . Making history: Nigeria's Stephen Keshi is the first African to guide a team from Africa to the knockout stages . The build up to Algeria's clash has been about  avenging the injustice they believed they suffered when Germany knocked them out of the 1982 World Cup. A low scoring win for Germany over neighbour Austria would see both countries go through at the expense of Algeria. After an early goal for the Germans, the game was played at walking pace and both sets of players celebrated at the end in what has become known as the Anschluss game. But it's not the only time there has been some dodgy goings at World Cups not least for Scotland in 1974. The Scots had beaten a rough and raw Zaire 2-0 and held Brazil 0-0. But inexplicably Zaire then lost 9-0, a record at the finals, to Yugoslavia. The 'brown envelope' suspicion surrounding that capitulation was heightened given Zaire then only lost 3-0 to Brazil in their final game. Yugoslavia then had to hold Scotland to a draw, which they did, to qualify thanks to that goal difference stacked up against Zaire whose manager was Blagoje Vidinic and, er, a Yugoslav. Greece suffered heartache by going out on penalties to Costa Rica. But their players then displayed great heart and generosity by donating all their World Cup bonuses to fund a new national training centre. The squad issued a statement saying :'We do not want extra bonus, or money. We only play for Greece and its people. 'All we want is for you to support our effort to find a land and create a sports centre that will house our National team.' Heartbreak: Greece crashed out of the World Cup after losing a dramatic penalty shootout to Costa Rica . Could Kenneth Omeruo eventually succeed John Terry as the rock of Chelsea's defence? How the 20-year-old copes with the France attack today will be a great test for a player Chelsea signed from Standard Liege two summers ago and spent last year on loan at Middlesbrough. Case for the defence: Kenneth Omeruo signed from Chelsea two summers ago and has been on loan at Liege . Nigeria should have progressed to the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup and perhaps gone all the way. They were leading Italy 1-0 and looking in control but then Italy's enigma of that era Roberto Baggio suddenly showed what he could do. Italy equalised when Baggio scored from the spot in extra time. Italy went to lose the final to Brazil in a penalty shoot out in the decisive kick by Baggio known as the Divine Pony Tail which went way over bar.","Benzema looks to have secured at least another season at Real Madrid .

"Tragedy: Victoria Harrison died during a routine appendix operation at Kettering General Hospital, who had tried to hide its failings to protect its staff . A hospital where a young hairdresser bled to death over 15 hours has been forced to admit a catalogue of 43 errors just weeks after it tried to hide the full details to avoid 'putting staff under more stress'. Victoria Harrison died after an artery was torn during appendix surgery at Kettering General Hospital in Northamptonshire. In the hours before she died the 17-year-old was so scared for her safety she texted a picture of her blood-soaked T-shirt to her boyfriend. At her inquest in December Northamptonshire Coroner Anne Pember criticised the . hospital for their 'poor' levels of care and said she believed . Victoria's life could have been saved. Despite calls from her family to come clean over the full scale of its mistakes the hospital refused to say exactly what the errors were for fear of 'putting staff under more stress' The hospital's chief executive, Fiona Wise, said in January: 'We have a right to withhold that information where we feel it is appropriate to prevent further damage to individuals who have already been through a thorough investigation process.' But today a BBC Freedom of Information request forced them to reveal the 43 errors, how it dealt with unprofessional staff and its plans to improve care. Mistakes included uncertainty about Victoria's level of blood loss, inconsistency in handovers between nursing teams, and staff did not properly monitor Miss Harrison. Today's FOI response also revealed that ten staff were disciplined after her death. Bereft: Victoria's mother Tracy Foskett and sister Sarah Francis have demanded answers about how their loved-one died . Damning:  A report by Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust found its staff made 43 errors while caring for Miss Harrison there before she died . The teenager had been admitted to hospital for routine key-hole surgery on August 15 last year after suffering abdominal pains. But . during the 30-minute operation to remove her appendix, she suffered . internal bleeding when surgeons tore a hole in an artery while inserting . a micro-camera into her stomach. Staff . managed to repair the hole but she lost almost half a pint of blood and . she was sent to recover on a ward, but died the next day. Life lost: Victoria was admitted to hospital for the simple operation on August 15 this year, but within 15 hours she had died . An . inquest at the Best Western Hotel in Corby, Northamptonshire, heard . nurses failed to read her medical notes which indicated she had suffered . a large bleed during surgery. She was not properly checked and nurses failed to take her blood pressure which would have indicated her blood loss. Despite complaining of being in pain nurses gave her morphine until she suffered heart failure and died at 7am on August 16. Tragically, Victoria - who was the youngest of three siblings - was due to see her big sister Sarah-Louise, 22, get married that weekend after picking out her wedding dress. Gillian Joy, the recovery nurse looking after Victoria, told her in Corby inquest she had not been told the patient had bled during the surgery and did not read the operation notes. Despite complaining of being in pain nurses gave her morphine until she suffered heart failure and died at 7am on August 16. Speaking after the hearing, Victoria's mother Tracey Foskett, 42, paid tribute to her 'wonderful' daughter and said she hoped lessons had been learned to spare others similar heartache. She said: 'I would like to thank all my family who have been there for me and my friends and Victoria's friends who have supported me throughout the devastating loss of my daughter. 'Also my solicitor for getting the result the family wanted and also to Clare Culpin for being there on 24 hour support to answer every question I have asked about Victoria's death. 'Victoria was a wonderful girl loved by many and will be greatly missed. 'May Victoria's legacy go on at Kettering Hospital so no other family have to go through the heartache of losing a loved one and feel the pain we feel for the rest of our lives missing our beautiful Victoria.' Let down: 'Tor', as she was known to her family, texted her fiancé with a picture of a blood-soaked T-shirt because she was scared . Clare Culpin, Director of Nursing and Quality at Kettering General Hospital, also issued an apology to the family and revealed a number of staff had been disciplined following the case. She said: 'I would like to start by saying to Victoria's parents, family, and friends, on behalf of Kettering General Hospital, we are very sorry. 'Victoria's death led to a very thorough serious incident investigation being carried out by this hospital. 'That investigation identified a number of recommendations and led to some disciplinary action. 'As a result the hospital has committed to some significant changes to practice and patient care.' Findings: Victoria's was let down in 43 different ways, Kettering General Hospital has admitted . 1. Wrong surgeon documented on theatre documentation. 2. Communication of blood loss among theatre team. 3. Unsupervised student scrub practitioner. 4. Scrub practitioner not concentrating on procedure. 5. Scrub practitioner not checking blood loss. 6. Large number of staff in and out of theatre during procedure. 7. Anaethestic doctor went for a break just before Victoria was extubated (removal of breathing tube). 8. The surgeon did not inform his consultant of the bleed. 9. Post-op notes were not properly reviewed. 10. No record of blood loss on the theatre care plan. 11. Uncertainty surrounding the handover of blood loss information from theatre to nursing staff. 12. Missing information on handover notes from recovery to ward nurses. 13. Missing information was not handed over when ward nurses changed shifts. 14. Victoria's respiratory rate was only counted on every second set of observations by recovery nurses. 15. A staff nurse did not delegate post-op observations when she was called away, leaving a two-hour gap in monitoring. 16. The surgeon did not report the artery damage or blood loss during surgery to ward staff. 17. Routine post-op observations were discontinued. 18. No standard handover routine between day and night shift surgical doctors in place. 19. A junior doctor did not check Victoria's haemoglobin result after her surgeon ordered tests. 20. Supervision of the junior doctor was not clearly defined. 21. The junior doctor did not examine Victoria's abdomen while at her bedside - despite her complaining of pain in the area. 22. Inaccurate recording of medication. 23. The junior doctor did not make a note in Victoria's records when he took a sample of her blood. 24. A staff nurse did not follow proper procedure when re-dressing an abdominal wound. 25. The same nurse disrupted an intact dressing too soon after surgery. 26. Nurses did not complete a formal pain assessment despite increasing levels of discomfort. 27. Vital signs were not monitored before or after Victoria was given intravenous morphine. 28. Routine 2am observations were not completed. 29. A nurse performed a visual assessment of Victoria in the dark without using a torch. 30. Improper overnight monitoring. 31. Poor observation of the patient. 32. Lights were switched on at 4.50 am - contravening hospital policy on patient well-being and dignity. 33. Lack of piped oxygen to beds on the ward. 34. The primary staff nurse was not made aware of the bleed in theatre. 35. Blood transfusion policy was not followed. 36. A scribe was not present during resuscitation attempts. 37.

"The UC Santa Barbara killer murdered six people May 23, but some of his 50-plus shots also hit and injured a dozen others and one of those survivors has now spoken out about what it was like to live through Elliot Rodger's rampage. Megan Carloto, 22, was riding her bike to a friend's house that fated Friday when she felt a pain in her thigh and pulled over. She thought the shots she heard were just fireworks at first, but when the pain hit her, so did an horrific realization. 'That guy tried to f*****g kill me,' she told ANIMAL New York. Carloto was lucky and didn't even require surgery after the bullet passed through her thigh, but she says the experience has changed her . But Carloto was one of the lucky ones. Unlike Weihan Wang, Cheng Yuan Hong, George Chen, Katherine Cooper, Christopher Michaels-Martinez and Veronika Weiss, she got through the night alive. 'It’s my upper thigh. It’s across the top,' she told ANIMAL. 'There are two holes because the bullet went through the top of my thigh. It didn’t hit a bone. It didn’t hit an artery. No surgery, no stitches.' Carloto describes the next few minutes and hours as a battle to come to terms with what had happened, who had perished and how she and her flesh wound fit into the horrible scheme of things. 'I watched Elliot Rodger’s YouTube video a couple hours later. That was the moment when I realized someone tried to kill me. Horror: Carloto was riding her bike that fated Friday night when she felt a pain in her leg and it slowly dawned on her that she'd been shot . 'He pulled over his car and pointed at me and shot. I thought I was caught in the crossfire. And it turns out he saw me, pulled over, and shot at me.' As the mourning for the slain continues and Carloto moves on from the experience, she's taking away two things from the experience: the convictions that gun laws must change and that women can no longer be victimized for not returning the advances of men. 'We’re not obligated to fulfill this male desire,' she says. 'And it angers me that people are hurt because this person was so narcissistic.' While she knows that small changes to gun legislation won't prevent the next Elliot Rodger, she Carloto questions the wisdom of doing nothing at all. 'I’m not gonna snap my fingers and make everything perfect and one law is not gonna make everything perfect. But at least try. Try something. It’s not gonna hurt,' she says. 'It's just two holes. In and out.' 'It angers me that people are hurt because this person was so narcissistic that he felt that he should kill people who don¿t wanna have sex with him,' says Carloto .","UC Santa Barbara graduate Megan Carloto was biking to a friend's house when Rodger took aim and shot her in the leg .

"Police in Albuquerque are facing intense criticism after video footage was released which appears to show officers using excessive force to apprehend a homeless man who was holding two knifes. James Boyd, 38, died as a result of his injuries after a standoff with cops last Sunday, during which police fired two stun gun rounds, six rounds of gunfire, a bean bag and a K-9 unit was released on him. The entire ordeal was caught on one officer’s lapel camera and has led to a public outcry from city and state leaders who have accused the police of using excessive force. Scroll down for video . Police in Albuquerque are facing intense criticism after video footage was released which appears to show officers using excessive force to apprehend James Boyd, a homeless man who was holding two knives . Speaking to reporters during a press conference on Friday, Albuquerque Police Chief Gorden Eden said he thought his officers' actions were justified. The lapel footage shows half a dozen officers standing about 20 feet away from the man while shouting ‘get on the ground!’ and 'drop the knife!' Boyd was actually turning away as officers unloaded beanbags, stun guns and live rounds on him. Boyd, who police say had a lengthy criminal record, later died. However, Eden said the medical examiner has not yet determined if the bullets killed Boyd. Two police officers each fired three bullets causing Boyd to fall to the ground. A medical examiner has not yet determined if the bullets killed Boyd . Boyd who had spent time in prison and in a mental health facility told cops that he was a federal agent . The shooting comes as Albuquerque police is under a U.S. Justice Department investigation over excessive force and three dozen police shootings since 2010. ‘We need to look at some changes within the department, but I think more importantly we need to restore confidence in the Albuquerque police department,’ said City Council President Ken Sanchez. State Senator Michael Padilla said he was responding to worried constituents. He says he was disturbed not only by the video, but by APD Police Chief Gorden Eden’s comments that the shooting was justified. ‘I'm very concerned about the chief of police immediately jumping to conclusions,’ Padilla said. ‘I think we all know with camera on the lapel video - something definitely happened.’ Sanchez said was concerned about how the public now sees the APD. ‘We need to work hard to restore confidence in the men and women who work for the Albuquerque Police Department,’ he told KOB4. At Friday’s press conference Eden said police responding to a suspicious-person call found Boyd sleeping at what looked like an illegal makeshift camp in the Sandia foothills. Eden said Boyd later claimed to be a federal agent and demanded to see officers with New Mexico State Police, who he also threatened to kill. ‘The officers were attempting to affect a felony arrest using less-than lethal weapons, including a distractive device, K9, and a Taser shotgun,’ Eden said. Authorities said Boyd threatened to kill a Crisis Intervention Team officer called to the scene. When Boyd refused to follow police orders and an unarmed K9 officer got close to him, officers Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez shot toward Boyd, Eden said. The video footage shows an injured Boyd with two five-inch knives in his hand when officers surround and handcuff him. The video footage shows an injured Boyd with two five-inch knives in his hand when officers surround and handcuff him . ‘The suspect did in fact make a decision not to follow the directions that (were) provided to him by the officers,’ Eden said. ‘On many occasions he said that he was not going to come off that mountain.’ Eden said many of Boyd's prior arrests were for violent crimes, including a December 2010 arrest on charges he punched a female officer and fractured her nose at a city library.","James Boyd 38, died as a result of his injuries after a standoff with cops in the Sandia foothills in Albuquerque last weekend .

"Claims: Mass killer Elliot Rodger may have been addicted to Xanax, it has been claimed . Mass killer Elliot Rodger may have been dependent on the anti-anxiety drug Xanax which made him 'isolated and anxious' before his murder spree, it has been claimed. His family's spokesman previously said Rodger, who stabbed three students and shot another three dead before killing himself, was believed to have been taking the medication for around six months. Today a police source in Santa Barbara, California, told Radar Online that investigators are 'being told that he was likely addicted to Xanax'. The source said Rodger's parents, Hunger Games assistant director Peter and his wife Li Chin, had been doing 'basic research' on the prescription drug, whose medical name is alprazolam. 'Based on what they have read, they believe the tranquilizer made him more withdrawn, lonely, isolated, and anxious,' the source said. The drug's rarer side effects - experienced by more than one in 1,000 patients - include hostility, nervousness, hyperactivity and hallucinations or feelings of unreality. Despite its use as an anti-anxiety drug, rare side effects for around one in 1,000 patients can include anxiety. More than one per cent of patients, meanwhile, have trouble concentrating, get confused or depressed or become irritable. The source added: 'Xanax isn’t being blamed for causing Elliot to go on his rampage, but it probably wasn’t the best decision to have someone like him on it.' The 22-year-old's use of the prescription drug was revealed after his parents spoke of their 'hell on earth' at knowing the heartbreak he caused in their first formal statement last week. 'We are crying in pain for the victims and their families,' Peter and Li Chin Rodger said in a statement that was read by family friend Simon Astaire. 'It breaks our heart on a level that we didn't think possible. The feeling of knowing that it was our son's actions that caused the tragedy can only be described as hell on earth.' It is now almost two weeks since their son stabbed three male students in his home - including two of his roommates - before gunning down two female students and another male. Scroll down for video .

Statement: Simon Astaire, a family friend of Chin and Peter Rodger, read out a statement on their behalf on Good Morning America last week, saying that they are 'crying in pain' for the victims and their families . He explained that they were always worried that their troubled son would kill himself, but after they received his 140-page manifesto - in which he detailed his plan for 'retribution' after girls failed to show any interest in him - on the day of the shooting, they realized that others might be in danger too. '[Li Chin] read the first four lines and she knew something was wrong,' Astaire said. She then clicked on his YouTube page and found terrifying videos in which he outlined his plan to 'slaughter' women. She called his father, Peter, from whom she is divorced. They realised they had to get to Santa Barbara as soon as possible and jumped in their cars. But during the drive, Li Chin heard about the massacre involving a black BMW - the one his mother had bought him - on the radio, Astaire said. The friend . added that he had known Rodger most of his life but always thought he . was an awkward child, who would shake whenever he was approached. 'I . thought he was the loneliest person I've ever seen in my life,' he . said. 'He fooled everyone for a very long time. He was a tragic figure. He is in many ways a monster.' Killer: Elliot Rodger, pictured, stabbed three friends and gunned down three other students in California . He also . insisted his friends had done everything they possibly could to avert . the massacre, from taking him to doctors to racing to the campus in a . bid to stop him. Since the . shocking incident it has been revealed that police had contact with . Rodger three times while he was living in Isla Vista, but they failed to . see any warning signs. On one occasion, a family member called and asked officers to check on Rodger because they were worried about his mental state. In . his warped 141-page manifesto, he describes the incident, saying: 'If . they had demanded to search my room ... (t)hat would have ended . everything. 'For a few horrible seconds, I thought it was all over.... [T]he police would have searched my room, found all of my guns and . weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them. 'I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies. I can't imagine a hell darker than that.' Victims: Rodger's first victims included his roommates Weihan Wang, left, and Cheng Yuan Hong, right . Gunned down: George Chen, left, was also found . stabbed to death in their home - although he did not live at the house - . while Rodger gunned down Chris Michael-Martinez, right, when he opened . fire at a deli . Loss: Katie Cooper, left, and Veronika Weiss . were standing outside a sorority house when they were shot . Sadness: Students mourn the victims who were killed by Rodger in a candlelit vigil . But . Rodger’s parents don't blame the authorities at all. Mr Astaire said: . 'They don't place any blame on the police, because Elliot fooled . everyone, no one knew the man he was turning into. 'He . seemed a sensitive guy, there was nothing aggressive about him, there . was no anger. No one recognizes the person portrayed in the manifesto. He didn’t act in that way, he was just in his own world. He didn’t once . speak about guns. 'If . you look at the amount of therapists they took him to, it is clear he . did all he could. He's writing with anger, but he constantly references . how they tried to make him feel better.'","22-year-old mass shooter was thought to be taking drug for six months .

"A man who has hiccuped constantly has received the devastating news there is probably no cure and he could have them for life. Daniel Clavin, 38, spoke out last year to appeal for help in finding the cause of his chronic hiccups. Now, he has been diagnosed with the neurological condition multiple sclerosis and believes the illness could be responsible for his hiccups. Scroll down for video . Daniel Clavin (pictured with his wife, Susan) has had chronic hiccups for almost three years . He began suffering constant hiccups after a night out and the problem is now ruining his life. He has to sleep in a separate room to his wife, is embarrassed about going anywhere in public and struggles to eat normally. He said: ‘They’ve taken over my life and I don’t know if I’ll ever get rid of them. ‘Now I’ve been diagnosed with MS I think that’s the reason for them. ‘They are not a common symptom of MS but MS can affect your brain in lots of different ways. ‘I’m told I’ve got a high burden of the disease and this is the only symptom so far, so I can’t complain. Mr Clavin has tried every trick that could possibly stop his hiccups but nothing has worked . Mr Clavin (pictured eating sugar and vinegar in a bid to stop his hiccups) has recently been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. He believes the neurological condition is responsible for his hiccups . ‘But MS is a progressive disease so I don’t know if I’ll ever be cured of them.’ Mr Clavin’s hiccups began in July 2011 after he went on a stag do. He said: ‘I just woke up with them and I’ve no idea why they started. What is MS? MS is a neurological condition that affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord. It causes a wide range of symptoms including problems with muscle movement, balance and vision. Each nerve fibre in the brain is surrounded by a layer of protein called myelin which protects the nerve and helps signal from the brain travel to the body. In MS this fibre becomes damaged disrupting these nerve signals. Usually, people with MS have flare-ups of symptoms for a few days to a few months followed by periods of few symptoms. After about 15 years, half of patients then develop secondary progressive MS in which symptoms gradually worsen over time. There is currently no cure but treatments can help control the symptoms. MS is an autoimmune condition which occurs when the immune system starts attacking the myelin covering of nerves. MS is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 and life expectancy is five to 10 years less than in the population as a whole. Source: NHS Choices . MS and hiccups: . Some experts believe the damage that occurs to the central nervous system as a result of MS can result in the body losing its ability to control hiccups. But, it is a rare way for MS to present - one study suggested about eight per cent of MS patients struggle with hiccups. ‘I’m not a big drinker and I’d had more than I’d for some time but it was nothing out of the ordinary. ‘Since then I’ve tried just about everything - all the old wives’ cures - but I can’t stop. ‘Some days are bad and I’ll have difficulty eating and keeping my food down. ‘Other times they lock up my diaphragm and I won’t be able to breathe for 30 seconds. ‘I spend most nights in a different room from Susan so she is not disturbed but that’s not ideal and it puts a strain on things. ‘I can be lying there for hours, hiccupping every three seconds.’ Mr Clavin is currently seeing a neurologist who has prescribed chlorpromazine, a drug normally used to treat schizophrenics. That has failed to stop the hiccups - but appears to have reduced them to a regular on-off pattern. He said: ‘I’ll have them for seven or eight days and then they’ll suddenly stop and I’ll be without them for five or six days and I’ll be perfectly fine. ‘It’s been like that for several months now and I don’t know if it’s because of the drug. ‘I’ve got another appointment with the neurologist in a couple of weeks when he says he’s going to put me on an anti-epilepsy drug to see how I react to that. ‘There’s also the possibility of having a pacemaker fitted in my diaphragm which would interrupt the signal from my brain and hopefully stop them.’ Despite the problem, Mr Clavin says he has been able to keep his job as a software worker with British Telecom. He spends a couple of days a week in their Dublin office and the rest of the time at home in County Roscommon, Ireland. He said: ‘My work colleagues are very good and very tolerant and I do everything I can to keep the hiccups quiet. ‘I find I can control them best and hold my breath if I’m not talking so I try to keep quiet. ‘People find it quite funny when they first meet me but then it becomes quite annoying for someone to have to listen to. ‘I to try to keep cheerful but the medical community doesn’t seem to know what to do for me. Mr Clavin (pictured with his wife, Susan, and children, Harry and Megan) believes that as there is no cure for MS he could have his hiccups for the rest of his life . ‘I’m told there’s only a handful of people in the world at this moment who will have hiccups as bad.’ Mr Clavin - father to Harry, four, and 20-month-old Megan - has seen a number of experts, had two endoscopies, a CT scan, changed his diet, taken tranquilisers and consulted a chiropractor but all in vain. His wife, Susan, 39, said: ‘It’s a big struggle. ‘I try to block it out but I can’t sleep with it - the sound and the constant twitching of the bed. ‘Even when he’s having a good week it’s hard having him back in the bed because I’ve got used to sleeping by myself. ‘It is very tough on him and day to day he’s not very happy, although he tries to remain positive. ‘It’s difficult for anyone to concentrate on anything else when he’s around. ‘We are still desperate to find someone who can help him because the hiccups are ruining our lives.’ Jo Chapman, Information Resources Manager, at the MS Society said: 'People with MS can experience chronic hiccups, which may be caused by having MS, but this link isn’t proven. 'No two cases of MS are the same and the condition can present itself with a wide range of different symptoms. 'We wish Daniel and his family all the best for the future and would encourage him to get in touch if he would like and support or further information about the condition.

"A college water polo star was one of the 13 injured in virgin-killer Elliot Rodger's Friday rampage on the University of California Santa Barbara campus. Alamo, California native Nick Pasichuke was in Isla Vista visiting his best friend Tyler Martin when he unfortunately came into Rodger's path. The University of the Pacific freshman was skateboarding back from a burrito run with Martin's roommate Patrick Eggert and two other girls around 9:30pm when Rodger's car came up from behind at top speed. Scroll for video . 'It's a blur,' Pasichuke told the San Francisco Gate. 'My friend (Eggert) was on his bicycle and I had my longboard , and then I was hit out of nowhere. Next thing I knew I was lying in the street. It threw me 50 feet down the road.' The collision happened right outside Martin's home, and he came running out to help Pasichuke. The two attended San Ramon Valley High School together where they were both on the water polo team. 'As I was leaning over and trying to comfort him - he said he was in a lot of pain, obviously - I heard pop, pop, pop,' Martin told NBC Bay Area. Visiting friends: Nick Pasichuke (left) was in Isla Vista on Friday to visit his best friend. He's currently a freshman at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California where he plays water polo. The business major was hit by 22-year-old Elliot Rodger (right), who was fleeing the scene of the UCSB shooting . Banged up: Pasichuke broke both of his legs and sustained facial fractures and scarring on most of his body after being hit by Rodger's BMW . It reportedly took ambulances 45 minutes to show up because of the other victims. Pasichuke broke both of his legs and sustained facial fractures and scarring on much of his body from the impact. Eggert was also injured, but was able to walk after the accident. Pasichuke underwent surgery Saturday and was in good condition recovering at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital on Monday. Returning to the pool: Pasichuke underwent surgery on Saturday but will be able to play water polo again. Pictured fourth from right in the above photo with his high school team . Luckily, Pasichuke will be able to play water polo again. He currently plays attacker for his Stockton, California college team and planned to spend the summer working as a lifeguard and training. 'Nick's an athlete, so he's got a strong upper body; I think that helped him come through it,' his mother Jill Pasichuke told the Gate. 'I'm just happy I have a kid to take home.' Back home in Alamo, Nick's 17-year-old sister Katie says there's been an outpouring of support. 'There has been a lot of support from the community, people calling, stopping by and also on social media, and we're thankful for that,' Katie Pasichuke said. 'My brother was very lucky to have been one of the survivors.' Get well: His sister says there has been an outpouring of support back home for the water polo star. Pictured on the right at a University of the Pacific swim meet . Support for Pasichuke is also evident on Twitter, where friends have been wishing him well with the hashtag #PrayForCheeks. His attacker Rodgers died Saturday night from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Rodgers set out that evening to kill as many girls as possible, blaming his virginity at the age of 22 on all womankind. Six were killed in the rampage, and 13 injured.

"From clocks with no hands to clown faces and masks, gangsters are known for tattooing their bodies with strange symbols charting their criminal exploits. While many of them may appear innocent enough to a law abiding citizen, to fellow mobsters they can have an much more sinister meaning. For example, an opaque teardrop can denote a murder, while the outline of a tear with a clear centre means the wearer is seeking revenge for a killing. Gangland tattoos can have various meanings, from teardrops for a killing to spiderwebs for jail time. Prosecutors in the case of Aaron Hernandez are examining inkings on his right arm to use as evidence of guilt in two homicides . Opaque teardrop tattoos (top) can mean the person has killed, while clear teardrops (bottom) could mean the person is seeking revenge for a killing . Clowns and face masks represent gangsters' 'play now, pay later' attitude to life, while spider webs and clocks without hands tell others they have done jail time. Sometimes the designs are less figurative. In 2011 Anthony Garcia was convicted of murder and sentenced to 65 years in prison after a homicide investigator discovered he had the scene of an unsolved 2004 murder inked on his chest. Prosecutors in the case of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez are also looking to use tattoos he has on his right arm as evidence against him in a double homicide case. Officers won't say which designs they are interested in, but Photos of Hernandez show he has had five stars and other tattoo work added to his right forearm over the past few years. While many star tattoos have nothing to do with crime, they can sometimes be used to represent killings, said Kevin Waters, a criminal justice professor at Northern Michigan University and former agent with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. While most designs are figurative, others are not. In 2011 Anthony Garcia was locked up for 65 years after a homicide detective noticed an inking of an unsolved murder scene on his chest . A judge in the case of Jeffrey Chapman ruled that he could wear a high-necked jumper to hide the word 'murder' spelled backwards across his neck in case it prejudiced the jury . 'I would say the cops probably see the stars and know in some circles that a star does represent a kill and want a tattoo artist to come in and see if he (Hernandez) said anything about that,' Waters said. Sinister designs have also caused problems for criminals facing trial, including William Clyde Gibson, a convicted double murderer who tattooed 'Death Row x3' on his head before a third homicide trial. Teardrops: Have several possible meanings, including the number of people the wearer killed or the number of stints in prison they served. A clear teardrop can mean the wearer wants revenge for the killing of a loved one. Spider webs/Clocks with no hands: Can mean the wearer served time in prison. Stars: They can be innocent designs. On some prison gang members, however, they can represent the number of people the wearer killed. The number of points on a star can correspond with the number of years served in prison. Three dots: Often inked near an eye or on a hand, it can refer to the ""vida loca,"" or crazy life, of a criminal. Penal code numbers: Some criminals get tattoos of the penal code numbers for the crimes they committed. Cats: Can refer to thieves, especially among Russian criminal groups. Masks and clown faces: These tattoos can represent a criminal's 'play now, pay later' lifestyle. The judge in that case ruled Gibson, who had a shaved head, must grow his hair out in order to hide the inking as it could be prejudicial. The same month Gibson went to trial, Jeffrey Chapman was given permission to wear a turtleneck to cover a tattoo of the word 'murder' spelled backward on his neck, amid concerns it would prejudice the jury at his upcoming murder trial in Kansas. According to criminologists, other well-known gang-land designs include three dots inked in a triangle near and eye or in the corner of a hand represent the 'vida loco', or 'crazy life', of a criminal. Another design, particularly popular in Russia, is a cat to denote a thief or burglar. In Hernandez's case, officials said they have received several responses to their plea for information for tattoo artists who worked on him, but they wouldn't elaborate. Boston police and the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office said the artists would be considered witnesses and are not accused of any wrongdoing. Even if investigators do find the artists who created the tattoos they are interested in, it's not clear they would talk. While there is no code on confidentiality between artist the artist and the person having the inking, Joe Capobianco, an artist from New Haven, said there is an 'unwritten code... on does not rat on one's clients.' As for Hernandez, he says all his tattoos have personal meaning. The stars on his right forearm surround a tattoo depicting being in God's hands, which he told USA Today in 2009 was meant as a nod to his older brother and late father. Messages seeking comment were left for Hernandez's lawyers. They have said Hernandez looks forward to proving his innocence. Spiderwebs are commonly used to represent time served in jail, as are clocks without hands (library image)","Gangsters tattoos often denote types of crime committed or time in jail .

"An Arizona pharmaceuticals tycoon asked California's attorney general to review findings that his girlfriend killed herself by tying her wrists and ankles and hanging herself naked from a balcony of his historic mansion, according to a letter released on Tuesday. Jonah Shacknai said he hoped the review would give 'confidence, comfort and resolution' to those questioning whether Rebecca Zahau committed suicide on July 13 at his Coronado mansion near San Diego. Mr Shacknai, 54, said he had no reason to doubt findings by authorities in San Diego County that his 32-year-old girlfriend killed herself two days after his six-year-old son accidentally fell while under her watch and died days later. Scroll down for video . Suicide: Rebecca Zahau, right, was found hanging naked at Jonah Shacknai's mansion in Coronado, California . Mr Shacknai said his family is being harmed by 'vicious speculation and innuendo in certain media outlets' about the deaths. 'I believe the only way to achieve some dignified resolution for . everyone who has been touched by the horrible events of this summer will . be through the efforts of your office,' Mr Shacknai wrote in a letter . dated September 19 and released by his public relations firm on Tuesday. Lynda Gledhill, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Kamala . Harris, declined to comment beyond acknowledging the letter had been . received. Investigators believe Ms Zahau tied rope to bedposts and around her wrists . and ankles. They suspect she loosely tied her wrists together in front of . her before slipping one hand out, putting her hands behind her back and . reinserting her wrist into the loop of rope. Manchester United fan: Max was revealed to have broken his spinal cord in his fall, and was not breathing and had no pulse when he was found . They said her DNA was found on a knife, rope and bedposts, along with her footprints on a dusty balcony. Ms Zahau's family immediately questioned the findings disclosed on September 2 . that included a video reenactment of how they think she bound her . wrists. The anguished family is hoping the . sheriff's office will take another look at the case after the pink rope . cops said she used to hang herself is not visible in a video released . last week. Mr Shacknai acknowledged in his letter that the circumstances of . Zahau's death were 'undeniably strange'. Zahau family attorney Anne Bremner did not immediately respond to a . phone message seeking comment on Mr Shacknai's request. Neither did . officials with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, which ruled . her death a suicide. Mr Shacknai is founder and chief executive of Medicis Pharmaceuticals . Corp, a company based in Scottsdale, Arizona, that makes acne treatments . Solodyn and Ziana and facial wrinkle treatment Restylane and Dysport, a . competitor of Botox. He owns the 27-room waterfront mansion in Coronado, where he lived . during the summer with Ms Zahau, his girlfriend of two years. His son was . from a marriage that ended in divorce in 2008. Officers, however, . admitted last Monday that there were bruises on Miss Zahau's scalp and a . T-shirt had been wrapped around her neck and stuffed in her mouth. Police . released the extra details about the autopsy report that concluded she . had committed suicide, after parts were found to have been withheld from . the public. They had come . under pressure to release more information after findings leaked to the . media showed that there were possible reasons to question the finding . that she committed suicide. 'As in any comprehensive investigation, some findings cannot be entirely explained,' an official said. Death: Rebecca Zahau, 32, left, died at the mansion of Jonah Shacknai, 54, right in Coronado, California, in July, just two days after his son Max, 6, who she was looking after, was gravely hurt from a fall off the stairs . 'None . of the observations listed... are inconsistent with the conclusions . reached regarding the cause and manner of death of Rebecca Zahau.' Dr . Lucas said the bruises were minor and may have been caused when Ms . Zahau slipped over the balcony with the rope around her neck. The . t-shirt in the mouth is not unusual, he added. 'It is not clear why it . was there, although people can place material in her mouth prior to . hanging,' he said. He said blood found on her thighs was not the result of rape but probably due to . an intrauterine device or menstruation. Despite those findings, a . leading pathologist questioned the suicide conclusion. Dr . Cyril Wecht, who has consulted on high profile cases including the . assassination of President John F Kennedy, the drug overdose of Elvis . Presley and the OJ Simpson case, said a number of factors in the ruling . did not add up. While Dr . Wecht stopped short of saying it was murder, he is not content to rule . it a suicide. He said the report needed a lot more scrutiny. Now you see it, now you don't: The family of . Rebecca Zahau want authorities to reopen the case after a video shows . the same mansion balcony without the rope the sheriff's office said she . used to kill herself . Murder or suicide? The 'pink rope,' shown in this crime scene photo, is what police say Rebecca Zahau hanged herself with at her boyfriend's California mansion . Tragic home: The historic 27-room Spreckels mansion in Coronado, an affluent suburb of San Diego, where Jonah Shacknai's girlfriend was found hanging naked . From above: An aerial view of the historic mansion in California where the tragedy happened in July . 'When . you put all of this together, it just is bothersome' Dr Wecht told . KFMB-AM. 'The manner of death I would have left as undetermined.' On . the t-shirt, which was removed from her mouth by Mr Shacknai's brother . Adam when he cut her down, Dr Wecht told KFMB-AM:  'What does she care . for that? ""Gee, I don't want to wake anybody up who may come to rescue . me."" 'I don't know. I'm just . trying to think. She didn't want to be rescued and didn't want to . scream so she put it in her mouth? It's absurd.' Regarding . the tape residue, Dr Wecht speculated Miss Zahau could have planned to . bind her feet with duct tape and then switched to rope. But he added to . KFMB-AM: 'Well then, where's the duct tape?' Message: Police covered the writing that appeared on a door in the mansion that allegedly said: 'She saved him, can he save her' He . also questioned why her feet were bound. And Dr Wecht was . concerned by haemorrhages found under her scalp surface, saying it was . evidence of blunt force trauma. 'For someone to say there isn't any kind . of struggle is not correct,' he told KFMB-AM. It was revealed on September 2 that before she died, Miss Zahau painted a message in black paint on a door. According . to Miss Zahau's ex-husband, Neil Nalepa, it read: 'She saved him, can . he save her.' Her family contends that she did not die by her own hand. Ms Zahau’s sister Snowem Horwath said: 'Becky did not kill herself, someone killed her.' 'Time will reveal who killed Becky.  I think I know who killed my sister. We are not stupid, she never had any enemies.' The . family is calling for a forensic psychiatrist and a criminal profiler . to investigate the case and say the cryptic message in black paint was . not in her handwriting. But authorities said the paint from the message was still on her hands and on the rope when she died. The death of Max Shacknai, who fell over a staircase railing, was ruled an accident. His neck was broken and he was found not breathing and with no pulse by Ms Zahau at the bottom . of the stairs after she heard a noise and came to look. She was the only . adult at home at the time. Two . days later, Adam Shacknai, called 911 to report that Miss Zahau . appeared to be dead, investigators said. Jonah Shacknai was not at home . as he was at his son's hospital bedside . When . Miss Zahau's naked body was found hanging from the mansion's balcony . with her ankles and wrists bound, investigators were quick to say they . weren't ruling out suicide. They eventually determined there was no . evidence of foul play, sexual assault or a struggle, authorities said. She was alive when she went over the balcony and she died by hanging. There were no alcohol or drugs in her system. She died at about 3am and was found at 6.45am by Jonah Shacknai's brother Adam, who was staying in a mansion guesthouse. Mr . Shacknai has two children with his first wife, Kimberly. Max was his . only child with his second wife, Dina, whom he divorced in 2008 . The . home where the tragic incidents occurred, known as the Spreckels mansion, is one of the more storied . properties in Coronado, a small suburb of multimillion-dollar homes on . the tip of a peninsula across a bay from downtown San Diego. The . home has unobstructed beach views and sits near Coronado's main street, . which is lined with palm trees and upscale boutiques. Jonah Shacknai bought the mansion in March 2007, when it was assessed at $12.75million. The . home was built in 1908 and named for its original owner, newspaper . mogul John D.

"A surfer had a lucky escape over the weekend when a 15-foot Great White shark knocked him off his board in the waters off of La Selva Beach in California. The shark took a huge bite out of Beau Browning's board on Saturday when he was still tethered to it, pulling him underwater for around five terrifying seconds. 'And he finally let go, and I let go of my leash and I was finally able to get up to the surface,' said Browning. Close call: Beau Browning's surf board reveals how close he came to being bitten by the great white shark off the coast of California . The brush with death for Browning happened at sundown, as he prepared to stop his surfing for the day. 'I caught my second wave, and barely got into it, and out of nowhere, I was popped into the air by probably like 10-15 feet. looked down and saw a shark,' said Browning to KSBW. 'He took a bite on the way down.' After the attack Brown said he felt more in danger of drowning than being attacked by the shark because he was still tethered. No grudge: Beau Browning said that despite his lucky escape he bears no ill-will toward the great white shark . However, despite his frightening experience, Brown does not hold any grudges against the shark. 'They were just doing what they’re designed to do,' the surfer said. 'And they thought I was something else. And that’s all it is. I got no hard feelings against sharks.' The shark attack on Browing was the seventh in Santa Cruz County in the last 88 years. Not one of these attacks has resulted in a human fatality.",Beau Browning was attack on Saturday off the coast of California .
"Your Facebook posts are typically seen by three times as many people as you think they are, claims a new study. Researchers at Stanford University found that users of the social media platform drastically underestimate the number of people looking at their content based on factors including how often their friends post, plus how many likes, comments and shares they receive. ‘Posting to a social network site is like speaking to an audience from behind a curtain. The audience remains invisible to the user: while the invitation list is known, the final attendance is not,’ writes Stanford assistant professor Michael S. Bernstein in the study. Researchers at Stanford University found that Facebook users drastically underestimate the number of people looking at their content . New research has found that people's Facebook posts are typically seen by three times as many people as they think they are . ‘Feedback such as comments and likes is the only glimpse that users get of their audience.’ While Facebook does have access to data about how many people look at each post, it only shares this information with advertisers and not with ordinary users. The research suggests that is a situation that Facebook wants to maintain because users would post differently if they had a proper breakdown of who was viewing their content. The researchers found that what users post is based on the reactions that they have received to what they’ve posted in the past. Users with the same number of friends have highly variable audience sizes . If people knew that their posts were having much less impact on their audience they might choose to post less frequently which would be a disaster for Facebook which like all successful social media platforms depends on user interaction. The research, carried out in tandem with Facebook’s data science team, looked at 220,000 users over the course of a month. They found that Facebook users reached 35 per cent of their friends with each post and 61 per cent of their friends over the course of a month. The number of unique friend leaving likes is positively associated with audience size, but has a large variance . The researchers suggest that users are also happy to underestimate the size of their audience because if a post receives little or no comments it is more comforting to believe that few people saw it rather than accept that many people saw it but few liked it. ‘I think this is something we need to better understand,’ Bernstein told Buzzfeed, arguing that fear of rejection is just one of many possible reasons Facebook users underestimate their audience. ‘When I post content, do people not react to it but enjoy it? Do they not react to it and it is grating on them over time and they choose to unsubscribe? We don’t know.’ The researchers are keen to carry out more in-depth analysis of social media and how people react with it.","Researchers at Stanford University found that people drastically underestimate how many people are looking at their updates .

"Lorna Smalley, 37, lost her memory after developing encephalitis - inflammation of the brain. She is pictured with her daughter, Jasmine, and her husband, Mark . A mother who lost her memory after being struck down by a life-threatening illness is able to care for her daughter again thanks to dozens of daily iPhone reminders. Lorna Smalley, 37, lost almost two years of her memory after being diagnosed with encephalitis - inflammation of the brain. Her memory loss was so severe that while she was in hospital for a month, she did not ask after her two-year-old daughter and even asked whether she was Chinese. But her miraculous recovery means she can now care for Jasmine again and has returned to work - with the help of iPhone reminders that make up for her occasionally unreliable short-term memory. Up to 10 reminders a day tell her to pack her daughter’s nursery bag, when she needs to go to work and when to do everything from the washing up to the laundry. They also remind her of every family birthday and even her own wedding anniversary. Mrs Smalley, from Nottingham, said: ‘Although I remembered my daughter once she came to visit me in hospital, before that I hadn’t questioned why she wasn’t there and that’s scary. ‘Now I’m over the moon that I’m back to being a mum and back to work - even if I need a few reminders here and there!’ Mrs Smalley’s terrifying descent to losing her memory started when she woke up feeling unwell one morning in January 2013 and was sent home from work sick. The next . day her husband Mark, 40, came home to check on her at lunch time but . within hours she was struggling to focus and was taken into hospital. Her . husband went home from the hospital to care for their daughter Jasmine, . now three, but just a few hours later he was called back to say goodbye . as his wife’s condition had rapidly deteriorated. When he . arrived, a nurse called the two most recently dialled numbers on his . phone to summon his friends for support as doctors were sure Mrs Smalley . would not make it through the night. Amazingly, she survived the night despite being in and out of intensive care and spending more than a week in two drug induced comas. Her husband was warned she could face severe permanent brain damage. Mrs . Smalley’s doctor believes she had an autoimmune encephalitis when her . body started producing anti-bodies which attacked her brain. Encephalitis can have many different causes including an infection and abnormal immune system reactions. Mrs Smalley was so ill that doctors warned her husband she might not survive . Miraculously, Mrs Smalley recovered but she was left with memory problems. She has now had to use family photographs to remind her of all the events she has forgotten . Medical . staff tried to help her body fight the disease with a plasma exchange . which had dramatic results and after two sessions she was able to sit up . and eat a sandwich. A . plasma exchange, also known as plasmapheresis, is a . procedure where a machine is used to separate plasma from the other . components of a patient’s blood. During . the procedure, the plasma is removed and replaced with a substitute and . the red cells, white cells and platelets are returned to the patient. Encephalitis is an uncommon but serious condition that causes inflammation of the brain. It usually begins with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature and a headache. More serious symptoms can then develop. These include confusion, disorientation, seizures and changes in personality. There are several different types of encephalitis that have different causes. The most common are caused by infections or an autoimmune reaction. The illness requires urgent treatment - usually in an intensive care unit and about 10 per cent of cases are fatal. Some people make a full recovery but many experience permanent brain damage. This can cause complications such as memory loss, epilepsy, personality changes and fatigue. Source: NHS Choices . But when Mrs Smalley woke up there were significant gaps in her memory. She . had no idea why she was in hospital and for a week she had to be . constantly reminded that she’d had a miscarriage a month before. It . was only when her husband brought Jasmine to visit her just before she . returned home that Mrs Smalley realised she had not once asked after the . daughter she had given birth to and looked after for the previous two . years. She finally left hospital a month after being admitted and has been trying to remember the missing bits of the puzzle ever since. As well as her daily reminders, she wrote a diary when she left hospital to document everything she re-learned and to try and make sure she didn’t forget anything again. She had to look through photos of family holidays to try and fill in the gaps in her memory and has shocked herself by forgetting the way round Nottingham where she has lived for 18 years. Sadly, she has had to grieve twice for a friend who she had forgotten had died. When Mrs Smalley found a letter from her friend’s mother thanking her for a donation to a memorial fund, she found herself mourning for the second time. But psychometric tests have proved she’d retained all the necessary information to work as a practice pharmacist and is making a gradual return to her job. Mrs Smalley said: ‘It’s bizarre that I’ve remembered some things so well but I can’t for the life of me remember some holidays and certain events. ‘I’ve forgotten almost anyone new I’d met in the last two years as well basic things like where everything was in our house. 'I’ve spent months looking for a box of light bulbs that I put in a safe place and now can’t remember where I put them. Mrs Smalley now keeps a diary to ensure that she doesn't forget anything else . ‘I don’t remember anything about the . time I was sick. No matter how many times people tell me about it, it . still doesn’t sink in. I don’t know how it could happen so quickly. ‘I really thought of myself as very clued up on even the most obscure medical conditions but I’d never even heard of encephalitis. ‘I don’t think I’ll ever forget the word now!’ Mr Smalley, an accountant, said: ‘Lorna had always been a list maker but now it’s that with bells on! ‘We’re just trying to get back to life that’s as normal as possible with the almost constant alarms. ‘It was awful when she first went into hospital and she was hooked up to machines with tubes to help her breathe and eat. ‘She looked like she was barely alive - I didn’t know how that could be. ‘Because you don’t have a big list of all the things you know, once she came back from hospital she just gradually realised what she had forgotten and we had to piece her memory back together. ‘Lorna was in bits when she re-realised that her friend had died. But we had already grieved once. ‘When she came out of hospital it wasn’t the Lorna that went in, and it was really difficult because she didn’t remember much of what we had shared together, but thankfully that’s gradually come back and we’re a couple like we were.’ Dr Ava Easton, Chief Executive of the Encephalitis Society said: ‘There are around 6,000 new cases of encephalitis diagnosed in England each year alone and although there are many different outcomes, depending on how the individual was affected, memory loss can be severe.’ For more information about encephalitis visit the Encephalitis Society website.","Lorna Smalley, 37, suddenly started to feel unwell in January last year .

"A 25-year-old woman has become the fifth person in her family to be diagnosed with a devastating brain disease. Kirsty Skinsley has Huntington’s disease – an inherited condition that damages the brain cells causing problems with movement, behaviour and cognition. She is thought to be one of the youngest people in the UK diagnosed with the disease which usually develops in adulthood, after first suffering symptoms when she was 15. Ms . Skinsley, from Southport, Merseyside, said: ‘The doctors told me that it . would be surprising if I had Huntington’s at such a young age. Kirsty Skinsley, 25, has become the fifth person in her family to be diagnosed with a devastating brain illness . Ms Skinsley has Huntington's disease as does her brother, Liam, (also pictured as a child) and father, Brian. Her grandmother, Sarah Skinsley, and aunt, Paula Edwards, have already died from the disease . Huntington's is an incurable disease caused by an inherited faulty gene, which produces a protein called Huntingtin. It's not known how, but the gene causes widespread damage to the nerve cells in the brain, causing a range of symptoms. Sufferers can exhibit emotional and mental changes such as mood swings, clumsiness, lack of motivation, aggression and depression which, in the early stages, can often be written off as simple personality traits. Later, they develop physical problems such as the shakes or nervous tics, then weight loss and muscle weakness which leave the patient unable to swallow, speak or move. Every sufferer has a different rate of deterioration, but it is a fatal condition. On average, patients live for between 10 and 20 years after their diagnosis. Huntington's disease is estimated to affect around 8,000 people in the UK. In adults the symptoms usually appear between the ages of 35 and 50, although until a blood test was introduced around 20 years ago, it was very difficult to diagnose it at an early stage. In rare cases, symptoms can start to develop in childhood. To inherit the condition a child has to have just one parent who has it - if a person has the faulty gene, there is a 50 per cent chance each of their children will inherit it. Sufferers are typically aged between 30 and 50 years old and each child whose parent has Huntington’s has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the faulty gene. There . is no way of slowing down or stopping the progression of the disease . and sufferers usually get progressively worse for 10 to 20 years before . eventually dying. ‘Becoming . 21 is a milestone and I didn’t want to go into the next stage of my . life not knowing what lay in store for my future,’ Ms Skinsley said. ‘Although I knew that Huntington’s was on the horizon, doctors had said it was so unlikely I had it so young so I was surprised when they told me. ‘I was in denial for a long time as is expected with any terminal diagnosis and I didn’t want to open up to anyone about it. ‘Doctors told me they hadn’t dealt with someone with Huntington’s as young as me before.’ The former optician suffers from involuntary movements which are managed with medication and says she has good and bad days. Her father, Brian, and brother, Liam have also been diagnosed with the condition, and the 25-year-old has already watched as the disease claimed the lives of her grandmother and aunt. Her grandmother, Sarah Skinsley, died of the disease at 38, and her aunt, Paula Edwards, died at 42. The future is uncertain for Ms Skinsley and she fears she will not be able to do everything her friends may experience in their lifetimes. She said: ‘I see my mates getting mortgages and having babies and I do feel like I’m missing something. ‘I’d love to think I would get the family and marriage situation but I don’t know what the futures holds for me. Ms Skinsley (pictured with her mother, Donna) experiences involuntary muscle movements and behavioural changes and knows the illness is progressive so wants to experience as much as possible now . Ms Skinsley (pictured before her illness) is trying to raise money for the Huntington's Disease Association . ‘I would like to think it will happen. There . is treatment sort of like an IVF process now which ensures  genetically . that the embryos they insert don’t have the condition, so I would do . that. ‘I . do get sad that I don’t have that normality that others have but I have . amazing family and friends and I try my best to stay grounded and . positive.’ She is determined not to succumb to her . illness and has written a bucket list of things she wants to do before . the disease worsens. So far she wants to meet her idol Pink, do a parachute jump and have a dream holiday in Mexico to swim with dolphins. She will also be cycling from Cornwall to Sheffield on June 9 to raise money for the Huntington’s Disease Association.

"It was a time when John McEnroe vied each year for the Wimbledon title – but his activities away from the championships would have shocked his fans. The former tennis world No 1 would relax between matches by smoking marijuana with his pop-star friend Chrissie Hynde, she has claimed. Pretenders singer Hynde said: ‘Way back in the days when he was doing Wimbledon, he would always call me because he knew I had pot. He used to come around and hang out.’ Pop star Chrissie Hynde (left) has claimed that she used to smoke cannabis with tennis player John McEnroe while he was competing in Wimbledon (right, McEnroe wins in 1981) McEnroe first competed at Wimbledon in 1977 aged 18, when he got to the semi-final, and won the tournament in 1981, 1983 and 1984. Miss Hyde’s band found success in the same period, topping the charts with their single Brass In Pocket in 1979. While Miss Hynde’s memories will surprise fans of McEnroe, who know him only from his more sober image nowadays as a BBC commentator, he was once the ‘bad boy’ of tennis, notorious for his on-court confrontations with umpires. He is an able guitarist and he and Miss Hynde remain good friends. McEnroe has appeared on stage with The Pretenders numerous times and he plays on her recent solo album, Stockholm. In an interview with NPR, a US radio station, Miss Hynde, 62, said she tried to encourage McEnroe to quit tennis because he has ‘such personality’ when he plays the guitar.

"Former Gossip Girl actress Kelly Rutherford burst into tears outside of a Manhattan federal courthouse Wednesday after losing her 11th-hour legal bid to keep her two children in the U.S. Rutherford, 45, has been locked in a battle to prevent her son and daughter from being sent back to France, where they live with her ex-husband, Daniel Giersch. The children are scheduled to get on a plane to return to their father next Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Major setback: Kelly Rutherford, pictured here with her son and daughter in the latest issue of Hamptons magazine, was dealt a major blow Wednesday when a federal judge refused to step in to prevent the children from being sent back to their father in France . This morning, Ms Rutherford appealed to a federal judge in Manhattan asking him to keep her children with her, but Judge Andrew Carter Jr responded that he did not have jurisdiction to step in and overrule a California judge who made a decision in the custody case in 2012. Following the hearing, Kelly Rutherford was seen sobbing in reaction to the ruling. 'My own country won't save my children, and I pay taxes!' she exclaimed outside the courthouse, according to TMZ. Rutherford, however, still has one more chance to keep her children in the country. The federal judge assigned to the case scheduled a conference call Friday with the actress, her ex-husband and his attorney to try and work out a way for Mr Giersch to live in the U.S. Giersch, who is a German citizen residing in France, was deported from the U.S. over allegations of visa fraud. If this final effort fails, Rutherford’s children will be put on a plane en route to France next Tuesday. After the emotional court hearing, Rutherford complained that her children, 7-year-old Hermes and 5-year-old Helena, who are American citizens, are being essentially deported from their home country while she is being forced to pay taxes to support the parents of children 'who illegally crossed our borders,' according to Page Six. She added that something like this could have never happened anywhere else, especially not in Germany. Bittersweet: Kelly's two children have been spending their summer vacation with mom in New York. But they are supposed to return to their father Daniel Griesch next Tuesday. Kelly had petitioned the federal government to allow the children to stay in the US claiming they had been deported to France illegally in the first place . Judge . Carter responded to Rutherford’s claims by stating that her son and . daughter are not being deported in the official sense, meaning that . their constitutional rights are not being violated, Page Six reported. Meanwhile, RadarOnline revealed  Wednesday evening that the former Gossip Girl star could face . kidnapping charges if she fails to return her two children to their . father as required under the 2012 custody decision. Giersch's . legal team is said to be furious at Rutherford and her continued . machinations to keep her children in the U.S. - especially in light of . the fact that the father of two allegedly paid for his ex-wife’s trips . to France. Rutherford's . efforts were dealt a blow by a memorandum handed down yesterday by . Attorney General Eric Holder and Director of Homeland Security Jeh . Johnson. They . slapped down the Gossip Girl star's August 5 petition, which claimed . that the children had been illegally deported by a California court. They have been here with her on summer holiday. In its filing, the recommendation of Holder and Johnson read, in part: The Court should decline Petitioners’ request that the United States take custody of them [the children] for the following reasons: . (1) no subject matter jurisdiction exists over the Petition for Writ of Mandamus because the Respondents have no mandatory duty to take custody of Petitioners; (2) no subject matter jurisdiction exists because sovereign immunity bars the Court from requiring the Respondents to take custody of Petitioners; (3) no subject matter jurisdiction exists because Petitioners have not been deported and fail to raise a federal question. A California court ruled two years ago that the children . should live in France with ex-husband Daniel Griesch. Wendy Murphy, Rutherford's attorney, told MailOnline: 'Kelly has no intention of violating the California judge's order. Heavyweights: Kelly's high-powered legal team in her attempt to keep her children in the US includes Alan Derschowitz,  Robert M Wallack . 'This . is about Kelly's children and their civil rights. This legal action is . the only way for the children to enforce their rights as U.S. citizens. 'No . person, especially an American child, should be forced to leave the . United States unless a federal authority makes that decision in a manner . consistent with the Constitution. 'That . did not happen with Kelly's children and we are simply asking a federal . authority to make a decision consistent with the children's fundamental . rights as Americans.' The . court documents seen by MailOnline are the latest twist in a bitter . battle that has gone on since Rutherford, 45, and Griesch, 39, a German . businessman, divorced in 2010 after four years of marriage. It has . left Rutherford emotionally exhausted, desperate and having filed for . bankruptcy with $2million in debt after spending all her earnings from . Gossip Girl on legal fees and flights to France to see her children. MailOnline revealed last week that Rutherford had filed a lawsuit at the Federal Appeals . Court of the Southern District of New York in Manhattan on behalf of . herself and her children. She sued the U.S. government, including Attorney General Holder and . Jeh Johnson, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, because . she claims that an earlier ruling by a California Superior Court judge . that her children should live in France was unlawful. Only federal . courts can deal with matters of deportation. she argues. She . wanted the US District Court in New York court to grant her ‘temporary . emergency authority’ over her children and an order saying the previous . ruling was ‘unconstitutional’. Marriage woes: Kelly left Daniel Giersch in 2009 while she was pregnant with their second child after the German businessman's visa was revoked. A judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012 . In strong language, Rutherford said it amounted to an ‘illegal deportation’. The . lawsuit stated: ‘Emergency relief is necessary because the children are . currently physically located in New York, but they are required to . return to France on August 19, 2014… . ‘...the children are left with no option but to seek relief from this court because there is no alternative means by which they can obtain a legal remedy allowing them to remain in their own country’. The lawsuit says the case is ‘highly unusual’ and raises the possibility of Rutherford breaking the law to ensure that her children stay in the US. It states that children’s ‘only hope of obtaining relief from this court would be to have their mother retain them in the United States, in violation of California order… . ‘...Such an option would deny the children a meaningful remedy and expose the mother and the children to unjust punishment’. Holding tight: Kelly will be devastated if her children have to fly back to her ex on Tuesday. She's spent all her earning fighting the California custody order and flying to see them . Rutherford has also demanded that steps be taken to see if Giersch could be given a visa to enter the U.S. to see his children. The only . reason the current arrangements were decided as such was because he . cannot enter the U.S., allegedly because he lied to get a visa in the . past. Rutherford, . who played Blake Lively's mother in Gossip Girl, has custody of her . children 50 per cent of the time but they live and go to school in . France. But the real issue is the rancor between the two sides, which has never been resolved. According . to court documents obtained by TMZ, trust broke down between the pair so . badly that Rutherford hired a private eye to spy on Giersch 'in . relation to certain issues regarding child custody and other matters'. Soon . after the birth of their daughter, who was born after they split, . Giersch put out a statement which said: 'I was never informed by Kelly . about the birth of our daughter, nor was I invited to attend. Kelly films a scene from Gossip Girl with Blake Lively. Kelly says she spent all her earnings trying to win back her children . 'In . fact, I found out about it through Internet reports like everyone else. Although this sickens me, I am of course overjoyed that our baby was . born healthy. 'I would’ve wanted nothing more than to hold our newborn daughter for a few moments, and I only seek to co-parent both our children responsibly and with love.'","Federal Judge Andrew Carter Jr refused to step in to keep Rutherford's children in the country .

"What could be the next record-breaking divorce settlement might have gotten more expensive, as the estimated amount of oilman Harold Hamm's fortune set to be divided has topped $17 billion, according to an analysis presented as evidence in their divorce trial. Hamm's personal wealth was previously estimated to be $11.3 billion by Forbes in 2013 . The analysis of Kenneth Button, an expert witness hired by Hamm's wife Sue Ann, was laid out in court testimony and in a document provided to Reuters by Oklahoma County Judge Howard Haralson. It is one of the first pieces of financial testimony to be released from the trial, which has been conducted mostly in secrecy. Unusually for a divorce case, Haralson has barred the public from the courtroom on most days and sealed most of the evidence. He says he is trying to protect shareholders in Hamm's Continental Resources from the release of confidential business information. Through his 68 percent stake in Continental, a leading driller in North Dakota, Harold Hamm is believed to own the most oil in the ground of any American. Over a barrel: Sue Ann Hamm (left) is suing for divorce from her husband, Oklahoma oilman Harold Hamm. The estimated size of Harold Hamm's fortune rose to more than $17b in a new analysis released by the court. Sprawl: The son of a sharecropper, Harold Hamm eventually amassed a large enough fortune in the Bakken oil fields to buy two adjoining mansions in a posh area of Oklahoma . The family also worked to keep word of the divorce from going public. The case was originally titled Jane Doe vs. John Doe when Sue Ann filed the suit in 2012, alleging that her husband was unfaithful. The identity of the parties was only discovered in March of 2013. The couple was married in 1988 and has two daughters, Jane and Hillary, from the marriage. The The family split its time between four homes, including a two-mansion family enclave in Nichols Hills, Oklahoma, with its own combination basketball and tennis court, which the couple bought in 2009. Harold Hamm also has three children from a marriage that ended in divorce in 1987. Behind closed doors, the case has had its own sensationalistic highlights. Sue Ann went through the trouble of installing surveillance equipment in the home beginning in 2007, according to court documents. One bill alone was to the tune of $9,866.09. Lawyers for Harold are demanding the 'home video or audio recordings' be turned over, in an attempt to show their separation effectively occurred before 2012. The recently introduced document, a trial exhibit marked ""confidential business information,"" is a 122-page report compiled by Button, a PhD economist. Haralson released the report after determining it isn’t subject to the protective order he has placed in the case. Button's report contends that up to $15 billion of the growth in Continental's market capitalization during the period he studied is ""active"" marital capital, or subject to division between the spouses. Button crunched data from the years between the couple’s 1988 wedding and February 2014. Rags to riches: The son of a poor sharecropper, Harold Hamm rose to become the head of an oil exploration company worth billions. He was honored as one of Time's Most Influential People in 2012. On the range: Harold Hamm, his wife and two daughters, Jane and Hilary, enjoyed the benefits of the Bakken boom . Since then, Continental's value has grown by nearly $4 billion more, adding to the wealth the court may divide, Button said in court last week. About $2.6 billion of that appreciation would accrue to Harold through his 68 percent stake in Continental. All told, Button's analysis suggests that the marital capital subject to division could add up to some $17.6 billion. If Judge Haralson accepts Button's reasoning and awards Sue Ann a significant share of the marital estate, the Hamm split could yield the largest divorce settlement ever. If Hamm has to sell Continental shares to finance a large settlement, his control of the company could be eroded. Attorneys for Harold Hamm and for Continental didn't respond to questions from Reuters. Harold's witnesses will testify later in the trial, which began last week and is expected to end in October. The dubious distinction of most expensive divorce settlement goes to Russian businessman Dmitry Rybolovlev, who forked over $4.5 billion to his ex-wife Elena after their divorce concluded this year. The marriage of Elena and Dmitry, both 47, had soured recently, leading into a years-long divorce proceeding. Buy me love: Dmitry Rybolovlev holds the distinction of paying the most for a divorce settlement, paying his ex-wife Elena $4.5 billion in a settlement . 'He was not very subtle with his infidelities,' Elena's lawyer David Newman told the Daily News of Dmitry. The business magnate, nicknamed the 'fertilizer king,' was valued around $8.8 billion. During the divorce, he unloaded cash on various properties, including a share in French soccer club AS Monaco, two islands belonging to Aristotle Onassis and a $88 million apartment overlooking Central Park for his then-college-age daughter. Rybolovlev also reportedly had the opportunity to save himself some money. A $1 billion settlement deal was offered by Elena shortly before the court's decision that was nixed by a lawyer for Dmitry's trust. The divorce was first filed in 2008, when Elena said she had finally had enough with her husband's unfaithfulness. In documents submitted to the court, Elena described wild yacht parties where Dmitry shared 'young conquests with his friends, and other oligarchs'. What caused Continental's increase in value is critical to the outcome. Under Oklahoma law, any increase in the Hamms' net worth resulting from the active efforts of either spouse during the marriage is considered part of the marital estate. Continental's impressive growth itself isn't in dispute. According to Button's report, the Oklahoma-based driller was valued at between $10 million and $50 million when the couple wed in 1988. It is now worth around $27 billion.Sue Ann Hamm's legal team contends that this growth resulted largely from the active leadership and astute decision-making of Harold. He is widely credited as a pioneer in developing the Bakken Shale formation of North Dakota, America's largest oil discovery in decades.Harold's attorneys will try to show that Continental's growth resulted mostly from factors beyond his control. They signaled this strategy in their cross-examination of Button, pressing the economist to consider that external forces, such as higher oil prices and new drilling technologies, were decisive factors in Continental’s success. Button is trying to undercut Harold's position by comparing Continental's spectacular growth with that of rivals. The margin by which Continental's financial returns outpaced those of similar oil and gas companies should be considered Continental's ""active"" appreciation, the Button report says.It compares Continental's financial returns to those of 76 other publicly traded U.S. independent drillers.Continental and these ""peer companies,"" the report says, faced similar risks, opportunities and market conditions - such as fluctuating oil prices, choices among technologies and drilling locations, and methods to raise and deploy capital.Continental's return on investment was at least 44,271 percent during the Hamm marriage, Button wrote. The average return among peers - extrapolated over the same period - was a relatively modest 691 percent, the report says.Continental's outsize returns compared to its competitors are ""likely the results of difference over time in the specific operational decisions and actions of the management of these companies.""Hamm founded Continental in 1967, two decades before his marriage to Sue Ann, a former attorney at the company.Continental has said the divorce is a private matter that hasn't affected the business and isn't expected to. At the same time, Continental attorneys have submitted hundreds of thousands of pages of documents in the trial in support of Harold. They also have repeatedly persuaded the judge to seal evidence and close the courtroom to avoid damaging Continental's interests.","Harold Hamm, 68, accrued a fortune worth $17 billion according to the estimate of analyst hired by his wife Sue Ann, 56 .

A judge awarded him custody of the children in 2012 . Tug of love: Rutherford says her ex has not made any attempt to obtain a visa so he can come visit to the US. The arrangement for the children to live with their father was ostensibly made because Griesch allegedly lied to get a visa in the past . ‘...the children are left with no option but to seek relief from this court because there is no alternative means by which they can obtain a legal remedy allowing them to remain in their own country’. The lawsuit says the case is ‘highly unusual’ and raises the possibility of Rutherford breaking the law to ensure that her children stay in the US. It states that children’s ‘only hope of obtaining relief from this court would be to have their mother retain them in the United States, in violation of California order… . ‘...Such an option would deny the children a meaningful remedy and expose the mother and the children to unjust punishment’. But Wendy Murphy, Rutherford's attorney,  told MailOnline: 'Kelly has no intention of violating the California judge's order. 'This . is about Kelly's children and their civil rights. This legal action is . the only way for the children to enforce their rights as U.S. citizens. 'No . person, especially an American child, should be forced to leave the . United States unless a federal authority makes that decision in a manner . consistent with the Constitution. 'That . did not happen with Kelly's children and we are simply asking a federal . authority to make a decision consistent with the children's fundamental . rights as Americans.' Rutherford also demands that steps be taken to see if Griesch could be given a visa to enter the US to see his children. The only . reason the current arrangements were decided as such was because he . cannot enter the US, allegedly because he lied to get a visa in the . past. Rutherford, . who played Blake Lively's mother in Gossip Girl, has custody of her . children 50 per cent of the time but they live and go to school in . France. But the real issue is the rancor between the two sides, which has never been resolved. According . to court documents obtained by TMZ, trust broke down between the pair so . badly that Rutherford hired a private eye to spy on Giersch 'in . relation to certain issues regarding child custody and other matters'. Soon . after the birth of their daughter, who was born after they split, . Giersch put out a statement which said: 'I was never informed by Kelly . about the birth of our daughter, nor was I invited to attend. Kelly films a scene from Gossip Girl with Blake Lively. Kelly says she spent all her earnings trying to win back her children . 'In . fact, I found out about it through Internet reports like everyone else. Although this sickens me, I am of course overjoyed that our baby was . born healthy. 'I would’ve wanted nothing more than to hold our newborn daughter for a few moments, and I only seek to co-parent both our children responsibly and with love.' Nobody from Giersch’s legal team was available for comment.","The actress has filed an emergency petition with the US District Court asking The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security for a temporary restraining order to keep her children in the US .

"Next time you think about cheering somebody up when they are upset, perhaps it might be best to just leave them alone. Trying to make somebody smile when they are miserable could actually make them feel worse, a study has found. If you force a friend to grin when they are in a bad mood then their brain starts to associate it with sadness instead of joy. The study found that  faking a smile won’t cheer you up because it is just a ‘mask’ to inner sadness (file picture) And next time they smile it could bring back miserable memories instead of lifting the bad mood. The study suggests that the idea of grinning and bearing it might not be the best solution after all. It was carried out by Anirban Mukhopadhyay, an associate professor of marketing at Hong Kong University Science and Technology, who said you should wait until your unhappiness lifts before attempting a grin. He said: ‘Making people who are feeling bad smile could backfire and make them feel worse, because they may interpret smiling as trying to become happy. ‘Smiling frequently would remind them of being not happy’. The research team carried out three experiments: in the first 108 people completed a survey asking how often they smiled and whether they felt good about themselves. They also reported how happy they were with their lives in general. In the second experiment 63 people were shown funny pictures and were asked if they thought they were amusing. If you force someone to grin when they are in a bad mood, their brain starts to associate it with sadness instead of joy, the study by Hong Kong associate professor Anirban Mukhopadhyay found (file picture) In the third 85 people were asked to list situations when they felt happy and about their overall life satisfaction. They were also asked to perform facial exercises to put their faces in a smile like position. The study results showed that if you are faking a smile then it won’t cheer you up and that you are just using it to ‘mask’ your inner sadness. Professor Mukhopadhyay wrote: ‘Smiling by itself does not increase happiness, or wellbeing. ‘Instead, the belief that one must already be happy when one smiles is what increases happiness, and as a result, wellbeing.’ Professor Mukhopadhyay said that people who are naturally smiley people should carry on grinning - as it will still make them happy.","Smiling when unhappy makes people feel worse because it is just a 'mask'

"Air passengers are paying up to eight times as much for their seats as the person sitting next to them - including in coach class. Fliers are routinely being ripped off if they book a route which is popular with business travellers even if they are using it for a holiday. A study found that as a result air passengers were paying up to $1,200 (£710) more than they should on a flight that took just one hour. On board: Fliers are routinely being ripped off if they book a route which is popular with business travellers even if they are using it for a holiday (file picture) The findings will likely enrage consumers who are nowadays being forced to pay for many things that once came a standard. Airlines like Ryanair routinely hit passengers with hidden fees of $17 (£10) per trip and $120 (£70) for checking in at the airport. The study looked at flights in the US and found that some airlines had a greater price disparity between the lowest fares and the highest than others. Fares varied the least on Spirit Airlines, five per cent. On Virgin America they had a 15 per cent disparity, and United Airlines had 18 per cent variability. The study also looked at the amount it cost you if you booked the wrong seat. Flying between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, . a one hour journey, the highest paid for a seat in coach was $1,400 (£830) and . the cheapest was $200 (£120), a difference of $1,200 (£710). Differences: The study looked at flights in the US and found fares varied 15 per cent on Virgin America . Other fares were not so high in monetary terms but up to eight times more than the lowest seat. Overall, the study showed that flights to popular destinations like Hawaii were not so likely to have a price variability because consumers are more willing to switch to another airline. However trips to Washington DC and Chicago changed more because business travellers had to take them regardless, meaning the airlines could take advantage of them. The study was compiled by travel website Hopper.com, which advised passengers to book early and watch prices closely. Hopper.com analysed flight data using its own software which monitors 10million flight requests a day. The survey was carried out at the start of May.","Fliers paying up to $1,200 (£710) more than they should on hour's flight .

"If you have ever wondered why so many superhero films come out in the summer then the secret film industry calendar could have the answers. A comprehensive analysis going back to 1913 has found that Hollywood has been sticking to the same pattern of release dates for an entire century. February is when films about the Nazis are released and summer is when you can expect to see secret agents and space on the silver screen. Star Wars: A New Hope was released in May, along with many other movies featuring the buzzword 'princess' The Matrix: Martial arts-type films such as this 1990s classic tend to be released by the industry in March . Film season: Certain movies come out at certain times of the year depending on the topic they centre around . Films about princesses come out in May, Autumn is the time of The Bible and the end of the year is reserved for darker themes like abortion. TIME magazine gathered data on 8,298 movies on online film database IMDB that made at least £62,000 going back to 1913 to reveal the calendar. It matched up keywords with the release month for each film and found that there were distinct seasons that have been operating for decades. Hollywood has long used the colder months for more sobre themes - just before awards season - but the TIME analysis goes much further. It found that January is the most depressing month when films about death, melancholy and the 19th century are most likely to come out. Ben Hur came in at the start of the year in 1959 and featured Charleton Heston in the lead role where the body count includes Jesus and dozens of men in the brutal chariot racing scenes. Seasonal: Festive films such as Home Alone are always released in November ahead of the Christmas period . Superhero: Films with heroes and villains tend to be released in June, such as the original Batman which came out on June 23, 1989 . In January 1940 Gone with the Wind was released in which Vivien Leigh’s Scarlett O'Hara endures repeated heartbreak during the American Civil War. Come February Hollywood zeroes in on the Nazis with films like Cabaret, which is set in the Weimar Republic in Berlin in 1931. But by April the mood has lightened and there are a glut of erotic and college films. By May movies about the future dominate are a movies about princesses including Star Wars which ticks both boxes thanks to Princess Leia. Summer is the time of the blockbuster, with June being when you are most likely to see super heroes on the screen. Crime: Films featuring drug lords and elements of crime, such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) tend to be released in August, along with movies about demons and those aimed at young teenagers . On the ball: Football-related films  are released in September just after the start of the season. Green Street, which featured Elijah Wood and centred around football hooliganism, was released on September 9, 2005 . Batman came out in June 1989 and more recently the latest Superman reboot, Man of Steel, was released in the same month last year. Drug lords are one of the most popular themes in August where you will also most likely see an ensemble cast such as in the Wizard of Oz. September is the month of stalking films like Fatal Attraction, which came out in 1987. And as the weather gets cooler, the themes tend to get darker and keywords like ‘fear’ come up more often. Films about blackmail have a tendency to come out in October as do horror movies such as Halloween, which came out on the 25th of the month in 1978. Enchanting: Movies featuring ensemble casts, including The Wizard of Oz (1939) are often released in August . Death: Films in which one or all of the main characters die, including Titanic, tend to be released in December . The TIME analysis shows that December is deadly for main characters as that is when they are most likely to die - Titanic is a notable example. In the Poseidon Adventure, which came out in December 1972, Gene Hackman’s Rev Frank Scott sacrifices himself so the other survivors can leave their stricken cruise liner. December is also the season for epics such as Lord of the Rings and Avatar, TIME says.","Movie analysis shows certain films released at certain times of the year .

"The American doctor diagnosed with the deadly Ebola virus in Liberia says he will have no regrets if he cannot be saved, a friend revealed today. Kent Smith, . an elder at the South Central Alliance Churches in Fort Worth, Texas, . where Kent Brantly and his wife Amber worship, told MailOnline that the doctor has been frank . with friends. 'God's going to deliver me from this . but even if he doesn't I have lived my life for him and I have no . regrets,' he has said, Mr Smith told MailOnline. Dr Brantly, a 33-year-old father of two, is one of two Americans fighting for their lives. Married . missionary Nancy Writebol, from Charlotte, North Carolina, is also fighting for her life at a Liberian hospital as the continent struggles . against the worst ever outbreak in history. Devoted: Kent Brantly, pictured with his wife Amber and their two children, contracted Ebola while working with patients in Liberia. He and his family chose to stay in the country even after Ebola began to spread . Hopeful: A sign at Southside Church of Christ in Fort Worth, Texas offers support for Dr Brantly. There is only a 10 per cent survival rate for people who become infected with the incurable disease . Nearly 700 people have been killed by Ebola in West Africa, with 127 of those in Liberia, according to the World Health Organization, but the families of the Americans hope prayers will pull them through. Brave: Dr Brantly has said that he is putting his trust in God to help him defeat the Ebola virus . Speaking . from her home in Indianapolis, Indiana, Dr Brantly's mother Jan, 72, said she was in . 'daily contact' with her son's wife, Amber, and that she was praying . for them both. She . said: 'It's a very very stressful time. Kent is a fine young man, very . compassionate, doing what he’s prepared all his life to do. 'He’s placed his life in the hands of a loving God and our love in that God sustains us. 'We pray constantly for him and we solicit the prayer of the whole world. He's a brave man. He's doing what he's doing to serve his God and we are asking people to pray.' Outside of Brantley's church, a sign reads: 'Pray for Kent.' Infected: Nancy Writebol, pictured with her husband David, also became infected while working in Liberia . Brantly, who has been working . as medical director for an Ebola case management center run by . Samaritan's Purse, recognized that he had symptoms associated with Ebola . last week, Melissa Strickland, a spokeswoman for the North . Carolina-based charity, told the Dallas Morning News. The virus can go unnoticed for three weeks and . kills 90 per cent of those infected. Health workers are at serious risk . of contracting the disease, which spreads through contact with bodily . fluids. There . is no known cure for Ebola, which begins with symptoms including fever . and sore throat and escalates to vomiting, diarrhea and internal and . external bleeding. Brantly, . who had meticulously adhered to protocols when treating patients, . immediately isolated himself when he recognized the symptoms and . notified team members, Strickland said. He is now . being treated in an isolation center at a Liberian hospital and is in . stable condition. He is sitting up and working on his computer, . Strickland said. Cautious: Dr Brantly of Samaritan's . Purse relief organization is shown wearing protective clothing as he . works with Ebola patients in Liberia. Brantly is also being treated . after somehow becoming infected with the virus . At work: An image shows Brantly, left, wearing protective clothing and caring for patients in Monrovia . 'His fever . is fluctuating,' she said. 'He has some aches and pains... He's a very . dedicated person and a very strong person, and he’s fighting as we'd . expect someone like him to fight.' His . family, who had moved to Liberia with him, had returned to the U.S. for . a pre-planned trip last week, before he found out about his condition. They have shown no signs of the disease. MailOnline understands that his wife is not at their home in Fort Worth, Texas, but is elsewhere and staying with family. Before . heading to Liberia, Brantly, who graduated medical school in Indiana in . 2009, had worked as a resident at John Peter Smith Hospital, and he . completed his three year placement last year. Throughout . the residency, he and his wife managed to save money and pay off his . student debts so that they could head to Africa to become international . medical missionaries last October. They went to Liberia . as part of a two-year fellowship with Samaritan's Purse. 'The . caliber of a person like that who says, ""I'm going Africa, I'm going to . where people need me the most,"" it really speaks to you,' Robert . Earley, president and CEO of JPS Health Network, said Sunday, NBC reported. 'It speaks . to your heart.' Safe: Dr Brantly's wife and children went on a trip back to the U.S. before he started showing symptoms . Missed: Brantly and Writebol, right, are both in isolation, which is devastating for their families, friends said . Aparna . Raj Parikh, who had attended medical school with him, told the Dallas . News that he wasn't surprised that Brantly had put himself in danger to . help others. Photos of Brantly working in Liberia show . him in white coveralls made of a synthetic material that he wore for . hours a day while treating Ebola patients. Writebol . had moved to Liberia with her husband. She worked as a hygienist, . spraying protective suits worn by health care workers treating Ebola . patients in Monrovia, the Charlotte Observer reported. Writebol . and her husband David are not medical personnel, but rather Christian . missionaries with 15 years experience serving disease and . poverty-stricken third world nations. Originally . from Charlotte, North Carolina, the couple raised two sons before . moving overseas, first to Ecuador and Zambia before moving to Liberia. 'It's . just devastating news,' her pastor, Reverend John Munro, said. He . described the couple as religious, humble people who were desperate to . stay and help despite the congregation's fears. Taking care: Medical staff working with Medecins sans Frontieres prepare to bring food to patients kept in an isolation area at the MSF Ebola treatment centre in Kailahun in Sierra Leone . Caution: Sierra Leone now has the highest number of Ebola cases, at 454. The outbreak started in Guinea . Her husband, David, delivered the terrible news to the congregation over Skype, he said. 'He's . devastated,' Munro said. 'He can't really be with his wife. She’s in . isolation. Ebola is very contagious. She's not doing well. It's grim . news.' The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone in weeks. Dr. Samuel . Brisbane on Sunday became the first Liberian doctor to die in an . outbreak the World Health Organization says. A Ugandan doctor working in . the country died earlier this month. Brisbane, . who once served as a medical adviser to former Liberian President . Charles Taylor, was working as a consultant with the internal medicine . unit at the country's largest hospital, the John F. Kennedy Memorial . Medical Center in Monrovia. After . falling ill with Ebola, he was taken to a treatment center on the . outskirts of the capital, where he died, said Tolbert Nyenswah, an . assistant health minister. The current outbreak of Ebola has spread to at least four countries in West Africa since the start of the year. So far, it has claimed 672 victims, and infected 1,093. Countries affected include Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. The disease spreads through contact with blood, body fluids or contact with tissue from infected people or animals. It has only a 10 per cent survival rate. Civil . servant Patrick Sawyer collapsed at Lagos airport in Nigeria on July 20 . after flying in from Liberia, where he had attended the funeral of his . sister, who had also succumbed to the disease. His plane also landed in Togo on its way to Nigeria, prompting fears that the virus may have also reached a fifth country. Professor . Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University . of Aberdeen, said: ‘If the disease gets going in Nigeria it would be . cause for concern. ‘Nigeria has close links with the UK and many other countries.’ Nigeria, . Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are now screening air passengers – but . doctors say this may not be effective because Ebola has an incubation . period of two to 21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot. Symptoms . include high fever, bleeding and damage to the nervous system. There is . no vaccine or cure. It is spread by contact with infected blood or . other bodily fluids. All outbreaks since 1976 when Ebola was first identified have been in Africa, with the previous highest death toll being 280. Unprecedented: The outbreak has spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and has now killed a man in far more densely populated Nigeria. The outbreak is the deadliest ever of the terrifying disease as the death toll crept past 700 . As . the death toll continues to rise in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, a . fourth African country was alerted over the weekend to their own case . of Ebola: the far more densely populated nation of Nigeria. Nigerian . health authorities raced to stop the spread of Ebola on Saturday after a . man sick with one of the world's deadliest diseases brought it by plane . to Lagos, Africa's largest city with 21 million people. The . fact that the traveler from Liberia could board an international flight . also raised new fears that other passengers could take the disease . beyond Africa due to weak inspection of passengers and the fact Ebola's . symptoms are similar to other diseases. Nigerian . officials say a Liberian man died of Ebola in a Lagos hospital Friday . after arriving in the country on Tuesday. It is the first case of Ebola . to be confirmed in Nigeria since the current outbreak began in West . Africa earlier this year. Nigerian . Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said all ports of entry in the country . are now on 'red alert' and health officials are investigating all . people who had contact with the deceased.","American doctor and dad-of-two Kent Brantly was treating Ebola patients in Monrovia, Liberia when he recognized he had the symptoms .

"Philadelphia police have released surveillance video footage showing the group of teenage girls accused of assaulting a Temple University student with a brick. The 19-year-old woman, who has declined to be identified, was walking with her boyfriend just off campus on Friday evening when a group of about 10 teenage girls began taunting them and then followed them for a block. Police say one of the girls then struck the female student in the face with a brick while the other suspects tried to rob the student's boyfriend. The victim was left with dislocated teeth and a fractured jaw. Scroll down for more . Five juveniles have been taken into police custody in Philadelphia in relation to Friday's incident. The 15-year-old who used a brick to beat a 19-year-old student is expected to be charged with aggravated assault . The incident happened on Friday evening when a group of about 10 teenage girls began taunting a Temple student and her boyfriend . 'My boyfriend pushed the girl away from me that hit me in the face and then the girl’s sister came at me with a brick,' the victim told WCAU. 'I tried to get away as fast as I could. My teeth were halfway out of my mouth. I wasn’t thinking about anything besides getting to safety.' Police say the suspects then fled the area by boarding a local bus. Surveillance video was released on Monday and shows the suspects are a gang of teenage girls thought by police to be between the ages of 16 and 17. The victim said she was hit twice with the brick, first in the face and then in the side of the head. ‘Her teeth were out of place,’ her 20-year-old boyfriend said. ‘It was terrible, it was terrifying.’ Savage: The pair says they were attacked with a brick similar to the one being held by the reporter in this NBC Philadelphia report . Where it started: The couple was accosted on this street by the unruly mob, Temple's athletic fields are behind the green fencing . ‘I tried to get away as fast as I could,’ she added. ‘My teeth were halfway out of my mouth. I wasn’t thinking about anything besides getting to safety.’ The girl was rushed to the hospital and underwent hours of emergency surgery to both save and align her teeth. ‘All of her teeth were pushed into the back of her mouth,’ said her father. ‘Her five top, front teeth were bent all the way back from the gum.’ She has since been released from care and is expected to recover, but has a long way to go. ‘I’ve been eating my food through a straw,’ she lamented. Since the attack became public, another . Temple University student has come forward and claimed that she too was . attacked by a group of young girls in the same area at the same time. Horror corner: The gang became violent, grabbing and punching the teen girl before twice smashing her in the head with a large brick . The 20-year-old junior, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told NBC10.com she was text messaging a friend as she walked down the street when she was punched in the face. ‘I typed [the message] and lifted my head to start walking again and as I lifted my head up, there was a girl coming at me, swinging at me, and I was able to lean back. She barely hit my chin, and then she swung again and hit my mouth area and my neck and I was able to shove her away and sprint away,’ she said. The student said a group of seven to 10 girls took part in the unprovoked attack that left her with bruises. The girl said she was able to escape the gang’s clutches and run to her nearby house, just feet from the local police headquarters. Then on Monday evening another Temple student was attacked by a   pair of juvenile girls who attempted to steal her purse. Philadelphia Police and Temple Police are continuing to investigate.

"The two American doctors battling the Ebola virus are entering a ‘critical’ phase of their treatment, the head of the charity which sent them to Liberia has revealed. Bruce Johnson, President of SIM USA, told MailOnline that within the next few days we will know if Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol are likely to survive. He said that Ebola could turn for the worse within hours and that both the patients may soon begin to show signs of internal bleeding which could be fatal. Scroll down for video . Waiting for an answer: Nancy Writebol, pictured with her husband David, is entering a critical stage of her Ebola treatment and will either show signs of recovery or inevitable death . Mr Johnson also warned that unless the international community does more to stop what has become the most serious outbreak of Ebola in history then it will spark a ‘tsunami of destruction’ in Africa - and maybe beyond. Last week Dr Brantly, 33, from Forth Worth, Texas, was identified as the first American to be diagnosed with Ebola, which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects. Mrs Writebol, 60, an educator turned missionary from Charlotte, North Carolina, was the second. The condition update will be agonising for both their families - not least Dr Brantly’s wife Amber who is in the US with their two young children. Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol were in Liberia with SIM USA and Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian aid charity. Dr Brantly was treating the sick whilst Mrs Writebol was disinfecting medics as they left isolation wards. Hoping to survive: Dr. Kent Brantly is fighting Ebola to the best of his ability and will know whether or not he'll live sometime in the next few days . Mr Johnson told MailOnline that both were being treated in isolation private houses at the SIM compound near the Liberian capital Monrovia. Mrs Writebol was still in her home and her husband David has had to move out. Mr Johnson said he spoke to Dr Brantly on Monday and that he ‘wasn’t as good as he had been’. He said: ‘The situation is so fluid. One day it’s up, one day it’s down. He was up working on his computer, talking with people this is not a bed ridden situation. ‘He is moving, he is active. He is interactive and we are pleased with that’. Mrs Writebol is suffering from diarrhea but is talking and in touch with family via her computer on Skype and via email. Mr Johnson said: ‘Her husband David seems strong. He is handling this with faith but he is also realistic with Nancy and Kent. ‘This is not a light situation. This is a very serious situation but we are encouraged by how they are doing so far. ‘The next few days are critical in assessing the recovery of both of them’. Days may be numbered: If the doctors reach stage two of the disease blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red . SIM spokesman Palmer Holt said that the coming days are so important because symptoms would start to show that would indicate that the disease had entered its second, more serious phase. The first stage is characterised by fever, headaches, nausea, vomiting, a rash and diarrhea. The second however is haemorrhagic fever in which patients endure difficulty breathing and swallowing and agonising bleeding inside their body. Blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red. They die an agonising death. Generally patients who enter the second stage do not survive. Mr Johnson said that SIM USA had not yet identified how Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol had become infected but said that they take ‘extreme safety measures’ and follow guidelines from the Centre For Disease Control. He said: ‘Our hearts just break for them’. So far more than 600 people have been killed in the outbreak across West Africa that has infected more than 1,200. Liberia has closed its borders to help stop the disease amid fears that it could spread after a patient suffering from Ebola took a flight to Lagos in Nigeria. Mr Johnson said: ‘What we have here really is the potential for this to become a tsunami of destruction for the country of Liberia and that why we are calling on the international community to now respond. ‘It’s grown to such proportions that it’s overwhelming Samaritan's Purse and SIM and it needs others like the US to help. ‘It’s like a wildfire in the Western US. It’s like what happens to a small fire that continues to grow and no-one is trying to put it out. ‘This is preventable but right now SIM is the only care center for Ebola patients in Liberia and that has to change’.","Within the next few days we will know if Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol are likely to survive .

Smith allegedly admitted to police that one of the two victims said no then added, 'Yeah, but I thought she was saying 'no' for pleasure and not to stop having sex.' He did not consent to interview requests. Smith has pled not guilty and will be back in court on Oct. 27. His trial is set for December 2. Though school officials have said he has a right to play and his attorney has told reporters Smith is 'innocent until proven guilty,' he believes the charges are too much for the team to deal with. Smith allegedly admitted to police that one of the two victims said no then added, 'Yeah, but I thought she was saying 'no' for pleasure and not to stop having sex.'

These magnetic data images show the newly discovered monuments around Stonehenge . Another digital map, covered with red dots, highlights the location of new sites that have been discovered . Looking just below the surface, their extensive finds include evidence of 17 previously unknown wooden or stone structures. Scientists from Birmingham University spent four years mapping an area of five square miles in minute detail as part of the largest geophysical survey ever undertaken. Unveiling their findings yesterday at the British Science Festival in Birmingham, they described how advanced radar scanners were developed especially for the project to build up a digital map ten feet underground. Among the discoveries is a 100ft-long wooden building, or long barrow, around two miles from Stonehenge, built in 2400BC. Experts think it was the site of complex rituals, including the removal of flesh and limbs from dead bodies. The building is thought to have been used for seven generations by a single family before it was buried in chalk and forgotten for thousands of years. What . lies beneath: Archaeologists now believe that Stonehenge was at the . centre of a vast network of religious monuments. Among the discoveries . is a 100ft-long wooden building, or long barrow . Also unearthed were massive prehistoric pits, some of which appear to form astronomical and solar links with Stonehenge – confirming the belief that it was positioned to reflect the Sun’s movement. And the Durrington Walls ‘super-henge’ three miles away was revealed to have once been flanked by as many as 60 posts or stones up to ten feet high – suggesting a very similar structure to Stonehenge itself. Project leader Professor Vincent Gaffney said archaeologists had previously thought most of the site was just ‘green grass’. He added: ‘What we’re seeing is this unconscious elaboration of the Stonehenge landscape. 'Digital . map': The technology was able to produce a 3D reconstruction and . visualisation of the timber uprights that formed the mortuary building . of the long barrow . Experts think it was the site of complex rituals, including the removal of flesh and limbs from dead bodies. ‘You’ve got Stonehenge which is clearly a very large ritual structure which is attracting people from large parts of the country. But around it people are creating their own shrines and temples. We can see the whole landscape is being used in very complex ways.’ The way Stonehenge and its surroundings were laid out was a ‘highly theatrical arrangement,’ he said. As people approached the monument via an ancient procession route, it gradually emerged from the landscape. The structures cannot be accurately dated until they are excavated – and any decision over digging lies with English Heritage. A two-part BBC2 series – Operation Stonehenge: What Lies Beneath – starts tomorrow at 8pm.","Archaeologists believe site was centre of a network of religious monuments .

"Congressional Republicans, led by House Oversight Committee chair Darrell Issa,are planning another IRS coal-raking exercise for Wednesday, hauling the tax agency's commissioner in for a hearing about the nearly year-old tea party targeting scandal. Committee staff say the U.S. Department of Justice and the rest of the Obama administration haven't shown them any sign that they're investigating corruption in the awarding of income tax exemptions to nonprofit groups. An aide to one Republican committee member said Monday that the White House and the Treasury Department were already dangerously close to causing a constitutional crisis. 'They've blown off the subpoenas,' the aide said, referring to legal demands the committee issued to the IRS on August 2 and February 14. 'If the DOJ keeps dragging its heels too, and can just get away with it, why do we have an oversight committee in the first place? It's like the White House has never heard of the separation of powers.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . John Koskinen, a former CEO of Freddie Mac, is now in charge of the IRS and will face aggressive questions on Wednesday about a scheme to target right-wing groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for special tax benefits . Hundreds of small and politically conservative tea party groups were 'screwed'  by the IRS, according to House Oversight Committee chair Darrell Issa, a California Republican . 'Not even a smidgen of corruption': President Barack Obama told Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly on Super Bowl Sunday that the IRS's hands were clean, despite an ongoing investigation of the kind that the White House routinely refuses to comment on . The House of Representatives, controlled by the GOP, has already found Attorney General Eric Holder in criminal contempt for refusing to hand over documents in the botched 'Operation Fast and Furious' gun trafficking scheme. But Holder himself is the official responsible for enforcing the contempt finding, rendering him essentially outside the reach of Congress. And despite the White House's assurance that the Justice Department is investigating the most politically fraught IRS scandal since the Nixon administration, President Barack Obama said during a Super Bowl Sunday interview that he was already sure there was 'not even a smidgen of corruption' to be found – suggesting that he isn't reserving judgment until an investigation has concluded. In June 2013, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that the president thought political targeting by IRS officials was 'a problem.' Issa, a California Republican, is calling IRS top dog John Koskinen to testify Wednesday about what his agency has done to clean house. Beginning in early 2010, IRS officials routinely held up tax-exempt applications from conservative organizations, including 'tea party'-named groups, whose positions differed from the president's. Some groups waited more than three years for their approvals, while politically liberal groups were fast-tracked. Foot-dragging? Attorney General Eric Holder has promised to investigate the IRS's actions, but Oversight Committee Republicans say the Justice Department won't show any evidence it's actually happening . Obama sacked the then-acting commissioner, Steven Miller, promising in the White House East Room that 'we will work with Congress as it performs its oversight role. And our administration has to make sure that we are working hand in hand with Congress to get this thing fixed.' 'Congress, Democrats and Republicans, owe . it to the American people to treat that authority with the . responsibility it deserves,' he insisted, 'and in a way that doesn’t . smack of politics or partisan agendas. ... The good news is it’s . fixable, and it’s in everyone’s best interest to work together to fix . it.' The scandal has galvanized disparate parts of the Republican Party, with libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul and others firing up more traditionally conservative constituencies with red-meat, anti-IRS messages . Obama nominated Koskinen to take the place of Daniel Werfel, another interim commissioner, in August. He was confirmed during the week before Christmas. 'We all hoped the new commissioner would be independent and at least make a move to toss out some of the bad apples,' MailOnline's source said. 'But this is looking like more of the same. The committee is doing all it can, but if these guys refuse to obey the law there's not much anyone can do.' The IRS's complicity in the scandal that hamstrung hundreds of small tea party-affiliated groups exploded in May 2013 when Lois Lerner, then in charge of the agency's 'Exempt Organizations' division, answered a self-planted question about it during a professional conference. Since then, she has refused twice to answer questions before the Oversight Committee, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The IRS promised nearly three weeks ago that it will turn over all of Lerner's emails during the Obama administration to the House Ways and Means Committee – the Oversight Committee expects to share in the bounty of disclosures – but no documents have shown up on Capitol Hill. Issa and other Republican committee . leaders released a report this month alleging that Lerner 'believed the . political participation of tax-exempt organizations harmed Democratic . candidates, she believed something needed to be done, and she directed . action from her unit at the IRS.' She . was also involved, they wrote, 'in an ""off-plan"" effort to write new . regulations in a manner that intentionally sought to undermine an . existing framework for transparency,' and then 'engaged in efforts to . cover it up' by publicly denying that the IRS was trying to change its . evaluation criteria. Still a target: Lois Lerner, who helmed the IRS's tax-exempt application office while right-wing groups were singled out for special scrutiny and held back for years at a time, has refused twice to answer questions before Congress . The net effect of the proposed new regulations – an effort described in IRS emails as being developed 'off-plan' and away from public view – would be to codify the procedures that Lerner put into place, in a way that Republican congressional insiders say will permanently make it harder for conservatives to participate in the political process. 'Instead of fixing a clear form of discrimination, they're trying to write it into stone,' a second Republican aide said Monday. 'That's why so many people have complained about it.' More than 143,000 comments were logged in response to the IRS's regulatory proposal, a historic number that's second only to the Obama administration's requirement under the Affordable Care Act that all qualifying insurance plans must include coverage for contraceptives. Committee staff said Monday on background that the IRS has failed to turn over any requested documents about the proposed regulation. 'You watch on Wednesday,' the second staffer . predicted: 'Koskinen is going to bob and weave, and committee . Dem[ocrat]s are going to try and change the subject over and over . again.' 'This is probably going nowhere, again. Unless the chairman has some new ammunition. I don't know that he does.'","The IRS commissioner will be called on the carpet this week for a Wednesday hearing about the tea-party targeting scandal .

"A simple blood test has been developed to signal when a common treatment for prostate cancer has stopped working. British scientists hope the new test might vastly improve outcomes for men with advanced cancer by making treatment more effective. They developed the test after discovering that glucocorticoids – steroid drugs given to 90 per cent of prostate cancer patients – can actually accelerate the growth of tumours after a few months of use. A blood test developed by experts at the Institute of Cancer Research can tell doctors when a common treatment for prostate cancer has stopped being effective . Although the treatment is initially very effective at battling the tumour, after a certain period - which varies patient to patient - it stops working, and then even starts encouraging the cancer to grow. In one in five patients the steroid eventually drives an aggressive mutation which leads to accelerated tumour growth, the research suggests. The startling discovery, made by specialists at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, could save countless lives. The new blood test can precisely tell doctors when the treatment has stopped becoming effective and allow them to stop using it before it puts a patient at risk. Prostate cancer affects 42,000 people every year in the UK. It is the most common cancer in men, accounting for a quarter of all male cancers. Twenty per cent of patients die within five years of receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis. Study leader Dr Gerhardt Attard, whose work was published last night (WEDS) in the journal Science Translational Medicine, said: ‘Glucocorticoids are initially effective, they are great treatments which we have been using for more than a decade now. ‘They make people feel better and their tumours shrink. ‘But in time - it could be a couple of years or less, depending on the patient - the cancer manages to adapt and start growing again. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have it for many years. Symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis). When this happens, you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while urinating and a feeling your bladder has not fully emptied. However, these signs do not mean you have prostate cancer. It is more likely they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (also known as BPH or prostate enlargement). Source: NHS Choices . ‘In one in five people the treatment might start driving the disease, activating harmful mutations. ‘In the future, we hope to routinely monitor genetic mutations in patients with advanced disease using just a blood test – enabling us to stop treatments when they become disease drivers and select the next best treatment option.’ The study, based on complex genetic analysis of biopsies and blood samples from 16 patients with advanced prostate cancer, shows that glucocorticoids – which are usually given alongside hormone therapy - can in some cases increase the population of cancer cells in a tumour. Once the body has adapted to the drug, the cancer is driven into a more aggressive form, and starts mutating and accelerating its growth. But the researchers, who worked with doctors at the Royal Marsden cancer hospital West London and the University of Trento in Italy, found that regular blood tests - or ‘liquid biopsies’ - could track minute changes in the DNA of the tumour. It means they can act as soon as the cancer starts becoming resistant to the treatment, and withdraw it before it starts mutating into an aggressive form. Doctors are already using the blood test on all prostate patients at the Royal Marsden, and hope that with more positive results it could be rolled out to all hospitals. Dr Attard said: ‘We need to confirm these findings in larger numbers of patients but using these types of blood tests could allow true personalisation of treatment for prostate cancer patients, based on the cancer mutations we detect.’ The Prostate Cancer UK and Cancer Research UK charities, which funded the research, last night welcomed the findings. But they warned that patients treated with glucocorticoids should continue taking their treatment - and not abandon it on account of the discovery. Prostate cancer affects 42,000 people every year in the UK. It is the most common cancer in men, accounting for a quarter of all male cancers . Dr Matthew Hobbs, deputy director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘This research is important as it shows that there might be a new way to monitor how a man’s cancer is changing during treatment and that could help us to pinpoint the stage at which some drugs stop being effective. ‘In the future this could arm doctors with the knowledge they need to ensure that no time is wasted between a drug that stops working for a man and him moving on to another effective treatment.’ Nell Barrie, science information manager at Cancer Research UK, added: ‘It’s vital to understand the genetic twists and turns that offer tumour cells an escape route to become resistant to treatment.’","Glucocorticoids are steroids given to 90 per cent of prostate cancer patients .

"Free range chickens may not live the comfortable lives we have been led to believe, according to a leading British vet. Research shows that chickens which are allowed to roam free are in fact more likely to catch disease, get injured and die earlier than those kept in cages. Eggs from free range hens now make up 45 per cent of the British market – a huge increase from just 1 per cent in 1980. Cluck happy... or not: Chickens allowed to roam free in open fields in fact die sooner and are much more likely to catch diseases . Supermarkets and celebrity chefs would have us believe that free range chickens are happier, healthier and live more natural lives than those in battery farms. But chickens allowed to roam free in open fields in fact die sooner and are much more likely to catch diseases, according to Barry Thorp of the Royal School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh. They are also more likely to break their bones because they have not been bred to survive an outdoor life, he said. Recent regulations mean that chicken houses are no longer the tiny squalid cages they once were. Dr Thorp, speaking during a debate on chicken welfare at the British Science Festival in Birmingham yesterday, said: ‘I think that for long-term sustainability, free range systems do not work. ‘I’m certainly very comfortable with buying eggs from furnished cages. I have no issues with that at all. ‘I think free range has some merits but it also has many problems as well. I don’t see it having a long-term sustainability and that worries me.’ Ten per cent of ducks carry bird flu, posing a huge threat to chickens that is very hard to control . Dr Thorp said the boom in free range has been driven by the idea that chickens live better lives – a message that has been amplified by large retailers. ‘Supermarkets love free range because they can make a bigger margin,’ he said. But chickens kept in large fields are far more likely to pass diseases to each other and on to wild birds and ducks. He warned that the increase in the number of free-range chickens raises the risk of a major epidemic of bird flu. ‘We have been lucky in this country that we haven’t had a major bird flu outbreak,’ he said. Dr Thorp, a specialised poultry vet, added: ‘Having a physical barrier between chickens works – cages stop disease because if nothing goes between A and B, disease does not travel between A and B. ‘When different chickens and wild birds come into contact with each other and their droppings, disease spreads. ‘As a vet I make far more money from farmers who have got birds kept free range than those kept in cages.’ The spread of disease between chickens in fields and ducks in nearby rivers is a particular risk, he said. Ten per cent of ducks carry bird flu, posing a huge threat to chickens that is very hard to control. Germany and Holland have been very wary of free range systems because of the bird flu risk, instead opting for barn rearing models in which chickens are easier to control. Germany and Holland have been very wary of free range systems because of the bird flu risk, instead opting for barn rearing models in which chickens are easier to control . Dr Victoria Sandilands, of Scotland’s Rural College, said free range birds have a mortality rate of 8 to 10 per cent, far higher than caged hens’ death rate of 2 to 4 per cent. Free range hens are also twice as likely to have fractured bones as those kept in cages. Cages are also far better than they used to be, she said. She added: ‘Ten years ago cages used to have a wire floor with access to food and water but nothing else. ‘From 2012 only furnished or enriched cages have been permitted across the EU.’ Cages now have to contain nesting areas, separated from the rest of the cage, with a ‘scratch floor’, a perching area for every hen and more than seven square metres per chicken. She told the Birmingham audience: ‘Furnished cages provide a safe, clean environment, and laying hens are generally physically healthy. The ability to perform many natural behaviours has also improved greatly.’ Mia Fernyhough, senior scientific officer at the RSPCA, admitted that free range farming systems are far from ideal. ‘Free range is more complex so it takes more careful management to do it well,’ she said. ‘There is increased risk of mortality and increased risk of disease and injury. ‘But it can be managed well. Free range has a much, much greater potential for higher welfare.’","Eggs from free range hens now make up 45 per cent of the British market .

"If your lavender bushes seem to be bereft of bees, then you might need to be a little more selective in your choice of plant. For a study has found that English lavender is twice as good at attracting bumblebees as French lavender. Its simple clusters of flowers are more accessible to bees than the ornamental frills on the French, according to scientists from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. A study has found that English lavender, pictured,  is twice as good at attracting bumblebees as French lavender . In the Big Bumblebee Discovery survey carried out by 30,000 schoolchildren, the insects were spotted twice every five minutes on English lavender, where they feed on nectar. French lavender – characterised by frilly ‘rabbit ear’ petals that point upwards – saw bumblebees visit only once every five minutes. The study – one of a growing number of ‘citizen science’ experiments used to track wildlife – also found a surprising number of bumblebees in city centres, until now were thought to be desolate areas for pollinating insects. In fact, the participants recorded more bees on lavender in urban areas than in suburban or rural locations. The ecologists, presenting their results yesterday (MON) at the British Science Festival in Birmingham, said lavender creates an ‘oasis’ of nectar for bumblebees. Dr Michael Pocock, of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, said: ‘What is commonly called French lavender tends to be a much more ornamental plant. ‘English lavender tended to be visited at a much higher rate. ‘The names used do not mean that one is from England and the other is from France – they are both plants that were introduced to Britain in the past.’ French lavender, pictured here on a river bank, is characterised by frilly ‘rabbit ear’ petals that point upwards . English lavender, which is more commonly planted in this country, copes better with cold and wet weather than French lavender, which is widely grown on the continent for its oil. Dr Helen Roy, also of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, added: ‘Our understanding is that on more fancy flowers it is more tricky for the bumblebees to access the nectar.’ The scientists said they had been puzzled when participants had recorded more bees in city centre locations than in other areas. But they said the trend might be explained by the fact insects in urban areas are simply more reliant on lavender – the only species of plant that was monitored. Dr Pocock said: ‘We were surprised to see more observations in urban localities, as suburban gardens are often thought to be better. ‘Planting lavender - and other flowers - in city areas could help to support populations of pollinators in those habitats.’ English lavender, which is more commonly planted in this country, copes better with cold and wet weather than French lavender . A quarter of the bumblebees in Europe are at risk of extinction as their habitats are destroyed, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Loss of wildflower meadows and the use of pesticides such as neonicotinoids are largely blamed for their decline. Bumblebees are vital to agriculture as they pollinate fruit and vegetables - a natural phenomenon thought to be worth £560million a year to the British economy. The survey involved 30,000 children, who recorded 27,000 individual bumblebees at 4,000 sites. Dr Roy said: ‘The number of people who have taken part in the Big Bumblebee Discovery is inspiring and their observations are extremely insightful. ‘Understanding the experiences of citizen scientists is extremely useful for the development of future projects where mass participation can aid the scientific process.’","English lavender is twice as good as attracting bees than French variety .

"Television presenter Chris Tarrant has described the high-profile arrests of 70s celebrities in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal as a 'witch-hunt'. The 67-year-old, who recently announced he was stepping down from long-running TV quiz Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, said while those found by a court to be 'like Savile' should be locked up, he also warned about innocent people getting hurt. Tarrant last year joined a number of people who criticised Jimmy Savile, saying: 'I met him twice and found him deeply unpleasant. God knows why none of it came out before.' 'Witch-hunt': Chris Tarrant (left) has described the arrests of 70s entertainers following the Jimmy Savile (right) scandal as a 'witch hunt' Asked about how he felt about the arrests of 70s entertainers following the Savile investigation, Tarrant has now told The Telegraph: 'I think what is happening is terrifying, it does appear to be a witch-hunt. 'Those like Savile, who behaved about as vilely as a human being can, deserve to be banged up and have the key thrown away. 'But in the meantime there are an awful lot of people who are getting hurt, some of whom are clearly innocent.' Last week Paul Gambaccini admitted he was the latest celebrity to be arrested by detectives investigating the Savile scandal. The 64-year-old radio and TV presenter issued a statement denying the ‘historic’ allegations of sexual abuse after frenzied speculation about the identity of the high-profile suspect arrested earlier in the week. Detectives did not disclose details of the allegations facing Gambaccini. But it indicated in a statement that he is not suspected of committing offences with paedophile Savile. Presenter: Chris Tarrant (centre) rose to prominence on the Saturday morning children's show Tiswas which ran from 1974 to 1982 . Operation Yewtree is the national investigation prompted after claims were made against disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile. Scotland Yard has led the probe, and separated its inquiries into those involving Savile, those involving Savile and others, and those involving others. Entertainer Rolf Harris, former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis and PR consultant Max Clifford are among the high profile figures already arrested and charged with sex offences following Operation Yewtree. They all deny wrongdoing. Comedian Jim Davidson, who was arrested in January, learned in the summer that he would not be charged. Paul Gambaccini last week admitted he was the latest celebrity to be arrested by detectives investigating the Savile scandal . Fellow entertainer Freddie Starr remains on police bail, as prosecutors decide whether to charge him. Former pop star Gary Glitter is also waiting to learn his fate after his arrest. Gambaccini was the 15th suspect to be arrested under Operation Yewtree. Police confirmed another man, aged 74, was arrested as part of the investigation. Both men have been bailed to a date in early January. After making his name on Tiswas, Tarrant went on to host a number of shows including OTT and Tarrant on TV. He also joined Capital Radio as a presenter in 1984 and hosted Capital Breakfast from 1987 to 2004. In 1998 he hosted the hugely popular Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, the most internationally popular television franchise of all time after being aired in more than 100 countries. Last month however Tarrant announced he had reached a point where he wanted to call it a day after being with the show since its inception. In the interview with The Telegraph, Tarrant also spoke about his father, who was awarded a Military Cross for his role in the Second World War. The TV presenter is planning to release a book in May called Dad's War, which details how he discovered that his father had been involved in some of the war's most significant campaigns,  including the Dunkirk evacuation and the D-Day landings, and also took part in some of the most brutal, close-range fighting in Cleve.

"Prime Minister: Schools, hospitals and other public service organisations will be told to cut down on imported food and buy British instead under new guidelines unveiled by David Cameron today . Schools, hospitals and other public service organisations will be told to cut down on imported food and buy British instead under new guidelines unveiled today. Public bodies – including the Armed Forces and government departments – currently spend £400million a year on cheap imported produce that could easily be grown in the UK. But Government rules that make price the overriding factor in catering contracts are to be scrapped and replaced with new guidelines that prioritise other factors, including local sourcing. From 2017, all food that can be bought locally will be – even if it is more expensive. Whitehall will lead the way by launching the policy in its own departments, as well as the Armed Forces and prisons. External bodies such as schools, hospitals and council-run care homes will be expected to follow suit. David Cameron said last night: 'Our long-term economic plan is all about . backing the do-ers and the hard-workers – and no one does more or works . as hard in Britain today than our farmers. ‘By opening up these contracts, we can help farmers create more jobs, invest in their businesses and make sure people have a healthier lifestyle.’ ‘It’s a triple win – and will mean a brighter future for our country.’ Britain currently imports 40 per cent of its food, including many products which could be produced domestically. The Government is desperate to reduce imports, to support UK farmers and to end our reliance on unreliable foreign supply chains. Ministers want to reduce the volume of foreign food we ship in that could easily be produced on home soil, such as New Zealand lamb, Spanish cucumbers and Danish bacon. Former Environment Secretary Owen . Paterson, who lost his job in last week’s reshuffle, has repeatedly . highlighted the problem - and urged shoppers to choose British over . foreign food. But UK farmers have been unimpressed with a mismatch between rhetoric and reality. School lunch: Public bodies - including the Armed Forces - currently spend £400million a year on cheap imported produce that could easily be grown in the UK. Above, schools will be told to buy more British food . This is because for all ministers’ words, the fact remained that Government departments were themselves buying £600million worth of foreign food - £400million of which could be produced in Britain. The farmers claimed that a major problem was the Government Buying Standards, which include an overarching rule dictating that the cost of food trumps all other factors. But the new guide will make clear that price is not the only factor, and aspects such as nutrition, and how and where food is produced should be taken into account. Minette Batters, deputy president of the National Farmers Union, welcomed the plan as a ‘significant step in the right direction’. Support: Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson (left) has repeatedly urged shoppers to choose British over foreign food. His replacement Liz Truss (right) said the new guidelines were a 'huge boost to UK farmers' She said: ‘I am delighted to have such . support across Government departments enabling them to more easily . source British produce. ‘Of course saying that more British food is sourced to our standards of production is one thing - to ensure that this happens on the ground, it is important that public sector buyers and caterers know that they can easily meet the plans aims by simply sourcing food to Red Tractor standards, the widely recognised mark of British food production standards.’ Liz Truss, the new Environment Secretary, added: ‘This move will mean that food served in canteens across the public sector can be more local, seasonal and tastier. ‘It will help drive growth in Britain’s first class food and drink industry and benefit the environment through reduced waste, higher take-up of meals and less unappetising food left on plates. ‘This is a huge boost to British farmers and producers and for students, patients and employees who want to enjoy fantastic food.’","Public bodies are spending £400million a year on cheap imported produce .

"25 exotic dancers at a strip club in San Diego are filing a claim against police officers they say forced them to stay at the strip club against their will so they could take revealing pictures of them and their tattoos. Ten officers on the San Diego police force raided the Cheetah's Gentleman's Club in Kearny Mesa on March 6 to 'check dancers permits' said the dancer's lawyer Dan Gilleon. The claim says that during the check, 10 officers whose identities were not released, held dancers against their will for an hour without a proper warrant. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 25 dancers, some of whom may be pictured here, claim that SDPD violated their civil rights . The Cheetah's Gentleman Club in Kearney Mesa features scantily clad women dancing for entertainment . The dancers say that the officers told them to pose in different positions so that they could 'photograph their tattoos.' According to the girls, the officers told them to 'smile for the camera' and made other 'arrogant and demanding' comments that made them feel uncomfortable. 'I got my pictures taken from at least my knees upwards, and I'm half dressed. I felt kind of violated and like my rights were not there,' said dancer Brittany Murphy to NBC. Officers told the dancers that the photos for their working permits, which are updated on a yearly basis, needed to be renewed. Lt. Kevin mayer told NBC that the officers didn't do anything against the rules and that photographing dancers and their tattoos, which acts as an identifier, is essential to confirming that dancers are who they say they are. Brittney Murphy told NBC that police made her feel uncomfortable when they insisted they take photos of her and her tattoos while she was half naked . Lt. Kevin Mayer said that taking photos of dancers and their tattoos is standard protocol when renewing work permits . 'The city municipal code mandates that . the police department go out and conduct these inspections. Now to be an . adult entertainer or to own a strip club -- those are both police . regulated businesses, and to be in that profession you have to get a . permit,' said Mayer to NBC. 'So being that we're mandated to go out and conduct these inspections, the people and the holders of these permits are aware that these [checks] are coming,' he added. Regardless of what police say, the dancers are filing a civil rights claim against the SDPD for more than $10,000. The manager for the Cheetah's Rich Buonantony said that the girls felt pressured to do what the cops wanted because if they were to say 'no' to their demands, their work permits could be taken away. Dan Gilleon told NBC he thinks the claim will be denied in which case he will file a lawsuit.","Ten officers on the San Diego police force raided the Cheetah's Gentleman's Club in Kearny Mesa on March 6 .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have delighted well-wishers by sending thank you cards to all of the people who wrote to congratulate them on the birth of Prince George.

"Found: Police acting on a tip tracked down missing schizophrenic mother of two Catherine Hoggle, 27, in Maryland but her children are still missing . A missing paranoid schizophrenic Maryland mother found and taken into custody on Friday night has told police her children are 'safe' but won't tell them nor her husband where they are located. Catherine Hoggle is being questioned by detectives but her children are still no where to be found. Hoggle was charged with child neglect earlier this week after police realized her children, Jacob, 2, and Sarah, 3, had not been seen for days. Hoggle has told police that her children are alive but they are not able to verify Hoggle's statements since she has given them varying stories about their location and she has been off her medication for schizophrenia. NBC reports that Hoggle has changed her appearance by cutting her hair. Her disheveled look has lead police to believe that she may have been spending nights on the street prior to her arrest. Police said just after 11 p.m. on Friday they received a call from a Germantown resident saying that Catherine Hoggle was spotted walking near Century Rock Boulevard and Crystal Rock Drive. Officers were dispatched to the area and were able to quickly track down the missing woman, but her two children, 2-year-old Jacob and 3-year-old Sarah, were nowhere to be found. Many gathered at the Chik-Fil-A parking lot on Saturday night for a candlelight vigil to pray for the missing children in the hopes that they will be found safe and sound. Hoggle, who reportedly suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and had gone off her medication, was taken to police headquarters for questioning,wUSA9 reported. Officers remained on the scene in Germantown overnight, scouring the streets and a nearby apartment complex with K-9 dogs in search of the missing toddlers. 'Thank you to this caller. We remain concerned for the children's welfare and ask that people still call 911 with information and tips,' Montgomery County police tweeted after finding Hoggle. Earlier in the day, authorities released a video showing Hoggle sneaking out the back of a Chick-fil-A in Germantown Monday, just moments after lying to her common-law husband, Troy Turner, about the whereabouts of their two children. Hoggle was then captured on video again at the Germantown Commons shopping center on Tuesday morning around 4.30am. The children are not seen in the video. Scroll down for video . Alive or dead?: Catherine Hoggle has said her children Jacob (left) and Sarah (right) are 'safe' but police are unable to verify her story since it has changed several times and she is a schizophrenic off her medication . Spotted: Catherine Hoggle was spotted in Surveillance footage sneaking out of a Chik-fil-A in Germantown, Maryland earlier in the week and police were able to take her into custody late on Friday . Turner contacted police on Monday night and reported that the trio were missing. The couple had stopped at the fast found restaurant Monday on their way to the police station, as Turner was concerned about the children and felt Hoggle was 'not forthcoming' when he suggested the two go pick them up at daycare. Moments later, Hoggle went out the back door and walked to the Germantown Transit Center. 'I want it over with, I want my children here with me,' said Turner, who has been distributing and posting  flyers all over town in hopes of finding his wife and children. Montgomery County police have obtained a warrant for  Hoggle's arrest, charging her with child neglect, a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 5 years and $5,000, according to ABC 7. K9 squad: Police dogs are sniffing areas close to where Hoggle was found in attempt to find her children . Searching: Troy Turner hands out flyers at a Germantown shopping center where his wife is known to frequent in the hopes that maybe his missing children might be somewhere nearby . On Sunday, police said Hoggle took the children to her mother's house in Clarksburg. She said she was  going to take her son Jacob for pizza, but when she returned to her mother's home three hours later, she did not have him with her. Hoggle claimed Jacob was at a playmate's house, but police said Jacob was not there and the youngster has not been seen since. Police understand that at the time Turner was at his overnight job. Sarah was last seen on Monday at Hoggle's mother's home. Hoggle and Turner also have another son together, whose whereabouts is known.","Missing paranoid schizophrenic mother Catherine Hoggle, 27, was found and taken into custody on Friday night .

"New England's tallest lighthouse has been sold for $78,000 after initial bidding was lackluster, perhaps due to being 6 miles from the Maine coast and a dark history of cannibalism in the area. A federal government spokeswoman says the General Services Administration has accepted a bid for the Boon Island Light Station off York, Maine. The winning bidder is Portland, Maine, resident Art Girard. The Administration closed out an auction of the 133-foot-tall lighthouse tower on Aug. 17. More than a dozen bidders vied for it. The government had to approve Girard's bid, which was the highest of the bunch. Lonely home? Boon Island Light Station sits in the Gulf of Maine about six miles off the coast of York, Maine and is an isolated home perfectly suited for many a sea-loving hermit . Finally sold:The lighthouse sold for $78,000 after an auction was extended after getting a top bid of just $41,000 . Climbing the stairs: Boon Island Light has the distinction of being the tallest lighthouse in both Maine and New England at 133 feet . The lighthouse was built in 1855 and is located on a tiny rocky island 6 miles off the Maine coast. It's still active as a navigational aid. It is one of 57 active lighthouses in Maine and is the tallest in New England, though not the highest above sea level . At six desolate miles off an already sparsely populated coast, is it also its loneliest residence? Initial bidding, which closed at 10am on Tuesday August 12, was lackluster. Seven people bid on the lighthouse, with the top bid coming in at $41,000. The government opened bidding up again. Desolate: The isolate outcropping of granite is located six desolate miles from York, Maine and was once the site of a shipwreck where sailors eventually turned to cannibalism .

Tradition: Boon Island is among the five or so light houses on the New England and Gulf Coasts auctioned by the Coast Guard each year . In addition to its isolation, Boon Island's dark history could be to blame for not selling the first time around. The barren outcrop of granite was the site of a shipwreck in 1710.

"'We will not accept being treated as second-rate . citizens': Romanian premier Victor Ponta slammed moves to . restrict benefits to migrant workers . Romania's prime minister has told Britain not to treat Romanians as 'second-rate citizens' when curbs on Romanian and Bulgarian workers are lifted on January 1. Victor Ponta said last night that research showed no evidence that there would be large numbers of migrants moving from his country to the UK, despite mounting fears. And he reiterated the claim, made elsewhere, that Romanians were more likely to seek work in southern European states like Italy and Spain, where the language is far more similar to Romanian. David Cameron this week announced measures to toughen welfare rules for migrants from the European Union amid concern that migrants from Romania and Bulgaria would exploit the benefits system. He has claimed that one million people from Central and East Europe are living in Britain with migration at a level not seen since wartime. But, in a statement released last night, Mr Ponta slammed the move. He said people should be punished for abusing the welfare system, but restrictions should not be used to 'generate or justify abuse or discrimination'. 'We will not accept being treated as second-rate citizens,' Mr Ponta said, adding that research showed 'there is no reason for concern regarding a migrant wave' from Romania to Britain. Millions of Romanians had already chosen to work abroad in 'southern Latin states', referring to Spain and Italy which have a Latin-based language like Romanian. He said he hoped Cameron was not trying 'to attack the fundamental principles of the EU, among which the freedom of movement is one of the most important values'. Mr Cameron's benefits proposals were criticised on Wednesday by European employment commissioner Laszlo Andor as an 'unfortunate over-reaction'. Warning that Britain risked becoming the 'nasty country of Europe, he said plans to curb benefits for migrants were were fuelling ‘hysteria’ and accused the PM of distorting the truth about immigration. ‘The point is that the British has not been given all the truth and the full truth about this subject,' Mr Andor told Radio 4's Today programme. Brussels is facing a growing revolt . over its no-borders immigration policy, with France and Germany also . suggesting they want curbs on EU migrants’ rights. Mr . Cameron, who has been criticised for refusing to give an estimate of . how many Romanians and Bulgarians will come to Britain next year, has . outlined plans to limit the rights of temporary workers to housing . benefit, and a 12-month bar on those fund begging and sleeping rough. The . measures were announced shortly after the Daily Mail published the . results of a poll which suggests that four in five Britons do not want . unrestricted access to the UK for Romanians and Bulgarians. 'Hysteria': European employment commissioner Laszlo Andor criticised benefits curbs for migrants announced by David Cameron this week, accusing the Prime Minister of distorting the truth about immigration . Home Secretary Theresa May this week suggested moves to cap the number of EU migrants to the UK in order to stop British workers languishing on the dole. Writing for the PoliticsHome website, Mrs May suggested that the Government’s attempts to make the UK a less attractive destination - by restricting access to welfare and introducing an annual levy for use of the NHS - were likely to have limited effect. ‘In all honesty, whatever the Government does in terms of reducing the pull factors that draw people to Britain, as long as there is such an enormous disparity between EU member states in terms of income per head, there will be an overwhelming incentive for people to move from poorer member states to richer member states,’ she said. Mrs May added: ‘That not only puts pressure on communities in countries like Britain, it robs poorer EU member states of their most talented people. So in future, we must put in place new arrangements to slow full access to each other’s labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to mass migration.'","Migrants from Romania and Bulgaria free to work in UK from January 1 .

"Princess Madeleine and her American husband, banker Christopher O'Neill, have decided that their first child should be born in New York City. The palace said on Saturday the couple had decided to do so after 'careful consideration' and consulting with her parents, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia. The Swedish Newspaper The Local reports that royal expert Roger Lundgren has explained that Madeline's decision to give birth may ruffle some at home. Madeline looks sporty at home in New York City with her husband banker, Christopher O'Neil, and an 'almost there' baby bump . Princess Madeline and Christopher O'Neil got married in Stockholm in June . Madeline and Christopher O'Neil got married in June in Stockholm . 'Many here at home will probably be . disappointed, they want their princess back home in Sweden, as part of . the royal family. The fact that Madeleine will give birth abroad cements . a distance to her,' said Lundgren. On the contrary, Lundgren also says there were certain factors such as a difficult pregnancy that might make it hard for the princess to travel home. He called her decision 'purely practical.' 'She has had a tough pregnancy, she missed the Nobel banquette for example, and it is simply more convenient to give birth there than in Sweden,' he said. According to Swedish lifestyle magazine . Svensk Damtidning, the 31-year-old royal and her husband Christopher . O'Neill are welcoming a daughter into the world on February 25. The Princess has yet to confirm the reports herself, but a Swedish Royal Court spokeswoman told Svenskdam.se that the information is indeed true. The younger sister of Crown Princess . Victoria, Madeleine is fourth in line to the Swedish throne. The baby . will be fifth in line. Sweden's one-time 'party princess' lives with her British-American husband, 39, in New York where she works for the World Childhood Foundation, a non-profit group founded by her mother, Queen Silvia. The couple met after Princess Madeleine fled to the U.S. in 2010 with a broken heart. She crossed the Atlantic following the breakdown of her first engagement to Swedish attorney Jonas Bergstrom amid speculation that he had cheated on her. Rumours of a romance with Mr O'Neill first emerged in early 2011 when the pair were seen together at the Central Park Boathouse. A source told the New York Post at the time: 'She is always happy when she is with him.' The Swedish royal family attend a performance to celebrate Queen Silvia's 70 birthday at the Oscar Theatre . A Swedish royal expert called Princess Madeline's New York birth 'practical' but also said that many is Sweden would be 'disappointed' Madeleine says she and her husband were friends first, and a relationship blossomed over time. 'I appreciate Chris for his warmth and his humor,' she said. 'He has a very big heart and he manages to make everyone in his presence feel good. Christopher is a very thoughtful and generous person. Mr O'Neill, however, says that 'from the very outset, I immediately felt something special with Madeleine.' Insiders predicted an engagement last year when Crown Princess Victoria gave birth to a baby, Princess Estelle, and Mr O'Neill accompanied Madeleine to Estelle's baptism ceremony that May - a significant indicator, as partners of royals are usually not invited to such occasions unless they are officially engaged. And they were spot on. The couple announced their engagement in October 2012, confirmed in a brief video clip posted on the royal website. 'Chris proposed to me in New York at the start of October, and we are very happy,' Madeleine said in the video, which was recorded Wednesday at the Drottningholm Palace outside Stockholm. Madeleine described the proposal as 'very romantic and intimate' but would not reveal anything beyond that. Sweden has a constitutional monarchy in which the royals primarily serve as figureheads. King Carl XVI Gustaf is the country's head of state, but his powers are limited to ceremonial duties. From friends to lovers: Madeline said that she loves Chris for his 'big heart' and his 'sense of humor'","Swedish princess Madeline and her American husband Christopher O'Neil are expecting their first child in February of 2014 .

"Russia has acknowledged that the propulsion unit on one of the rockets responsible for the deadly Syrian chemical attack indicates it was made by a Soviet plant in Siberia. But Moscow experts claim the remnants of the ‘antique’ weapon provide new evidence the sarin blast was the work of rebels and not the Damascus regime. President Assad’s military machine would not have used this ‘ancient junk’ for a chemical attack when they have far more up to date missiles, said one. Mourning: A Syrian man grieves over a dead body after the 21 August attack which prompted Syria agreeing to lose its arsenal . The first missile was ‘a 140-mm M-14-series rocket projectile from an old Soviet-made BM-14-17 multiple-launch system dating from 1952,’ said Ruslan Pukhov, director of Russia’s Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies. The numbering and Cyrillic letters show it is from  Sibselmash plant in Novosibirsk, which during the Cold War was ‘one of the USSR’s main producers of various types of unguided rocket projectiles. ‘The code 4-67-179 means the 4th batch in 1967 by factory 179,’he said. Pukhov claimed it was ‘unlikely’ the USSR had sold chemical weapons to Syria but said that in any case ‘an old munition has clearly been improvised to take chemicals. ‘We know that the Syrians took the BM-14-17 out of service long ago and M-14-series projectiles for that weapon are long past their storage deadlines.’ 'Given proof': Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, right, meets Sergei Ryabkov in Damascus today, where the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister said Syria told his officials they have handed over proof of 'rebels participating in the chemical attack' The Russian expert said: ‘If they wanted to use chemical munitions then they probably would not have wanted to risk it with antiques like these and instead would have gone for the BM-21 Grad, for which they probably do have chemical munitions. ‘But the insurgents could have found this ancient junk after capturing some military storage depot.’ The second projectile identified by weapons inspectors looked to be ‘home made’. Blaming the Assad opposition for the attack, he claimed: ‘The Syrian army is unlikely to be making and using such primitive munitions.’ Meanwhile, Russia claimed today it was handed new materials by the Syrian regime implicating rebels in the chemical attack outside Damascus on August 21. Deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, said after meeting top officials in Damascus: ‘The corresponding materials were handed to the Russian side. We were told that they were evidence that the rebels are implicated in the chemical attack.’ He said that Russia would ‘examine the Syrian materials implicating the rebels with the utmost seriousness.’ Russia has repeatedly expressed suspicion that the chemical attack was a ‘provocation’ staged by the rebels with the aim of attracting Western military intervention in the conflict. Mr Ryabkov also claimed this week’s UN report into the chemical attack was ‘politicised, biased and one-sided’.","Moscow says parts of chemical gas rockets were made in Siberia .

"Posey County Sheriff Greg Oeth tells WFIE-TV that authorities found the cage where they believe Joelle Lockwood may have been kept. The mother of two had been missing since July 9. Oeth says Lockwood was taken to a hospital briefly Saturday night and then returned to her family . An Indiana woman missing for two months and apparently held as a slave in a cage has been found alive, and authorities have arrested a couple in connection with her July disappearance, police said on Sunday. Joelle Lockwood, 30, went missing on July 9 and was allegedly kept inside the trailer of 37-year-old Ricky Roy House Jr. and 44-year-old Kendra Tooley where she was made to perform chores while wearing a belt like a dog collar around her neck, naked from the waist down. They have been arrested on preliminary charges of criminal confinement and rape. The mother-of-two was freed after Tooley's ex-husband visited the suspects and rescued her while the couple aimed guns at him. He brought her to Evansville Police Department, where detectives interviewed her and then went to the residence and arrested the suspects, police said. Lockwood was allegedly abducted by House after he offered her a ride after a party. Sheriff Oeth said that the two had gone to high school together. At House's suggestion Lockwood agreed to go back to his trailer. 'Once they arrived there, he forced her to stay and confined her,' Oeth said. 'As the investigation is progressing, this looks like there's more of a sexual motive.' According to police Tooley has admitted to police that Lockwood was abducted and held, but House has so far refused to cooperate with authorities. Scroll down for video . Captivity: Joelle Lcokwood was kept in this wooden cage while held by an Indiana couple in their trailer for two months . According to WFIE, Tooley's ex, Ron Higgs, saved Lockwood after he realized she was being held prisoner. 'He took it upon himself to get her out of the residence and took her back to Evansville,' said Posey County Sheriff Greg Oeth. 'Once there, he contacted authorities there. She's going to be returned to her family so we're very, very happy of the outcome from those circumstances.' Higgs said that he was telephoned by Tooley on Thursday because she needed money from him. Joelle Lockwood, 30, went missing on July 9 and was kept inside the trailer of 44-year-old Kendra Tooley and 37-year-old Ricky Roy House Jr. Please help: A missing poster with Joelle Ann Lockwood's photograph was put out to help the search for her . He said that when he arrived at the couple's trailer, House brazenly showed him Lockwood inside the cage. 'She had a t-shirt on, and that was it,' said Higgs to WFIE. 'She had a leather belt, like a dog collar on. Every night, they locked her in there. No food, no water.' Higg said that she was being made to cook and clean by House and Tooley and he initially thought she had agreed to the bizarre set-up. However, on Friday, which was his second night in the trailer, Lockwood approached him and begged for help. 'That's when she told me on the second night with tears running down her eyes, 'please, do not leave here with out me,' said Higgs. 'And I promised her, if I have to give my life to get you out of here I will.' He then managed to get Lockwood out of the trailer, allegedly with guns trained on him, although Higgs has not clarified how he got the mother of two out as of Sunday. 'Everybody's calling me a hero,' said Higgs. 'I'm just a pure bred American, that I believe.' Rescuer: Tooley's ex-husband, Ron Higgs freed Lockwood - claiming to have had a gun pointed at him while he saved her . Joelle's mother, Candace said on Sunday that she is thrilled and exhausted to have her daugher home, while family friend, Amanda Crowe said that the family is still in shock. 'I just really want to say thank you to everyone who has supported us and has supported Joelle's family,' said Crowe. 'It means the world to all of us that the community has come out and has helped to find her.' The official Facebook page for Lockwood to raise awareness of her disappearance was ecstatic at the news she had been found. 'Thank you everyone for all their efforts with helping find Joelle!!!,' a Facebook post on a support page that offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to her recovery read on Saturday. 'JOELLE IS FOUND!!! SHE IS ALIVE AND WELL.' Lockwood was last seen on July 9 leaving a party in Evansville, about 20 miles away. She was walking in the area of Park Street and Florida Street in Evansville and allegedly intoxicated. Authorities have also been exploring any possible connection between the Lockwood case and the August 15 disappearance of Kristy Kelley, 27, in Boonville, about 20 miles from Evansville, the Evansville Courier & Press reported last month. Evansville police did not mention the Kelley case in their statement and a spokesperson could not be reached for comment on Sunday. A dispatcher for the Warrick County Sheriff's Office said on Sunday that Kelley was still missing.","Joelle Lockwood, 30, has been found alive after disappearing two months ago .

"Six weeks after Bill de Blasio left behind his suburban Brooklyn house to move into Gracie Mansion, the NYPD is still guarding his empty home. An officer from the NYPD is stationed 24 hours a day in a small booth outside de Blasio's home in Park Slope and based on hourly wages, taxpayers in New York are paying $277,000 a year for their mayor's empty home to be protected. According to the New York Post a spokesman for the NYPD refused to comment on security arrangements for the mayor who moved in Gracie Mansion in July, almost nine months after his election to replace Michael Bloomberg. Constant presence: The NYPD security booth outside NYC mayor Bill DeBlasio's Park Slope house the booth has been there since he won election in November . Brooklynite: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, waves while standing with his wife Chirlane McCray and children Dante de Blasio, (second from left), and Chiara de Blasio, after being sworn in as the mayor of New York City at the start of the new year . Since he and his wife Chirlane McCray left Park Slope, de Blasio has mentioned that he could be keen to rent out his home while his family is at Gracie Mansion. They officially moved into the historic home the day after the family returned from their vacation in Itay. No one had lived at Gracie Mansion since Rudolph Giuliani left office in 2001. Mayor Michael Bloomberg remained in his opulent Upper East Side town house during his 12-year administration, though he oversaw extensive renovations to the mansion. De Blasio; his wife Chirlane McCray; their daughter, Chiara; and their son, Dante had long lived in Park Slope, a progressive neighborhood that helped shape the mayor-elect's political identity. They spent some time publicly debating whether to make the switch. New home: A wrought iron gate secures the entrance to Gracie Mansion, on New York's Upper East Side,  Monday, July 28, 2014. Mayor Bill de Blasio, his wife and their two children woke up in their official Manhattan residence for the first time on Monday, a day after returning from their vacation in Italy . My house: Bill de Blasio and Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson decend the steps as Mayor Bill de Blasio hosts a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors ''Cities of Opportunity Task Force'' Using the campaign theme 'a tale of two cities,' de Blasio ran as an outer borough candidate in touch with the concerns of working and middle-class voters who felt left behind by what they perceived were Bloomberg's policies favoring Manhattan and the wealthy. The graceful Federal-style mansion — which has eight bathrooms, as opposed to just one in their Brooklyn home — will be the site of many of the mayor's meetings and social gatherings. The current structure was built in 1799 by merchant Archibald Gracie in a location that, at the time, was in the countryside more than 5 miles north of the fledgling city. It changed hands several times until it was seized by the city in 1896 after the owner failed to pay taxes. In 1942, it was designated the official residence of the mayor, and Fiorello LaGuardia moved in. In 1966, the home nearly doubled in size during an expansion. It received a sweeping renovation over the last 12 years. Bloomberg, who dipped into his own fortune to pay for some of the renovations, opened it to the public for tours and events. The four-bedroom home has 12 full-time employees, including kitchen and gardening staff. It sits on the site once occupied by a home that was destroyed by British cannonballs during the Revolutionary War. One of the 12.5-pound cannonballs was found a century later during construction work and was placed on a mantle to become part of the historical decor.","New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio left Brooklyn in July for Gracie Mansion .

But the royal admitted candidly: ‘I really quite hate Twitter' as he took the opportunity to hit out at the social networking site for what he sees as its ‘invasion’ of his privacy during an impromptu Q&A. Scroll down for video . Joking around: Harry proved a hit with students at the Bethnal Green Academy but said he 'hates' Twitter . When asked if he would be tweeting during the Games, which take place in London this September, Harry said: 'I would love to get involved and go on social media and if it was for causes like this I really would. 'The issue for myself and my family, put quite simply, is that it's very hard for me to tweet about the Invictus Games and tweet about something that means a lot to me, whereas I at the same time really quite hate Twitter by the invasion of privacy. I think you all understand what I'm talking about.’ Although Buckingham Palace and Clarence House both use social media to promote the work of the Royal Family, Harry, who is fourth in line to the throne, has often spoken of his anger at the way details or pictures of his whereabouts outside of official engagements are made public on the internet. But it seems that not all social media is off limits, as during the visit, he admitted that he once had a Facebook account – for which he used the pseudonym Spike Wells. Enjoying himself: Prince Harry was on cheerful form as he told of his hopes for September's Invictus Games . Friendly chat: Despite his dislike of social media, Harry hopes the 'digital champions' will help spread the word . Harry was meeting 60 students from six London schools taking classes at Bethnal Green Academy on how to Tweet and use Facebook and other websites as they prepare to become ‘digital champions’ for the Invictus Games. The prince has spearheaded the event, which will be held between September 10th and 14th at the Olympic Park, and will see 400 wounded servicemen and women from 14 countries compete in everything from volleyball to archery. Speaking off the cuff, Harry told his audience: ‘For me this is an opportunity for the British public to say thank you to these people from across the world for their service. You only hear about the guys who die, you never hear about the injuries. ‘So to give this opportunity to all these guys who have been injured and managed to survive thanks to the amazing medical care we have nowadays, I think that's a really powerful message to send to everybody. Some of them shouldn't be alive but they are.’ Snap happy: A student at Bethnal Green Academy films Prince Harry as he tells teens about the Invictus Games . He told the students how he was inspired by the Warrior Games, a similar event held in the US, during a visit to Colorado in 2012 and vowed to make their concept global. Since then he has immobilised the MOD, London Mayor and Olympics organisers to throw their weight behind the event. During the very relaxed visit Harry sat in on three workshops at the school, at one point even taking over and asking the young people questions about why they like social media. He posed for photographs with several of the students and encouraged them to ‘get out of the classroom’ to take pictures and tweet from Olympic locations. After the event - and despite his disdain for the site - photos of Prince Harry flooded onto Twitter, with students telling of their delight at meeting him. No escape: Prince Harry was the subject of a series of delighted selfies, including this from Sheridan Gateley . Popular: This twitpic of Prince Harry also appeared on the site as his 'digital champions' got to work . One, Sheridan Gateley, who describes himself as a 'passionate Arsenal fan and a fan of sport in general,' tweeted: . 'Selfie with His Royal Highness Prince Harry.

"Prince Charles admitted today that his action man days were behind him as he chatted to surfers on a Cornish beach. The heir to the throne, considered something of a heart throb in his day and who frequently drew admiring glances from women on sun-kissed beaches around the world, said ruefully that he was 'past his sell-by date'. The prince and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, were visiting the surfing mecca of Watergate Bay near Newquay, Cornwall, as part of a three-day trip to the West Country. Surf's up! Charles met with a group of young surfing chefs at surfing mecca Watergate Bay, Cornwall . Beach body: The heir to the throne was considered . something of a heart throb in his day . Charles recalled the days when his bronzed body was a regular sight on boards at nearby resorts such as Constantine and Polzeath on the county's north coast. His sons, William and Harry still regularly go surfing in the area but Charles, 65, told the beach's RNLI lifeboat manager Steve Instance: 'I'm past my sell by date for surfing.' But his return to the coast briefly made him long for those days again. Down on the beach he met with some surfing chefs - a group of students from Camborne College near Redruth who are on a placement at Jamie Oliver's Fifteen restaurant immediately above the cove. Everybody go surfing... except for Charles: the Prince said 'I'm past my sell-by date for surfing' Envious: Charles told one young surfer that he wished he could return to the water-sporting days of his youth . One of them, Carla Viladonmat, 25, said the Prince had told her he was envious of them. 'He said that he had done it himself quite a few years ago and wished he could get back out there now,' she said. The Prince and Camilla also spent time chatting with a group called Surf Action, who teach the sport to military veterans, many suffering post traumatic stress disorder, to help them to adjust to life after war service. Rich Emerson, one of the charity's founders and a former Lance Corporal in the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, said it had helped him come to terms with life when he was living in a Cornish cave after serving in the first Gulf War. 'It's something to do with the salt water. You get a lot of positive vibrations in the salt water,' he said. 'We mainly deal with a lot of post traumatic stress.' Charles and Camilla also met formerly unemployed apprentice chefs at the Fifteen, which is run by Jamie Oliver but managed by the charity Cornwall Food Foundation. Magic of food: Charles met young chefs at the restaurant 'Jamie Oliver's Fifteen Cornwall' Birthday visit: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, celebrates her 67th birthday in Cornwall today . It trains the apprentices on an intensive 16-month course designed to use the magic of food to unlock their potential and create the chefs of the future. Later the Duchess used a visit to the award winning Camel Valley Vineyard near Bodmin to call on English wine producers to come up with an alternative name for sparkling wine to rival champagne. Only wine produced in the Champagne region of France can use the name but the Duchess described how sparkling wine made in the UK was ""very good"". Sampling a glass of bubbly - a glass of sparkling wine from 2011 called Annie's Anniversary - the Duchess said: 'I think we should come up with an idea for British sparkling wine because it's champagne and very good champagne - it should have a special name.' School days: Camilla meets Ben and Scarlett from Ben and Scarlett from Padstow School . Camilla's father Major Bruce Shand was a wine merchant and passed on his love for whites, reds and rose to his daughter, who is now president of the United Kingdom Vineyards Association. To mark her trip to the Camel Valley Vineyard, Camilla, who celebrates her 67th birthday today, was presented with a Methuselah  of sparkling rose wine - containing nine bottles. Camel Valley was started by Bob and Annie Lindo 25 years ago when they converted their livestock farmland to growing vines and, with their son Sam, have gone on to great success. Their wines have won international awards and a sparkling variety was used in the toasts at a Commonwealth leaders summit in Sri Lanka last autumn hosted by the Prince of Wales. Each year the vineyard produces 100,000 bottles of wine of all types from grapes grown on south facing slopes in an idyllic part of north Cornwall.","Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall met with surfers in Cornwall .

"He’s such a little ruffian, according to his parents, that it’s a wonder the butterfly escaped unscathed. In one of two new photographs issued to mark his first birthday today, Prince George can be seen pointing and gazing intently at the delicate creature which has landed on his father’s hand.

Celebrations: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with Prince George during a visit to the Sensational Butterflies exhibition at the Natural History Museum in London . After all, on his first public engagement in New Zealand back in April, George unwittingly managed to make a female playmate cry by snatching her toy from her. The second photograph released by Kensington Palace yesterday shows the clearly enchanted young family in the midst of the ‘Sensational Butterflies’ exhibition at the Natural History Museum, in London, as several dozen live butterflies hover in the distance. Kate is wearing an appropriately summery £475 ‘Budding Hearts’ tea-dress by designer Suzannah, which she has worn previously on public occasions. Meanwhile George, who, like his mother is becoming something of a trend setter, is wearing blue and white stripped dungarees and a navy top by French label Petit Bateau, which sold out within minutes of another picture from the same set being released at the weekend. In one of two new photographs issued, Prince George can be seen pointing and gazing intently at the delicate creature which has landed on his father's hand . The Duke and Duchess also issued a statement thanking members of the public for the hundreds of presents, cards and letters of good wishes they have received since their son’s birth last July. ‘We would like to take this opportunity on George’s first birthday to thank everyone over the last year, wherever we have met them, both at home and overseas, for their warm and generous good wishes to George and our family,’ they said. Although keen to ensure that their son is allowed to grow up away from the spotlight, William and Kate acknowledged that they needed to mark the future king’s special day with a public gesture.

The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George watch Princes William and Harry play polo at Cirencester Park Polo Club, Gloucestershire, in June . The Duchess was, however, determined to ensure that one of their patronages would benefit from the occasion, and chose to visit the Natural History Museum’ s pop-up tropical house, full of live, free-flying butterflies and moths. She became patron of the museum in April last year. The exhibition, which runs until September, was opened up especially for the Cambridges and their team earlier this month but, says one closely involved in the proceedings, things didn’t entirely run to plan. As it was early morning, the butterflies, which normally swarm around visitors, needed time to warm up, and it was ‘touch and go’ as to whether the shoot would work.

Fortunately a blue morpho butterfly (Morpho peleides) from South America landed in front of the curious little prince and with a click, the carefree shot, so unlike normal royal portraits, was captured for posterity. Sir Michael Dixon, Director of the Natural History Museum said of the visit: ‘It was a real pleasure to host our Patron and her family earlier this month. They seemed to enjoy their visit, wandering through the tropical plants as brightly coloured butterflies took flight around them. 'It was delightful to see Prince George’s first experience of the Natural History Museum and I look forward to welcoming them again in the future.’ Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge with their son Prince George and Lupo the dog photographed at Kensington Palace, in London .

"Prince William was left helpless with laughter today after his bemused father was described as 'quite buff' during an event in Covent Garden today. The second in line to the throne had donned a wet suit to demonstrate his snorkelling skills in a Central London swimming pool when the delicate subject of a topless picture of Prince Charles taken in the 70s was raised. Chairman of the British Sub-Aqua Club, Eugene Farrell, had guests in stitches as he described the photograph of the heir to the throne as being 'quite buff' during his own diving days. Scroll down for video . Me? Buff? Prince Charles was left bemused when he was described as buff - much to the amusement of his son, Prince William . Boss: Prince William became president of the British Sub-Aqua Club in May after Charles stepped down . Entertaining: Prince William was left giggling when his father was left baffled after being described as 'buff' Enjoying the day: Prince William laughs as he splashes around in the pool during a reception in London . But while the rest of the room fell about laughing, Charles was left baffled, looking to his son for an explanation. Ever helpful, William, 32, leaned over and explained it to his father who raised his eyebrows theatrically, only to be told: 'Pa, you should be pleased! ' by a laughing Duke of Cambridge. Charles did see the funny side, quipping 'I know my eldest will now demonstrate his buff credentials' during his own address. Father and son were at the Oasis Leisure Centre near Covent Garden where Charles was formally handing over his presidency of the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) after 40 years to William. His own father, The Duke of Edinburgh, previously held the presidency and joked that he had installed a love of the water in his son from an early age. Definitely buff: A muscly Prince Charles tries his hand at windsurfing in a photo taken in Majorca in 1986 . Enthused: Charles told of how he threw William in the pool as a child - kickstarting a passion for diving . Diving fans: Both Prince William and Prince Charles have long been fans of all things aqua sport . 'I threw him in the swimming pool on occasions. Instead of putting him off, it enthused him,' he said. Charles also recalled how he had been 'absolutely terrified' when he divided in the Arctic and and how once, when a Moray Eel, came out of the gloom and put its teeth on his mask he 'shot off like a Polaris missile'. 'I hope one day my son, George, might follow in our footsteps,' said William during his own speech. 'At the moment bath time is quite painful but hopefully donning a snorkel and mask might calm him down.' William then donned a wet suit and got into the outdoor pool - despite earlier admitting he was something of a 'fair weather diver' - and tried his hand at snorkelling with a group of eight-year-olds. The prince slipped easily into the water as he chatted with the youngsters about their own diving experiences. He was then challenged to a race - but let the others win. Then it was time to put on his own, borrowed, mask and tank and get under the water. Brrr! As his father promised, Prince William demonstrated his buff credentials in the chilly swimming pool .

Fellow diver Tom Billingham , 17, who dives with the Dudley Dolphins, said: 'He was a natural diver and had clearly done it many times before. He appeared to be really enjoying himself.' Charles watched the end of the display and jokingly threw a plastic crab into the water at his son  before leaving William to get changed. Tony Marshall, Vice chairman of the BSAC, said William was following in a long line of royal divers. 'Prince William trained with us and as well as with the army down at Fort Bovisand near Plymouth,' he said. 'I also know he has been out with one of our local groups on Anglesey. 'The Duchess, his wife, is also a member of the BSAC. He admitted that he prefers warm water diving but clearly has a passion for the sport. It is one of the most exciting sports you can be involved in.' Eugene Farrell, Chairman of the BSAC which has 30,000 members countrywide, said it was an honour to welcome William as the third generation of his family to become president. 'We look forward to working closely with The Duke to inspire a new generation of young scuba divers and snorkellers to discover the rich adventure and opportunities of the underwater world which we all have a shared interest in preserving and protecting,' he said.

Camilla was visiting Exeter Library in Devon to open a new facility and promote its Summer Reading Challenge when she was challenged to put pen to paper in front of a group of schoolchildren.

Aides looked slightly askance as the drawing demonstration most definitely had not been part of the planned engagement. But giggling Camilla gamely took up a green marker pen and offered up her best effort - complete with large ears, goggly eyes and a slightly toothy grin.

"The Duchess of Cambridge is to take her first solo foreign tour, travelling to Malta on behalf of the Queen in September. Kate will join celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of Malta's independence from the UK on September 20th and 21st, Kensington Palace announced today. In a sign of her confidence in her grandson’s wife, the Queen has asked the Duchess to travel to the Mediterranean island which holds a special place in her heart. Scroll down for video . Off to Malta: The Duchess of Cambridge, seen here at Wimbledon last month, is to visit the island in September . As young newly-weds, the Queen and Prince Philip - who was then serving in HMS Chequers with the Royal Navy’s Mediterranean Fleet - lived together on Malta for almost two years. The Queen considers their time there as one of the happiest periods of her life as it was their only experience of living like an 'ordinary' couple. Although they were accompanied to the island by a retinue which included an equerry, a valet, a lady-in-waiting, and the Princess's childhood nanny, as well as their ever-present police bodyguards, the newly-weds were pretty much free to come and go as they pleased. For the future Queen, this was simply unheard of. There were parties, picnics, swimming expeditions and boat trips. Happy time: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh lived in Maltese capital Valletta for two years in the 1950s . Job: The Duke was serving on destroyer HMS Chequers, seen here in a Boxing Day photo with the Queen . The young princess even went out shopping and on visits to the hairdressers with the other young officers' wives. Philip, meanwhile, discovered a life-long love of polo. 'It was a fabulous time,' he later recalled. The couple lived at Villa Guardamangia, an idyllic holiday home rented by Philip's uncle, Lord 'Dickie' Mountbatten. During her stay in Malta the Queen left her first child, Prince Charles, at Buckingham Palace with his nanny and grand-parents, although she returned home for frequent visits. Her daughter, Princess Anne, was conceived on the island, and although she went back to England for her birth in August 1950, the Queen returned to Malta several times afterwards. Striking: A view of the Maltese capital Valletta with the lovely St Paul's Pro-Cathedral dominating the skyline . Famous sight: The Azure Window in neighbouring Gozo featured in HBO series Game of Thrones . In July 1951, she and Philip were forced to move back to Britain for good, however, when her father, George V1, fell seriously ill - bringing an end to one of the most carefree periods of her life. The Queen and her husband lasted visited Malta in 2007, to mark her diamond wedding anniversary. In a statement, Kensington Palace said: 'Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge will visit Malta on 20th and 21st September 2014 to represent Her Majesty The Queen on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Malta's independence.

And then there are the lucrative celebrity magazine shoots. Most recently they sold the first pictures of their baby, Mia Grace, for an estimated £40,000. Last year, Zara and her husband sold their five-bedroom home in Cheltenham for £1.27million, having bought it for £800,000 in 2009, making a profit of nearly £500,000. They have now moved into a property on Princess Anne’s Gatcombe Park estate, where Zara has stables and trains her horses. It is not known whether they own the cottage or pay any rent for it. Tindall himself still owns a £400,000 three-bedroom flat in a Georgian terrace in the centre of Bath, which he rents out for around £1,500 per month. And he owns a £300,000 three-bedroom flat in Dubai, which he also lets. Experts suggest that it could treble in price by 2020, leaving him with a £600,000 profit should he choose to sell. Tindall, 35, earns a salary at Gloucester Rugby Club, where he is a player-coach, and for his roles as an ambassador for brokers UFXMarkets and Artemis Fund Managers. He also has a company, Kimble Trading, of which he is the sole director and shareholder, which had £257,000 in the bank in 2008 and has made a relatively modest £197,000 over the last five years. He owns a quarter-share in racehorse Monbeg Dude, which has won £120,000 in prize money and is worth more than £200,000, and he has invested bonuses earned during the height of his professional success on the stock market. However, it is his wife who is the breadwinner. Experts believe Zara’s status as a royal triples her worth to between £300,000 and £500,000 a year per sponsor. The most significant deal is with outdoor clothing line Musto, which could be worth up to £800,000 a year . The Queen’s granddaughter was paid a six-figure sum to lend her name to video game Howrse, in which players own, train and compete on a virtual horse . More controversially, however, she has become the first royal to sign a deal with an online gaming firm. The Queen’s granddaughter was paid a six-figure sum to lend her name to video game Howrse, in which players own, train and compete on a virtual horse. Zara is also an ambassador for Rolex and Land Rover and has worked for Samsung, the Magic Millions horse sale in Australia, as well as the same fund managers as her husband, Artemis. Simon Rines, of the International Journal of Sports Marketing and Sponsorship, said: ‘There simply isn’t anyone else like her and her royalness, for want of a better word, is a unique selling point.’ A spokesman for the couple was contacted about this article but did not offer any comment.","Olympic silver medal-winning eventer rakes in estimated £1m a year from sponsorship .

"Prince Charles has admitted that speaking his mind is ‘in his blood’ as he revisited communities in Somerset blighted by flooding earlier this year. The heir to the throne was today meeting local residents in the village of Muchleney where, back in in February, he shamed both the Government and Environment Agency into finally responding to the crisis when he said: ‘The tragedy is that nothing happened for so long.’ Unlike his last visit, when he was forced to travel by boat and trailer, Charles arrived by car and marvelled at the once waterlogged countryside, covered in wildflowers and bathed in sunshine. Scroll down for video . It's Pimms O' Clock! Prince Charles enjoys a glass of Pimms while touring the village of Muchelney . Nice to see you again! Prince Charles chats to Muchelney locals as he returns for a second visit . But the plight of locals on the Somerset Levels who were left stranded and isolated for weeks on end was clearly not far from his mind. Although the future king is often lambasted for his so-called ‘meddling’ in national politics, in Muchleney they couldn’t have been more grateful for his stance after the ‘shameful neglect’ of the authorities earlier this year. Among those queuing up to thank the prince was farmer Jane Pine, 59, of Meare Green Farm, who told him that his visit and subsequent lobbying to get local rivers dredged – blamed by many for the some of the worst flooding in generations - has achieved ‘more last February than we have achieved in the last ten years of campaigning’. The prince replied: ‘Well I had to do something. It runs in the family. It’s in my blood.’ He added: ‘At least I’ve done some good.’ Shocking: Prince Charles perches on a 'throne' atop a tractor trailer during his first visit  in February . All smiles: This time around, the Prince of Wales was able to enjoy a glass of Pimms and a sunny day . He also chatted at length to another elderly local farmer, Stanley Chedzoy, and his family who have now farmed Slough Court Farm in Stoke St Gregory for five generations. His grandson, Anthony Gothard, said: ‘We had a really terrible year in 2012  as a result of the flooding and to have it happen again so soon after ploughing hundreds of thousands of pounds to keep the farm going was just devastating. We had to think seriously about whether we could carry on this year.’ Charles visited the family farm, which had  250 acres of land under water, back in February. ‘His visit genuinely got momentum behind the relief effort and he has clearly made an effort to keep that momentum going. We owe the prince a lot,’ Mr Gothard said. Mr Chedzoy added: ‘The politicians weren’t listening, the Environment Agency weren’t listening. No-one was listening until Prince Charles came down. We have got to thank Prince Charles for a lot of that publicity we subsequently received here.’ Charles’s first visit of the day was to Glastonbury Abbey, where he was accompanied by festival organiser Michael Eavis, as part of a publicity drive to encourage tourists back to Somerset following the winter crisis. Royal wave: Prince Charles waves to villagers following his second visit to the flood-hit village of Muchelney . Tourism: Earlier, the prince had joined tourism chiefs and Michael Eavis for a tour of Glastonbury Abbey . Historic: Glastonbury Abbey is thought to contain the tomb of the legendary King Arthur . The . Abbey, which sits on the edge of the Somerset Levels, is one of the . most beautiful spots in the area and is home to the tomb of the . legendary King Arthur and his Queen Guinevere. Thought . to have been the site of Avalon, Glastonbury is also associated with . Joseph of Arimathea who is said to have founded the now ruined abbey in . the first century. More recently, the Abbey was used as the . resting place for several Anglo-Saxon kings, among them the battling . Edmund Ironside who fought off the Danes only to die shortly afterwards, . leaving England to the tender mercies of King Canute and his Danish . empire. Then it was onto Muchleney where he met members of the local rural community at Almonry Barn, a 900-year-old wedding venue owned and run by the Wilson-Ward family. Although the venue suffered less water damage than many properties it was completely cut off for weeks on end and with prospective clients unable to view the property has suffered a large downturn in bookings. Adorable: Prince Charles meets baby Calvin Jack, five months, during his visit to Castle Cary railway station . All smiles: Prince Charles was on cheerful form as he met the baby and his parents before returning to London . Louise Wilson-Ward, 29, said: ‘It was hell, to be honest. Very surreal being cut off for weeks on end unable to do anything about it and with no end in sight. The situation was horribly isolating. ‘When Prince Charles came down to visit us we thought things were on the turn but the next day the rains came back with a vengeance. ‘ . Her mother Angela, 53, also explained: ‘We had been wandering around, aimlessly, for weeks on end, without knowing what to do. ‘I had been emailing everyone I could think of – the local council, the Environment Agency and even Downing Street but no-one bothered to reply. Then Prince Charles came to the area and suddenly, within 24 hours, everyone couldn’t reply quick enough. Except David Cameron – I never heard from him.’ Lovely to meet you: Prince Charles shakes hands with Calvin Jack's father Robin Etherington, 37, from Bristol . On his way: Prince Charles prepares to board a train bound for London after his day out in Somerset . Her daughter added: ‘We have been knocked really quite badly by what has happened. The place was derelict and hadn’t even been opened for six years when we took it over two years ago. 'It’s now the oldest wedding barn in England and has been a real labour of love. But no-one could get to us to view the barn and bookings have been hit. ‘It’s wonderful that the prince is continuing to take such an interest. The footage of the floods was undeniably shocking but we want to put out a message of recovery and hope.’ Although he arrived by car, Charles made a point of taking the train back to London for his evening engagement to highlight the quick links between London and Somerset. The prince, who does not travel by rail very often, took his seat in a First Class carriage alongside astonished fellow travellers. Unsurprisingly the train wasn’t late -  and arrived in London on time.","Prince Charles returned to the village of Muchelney on the Somerset Levels .

"The Duchess of Cambridge made a beeline for a group of flag-waving children as she arrived at a London Primary School this morning. Wearing a shocking salmon pink dress by her new favourite label, Goat, Kate sank to her knees to chat to youngsters who cheered and waved the English flag. She wore her long brown locks in ringlets in a half up style. The Duchess visited the Blessed Sacrament School in Islington, north London, to view the progress of M-PACT Plus, a project which helps address the difficult issue of addiction in families. Scroll down for video . Special guest: The Duchess of Cambridge visits an M-PACT Plus counselling programme in Islington, London, today . Making friends: The Duchess crouches down to talk to the children . Royal reception: Kate chats to the children who waved flags in her honour . Attentive: The mother-of-one made a beeline for the children on her arrival . The children were delighted to meet her. One little four-year-old made Kate smile . when she asked him what his favourite part of school was. Ezekiel . quipped back: 'Lunchtime.' Kate . asked a group of flag waving youngsters why they were so happy. And a . little girl, Seyi, six, told her: 'I said it was because she has come to . Blessed Sacrament school. I said I liked her dress.' And beaming Abigail, seven, said: 'She looks good in pink.' The Duchess launched M-PACT Plus with comedian John Bishop on a visit to Manchester in 2013 when she was pregnant with her son, Prince George. The project is funded by The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry - the vehicle for the trio's charitable initiatives - in conjunction with Comic Relief and two charities of which Kate is royal patron, Place2be and Action on Addiction. M-PACT Plus provides early support for school children affected by a parent's drug or alcohol misuse. Pleased to meet you: The Duchess shakes hands with one of the school girls and is presented with a bouquet of flowers that matched her dress . Perfectly groomed: Kate's long brown locks were swept back off her face . Extra curls: The Duchess had ringlets in her enviable, long brown hair today . Stylish as always: Kate wore a pink dress by Goat and nude heels . Pretty as a princess: Kate wore her wavy hair in a half up style and carried a box clutch that matched her shoes . Personal involvement: The Duchess is given a tour of the school to check the progress of a charity project she helped launch last year . It involves training school staff to identify children affected by addiction and by bringing families together for an eight week pilot intervention. A Kensington Palace spokesman said the project had been driven by a personal interest from the Duchess. They said: 'MPACT-Plus came about as a result of The Duchess of Cambridge's desire to help children of addicted families break the cycle of addiction, and she has taken a close interest in its progress. Better than normal lessons? The excited children wave their flags at Kate . Entertaining: Kate was amused when one of the children told her their favourite part of the school day is lunchtime . Good impression: The children said they liked Kate's dress pink . Royal duties: Slim Kate was driven to the school in North London this morning. She immediately sprang into action to meet and greet people . The Duchess is given a warm welcome from a man in uniform . 'Through her patronage of Action on Addiction, The Duchess of Cambridge became aware of the shattering impact of addiction, not only on those addicted, but also on their families. Research suggests that children of addicts are seven times more likely to become addicts themselves. 'The Duchess directed her charity, The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry to find a way to help. The Royal Foundation and Comic Relief commissioned research, which resulted in bringing together two charities together, Place2Be and Action on Addiction, to deliver M-PACT Plus and get specialist support to children at a young age, before problems have the potential to develop. 'Today's engagement is an opportunity for The Duchess of Cambridge to meet those delivering the programmes and discuss how the pilot is progressing.' The Duchess met project co-ordinators and headteachers who are helping to roll out the scheme in Sunderland, Manchester, Essex and London. She then joined a private counselling session during the hour-and-a-half-long visit. The pupils waited patiently for their chance to speak to the royal . Honest answers: Kate asked the children what they liked best about school and the responses included books and lunchtime . Getting up to date: The royal said she was pleased with how a charity project at the school supporting families dealing with addiction was progressing . Kate joined John Bishop to meet members of the school and hear speeches. The comedian had the Duchess in stitches when, during a speech to mark the occasion, he urged the assembled media not to focus on the 'style icon in their midst' - they were wearing, where their clothes were from or what hairstyle was in place - but to focus on the project. 'Basically, don't make the story about me,' he joked. Kate burst into giggles and couldn't stop smiling throughout the rest of the comedy star's speech. After he sat down she leant over to him and whispered something, giggling again. On a serious note, Bishop said Kate is 'genuinely committed' to the issue, and hailed the involvement of the Royal Foundation. 'What's good about it is that it will hopefully de-stigmatise the whole area. Addiction doesn't care what social class you're from. It's across the board. The levels of addiction in Knightsbridge will be as high, if not higher, than some of the most deprived areas in the country,' he said. 'I think, from the brief conversations I've had with her, she's committed to it as a person and probably even more so now as a mother, because you realise children are such fragile things and you've got to try and support them when they're at their weakest.' The Duchess of Cambridge is well known for her polished look and perfectly quaffed hair, but she stepped away from her traditional blow dry for her visit to Blessed Sacrament School in Islington North London. In a half-up style, Kate rang the changes with tightly wound glossy curls draped over either shoulder of her pink Goat dress. This is opposed to the Duchess' usual style of loosely waved blow-dry. As always her brunette locks had a high shine finish and there was not a hair out of place despite her busy day. Hairdresser to the stars, Nicky Clarke says: 'This look is great for day old hair. The curls will stay in place much better with hair that has not been washed for a day. Perfect for a long day of meeting the public.' He continued: 'Kate has probably been quite busy so her front lengths have grown giving the perfect base for this look. 'This style will also keep the hair off her face during the summer and gives an added something to the plainness of her dress. 'With her busy schedule, this look is perfect if your hair has grown a little too heavy at the front to wear loose as it will elongate the face. This look perks the face up and highlights Kate's cheekbones. 'It's regal, neat and well balanced and gives the 60's vibe of the dress a modern update.' Jonathan Long of Lockonego salon in Chelsea added: 'Kate has gone for much larger curls on this occasion which can be achieved on smooth hair using a large barrel tong. 'This makes a nice change for Kate and the good thing about this style is that the curls will drop out as the day goes on, giving a less structured more relaxed look which we usually see on Kate. 'It's a great style to last all day in hot weather as the curls become more dishevelled as the day goes on. The key to this look is to start the curls a few inches from the root area to give a modern yet still classic look.' Celeb backing: John Bishop joined the Duchess of Cambridge on a visit to an M-PACT Plus Counselling programme at Blessed Sacrament School in London . Kate giggled as she sat on the stage to hear Bishop's speech - which also had a serious message about the project at the school . The Duchess took an update on the project seriously and was interested to hear the progress that had been made . Work of art: Kate was presented with a Picasso style portrait of herself holding Prince George. The framed picture was given to thank her for visiting . Set to hang in Kensington Palace? The Duchess seemed delighted with the gift . The royal carried the portrait back to the car herself as she returned home . A spokesman for Place2Be said: 'With one in three children in every classroom affected by a mental health problem, early intervention is vital. The Duchess of Cambridge became Place2Be's royal patron last year after expressing particular interest in helping to support children and families affected by mental health problems. 'At Place2Be we work with more than 80,000 children in schools across the country to provide integrated mental health support to those affected by domestic violence, abuse addiction, divorce, school transition, bullying and other complex social issues.' Inside the school, the Duchess sat in on a steering group comprised of head teachers and charity workers involved in rolling out the M-PACT Plus scheme. Kate, who had her hair half swept from her face, listened intently as she was updated about its success so far and was clearly interested as she asked several pertinent questions about its workings. 'Were the parents quite surprised by the things their children were saying?' she asked. Nodding intently, she continued: 'Have you found it difficult to attract parents given the stigma that can be associated with these issues?' She also remarked that the training being given to teachers to spot children who may have issues due to their parents' substance abuse 'gives them more confidence to approach the topics.' 'That's fantastic,' she said, as she learnt about some of the success stories so far. As she left, the royal was presented with a work of art from a pupil. The painting was a Picasso style portrait of the Duchess cradling baby Prince George. She appeared delighted with the gift and carried it herself back to the awaiting car.","Kate visited Blessed Sacrament School in Islington, north London .

"Mystery last night surrounded the whereabouts of a portrait of the Queen painted by shamed entertainer Rolf Harris. The shamed star was commissioned by the BBC to mark the monarch’s 80th birthday and although not well-received by critics, it did, briefly, hang on the walls at Buckingham Palace. But last night the national broadcaster was denying all knowledge of its whereabouts. Scroll down for video . Unknown whereabouts: The BBC has denied all knowledge of where Rolf Harris' portrait of the Queen is being stored. Meanwhile the gallery known last to have it have taken down all references on their website . Meanwhile the gallery last known to have had possession of it was not answering enquiries - and appeared to have taken all references to Harris down from its website. Even sources close to the presenter and artist said they could not offer a ‘definitive answer’ as to where the picture was being stored. The Queen sat for Harris twice at Buckingham Palace in 2005, with the oil, which took two months to complete, finally being unveiled around the time of her landmark birthday the following year. In it she can be seen wearing an emerald green dress, her favourite pearls and a brooch made to mark her late mother’s 100th birthday. The presenter personally unveiled his finished work to the monarch in the Yellow Drawing Room and later boasted about how she had been ‘very friendly’. His efforts were filmed by the BBC and shown in a special edition of his programme, Rolf On Art. Critics lambasted the portrait as ‘amateurish’ - singling out her toothy grimace and awkward hands for particular scorn - but the palace duly hung it for a few months in the Queen’s Gallery, which is open to the public, as part of their 2006 summer opening display. It was handed straight back to the BBC afterwards, in around October of that year. A royal source said last night: ‘It was commissioned by the BBC for the Queen’s 80th birthday and was returned to the BBC – end of story. ’The portrait never belonged to the Queen and was never gifted to her. There was, however, a great deal of interest around the painting and the programme that accompanied it which is why it was displayed in the Queen’s Gallery for a short period. ‘It was handed back to the BBC afterwards and we haven’t seen it since.’ But a spokesman for the broadcaster told the Mail in a statement yesterday: ‘We have been asked about this before and out position hasn’t changed. The BBC does not have this painting in its collection.’ Landmark: The shamed star, pictured arriving at Buckingham Palace, was commissioned to paint the Queen to mark her 80th birthday . Remarkably, given that the BBC used public funds to commission both the portrait and programme, a spokesman added: ‘It was commissioned by us… but I can’t speculate as to where it may be.’ Enquiries have since revealed that the painting was put out on loan again to the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool in 2012 as part of a wider exhibition of paintings by Harris. Later that year, it seems that it was handed back to Whitewall Galleries, which is understood to deal with the sale and display of all Harris’s personally-owned paintings. Callers to the firm – which has more than 25 branches across the country and sells work by Jimi Hendrix and even, bizarrely, Timmy Mallett - were last night asked to send in their questions by email. At the time of going to press, the Mail had not received a response. Intriguingly, while internet searches still show several historic links between Harris and Whitewall Galleries – he frequently appeared at promotional events for the firm around the country as well as having his artwork sold by them – all references to him appear to have been deleted from their website. One source in the art world suggested last night that Mr Harris may have taken the portrait back for his personal collection. Whether that was simply for sentimental reasons or that he had an eye on selling it should he have been cleared of the charges he now faces jail for, may never be known. The only certainty is that it is unlikely to ever hang in public again.","Shamed star was commissioned by the BBC to mark her 80th birthday .

"Aside from the time travelling Delorean and coveted hoverboard, the Back To The Future franchise featured another simpler, yet equally futuristic design - self-tying laces. During Back To The Future II, Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, puts on a pair of Nike High Tops that automatically tighten and adjust to fit his feet - using so-called power laces. Nike released a limited range of McFly's Nike MAGs with manual laces in 2011, and now designer Tinker Hatfield has revealed the power laces will arrive in 2015. Scroll down for video . During Back To The Future II (1989), Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, puts on a pair of Nike High Tops that automatically tighten and adjust to fit his feet using so-called power laces, pictured . One of the most coveted pieces of futuristic tech seen in the Back To The Future franchise was the hoverboard - a skateboard-style device that can levitate. Inspired by this board, a team of Australian inventors designed the Baja board - a four-wheel drive motorised skateboard capable of reaching 31mph (50kmh). Elsewhere, California-based Future Motion created a self balancing, one wheeled skateboard. Called the Onewheel, the $1300 gadget can reach speeds on 12mph, and turn 360 degrees within the length of the board. Hatfield made these comments because 2015 was the year Back To the Future II was set in. Speaking at the Jordan Brand Flight Lab in New Orleans Hatfield told Sole Collector: 'Are we gonna see power laces in 2015? To that, I say yes!' Rumours about the technology have been circling since 2010 when Nike applied for a patent for 'automatically lacing trainers.' It said: 'The automatic lacing . system provides a set of straps that can be automatically opened and . closed to switch between a loosened and tightened position of the upper. 'The . article further includes an automatic ankle cinching system that is . configured to automatically adjust an ankle portion of the upper.’ The Back To The Future-inspired Nike MAG range was then launched in 2011. Much loved: Michael J. Fox starred in 1985's Back to the Future - the first in three films starring the actor and Christopher Lloyd . Rumours about the technology have been circling since 2010 when Nike applied for a patent for 'automatically lacing trainers'. Nike then released a range of Back To The Future-inspired High Tops, pictured, in 2011 . Only 1,500 models of the Nike MAG High Tops, pictured, were made, and every pair was auctioned off on eBay. A total of $6million (£3.5million) was raised from the sales of these shoes, and all the proceeds went to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research .

A total of $6million (£3.5million) was raised from the sales of these shoes, and all the proceeds went to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. San Francisco-based inventor Blake Bevin has already created her own self-tying laces, a prototype which she says will 'tide you over until Nike comes out with something more polished.' Using an Arduino microcontroller, Bevin fitted a sensor to a Nike High Top. When a person steps into the shoe, a force sensor reads the pressure of their foot and activates two servo motors, which apply tension to the laces, tightening the shoe. A touch switch can be used to reverse the servos. Using an Arduino microcontroller, designer Blake Bevin has already created a prototype version of a self-tying shoe, pictured.

"A police inspector has had his award-winning Twitter account and blog suspended by West Midlands Police over allegations of misuse. Inspector Michael Brown’s account had 16,700 followers and his blog, Mental Health Cop, was praised by experts for explaining the policing of mental health since 2011. But today it emerged that his account had been taken down by police bosses on the grounds he had been misusing the social media. Taken down: The account, which had 16,700 followers, can no longer be accessed, nor can his blog . The force refused to reveal details of the suspected misuse, but announced their on-going investigation is expected to last several days. A police spokesman said: 'West Midlands Police has a force social media policy which details how channels, such as Twitter, should be used by officers in both an official and personal capacity. 'As a force, the Corporate Communications Department monitors all corporate use and should any inappropriate or operationally sensitive communication be identified, this will be taken up with the individual. Recognition: Inspector Brown has won numerous awards, including the 2012 Chief Constable Award for outstanding contribution to mental health . 'In serious cases, the matter would be referred to the force’s Professional Standards Department. 'Recent monitoring has led to the suspension of an account operated by a response inspector whose focus was on mental health policing. 'Certain aspects of the officer’s communication is currently being investigated for alleged misuse of a force account and as such it would be inappropriate for the account to continue whilst further enquiries are made. 'Any breaches of force policy are taken extremely seriously and will be thoroughly and professionally investigated.' Probe: West Midlands Police refuse to explain the nature of the alleged misuse but revealed the investigation is expected to last a few days . Acting chief constable Garry Forsyth added: 'Our policy is intended to enable officers and staff to communicate with our communities effectively to offer an insight into our work. 'It does impose some restrictions but we are, of course, an organisation that holds sensitive information so we have to ensure that there is some restraint. 'I also can’t imagine any organisation that would want its employees to be openly critical of it - or indeed allow it. 'The policy is not intended to discourage personal perspectives and I believe a human element assists with engagement.' Inspector Brown, 39, has won numerous awards, includingthe Mind Digital Media award, handed to him by Stephen Fry, the Chief Constable's Award 2012 for outstanding contribution to mental health.

Comedian David Walliams had Prince Harry in stitches last night - after he invited him to a Peter Andre concert . The fourth in line to the throne met the Britain's Got Talent judge at a charity event at the Royal Albert Hall in London tonight with his father, brother and old friend, presenter Natalie Pinkham . Prince Harry, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge pose for a photo with members of the Military Wives Choir at the Business in the Community (BITC) 2014 Responsible Business Awards Gala Dinner . He later Tweeted: I just met Prince Harry and asked him if he wanted to come to see @MrPeterAndre in concert with me. He told Mail Online archly afterwards: 'Harry is a fan. Apparently.' Both Harry and his brother, Prince William, took the banter in their stride, however, exchanging jokes with the star. Walliams, who was co hosting the event with presenter Natalie Pinkham, a close friend of Harry, also had his audience in stitches before the royal party arrived with a serious of risqué jokes about celebrity arrests and getting 'pissed off your head'. After the event three princes also posed with the Military Wives Choir and street lyricist George The Poet. The three looked in good spirits as they took seats on the stage at tonight's event - a gala Responsible Business awards dinner organised by Prince Charles's Business In The Community . Founded by Charles 32 years ago, Business in the Community promotes the prince's belief that business should go far beyond the financial bottom line . The three princes pictured arriving at the event - co-hosted by David Walliams and Natalie Pinkham . Tonight's event was a gala Responsible Business awards dinner organised by Prince Charles's Business In The Community  charity Founded by Charles 32 years ago it promotes the prince's belief that business should go far beyond the financial bottom line. He seemed delighted that his sons had chosen to join him at the event, telling the audience that he was 'proud, delighted and amazed that my own next generation has decided to accompany me here tonight'. 'Perhaps curiosity has finally got the better of them? ' he joked. But there was a far more serious message the prince wanted to get across as He urged business leaders to employ more former servicemen and women, warning: ‘Fortune very often does not favour the brave.’ The heir to the throne highlighted the ‘loyalty and integrity’ of ex-military personnel as qualities that should be valued more by British firms. Harry looked dapper in a navy suit and striped burgundy tie as he made his way into the gala, held at the Royal Albert Hall . William and his father also wore the same shade of blue - with the eldest son matching his suit with a tie very similar to that worn by his father . In a keynote speech, Charles, who is president of the Business in the Community (BITC) charity, stressed the importance of creating training and job opportunities for former service personnel as well as for young, disabled and unemployed people. He said: ‘I want to look at a situation, which is just as big a concern to my sons as it is to me, where fortune very often does not favour the brave. ‘And that is in the opportunities available to our troops when they return home and seek employment outside the armed forces. Loyalty, integrity, teamwork and the ability to work calmly and with discipline and good humour under intense pressure are qualities that any business must surely value highly. ‘However the transition is by no means easy, and we should not pretend it is, even for the able-bodied. For those who have been wounded, of course, the difficulties are greater still.’ Charles, who has served with the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, added: ‘One of the biggest differences the corporate sector can make, is the development of the skills needed to fill the skills gaps and create the employment and economic independence that enable individuals to contribute fully to the community in which they live.’ The family appeared to share a joke as they walked in to the event.

"Ed Miliband and Philip Hammond were criticised yesterday for saying the floods had proved that climate change was a threat to our national security. The Labour leader said the country was ‘sleepwalking into a national security crisis’ because too many politicians failed to accept that climate change was causing the recent extreme weather. He added that global warming had the potential to destroy the homes, livelihoods and businesses of millions of people. Under fire: Ed Miliband (left) and Philip Hammond (both pictured during visits to flood-hit Berkshire last Tuesday) were criticised for saying the floods had proved that climate change was a threat to our national security . Defence Secretary Mr Hammond then weighed in to describe climate change as ‘definitely’ a national security issue. He added that it was ‘clearly a factor’ in the recent bad weather. The comments come amid growing criticism from Tory backbenchers that politicians were assigning blame for the extreme conditions to climate change, despite there being little evidence. Last night, as ministers struggled to get to grips with the extreme weather, Prime Minister David Cameron unveiled a £10million business support scheme to help small firms in flood-hit areas. Mr Hammond said a further 5,000 troops were on standby to offer their services to flood-stricken communities, but he risked angering councils by suggesting many of them had not asked the Army for help soon enough. The Defence Secretary told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the Army will carry out a ‘rapid inspection’ of the nation’s flood defences to assess damage caused by the floods. It will be carried out over the next five weeks - compared to the two years it usually takes. Announcement: Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured meeting soldiers on Saturday in flood-hit Chertsey, Surrey) has unveiled a £10million business support scheme to help small firms in flood-hit areas . In an interview with The Observer, Mr Miliband criticised Mr Cameron for abandoning the green rhetoric he used in opposition, and he called on all parties to unite behind scientific evidence that climate change was a key factor in extreme weather. He said climate scepticism among his backbenchers meant that the Prime Minister’s ability to give leadership was seriously hampered. ‘We have always warned that climate . change threatens national security because of the consequences for . destabilisation of entire regions of the world, mass migration of . millions of people and conflict over water or food supplies,’ said Mr . Miliband. 'Because of political division in Westminster, we are . sleepwalking into a national security crisis on climate change' Ed Miliband, Labour leader . ‘But the events of the last few weeks have shown this is a national security issue too, with people’s homes, businesses and livelihoods coming under attack from extreme weather. And we know this will happen more in the future. The science is clear. The public know there is a problem. ‘But because of political division in Westminster, we are sleepwalking into a national security crisis on climate change. The terrible events of the last few weeks should serve as a wake-up call for us all.’ A poll for the same newspaper showed that 51 per cent of voters believe the recent floods are a sign of climate change, while 24 per cent do not. The rest said they did not know. Mr Hammond offered some backing to the . Labour leader on Sky News, saying: ‘All the evidence suggests that . climate change is a significant factor in the weather patterns that . we’re seeing and Ed Miliband isn’t saying anything new. Trouble: Flood water covers fields in Chertsey. Ministers are struggling to get to grips with the extreme weather . ‘We’ve already identified climate change as one of the strategic threats that we have had to deal with. ‘The Ministry of Defence produces an annual report called Strategic Threats and it identifies climate change as one of the threats alongside rogue nuclear states.’ Asked whether he endorsed that, he said: ‘It’s a national security issue, definitely.’ 'We’ve already identified climate change as one of the strategic threats that we have had to deal with' Philip Hammond, Defence Secretary . Mr Hammond also criticised councils for failing to call in the Army, saying: ‘We offered troops quite a long while ago to civil authorities who wanted them. ‘What we’ve done over the last ten days is push them a bit more aggressively at those civil authorities.’ Last night Tory MP for Clacton, Douglas Carswell, said: ‘When politicians like Ed Miliband start talking about climate change, it’s because he hasn’t not anything else to talk about. ‘He said nothing on uncontrolled mass immigration - he was wrong about that. He said austerity would lead to recession - he was wrong about that. ‘So all he is left doing is talking in abstract terms about changing the weather. Politicians can’t even control our own borders so the idea that they can change the weather is absurd. ‘All Ed Miliband has done about climate change is put up domestic energy bills when he was minister.’","Ed Miliband and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond are both criticised .

"While TJ Oshie steals headlines for emerging from the ranks to lead Team USA hockey to victory over almighty Team Russia on Saturday, it's his gorgeous fiancee who's now stealing hearts. Even at eight months pregnant, Lauren Cosgrove managed to remain the picture of blonde beauty as she cheered on the 27-year-old St. Louis Blues forward, but the intense game-winning shootoout nearly proved to be too much. 'I might go into labor,' joked Cosgrove, as she watched the breathtaking display from home in Missouri. Scroll down for video... Who's luckier? Stunning blonde Lauren Cosgrove (left) is the fiancee of overnight USA hockey hero TJ Oshie (right) Shocking upset: USA forward T.J. Oshie, who normally plays for the St. Louis Blues, reacts after scoring the winning goal against Russia goaltender Sergei Bobrovski on Saturday. Back at home, eight months pregnant fiancee Cosgrove couldn't have been more thrilled . Cosgrove told KSDK that she's accustomed to her fiancee's prowess and that, despite all the excitement, it's no surprise he's rocketed to overnight superstardom. 'He's been a hearthrob for a while, here in St. Louis at least,' said the pert, smiling Cosgrove, who stayed behind because of her looming due date. Nonetheless, Minnesota raised Oshie barely made it to the Olympics. He was among the final selections for the U.S. roster and while he has never had a 20-goal NHL season, Oshie leads the Olympic team's American-born players with seven shootout goals this year. Oshie scored four times in the shootout and put the winner between the Russian goalie's legs in the eighth round, leading the United States past Russia 3-2 in the thrilling revival of the classic Olympic hockey rivalry stretching back to the USA's 1980 Miracle on Ice win. So, it may have been his small fish attitude less than his underdog status that made Oshie's game winning shoot out goal so unexpected. Just ask Cosgrove what he said when he called her after the game. 'I hope this all blows over pretty quick,' Cosgrove recalls Oshie saying about the media frenzy currently encircling him. 'This isn't really him,' she said. 'He's so low key.' 'I might go into labor!': Cosgrove, who is due to give birth on St. Patrick's Day, was unable to make it to Sochi. She watched Saturday's headlining grabbing game from home with friends in Missouri . All American: The beaming couple were engaged on their three-year anniversary just before Oshie left for Sochi . America's golden couple: The soon-to-be famous hockey bride met up-and-coming Oshie while they visited friends in North Dakota three years ago . Cosgrove, who is due to give birth . St. Patrick's day, says she's confident her country, and her personal . hearthrob, will take Team USA to the top of the podium at Sochi. 'I definitely have faith in team USA and I think they have a shot at the the gold.' Oshie's rise to fame was sparked thanks to a quirk in Olympic hockey rules. Whereas . in the NHL, teams must alternate which players they choose to face the . goal keeper in a shootout, in the Olympics a coach may choose the same . man each time. Oshie . was chosen for the U.S. men's hockey team with just such a situation in . mind, and the shootout specialist concocted one last clever goal to . silence an arena filled with screaming Russian fans. History in the making: USA forward T.J. Oshie scores the winning goal against Russia goaltender Sergei Bobrovski in a shootout during overtime of a men's ice hockey game at the 2014 Winter Olympics . Humble: 'I hope this all blows over pretty quick,' Cosgrove recalls Oshie saying about the media frenzy currently encircling him . International rules allow the same player to take multiple shots after the first three rounds of a shootout, and U.S. coach Dan Bylsma leaned on Oshie's array of slick shots and change-of-pace approaches to the net. Oshie scored on the Americans' first shot before taking the last five in a row, going 4 for 6 against Bobrovsky and disappointing a Bolshoy Ice Dome crowd including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Oshie's final shot was a beauty: He threaded a forehand right through Bobrovsky's pads, the puck punching the back of the Russian net emphatically enough to pop the water bottle on top into the air. The U.S. men are only interested in the one that all but wrapped up an automatic berth in the quarterfinals next week. 'I think you're going to see T.J. Oshie become a household name after that display he put on,' said David Backes, Oshie's teammate in St. Louis. 'The kids will be out on the pond probably in Minnesota right now, throwing a 5-hole on the goalie three or four times in a row.' Unexpted: Team USA celebrates after Oshie helped defeat Russia in a shootout during the Men's Ice Hockey Preliminary Round Group A game on day eight of the Sochi games . Timothy Leif Oshie was born on December 23, 1986. Grew up in Warroad, Minnesota AKA Hockeytown, USA, a town of 1,770 that's sent a player to every medal-winning USA men's hockey team. Oshie was born in Everett, Washington, but as a boy moved to Warroad in hockey-crazed Minnesota. Oshie starred at Warroad High School, a tiny powerhouse in the northwest corner of the state, right near the Canadian border. He led the Warriors to two state titles before playing three years in college at North Dakota. Oshie was a first-round draft choice by the Blues in 2005. His entered the league in 2008, but his best season came in 2011-12 when he scored 19 goals and had 35 assists to help the Blues make the playoffs. 'I think you're going to see T.J. Oshie become a household name after that display he put on. The kids'll be out on the pond probably in Minnesota right now, throwing a 5-hole on the goalie three or four times in a row. He does a great job for us in St. Louis. That's part of the reason he's on this team, along with some of the other things you can't put on the stat sheet.' — Team USA teammate and St. Louis Blues forward David Backes.","American's newest Olympic darling proposed to Lauren Cosgrove on their 3-year anniversary just before he left for Sochi .

'There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.' The couple, who wed in 2003 after eight years together, have two daughters together. While it isn't clear how long ago they parted ways, Ben has been spotted at several events in London over the past week, including the Julien Macdonald London Fashion Week show last Friday and the Dot Com Children's Fund Charity Gala on Tuesday. Life goes on: Ben caught up with his Strictly Come Dancing friends at the Dot Com Children's Foundation charity dinner in London on Tuesday night . The retired rugby player, 36, was still wearing his wedding ring as he left the gala at Mansion House in the City of London on Tuesday night.

Also in attendance was his former professional partner Kristina Rihanoff, who he ended up in eighth place on last year's series.

In November last year, Countdown presenter Rachel Riley revealed her marriage had ended and earlier this month went public with her Strictly professional partner Pasha Kovalev as a couple.

"Controversial: Police asked the Mail not to reveal the vigilante's identity to protect his family . This is the Leicestershire man behind a disturbing phenomenon of vigilantes who set out to hunt down and trap suspected child sex offenders, and expose them on the internet. He is the self-appointed leader of Letzgo Hunting, a gang that closed down this week just nine months after he set it up, following the suicide of a man it accused of grooming a pre-pubescent girl for sex over the internet. The gang’s members acted as detectives, judges and jurors towards those they targeted. First, a gang member would lure the men they suspected into the trap by striking up flirtatious conversations with them on the internet while posing as a young girl. Next, they would agree to meet them, still pretending to be a young girl. At that meeting, they would confront and film them before posting the footage on the internet and giving their ‘evidence’ to the police. Though police have criticised its methods, the group’s controversial activities have led to at least ten arrests. None has been charged with sex offences and it remains to be seen whether they are guilty of anything. And while they claimed they were behind the jailing this week of pub manager James Stone on child sex charges, police say evidence collected by the group played no part in the conviction. The irony is that these self-appointed investigators — whose aim was to expose the men they suspected to the full glare of publicity — operated undercover, refusing to identify themselves to the police or anyone else, claiming they risked revenge attacks. This week, when we tracked down their leader, he begged us not to expose him, for fear that he and his family would become targets. Indeed, it was his fear of being identified publicly — rather than the suicide of a man he hounded — that caused him to close down his gang. Yesterday, Leicester police also asked us not to identify him. ‘We believe there is a realistic chance of him coming to some harm,’ they said. ‘Feelings on issues surrounding paedophilia run very high, both against those accused and against those who make such allegations.’ We have agreed to abide by the police’s request  — though with deep reservations, because there is no doubt this man in his black hoodie top is a highly questionable figure. This does not mean, however, we cannot tell you his story or try to explain why he took the law into his own hands in his war on paedophiles. Chase: Letzgo Hunting members film the pursuit of a targeted man in a park . The Letzgo warrior is convinced he is a messenger from God crusading against those who have committed heinous crimes and that he is entitled to punish them. In his 20s, he is almost evangelical about his work. But this week, the methods and motives of his gang were criticised after the inquest of Gary Cleary, a 29-year-old engineer who hanged himself just days after the vigilante gang accused him of grooming a young girl. The police, NSPCC and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre were concerned about the gang’s activities, saying they risked jeopardising police investigations. Many claimed the videos the gang posted online of the men they suspected rarely met the tough evidential requirements needed for a criminal prosecution. 'We believe there is a realistic chance of him coming to some harm. Feelings . on issues surrounding paedophilia run very high, both against those . accused and against those who make such allegations.' Leicestershire Police . But what motivated this crusader? Was it the fact that his father was once attacked by a gang of vigilantes and left badly beaten? And how does he reconcile his group’s activity with police criticism and the death of a young man? Letzgo’s leader, who lives with his girlfriend, who is also in her 20s, rejects  the suggestion his activities circumvent the legal system. He also refuses to countenance the idea that he and his gang may have contributed to Cleary’s death. He claims Mr Cleary ‘killed himself because he tried to meet a child for sex’. He adds: ‘All our evidence was sent to the police. It’s not my fault the police sent someone to arrest him. They were the last ones to handle him.’ He refused to talk further about the case, pulling his hood over his head  and driving off in his convertible car with his girlfriend and their child. But we can reveal exactly what happened to Mr Cleary. He went online and hooked up by mistake with one of the vigilante group, who was pretending to be a 14-year-old girl. Mr Cleary, they say, showed an interest in meeting the ‘girl’ for sex. Suicide: Gary Cleary who killed himself in May . A meeting was arranged in a park in Leicester. It took place four months ago. In fact, the vigilantes sent an 18-year-old as a decoy. When confronted, Mr Cleary was said to have sworn at members of Letzgo Hunting filming the encounter. He then left the park. The group say they sent a ‘file’ of evidence to Leicester Police. Subsequently, Mr Cleary was questioned by a police officer and released on bail in May. He was not charged with any criminal offence. However, four days later he was found hanged in his garage at his home. The inquest into his death found he had committed suicide, though the coroner did not refer to any encounter with Letzgo Hunting or his arrest. While the truth about Mr Cleary’s intentions will never be known, the group insists it was doing an important public duty by monitoring the internet to protect children from paedophiles. Letzgo Hunting was inspired by an American TV programme, To Catch A Predator, in which alleged paedophiles are filmed being lured to a house where they think they are going to meet an under-age girl for sex. The Letzgo group has posted a series of shaky, hand-held videos of men arriving in public places to meet girls they had been chatting to on social networks and whom they thought were willing to have sex. When challenged by the Letzgo team, the men ran off — while being chased by a vigilante cameraman. It has emerged this week that two sisters, who have been among the many who have criticised the group on Facebook for their tactics, were subjected to thuggish comments from the group on social networking sites. One said she feared for the safety of her child after the name of her street was tweeted. Meanwhile, a man who made negative comments online about the group’s activities said he received a message from a follower that said: ‘I will cut your throat if I see you in the street.’ This controversy puts the spotlight on the legality, morality and motivation of Letzgo Hunting. In the past, during previous Mail investigations into its leader’s activities, he has asked for money to pay for ‘kit’ for the group. This is despite him having told his local newspaper: ‘I’m not doing it for any kind of monetary gain.’ No longer in action: The vigilante group - whose Facebook page is pictured - announced that it is to fold . He also claims to have ‘studied law’, though in reality he has no formal legal qualifications. What is fascinating is that when he was a teenager, his family was  the subject of a vigilante attack in an apparent case of mistaken identity. Perhaps this is why the vigilantes’ webpage quoted the ruthless Mongol leader, Genghis Khan, saying: ‘I am the punishment of God. If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you.’ The Letzgo leader — who calls himself ‘Scummbuster’ — was born in the Midlands. His father worked in the car industry and his mother was a shop worker. Tragically, she died two years after his birth. Jailed: Police say that none of the vigilante group's evidence was used to convict James Stone this week . It was when he was 18 that his father was attacked. He was repeatedly knocked to the ground as three men punched and kicked him. He suffered a smashed up face and serious eye injuries. The attack happened near a local pub on a Friday night and it was reported that the attackers had accused their victim of having recently assaulted someone. The Letzgo vigilante’s father, who was 42 at the time, vehemently denied this claim. He SAID it must have been a case of mistaken identity. Ten years on, it is his son who is the vigilante. Last year, with his girlfriend, the Letzgo leader set up a security firm, and he is known to be keen on keeping fierce dogs. It has also been alleged that he has taken at least one dog with him when confronting alleged paedophiles. The man lived in a council property in Leicestershire. Neighbours say he ‘ruined’ a perfectly respectable property by carrying out unnecessary building works and now rents a semi-detached home. His vigilante work has been marked by a bitter rivalry with another man who also targets paedophiles. Their respective groups have been engaged in a war of words on Facebook, accusing one another of incompetence. While the Letzgo leader claims his group includes concerned parents of both sexes, the truth is that it is predominantly run by himself and two other men. Some may wonder why the police take the group’s videos and related ‘evidence’ seriously. The problem is that the police have a duty to respond to any claim that the law has been broken and must begin to investigate if they believe a crime might have been committed. One of the vigilante’s neighbours says: ‘What gives this man the right to think he is a latter-day Charles Bronson figure? Such work should be left to the police.’ How bitterly ironic it is that, as soon as the Letzgo leader realised he was going to be exposed, he scuttled off to the police and lawyers — a courtesy he never afforded to the people, such as suicide victim Gary Cleary, that he exposed online.","Leicester Police told the Mail not to identify the man to protect his family .

"When environmentalist Laura spotted an articulate and well-built eco warrior sitting opposite her at a meeting of anarchists, she was touched by how he appeared ‘the perfect blueprint’ for the kind of man she was looking for. Others in that North London pub told how Jim Sutton had for five years waged an anarchic war as a hunt saboteur, been pivotal at anti-GM food protests and even travelled to Rome for a weekend of demonstrations. These were, the young woman thought, the impressive credentials of a dedicated environmental campaigner. Deceit: Met officer James Boyling (left) married an activist, and Bob Lambert (right) used the name Robinson . A month later, they met in another pub and Laura and Sutton became lovers. The following year they moved in together in a flat and began what she thought was ‘a blissfully in love relationship’. But, as the months went by, Laura began to realise that this reserved man did not seem as committed or as knowledgeable about ‘the cause’ as she had first thought. Yesterday, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that ‘Sutton’ was in fact James Boyling, 43, an undercover officer who had infiltrated anarchist and hard-line environmental groups to glean intelligence and disrupt their activities. He began working undercover in the mid-1990s after serving in the Met’s anti-terrorism unit. Senior police also named Bob Lambert, an undercover officer who used the name Bob Robinson and who fathered a son with a female activist before later abandoning them. The decision formally to name the officers follows a ruling by a High Court judge who said the Met could no longer hide behind its insistence that it could ‘neither confirm nor deny’ the identities of the men at the centre of allegations brought by women claiming they were ‘tricked’ into having sexual relationships with officers. The Met claimed its policy was for the safety of officers working undercover. It is the latest twist in an ever-more controversial legal dispute centring on the police’s use of undercover officers and the tactics they employ with women in particular. The woman who had a child with Lambert – who prefers only to be named as Jacqui – told the Mail yesterday that she suspected undercover officers used sex as a ‘tactical option’. She is currently bringing a legal claim against the Met. ‘I will never know if Bob Lambert’s “feelings” for me were “genuine” whilst we were in a relationship, as the police now say they were, but with hindsight, that must be irrelevant,’ she said. ‘What is significant is Lambert’s reasons for entering into the relationship with me and his reasons for ending it and leaving me to bring up our son alone. I believe that I was used, that I was just a tactical option and part of their operation.’ Lambert, who had infiltrated animal rights groups, was said to have had sexual relations with four women, including Jacqui, whom he met at an animal rights party. That was in the 1980s, and he left her when their son was two. Holes: Boyling's wife said holes began to emerge in his political views and started becoming reserved . He is also the detective named by barrister Mark Ellison’s review of the Stephen Lawrence murder case. Ellison wrote that he was one of three officers alleged to have been involved in a plot to gather ‘fascinating and valuable intelligence’ from an undercover officer who was spying on the Lawrence family and their supporters. Jules Carey of Bindmans solicitors, which represents Jacqui, along with other women bringing claims against the Met, said the decision to name officers would do little to restore public confidence in the force. There are currently ten women seeking compensation, with claims against four officers for deceit, assault, negligence and malfeasance in public office. This begs the question of whether an undercover officer who has sex with members of the group he has infiltrated is, as Jacqui claims, employing a tactical option, simply sees it as a ‘perk’ of the job or, as the Met says, is merely succumbing to genuine feelings of mutual attraction. To understand how officers can become so involved with women, you must comprehend how consuming living a double life can be. They are each provided with a ‘legend’ or cover story. Senior officers last year admitted that the identities of dead babies had even been used. The police spies get a passport and credit cards, as well as generous funds to be able to bribe people. They are also given a telephone with a tracking device so handlers can always trace them if they get into trouble. Lambert recently admitted appearing in a magistrates’ court for a ‘minor public offence’, but used his fake name to maintain cover. But is pairing off with a girlfriend from within the group they are infiltrating essential to their cover? In an interview with the Guardian, Laura said she began to question Boyling’s commitment to the cause while they were living as a couple. He showed a lack of commitment, she said, to environmental campaigns. He was, she said, ‘under-developed ideologically’ and there were ‘holes in his political development’. His increasingly reserved behaviour led to him being called ‘Grumpy Jim’. Also, his almost military attention to cleaning his boots led Laura to ponder whether he was in fact an imposter. He later announced he was leaving to hitchhike to South Africa. He vanished, perhaps to return to a desk in Scotland Yard. Tactics? The women Lambert and Boyling duped question whether they were tactical or 'a perk of the job' She tried tracking him down, and the pair met by chance in a bookshop, where he admitted to being a police officer. Despite this revelation, they maintained a relationship while living apart and had two children. They married in 2005 but divorced a few years later. Boyling remains a serving officer in the Met. Yesterday, another woman who had a relationship with an undercover officer, Helen Steel, rounded on the suggestion that officers had affairs because of genuine feelings. ‘It’s a load of rubbish,’ she said. ‘How can you have a genuine relationship that’s based on a complete web of lies? They knew that their posting was going to be ending in just a few years, and that they were going to disappear from our lives and leave us bereft. That’s not love – that is abuse.’ This former anti-capitalist protester with London Greenpeace said her world ‘fell apart’ after she discovered her former partner had a fake identity. Mr Carey says: ‘The compelling body of evidence that police officers systematically used sexual relationships with women to build their cover stories contradicts the “rogue officer in love myth” that is being offered to the public.’ Until these emotionally-charged legal battles have been resolved, it remains to be seen whether the police will regret giving Boyling a letter of commendation while he was an undercover officer for his ‘outstanding devotion to duty and determination over extended period in the investigation of serious crime’.","James Boyling and Bob Lambert posed as eco-warriors undercover .

"Some traditions are carried through the ages, but others are neatly dropped, such as the presence of the Home Secretary at the royal birth to ensure the true heir was not replaced with a usurper. Here we chart the extraordinary changes in how the royals have arrived into the world over the centuries. Prince Charles . On the evening of November 14, 1948, Prince Charles was born in Buckingham Palace’s Belgian Suite. The Queen Mother with the then Princess Elizabeth, aged eight months, (pictured left) before anyone thought she might one day be Queen. Right, Princess Elizabeth with baby prince Charles at his christening at Buckingham Palace in December 1948 . It had been transformed into a temporary maternity ward for the birth, and was later used for the arrivals of Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. It had been a long and arduous birth and our Queen-to-be had endured 30 hours in labour. Prince Philip spent some of the time smashing his way round a squash court with athletic vigour. He was, in fact, a nervous expectant father, and after the game went for a swim in the Palace pool. As he was drying himself, a footman hurried in with the news of the birth. Prince William: Prince Charles and Diana leaving St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, less than 24 hours after the birth of the infant . When the Princess came round from her anaesthetic, the Duke of Edinburgh was there with a bottle of champagne and a large bouquet of red roses and carnations, the Queen’s favourite flowers, that his equerry had the foresight to buy earlier. While it used to be traditional for the Home Secretary to be in attendance in adjoining rooms to witness the birth of the heir to the throne, the custom was dispensed with for Prince Charles. Indeed, it was the first time since the 18th century that there was no government minister present. The Queen-to-be was struck by the size of baby Charles’s hands. ‘They are rather large, but fine with long fingers — quite unlike mine and certainly unlike his father’s,’ she later wrote. ‘It will be interesting to see what they will become.’ Celebrate: People in festive mood outside St. Mary's hospital while hundreds of royal baby-watchers, journalists and photographers waited outside in anticipation of the royal birth . Touchingly, she added: ‘I still find it difficult to believe that I have a baby of my own.’ Prince Philip was characteristically blunt when asked what the future King looked like. He replied: ‘A  plum pudding.’ Meanwhile, outside the Palace the crowds shouted: ‘We want Philip!’ But, he didn’t come out and instead they sang lullabies. It was a welcome boost to the morale of post-war Britain. As is customary, the lights in Trafalgar Square fountain were changed to blue to signal a boy, and troops in ceremonial dress fired salutes amid the peals of bells from Westminster Abbey and St Paul’s. The Queen . The Queen was the first British monarch since the Middle Ages to be born in a private house rather than a palace or castle. She was delivered by Caesarean section at 17 Bruton Street, the Mayfair home of her maternal grandparents, the Earl and Countess of Strathmore. Crowds of people try to look at the notice formally announcing the birth of a son to Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge . At that point, she was third in line to the throne, after her uncle and father, and was expected to be pushed further down the line of succession as more male heirs were born. How wrong those expectations were to prove. The Queen was born at 2.40am on April  21, 1926, after the Queen Mother had been in labour for 24 hours. As was customary for the birth of anyone in the direct line of succession, the Home Secretary — then Sir William Joynson-Hicks — was present at the birth to ensure the true heir was not replaced with a usurper. At the time, the government was embroiled in an industrial dispute  with the coal miners. The first British General Strike was just days away and, in some quarters, there was even talk of revolution. While Elizabeth’s grandfather George V did not usually get on with children, the Princess was to prove his match and he took to calling her Lilibet and even allowed her to tug at his beard. Prince William . Diana, the Princess of Wales, broke with tradition by choosing to have her baby in hospital rather than a palace or castle. Like the Duchess of Cambridge, she opted for the private Lindo Wing of St  Mary’s Hospital in Paddington. On 21 June, 1982, she gave birth to Prince William. At first, she stuck with a natural childbirth, but after a few hours in labour she changed her mind and had an epidural to ease the pain. She later remarked: ‘If men had babies, they would only have one each.’ People take pictures outside St. Mary's hospital in London, Britain, 22 July 2013 and emailing them to friends around the world . Diana originally wanted to call her first-born Oliver, but Prince Charles was said to have been wary of anything that smacked of  Oliver Cromwell. Charles suggested Arthur Albert, but they eventually settled on William Arthur Philip Louis. After the birth, Charles presented her with a necklace of diamonds and pearls with a sparkling heart at the centre. He also bought her a solid gold ‘W’ to add to her charm bracelet as well as a custom-built, apple-green Mini with enough space in the boot for a travel cot. When the Queen saw her first grandson, she said: ‘Thank God he doesn’t have his father’s ears.’ Unusual Births . Prince Philip arrived on a kitchen table in a rented summer villa called ‘Mon Repos’ in Corfu. The house had no electricity, hot water or plumbing as Philip’s family was destitute, despite being members of the Greek royal family. Eighteen months later, the family left for France, with Philip travelling in a carry cot made from an old orange box. There has always been an element of intrigue about the birth of the Queen Mother. It is not precisely known where she was born on August 4, 1900. Some say she was born in the back of an ambulance, but it is more likely to have been at her parents’ townhouse in Grosvenor Gardens, in London’s Mayfair. The legal requirement to register the birth does not appear to have been paramount in the mind of her father, Lord Glamis. The 42 days allowed for registration had long passed when he strode into the register office on September 21. He was fined for registering the birth late — and appears to have entered the wrong place of birth on her birth certificate. While he said it was at the  family home, St Paul’s Walden Bury, in Hertfordshire, both she and her passport stated she was born in London. Not all royals are delivered into this world in sumptuous surroundings. In the 13th century, Eleanor of Castile, the first wife of Edward I, gave birth to the future Edward II in little more than a building site — a tiny, damp, windowless den in what was, to all intents and purposes, a half-finished Caernarfon Castle in Wales, later the scene of Charles’s investiture as Prince of Wales. Elizabeth Woodville, consort of Edward IV, gave birth in a basement in Westminster Abbey’s grounds, after her husband was removed from the throne and forced into exile. ROYAL GOSSIPS . Until the middle of the 17th century, royal childbirth was a strictly women-only affair overseen by midwives, ladies-in-waiting, nurses-in-waiting, wet nurses, dry nurses, laundresses and rockers of the royal cradle. As royal historian Alison James writes in her new book, The Royal Baby Book, this gang of women were known as God’s siblings — or God’s sibs — which is where the word ‘gossip’ comes from. Prince Albert was one of the first royals to break this tradition. He was present at Queen Victoria’s labours, and she gratefully wrote of him: ‘There could be no kinder, wiser, nor more judicious nurse.’ Captain Mark Phillips was present when Princess Anne gave birth to their son Peter in 1977. The experience, he commented afterwards, was ‘not everyone’s cup of tea’. AGONY and ECSTASY . Queen Victoria was at the forefront of the campaign to make pain-relief during  labour acceptable. One hundred and fifty years ago, it was expected that childbirth would and indeed should be agony. After all, the Bible says: ‘To the woman God said: “In pain you will give birth to children.”’ But by baby number eight, Victoria had had enough. For the birth of Prince Leopold she employed a Yorkshire doctor John Snow, who was a pioneer of the use of chloroform as an anaesthetic. ‘Oh, that blessed chloroform,’ she wrote afterwards, ‘soothing and delightful beyond measure.’ Protests against the painkiller were staged on religious and medical grounds, but the procedure gained popularity and became known as ‘Anaesthesia de la Reine’. COUNTING THE HOURS . In the records of royal labour-lengths, the award for quickest birth goes to Princess Augusta Sophia, born to Queen Charlotte and George III in 1768. The whole thing took 90 minutes from start to finish. The slowest royal birth was that of the future Edward VI, son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour. He took three days to emerge. A large procession took place in London during this time to pray for the Queen’s deliverance from a difficult labour. WEIGHTY MATTERS . The smallest royal baby seems to have been Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of the future Edward  VII. He was born two months premature on January 8, 1864, weighing 3lb 3oz — considerably lighter than William and Kate’s 8lb 6oz arrival yesterday.","Diana broke with tradition by choosing to have her baby in hospital rather than a palace .

"At first glance, it would be difficult to identify Lauri Love as a serious threat to the security of the West. As a student at Glasgow University, he would turn up to demos in his trademark hat and white tracksuit daubed with inane, contradictory political slogans. On his chest he had drawn a marksmen’s target inviting police to ‘aim here’. He had an anarchy symbol on his stomach and on his shoulder he had scrawled a hippyish slogan ‘Long Live Love’. Protest mode: Lauri Love's antics were derided by many students . Yet, according to American intelligence agents, Love – the 28-year-old son of a Baptist minister – is a key figure in a sophisticated gang of hackers who targeted some of the US’s most sensitive computer networks. An indictment presented before a grand jury in New Jersey, says Love tried to steal confidential data and told three other hackers ‘we can do some hilarious stuff’ with information they obtained, adding that they could even ‘f*** with the US government’. Speaking yesterday for the first time about his arrest at his parents’ Suffolk home, Love said it was a ‘surreal’ experience. At 6pm on Friday, October 25, his mother answered the door to a police officer posing as a delivery man. He asked for Lauri Love. When she confirmed her son was there, more than a dozen officers charged in. ‘I was in my dressing gown, pyjamas and a T-shirt when I went through into the hall,’ said Love, a slightly built and softly spoken man. Occupation: The 28 year old man from Newmarket, Suffolk would turn up at demonstrations in a trademark white hat with slogans written on his t-shirt . ‘Suddenly I was grabbed and handcuffed. It was a very surreal experience – I was very tired because I had been on a work programme and getting up very early. ‘A man sat across the kitchen table from me and said I was facing serious charges of hacking into computers in America. ‘They searched the house for hours and took away my computer and mobile phone. I was not formally cautioned but put into the back of a police car. ‘They couldn’t get the seat belt on so the policeman who sat next to me had to hold the belt while we raced through country lanes. ‘The police called in a local solicitor and on his advice when I was questioned on Saturday morning I made no comment. ‘I was questioned for an hour and a half by two people from the National Crime Agency who kept asking me if I had attacked the computers in America. They wanted to know what data I had taken, what I had done with it and where was it stored – and who else was involved and how much I had been paid to do it.’ If extradited and convicted, Love faces ten years in a US jail. But what led to Love being accused of hacking into US army and Nasa databases to steal ‘massive amounts’ of confidential information? Is this yet another example of America’s heavy-handed approach when it comes to relatively harmless, if obsessive, computer geeks? Or should we be concerned that Love’s computer wizardry poses a real threat? Love was brought up in a deeply religious family. His Scottish father, the Rev Alexander Love, worked at a number of Baptist churches after marrying Sirkka, a teacher from Finland. The family moved to the small village of Stradishall, near Newmarket, five years ago. Mr Love, 60, is a vicar at the nearby Highpoint Prison and his wife, 59, teaches inmates there. Data: The former Glasgow University student allegedly told other hackers 'we can do some hilarious stuff' with the information . Lauri is one of five children. It was during his 20s that his fascination with the internet and political activism took hold. He dropped out of Nottingham University, completed a year of compulsory national service in the Finnish army – he has dual citizenship – and worked in a genetics laboratory. He went to Glasgow to study physics and molecular biology, using Twitter to chat to fellow computer whizz-kids. Bizarrely, he named his Twitter account Smedley Butler, after a major general in the US Marine Corps. His activism came to the fore and he became a ringleader of a campaign to fight cuts at the university. ‘I shared their energy and passion for things – not just politics,’ he said. ‘I was one of those who took the initiative – it was not an abstract theory, it was real and I felt that I was making a valid contribution. I became deeply embedded in the movement.’ His infatuation with the Occupy movement culminated with him living in a tent in the city and abandoning his studies. It was only when his parents intervened that he returned to Suffolk. ‘I had become acutely depressed and really unable to look after myself  – I felt worthless and at times suicidal,’ he said. ‘Since then I have been at home and for the last year or more I have felt I couldn’t move outside the four walls of my bedroom.’ 'Surreal experience': The 25-year-old said he was in his pyjamas when he was arrested at his parents' home in Stradishall, Suffolk . He claims he has been diagnosed with acute depression and anxiety, conditions from which he has suffered since childhood. However, to other students at Glasgow, he was an attention-seeker. His hat with a Joker playing card lodged in the rim earned him the nickname ‘The T*** in the Hat’. Fellow student David, 23 – who did not want to give his real name – recalled their first encounter at a lecture: ‘He arrived ten minutes late. He took out several items from his bag – none of which was a notebook – and placed them down on the desk in the loudest and most disruptive way possible. ‘Love would just sleep, read the newspaper, or disagree with the lecturer whenever possible. If he managed to remain awake, he would cough and blow his nose loudly to cause further disruption. Everyone thought he was an egocentric, infuriating person.’ When students protested against spending cuts in February 2011 by occupying the university’s Hetherington House, Love revelled in the limelight as a leader of the sit-in. He was pictured alongside Left-wing singer Billy Bragg, who visited the occupation as it attracted nationwide media coverage. However, the university’s student union condemned the occupation and the police evicted the students. While he was popular with the protesters, Love was widely disliked by most of the student body. He was booed when he took to the stage at a public meeting about the occupation. The seven–month protest eventually ended that August. The graffiti on walls cost thousands of pounds to repair. Love was undeterred. At anti-austerity protests in Edinburgh a few months later, he was again a key player.  However, fellow students such as David believe that Love’s grandstanding was simply an attempt to boost his ego. ‘It seemed as though he didn’t care for the cause,’ he said. ‘He only cared about doing it to make him feel better about himself.’ Love’s arrest on hacking charges has not elicited much sympathy from those who knew him at Glasgow. One alumnus said: ‘He was, and I presume still is, an egotistical creepy hippy t*** who didn’t respect women’s personal space. Uncertain future: If extradited and convicted, Mr Love faces ten years in a US prison . ‘Don’t think many who came across him in the student movement will be particularly sympathetic to his current situation, which I am sure is a result of his ego yet again.’ If Love is a sophisticated hacker and the claims of the intelligence agents are accurate, he is certainly not very good at covering his tracks. A nine-page court document claims that US agents found the breaches of security came from a domain paid for by a PayPal account linked to an email account in Love’s name. That payment was said to be linked to an Internet Service Provider address in the UK owned by Rev A B Love in Suffolk. To Janis Sharp, who successfully fought attempts by the US government to extradite her son Gary McKinnon over hacking charges, the bid to extradite Love is another example of America’s relentless pursuit of ‘young British geeks’. The Mail successfully campaigned to prevent Mr McKinnon, who suffers from Asperger’s syndrome, from being extradited after he hacked into Nasa and Pentagon computers to look for evidence of the existence of extra-terrestrials. Miss Sharp said: ‘They are just young geeks sitting in their bedrooms; they’re not murderers, they’re not selling secrets, they’re just searching for information. ‘Extradition was meant for  terrorists, not some young  British geek.’","Lauri Love, 28, is accused of stealing confidential US government data .

"High roller: Poker star Phil Ivey netted £7.3million playing cards at Crockfords, one of the oldest private casinos in the world. But the house has refused to pay out . Seated at a private gaming table in a Mayfair casino, Phil Ivey exuded an air of quiet confidence. His transfer of £1 million into the casino’s bank account had been a gesture of goodwill, as much as proof that he meant business. Mr Ivey, one of the best poker players in the world, was joined by a beautiful Oriental female friend, whom he hoped would bring him luck. Perched on a chair overlooking the table, with its neatly stacked rows of chips, decks of cards and dealing shoe, sat the casino’s inspector, notepad in hand. For two nights over the August Bank Holiday at Crockfords, one of the oldest private casinos in the world, the 35-year-old Californian played a relatively simple card game called Punto Banco. The result was a winning streak which resulted in him netting a staggering £7.3 million. So is he now working out how to spend his winnings? Quite the contrary, for Crockfords has refused to pay up, and has called in investigators from Malaysia, where its owner, the gaming corporation Genting, is based. They interviewed staff and pored over hour upon hour of surveillance footage. They even inspected the cards and dealing shoe used in Mr Ivey’s game to try to see if anything untoward had contributed to his mammoth win. But it is believed no sign of any wrongdoing was found. The casino has returned his initial £1 million stake, but lawyers for both sides are now locked in an increasingly bitter dispute over the rest of the money. Strangely, it is not even clear if Mr Ivey has been accused of any wrongdoing. The police are not thought to have been contacted. The casino’s insistence on keeping its hands on the money is all the more curious because Punto Banco, which Ivey chose to play, is a skill-free game in which the gambler plays only against the banker, and seeks simply to get a score as close to nine as possible. This means that, as with a roulette wheel, it is almost impossible for a player to ‘fix’ the outcome. At first, the casino had said it would pay the winnings, warning that the Bank Holiday Monday would stall the payment. What eventually stopped it from handing over the money remains a mystery. It has emerged that the woman who accompanied the gambler has had her membership of another Mayfair casino suspended, although it is not known why. It is now most likely that Mr Ivey and the casino will meet in the High Court to settle the matter once and for all. At loggerheads: The casino has returned Mr Ivey's £1million stake, but lawyers for both sides are now locked in an increasingly bitter dispute . The case offers a tantalising glimpse into the world of high-stakes professional gamblers — one which might almost be taken from the pages of Ian Fleming’s novel Casino Royale. But James Bond was never refused his winnings by a casino — so why would anyone else be? Barry Carter, author of The Mental Game Of Poker, believes that because Mr Ivey is a very wealthy man — he won £10 million in just one Las Vegas poker tournament — he was able to continue to play for so long that he encountered a statistically unusual run of winning hands. Indeed, when he was at Crockfords and betting £50,000 a hand, his losses hit £500,000 before his fortunes changed. ‘I don’t think for one minute that he cheated,’ says Carter. ‘It is almost impossible for him to have an influence in a game of pure chance like Punto Banco. ‘Just because it’s statistically unlikely doesn’t mean you can’t have such a long winning streak — it is the nature of probability. ‘He comes to the attention of casino bosses because he is considered the best poker player in the world, and people wrongly think he may have some edge in other card games, too.’ Mr Carter believes the casino will have to pay the cash at some point, adding that the reason they can delay paying such a large sum is that the industry is not licensed as tightly as some other businesses. Over the years, professional gamblers who have developed some kind of system to boost their odds have been barred from casinos or had a cap imposed on the size of bets they can place. High stakes: Doormen stand at the entrance to Crockfords in Mayfair, London, where Mr Ivey played for two nights over the August Bank Holiday . Card counting is the most common technique, where the punter keeps an eagle eye on the cards that have already been dealt and memorises them, so he knows what remains. He can then make an informed bet on what is going to be dealt next. When Don Johnson, for example, a 49-year-old American professional gambler, arrives at a casino, he strikes fear into the management. He is already barred from two Las Vegas casinos — and in 2010 won more than £4 million from two Atlantic City casinos playing blackjack. Last year, a 12-hour session at another saw him walk away with more than £3 million. (The boss was promptly sacked.) While no one knows what system he uses, he puts his success down to having the cash to keep going when he has suffered setbacks. ‘You also have to understand the maths,’ Mr Johnson has said. ‘I’m not breaking any laws. I’m beating them with my own skills.’ There are those, however, who have relied on cunning to break the law and steal millions of pounds from casinos in cons worthy of the Ocean’s Eleven films. In 2007, two Chinese men and a woman were discovered using miniature cameras woven into a suit sleeve and a handbag to film the croupier dealing at a London casino. The images were beamed to a man holed up in van parked outside, who would freeze each frame to identify the cards on the table. Then, using a radio link, he relayed the details to his accomplices, who were wearing tiny earpieces. The gang were eventually arrested at the Mint casino in Kensington and later jailed. Some attempts to cheat the bank are a little more mundane. In 2009, two men named Mehmet Mersin and Suleyman Arik wore various wigs and false moustaches to visit casinos in London. They relied on a friend watching their poker games to spill his drink or strike up idle chat to divert the attention of the croupier. In that split second, the two men would swap cards between them to produce a stronger hand. Seven times they executed the deft manoeuvre, banking more than £5,000. Mystery: At first, the casino (pictured) had said it would pay Mr Ivey's winnings. What eventually stopped it from handing over the money remains unclear . While it was difficult to spot with the naked eye, the slow-motion playback from the CCTV recordings at the Empire Casino in London’s West End made compelling viewing for security staff. Both men were jailed. Inevitably, casinos have invested millions of pounds on a variety of surveillance techniques to catch cheats. Every roulette and card table has a sensitive microphone recording conversations, while a series of so-called ‘pan-tilt-zoom’ cameras record in high definition every twitch of players, audience and croupiers alike. To prevent cards from being marked, new packs are opened at the start of each business day, and shredded at the end. In a game like Punto Banco, casino inspectors like the one watching Phil Ivey in his private gaming room at Crockfords look out for patterns of low bets followed by a flurry of high bets, suggesting that the punter is somehow in the know about what cards are due to come up. In this game, too, a brilliant mathematical mind can attempt mentally to record what has already been dealt, and place bets based on those odds of the card they need turning up. Criminal gangs may try to secure the services of someone on the inside. A year ago, for example, three Italians were charged with fraud after apparently wearing special contact lenses to read invisible ink on cards marked by a French croupier. In one Cannes casino, the men made more than £50,000 after using the specially treated lenses to see the marks (a cross for a king and a line for an ace). They all denied the accusations. With such sophisticated attempts to break the rules, it is little wonder that casinos harbour a natural suspicion of those who win substantial sums at their tables. And for the same reason, disputes over unpaid winnings do happen, though very rarely. As yet, of course, there is no suggestion that Phil Ivey is guilty of anything other than a lucky streak. But if that is the case, why on earth is he still waiting to see the colour of Crockfords’ money? Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Poker player Phil Ivey won a fortune playing card game Punto Banco .

"Word went out that Mary Portas's involvement in the regeneration of Margate would form the basis of her new TV series . When Mary Portas, self-styled Queen of Shops, announced that the rundown seaside town of Margate had been chosen to benefit from her retailing wisdom, many shopkeepers hoped the ailing resort’s fortunes might be transformed. Word went out that the TV presenter and retail guru also wanted to use her involvement as the basis for her new series. The intention was to show how Portas magic can turn an economically rundown town into a busy trading centre again. But as the initial sparkle of their involvement with a celebrity champion begins to fade, the good folk of Margate are increasingly worried that the initiative is more of a vehicle for Portas’s ego — and for her bank balance — than for the rehabilitation of their once proud resort. It is a dispute that is threatening to split the Kent town. First, many accuse Portas of a sort of blackmail. For, in a provocative outburst, she seemed to suggest that unless they signed up to a long list of conditions (such as making available their financial accounts and agreeing to themselves and their customers being filmed), the £100,000 worth of taxpayers’ money that she was bringing via the project might be taken away. They also fear that like every other reality-style show, film footage might be used to ridicule them on national TV. Indeed, some are asking whether David Cameron’s ‘High Street tsar’ should really be allowed to promote her own TV career on the back of a Government-funded scheme. Margate was chosen after Portas announced a nationwide competition in which 12 economically-disadvantaged towns would eventually each be awarded £100,000 of taxpayers’ money to help breathe life into them. Margate was chosen after Portas announced a nationwide competition in which 12 economically disadvantaged towns would eventually each be awarded £100,000 of taxpayers' money to help breathe life into them . More than 300 towns signed up to be chosen as one of the dozen ‘Portas Pilots’. To understand how Margate is divided over the issue, it is necessary to explain how it has become two very different towns. On the High Street that rises up above the sandy beaches — once the choice holiday destination for millions of Londoners — the traditional big-name chains have left. Nearly 40 per cent of stores now lie empty as customers have been lured to the out-of-town Westward Cross shopping mall and the nearby Sainsbury’s and Tesco, all of which have free parking. Meanwhile, the small, independents left on the High Street struggle to survive amid empty premises with boarded-up windows and To Let signs. But while the High Street, with its charity shops and £1 bargain stores, epitomise recession-hit Britain, just down the hill Margate Old Town is fashionable and chic, with boutique clothes shops, a thriving café culture, bistros and art galleries. On the High Street that rises up above the sandy beaches - once the choice holiday destination for millions of Londoners - the traditional big-name chains have left . Nearly 40 per cent of stores now lie empty as customers have been lured to the out-of-town Westward Cross shopping mall (above) and the nearby Sainsbury's and Tesco, all of which have free parking . Last year, Portas, 52, having been . asked by Prime Minister David Cameron to lead an independent review into . the future of the High Street, reported that an average 20 high street . shops a day were closing across the country. It was a stark assessment that illustrated how out-of-town shopping centres and online retailers were dramatically changing the face of British towns. Excited by the prospect of winning £100,000 of government money to reinvigorate their town, the people of Margate drew up imaginative proposals. In May, after months of hard work, Margate was named as one of the 12 winning towns. Mary Portas visited and joined a packed public meeting in the former Woolworths building. She told the audience that she would base her next Channel 4 series, Mary Portas: Queen Of The High Street, on their story. But though she added, ‘This is not about me — this is about Margate’, the idea worried many locals. And their fears only increased when she said: ‘The downside for some of you is that I’ve got cameras doing this with me. They show warts and all. This ain’t going to be smooth.’ The seafront at Margate, bustling with activity in 1954 . Then, in a phrase that many shop-keepers considered to be blackmail, Portas added: ‘So we either let the cameras in with me, or I go back on the train and some other town gets it (the money).’ Portas later admitted her brusque manner was a mistake, and when she made the inflammatory comment it was ‘heat of the moment stuff with a camera stuck in my face’. In fact, the money was awarded by the Government and was not conditional on any TV deal. However, worse was to come, and within days two producers from Optomen — a TV production company — were trying to get townsfolk to sign contracts so they could appear in Portas’s new TV series. They were told they had to declare any psychological or physical problems that could affect filming, that they must make available all their firm’s financial records, and that they would be legally banned from discussing the programme publicly. Shop staff and customers would also have to make themselves freely available to be filmed. There was also anger about how much Mary Portas would make from the series, compared with the shopkeepers’ derisory appearance fee of £1 each. Mary Portas (right) with a Margate shopkeeper. She met with high street businesses, local shoppers and the council on her visit . The Queen of Shops has a two-year £500,000 contract with Channel 4, and will be paid a fee of about £45,000 for the three Margate programmes. While some boutique stores in the Old Town are displaying posters declaring their love for Mrs Portas — though they won’t benefit from the £100,000, they hope they might benefit from the publicity — a very different poster was displayed on the High Street, showing the grinning face of Portas with the words: ‘Thanks people of Margate, because I’m earning £46,000.’ In the family-run Joke Shop opposite, Lesley Howard, 70, is as straight-talking as Portas: ‘A media luvvie from the TV company came in with a contract. I thought it was outrageous and very intrusive. We refuse to appear because we would inevitably have ended up being ridiculed. Not for us, thank you!’ Nick Adams, 55, of Priceless Discounts, is still angry about Portas’s ‘insensitive’ comments that she’d leave Margate unless TV cameras were allowed. ‘That was terrible,’ he says. He says it doesn’t need a TV celebrity to divine Margate’s problems: rising business rates, high street parking charges and the lure of shops such as M&S and River Island at the Westward Cross mall. Some are asking whether David Cameron's 'High Street tsar' should really be allowed to promote her own TV career on the back of a Government-funded scheme . ‘I’ve been here 22 years and I’m close to shutting up shop,’ he says. ‘I don’t see what £100,000 will do to help. Also, I’m worried that a reality TV show will simply ridicule us.’ Another shopkeeper tore up his contract with the TV firm when he was told he had to provide detailed information about his private life. Some shopkeepers have also expressed irritation that many new shops have signed up to the TV series even though they are not part of the £100,000 regeneration scheme. The spit-and-sawdust-style Bull’s Head pub in the Old Town refuses to embrace the trendy ways characterising most of the neighbourhood. Landlady Alison Burke doesn’t mince her words. ‘This whole thing is about helping Mary Portas’s TV career,’ she says, pulling a pint for a man covered in tattoos. John Houston has personal experience of the Portas treatment after she visited his successful Outside The Square Gallery. ‘She just walked in unannounced,’ he says. ‘Suddenly this red-haired woman arrived with her entourage of about 30 people and a TV crew. I didn’t know who she was. ‘I didn’t want so many people cramming into my gallery, so I said: “Excuse me, could you leave?” They said they only wanted to ask me some questions. I said: “Leave!”’ Deborah Ellis, 39, who owns Madam Popoff Vintage clothing, has signed up to appear in the series but admits the producers warned her that Mrs Portas can sometimes come across as a bit abrupt. ‘They said if she was too harsh with her constructive criticism of the shop, I should tell the production crew,’ she says. ‘It will hurt, but it could be invaluable.’ A Channel 4 spokesman said Optomen had enjoyed ‘positive feedback’ from shopkeepers, adding that contracts are being amended after people raised concerns. ‘Whether Margate decides that it wants to take part in the TV series won’t in any way affect the work Mary is doing with the Government and 12 Portas Pilot towns,’ it said. ‘Mary is passionate about her work to help reinvigorate the High Street, and the programme will be made in that spirit.’ Back on Margate High Street, Julian Poupard, 75-year-old owner of Henrys, an electrical and camera shop, says: ‘It’s very sad, the decline of the High Street. It means the decline of a community. ‘Mary Portas says she wants to introduce market stallholders — but how will that have any effect on things such as soaring rates or parking costs? ‘I may be cynical, but I fear this government initiative is all helping her TV show and her career. There’s no proof to show that it will help towns such as Margate.’","Locals fear that if they do not sign up to long list of conditions, £100,000 worth of taxpayers’ money she was bringing might be taken away .

"Blueprints for the first-ever plastic gun produced on a 3-D printer, that can pass through metal detectors, have been downloaded over 100,000 times since it was posted to the web on Monday. Designs for the 'Liberator' pistol were posted online by Defense Distributed but on Thursday the U.S. State Department ordered the website to take down the blueprints, on the basis that the plans could violate export regulations. The blueprints, that could be produced on 3-D printers costing as little . as $1,000, were seen as a breakthrough because no one has previously designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition. Scroll down for video. Bang: This is the moment Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson successfully fired the first working plastic gun made by a 3-D printer . Surprisingly, most downloads of the plans did not come from inside the U.S. but from Spain. The U.S. is second, ahead of Brazil, Germany, and the U.K., according to Haroon Khalid, a developer working with Defense Distributed, who reported the statistics to Forbes. The State Department Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance ordered Cody Wilson, the 25-year-old founder of the site, to remove the online blueprints for the 3D-printable 'Liberator' handgun, Forbes magazine reported. The State Department office is reviewing whether the files violate export control laws for weapons, known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), since the plans were downloaded overseas. Wilson, currently a law student at the University of Texas in Austin, says his group will comply with the State Department directive. Crude: The Liberator plastic gun is a simple single-shot weapon that fires a small .380-caliber bullet . On Sunday, the group Defense Distributed posted a video of founder Cody Wilson firing the 'Liberator' plastic pistol. Mr Wilson made the schematics for the weapon available for free online this week - meaning everyone with a high-end 3-D printer can create their own version of the gun. In response, New York Senator Chuck Schumer announced that he plans to introduce legislation that will ban the weapons because they can pass through metal detectors at airports and court houses without being picked up. 'We’re facing a situation where anyone - . a felon, a terrorist - can open a gun factory in their garage and the . weapons they make will be undetectable. It’s stomach-churning,' he said. Plastic: Sixteen of the 17 parts that make up the Liberator are plastic, constructed by a 3-D printer. A small nail is used for a firing pin . Sixteen of the 17 parts in the . Liberator pistol are made from tempered plastic molded inside the . Stratasys Dimension SST 3D printer. The final piece of the weapons - the . firing pin - is a common nail. Mr Wilson told Forbes.com . that he hopes to make weapons available to anyone who wants them. It is . a bid, he says, to keep governments accountable to the people. 'You . can print a lethal device. It’s kind of scary, but that’s what we’re . aiming to show,' he said. 'Anywhere there’s a computer and an Internet . connection, there would be the promise of a gun.' The name of the gun - Liberator - comes from a simple World War II pistol that was designed by the U.S. military to made cheaply and air dropped in large numbers into occupied Europe and concentration camps. Like its World War II predecessor, the Defense Distributed pistol is a crude weapon. It holds only a single shot and uses an inaccurate smooth bore. Shocking: New York Senator Chuck Schumer plans to introduce legislation that would ban plastic guns made from 3-D printers . 3-D printing is poised to revolutionize engineering and reforge industries from medicine, to construction to aerospace. The process, also called additive manufacturing, creates a three-dimensional solid object from a digital model. The feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic. The layers are then joined together to create the final shape. The machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and 'slices' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing. The process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s. However, since 2010, an entire industry has sprung up around personal 3-D printers, which are increasingly small, increasingly powerful and increasingly affordable. Defense Distributed used a higher-end $8,000 model to build its 3-D gun. However entry-level desktop models can cost $500 to $1,000. The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace. Engineers hope 3-D printing will begin an era of 'instant prototyping' that will allow product developers to forge and tinker with prototypes quickly and inexpensively. The group has successfully fired it . with a .380-caliber pistol round. However, an attempt to shoot a . slightly larger 5.7 x 28mm defense cartridge blew the gun to pieces. Currently, the Liberator can only be . made through highly specialized processes on an $8,000 3-D printer. Mr . Wilson says he hopes to adapt the model . The technology behind 3-D printing is not new and has available for industrial applications for decades. It . is only since about 2010, though, that 3-D printers have become cheap . enough, simple enough to use and compact enough for most consumers to . purchase. Schumer says the accessibility of 3-D printers makes plastic guns a security threat. 'Guns are made out of plastic, so . they would not be detectable by a metal detector at any airport or . sporting event,' Schumer said, according WCBS 880. 'Only . metal part of the gun is the little firing pin and that is too small to . be detected by metal detectors, for instance, when you go through an . airport. 'A terrorist, someone who’s mentally ill, a spousal abuser, a felon can essentially open a gun factory in their garage.' Schumer . wants to renew a previous ban on undetectable weapons while the new . bill would add a ban on plastic high-capacity magazines. 'People . have made silencers, stocks, triggers and lots of other gun parts. They . can then upload these digital blueprints to the web and then anyone . with one of these printers - and the printers cost about $1,000 -  can . make one,' Schumer said. Current law bans . all-plastic weaponry. Defense Distributed weapons have just one large metal piece in the handle, to get around the law. Schumer says the metal can be swapped out and replaced with plastic.

"Ever since Gothic novelist Bram Stoker’s charmingly aristocratic character Count Dracula first appalled and mesmerised late Victorian England, the vampire that sinks its fangs into the neck of its victims and can only be slain with a stake driven through its heart has been a mainstay of European fiction. The new incarnation of good-looking young vampires with American accents in television series such as Buffy The Vampire Slayer or in books such as the Twilight series, only serves to show how difficult it has been to kill off these bloodthirsty ghouls of the undead. But while we may think that vampires live only in the pages of books and on the cinema screen, an extraordinary new archaeological discovery shows that they were all too terrifyingly real to people in times gone by. 'Vampire': Bulgarian archaeologists have unearthed centuries-old skeletons pinned down through their chests with iron rods . Undead grave: An archaeologist cleaning a skeleton during excavations in the Black Sea town of Sozopol, Bulgaria . Archaeologists in Bulgaria claimed this week to have discovered two ‘vampire’ corpses in excavations near a monastery in the Black Sea town of Sozopol. Both of them are more than 800 years old and have been pierced through the chest with heavy iron rods. Bulgaria’s national museum chief Bozidhar Dimitrov said as many as 100 such ‘vampire corpses’ have been found in the country in recent years. ‘They illustrate a practice which was common in some Bulgarian villages up until the first decade of the 20th century,’ he explained. Even today, the vampire remains a very real threat in the minds of villagers in some of the most remote communities of Eastern Europe, where garlic and crucifixes are readily wielded, and where bodies are exhumed so that a stake can be driven through their heart. The notion of blood-sucking vampires preying on the flesh of the living goes back thousands of years and was common in many ancient cultures, where tales of these reviled creatures of the dead abounded. Archaeologists recently found 3,000 Czech graves, for example, where bodies had been weighed down with rocks to prevent the dead emerging from their tombs. The advent of Christianity only fuelled the vampire legends, for they were considered the antithesis of Christ — spirits that rose from the dead bodies of evil people. Such vampires would stalk the streets in search of others to join their unholy pastime of sucking the lifeblood from humans and animals to survive. In medieval times, when the Church was all-powerful and the threat of eternal damnation encouraged superstition among a peasantry already blighted by the Black Death, the fear of vampires was omnipresent. In some cases, the dead were buried with a brick wedged in their mouths to stop them rising up to eat those who had perished from the plague. Records show that in the 12th Century on the Scottish Borders, a woman claimed she was being terrorised by a dead priest who had been buried at Melrose Abbey only days earlier. When the monks uncovered the tomb, they claimed to have found the corpse bleeding fresh blood. The corpse of the priest, well known for having neglected his religious duties, was burned. But vampiric folklore largely flourished in Eastern European countries and Greece, where they did not have a tradition of believing in witches. And just as with witches in England, Germany and America, the vampire became a scapegoat for a community’s ills. The ‘civilised’ world came to learn of vampires in the 18th century as Western empires expanded and their peoples travelled to remote parts of Central and Eastern Europe. With the spread of Austria’s empire, for example, the West became aware of the story of the remote village of Kisilova (believed to be modern-day Kisiljevo in Hungary) after it had been annexed by the Austrians. Screen version: Christopher Lee stars in 1958 Hammer Horror as the Count . In 1725, the village’s cobbled streets were stricken with panic over tales of the undead spreading disease and strangling innocent people. Locals blamed the spate of unexplained deaths on one Peter Plogojowitz, a peasant who had been dead and buried for ten weeks. They demanded that his coffin be opened up to make sure he was properly despatched. When the Austrian Imperial Provisor finally agreed to have the coffin prised open, the legend goes that he saw the cadaver had blood dripping from its mouth, talon-like fingernails, long fangs and signs of healthy skin. He noted that the body had failed to decompose, and so the locals resorted to the tradition of slamming a stake through its heart and then incinerating the corpse. Their horror, in fact, stemmed from ignorance about decomposition. Nails and teeth do not actually grow after death; instead, the skin and flesh shrink back, giving the impression of claw-like nails and abnormally long incisors. Meanwhile, corpses can be bloated from gases caused by decomposition, giving the body the appearance that the dead has been enjoying a good meal or drink while in or out of its casket. For a time, skin can also appear flushed after death, and blood can pool around facial cavities. If this was not enough to scare the wits out of simple, God-fearing folk, it was also noted that there were unmentionable ‘other wild signs’ — a reference to how male genitalia can inflate during decomposition. In some areas, vampires were known as ‘shroud-eaters’, because the cloth covering the corpse’s face had apparently been eaten away, revealing those ferocious teeth. In fact, it was the bacteria in the mouth that had dissolved the linen. Bloodthirsty: Lee in his classic portrayal of Dracula . With these gruesome accounts, the vampire got its fangs into the imagination of the British people. About eight years after the peasant Peter Plogojowitz became the most hated corpse in Eastern Europe, the London Journal ran an article about ‘vampyres’ at Madreyga, again in Hungary, in what was probably the first English usage of the word. In 1819, the year that Queen Victoria was born, Lord Byron’s doctor, John Polidori, published his short story, The Vampyre, featuring an aristocrat who had a penchant for quaffing the blood of young women. Bram Stoker then refined the story with Dracula, published in 1897. The Transylvanian aristocrat’s thirst for the blood of swooning and pallid young women was rivalled only by his yearning for fine tailoring. When the play was performed in a London theatre the 1920s, a nurse was on hand to tend to traumatised members of audience. But vampirism is not yet consigned to the history book. One account from the 20th century saw a man in Greece awake from a coma at his own funeral. As he sat up, the congregation was convinced he was a vampire (or vrykolake) and he was stoned to death. In the 1960s, an anthropologist recorded how older residents of one Greek island could still recall the killing of the last known vampire. And just eight years ago, it was clear in Romania that belief in vampires had not disappeared. In the remote village of Marotinul de Sus, the body of Petre Toma, a former teacher, was removed from its grave, had its heart removed and impaled on the end of a pitchfork. The six men who’d dug up the 76-year-old’s body replaced it in the coffin and sprinkled it with garlic. The heart was then burnt to ashes to ensure that Mr Toma could not rise from the dead to drink their blood. After his arrest, the leader of those men insisted they were acting in the village’s best interests because Toma had appeared to many villagers in their dreams as a vampire. The gang also insisted that when Toma’s heart was removed, the corpse let out a deep sigh. Even though the authorities jailed them for illegal exhumation, many villagers praised them for their actions. For them, the vampire was no myth.","Archeologists uncover 800-year-old 'vampire' skeletons buried at the stake .

"When you get to my age you can’t just ‘go’ on holiday. Oh no. Such things require serious preparation, both mental and physical. Talk about mission impossible. Entire invasions have been orchestrated in less time than it takes me to get my legs to the point where I will risk exposing them. As for my upper arms and stomach, they haven’t seen daylight since the old queen died. The rest? Well, it needs to be thoroughly buffed, polished, sculpted, pummelled, tinted and tweaked until I can get it to the stage where I’m confident I won’t frighten small children. When you get to my age you can't just 'go' on holiday. Oh no. Such things require serious preparation, both mental and physical. First, hair-removal. I was recently sent an odd little depilatory gadget, which, in the way of these things, sat on my desk for several weeks, eliciting various not terribly funny comments from male colleagues. Eventually I took it home to try, if only to put an end to the jokes. Turns out it’s rather brilliant. It’s called Pearl and it basically singes off unwanted hairs. If that sounds dangerous, don’t worry, I tried it and managed not to set off the smoke alarm. It’s very good for legs  and can also be used on the bikini line — if you’re terribly brave. Next, tanning. One of the paradoxes about getting older is that your thighs look much nicer if they’re tanned, yet getting them tanned is quite impossible because they’re all wobbly and covered in thread veins. Mandara Spa Bali Santi Energising Body Scrub, £8 (www.sainsburys.com). Coffee granules and coconut oil stimulate skin to leave it smooth, soft and ready to tan. You have two options. Either you can have your leg veins removed through sclerotherapy, which can be very effective (although success rates vary from patient to patient) but needs to be done during the winter months (it’s one of those procedures that make the problem look much worse before it gets better); or you can banish the husband and the kids for a couple of hours and turn yourself into J-Lo using the power of self-tan. In my experience, the success or failure of self-tan depends entirely on the amount of preparation. It is not a process that can be hurried. Here’s what you will need: some plastic gloves (Spontex all-purpose will do fine) and a tanning mitt (the mitt is not essential but the gloves are), a good exfoliator, a normal moisturiser, a full-length mirror, a pair of soft black trousers, a loose black top, an old towel and a glass of wine. Oh, and some self-tan, of course. Run a bath, soak for 15 minutes. Then exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate, paying special attention to knees, elbows, heels and any other dry or scaly area. Then do it all again. Once out of the bath, slather yourself in moisturiser, again paying extra attention to knees, elbows, etc. Drink your wine. Now, pull on your gloves. Both hands. Just a reminder now: you are naked in front of the mirror (that’s what the wine was for), so you might want to lock the door. Starting at your feet, work the self-tan into your skin in upward motions, making sure you don’t miss any bits. For this reason it’s best to use a product that darkens the skin visibly — it seems messier  but the end result will look much more professional. Work fast — most modern self-tans are designed to dry quickly. Check your progress in the mirror and go over any white patches. Do your arms last and, when you’ve finished, take off the gloves and brush the excess onto your hands. Best not to do your hands per se — they don’t really need it, and it’s easy to stain nails and cuticles. Once you’re dry, get dressed in your black ensemble. No underwear, please, and no shoes. And no sudden movements. After a while you will start smelling of biscuits (this is the active ingredient in the tan working). Stick with it for as long as you can bear the smell, then shower off and moisturise. Having taken the edge off your pallor, it’s easy now just to add a tiny bit of fake tan to your ordinary body cream and use every day to build a proper beach-fabulous colour. To this end the genius that is Clarins has just brought out Self-Tanning Radiance Plus Golden Glow Booster (£18): just a couple of drops in your everyday body cream will turn it into a gradual tanning product. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive with Prince George at Wellington Military Terminal on the first day of their official to Australia .

Dehydration, lack of movement, dryness, chair static, hair frizz, wind-inducing airline food: it’s not an ideal combination. The longer the flight, the worse the bloat. Mama Mio’s Lucky Legs Cooling Energising Leg Gel, £19.50 at www.mioskincare.co.uk (it’s designed for pregnant ladies but I’m not proud) contains lots of lovely refreshing, de-puffing ingredients such as ginger and peppermint, and it comes in a 100ml bottle so it should just about squeak past security — provided, of course, you put it in the requisite see-through receptacle. If you’re a regular traveller, you might want to consider investing in your own see-through make-up bag. At the top end of the scale there’s Anya Hindmarch’s incredibly extravagant but completely delectable Inflight Case (£150, www.anyahindmarch.co.uk), which is brilliantly well thought-out with separate compartments for take-off and landing. Otherwise dear old M&S does a very nice set of three with a snazzy polka-dot trim (£7.99, www.marksandspencer.com). One of my favourite brands, This Works, has done an entire range of clever in-flight essentials, including In Transit Muscle Therapy (£18), which comes in a handy roll-on and contains a reviving blend of essential oils including marjoram, black pepper and pain-relieving clove. Great also post-gym, if you happen to be that way inclined. I find my skin shrivels up like a prune at the barest hint of a doors-to-manual, so a moisturiser is a must. Lucas Paw Paw (£4.95 from www.pawpawshop.co.uk) is a fantastic all-rounder, suitable for skin, lips, nails, dry patches and the like. It’s a very pure product based on papaya extract: simple but effective. Lastly, something to keep the in-flight hair frizzies at bay: John Frieda Frizz Ease Original 6 Effects Serum (£6.29 at www.feelunique.com): the original and still the best.","How to disguise older legs with fake tan .

"You’d be hard pressed to make it through BBC1’s latest three-part nature series without getting a lump in your throat. Operation Wild sees Clare Balding join a group of pioneering vets from Britain and around the world as they save the lives of animals, and on her trips to China and West Africa she reports on two of the most moving animal stories ever shown on TV. First she’s in the Himalayan foothills, at a sanctuary where vets are using the latest human neo-natal techniques to help giant pandas to breed. In the wild, when panda mums have twins, they abandon one cub to die. The mothers can’t produce enough milk to suckle two young. Even in captivity, the second baby couldn’t survive on formula milk as there are crucial antibodies in its mother’s milk. Vets at the Wolong sanctuary have developed a rota system that fools the pandas into caring for each baby, one week at a time. And that means there is always a nursery where dozens of infant pandas are rolling around, sucking on milk bottles. Clare with a 'really cute' endangered baby panda in the Himalayan mountains . Clare with an orphaned orangutan in Borneo . ‘You see so many pictures of pandas and think, “They can’t possibly be that cute in real life."" And you get here... and really they are that cute!’ laughs Clare. Her second trip is far sadder. At a sanctuary for gorillas and orangutans in Cameroon, run by conservationist Rachel Hogan, Shufai, a teenage gorilla, is living with horrific injuries caused by poachers. When he was a baby, humans butchered his mother for bush meat while she was cradling him. Shotgun pellets left Shufai with a useless left arm, and amputation has become inevitable. The surgery is almost too painful to watch. But when Clare returns to Cameroon eight months later, Shufai’s gorilla friends had encouraged him to play again. They even taught him to do something he’d never dared try before – Shufai can now, one-handed, climb a tree. ‘He’s been able to re-establish himself as the peacemaker in the gorilla group,’ says Clare. ‘He’s the good boy in the class!’ Operation Wild co-host Steve Leonard with an elephant in Laos . Clare’s co-host is Steve Leonard, a vet who works with his brother in Crewe, and who’s been flying off at a moment’s notice to Africa or Asia to document the strides made in medicine for endangered species for the show. ‘Luckily I have the most understanding boss in the world – my brother Tom,’ he says. ‘It can be surreal. I’m doing the day job – then the BBC rings and I’m off to the airport. Hamsters in the morning, hippos in the evening!’ His experience with British pets can be invaluable thousands of miles away. ‘I had to remove a damaged eyeball from an orangutan,’ he says. ‘I’ve done that many times on cats because of little boys with airguns – I’d never done it on an ape, but it was basically the same anatomy. An orangutan is like a big orange cat with hands.’ Will Thomas, the youngest vet on the show, faced a more exotic challenge in Laos when he treated Tom Kun, an elephant with a bullet in its leg. He wanted to X-ray the infected leg, and had borrowed a valuable radiography machine from a nearby hospital. But the elephant wouldn’t stand still and the doctors feared he’d crush the £40,000 X-ray device. Tom Kun’s keeper saved the day by leaping onto the elephant’s back and covering the animal’s eyes while crooning a lullaby. Briefly bemused, Tom Kun stayed still long enough for Will to get the X-ray. In Ahmedabad, India, Steve attended the annual kite festival, where fliers dip their strings in glue and powdered glass and try to slice through the lines of other kites. This takes a terrible toll on birds as the lines slice through their wings like cheesewire. The terrified creatures are bundled up by volunteers and rushed to a makeshift clinic to be patched up. The first challenge is to give them a transfusion. It takes great skill to find the artery in a bird’s leg and insert a tube. Only then can the surgeon sew up the wings. Steve insists that showing these heart-rending scenes encourages the public to help. ‘When I made the Orangutan Diary series in 2007 we focused on a charity that was facing closure from lack of funds. The result was amazing – financial security, new buildings for the apes, extra staff. The British are born animal lovers, it’s just that sometimes we have to be reminded to care. Some say animal programmes are too emotional, but that’s the best way to motivate people.’ Operation Wild, Wed, 9pm, BBC1.","Operation Wild sees Clare travel the globe with a group of pioneering vets .

"Engineering students have  created a couch with wheels that has been driving them around campus and to adventures across the road. It began as a joke between a couple of students at the University at New South Wales in Australia but after suggesting the idea to their supervisor the development of an electric couch was brought forward. 'We use much smaller versions of these wheels on little robots we make at university... we suggested to one of our supervisors that we build a couch on  giant wheels and so we did,' Stephanie McArthur, one of the students behind the project told BBC. Scroll down for video . The device may look like any other Ikea couch but in the inside it has been stripped and replaced to allow the couch to be transformed into a robot . The electric device can move in any direction which is manually controlled by an Xbox game-pad . Students have been having fun with the electric cushioned seat as they ride around campus and take little adventures across the road . The electric couch was designed on the computer in CAD,  computer-aided design, and then sent to a workshop in the engineering facility where they added all the components together. 'We've got the scooter wheels inside that we've bolted down, attached all the gears and chains and then we put the modified Ikea couch on top,' Ms McArthur said. She said  it looks like any other couch on the outside but in the inside it has been stripped and replaced to allow transformation of an average Ikea couch to a moving robot.

"She already has a stellar music career, her own fragrance and a beauty line with MAC - all to the tune of a reported £170m - but Rihanna clearly wants world domination. The Bajan singer, who took home the best-dressed gong at the prestigious CFDA awards this year, may well be launching her own fashion range. The 26-year-old, who has already designed collections for Armani and River Island, has filed trademark documents in her surname, Fenty, for apparel, lingerie, hats, sleepwear, cosmetics and swimwear. Scroll down for video . Will she, won't she? Rihanna, who took home best dressed at the prestigious CFDA awards this year, may well be launching her own fashion range . According to Vogue.co.uk, the documents have been filed with the USPTO under her Roraj Trade LLC. The style icon certainly has design experience, launching her debut range for Armani back in November 2011. She also . lent her fashion expertise to Styled to Rock, where she assisted . up-and-coming British designers with their clothing lines. In February 2013, the singer presented her first women's collection at . London Fashion Week for River Island. The sporty urban range was such a . hit that she released two more collections for the high street giant. Let's hope she's venturing into fashion! The documents have been filed with the USPTO under her Roraj Trade LLC, and has assigned the 'Fenty' mark . Well, it makes sense! The global style icon has sat front row at countless fashion shows and modelled for numerous high fashion brands like Balmain . A regular . on the Fashion Week front rows, she has also lent her good looks to . countless high fashion campaigns and topped best dressed lists around . the world. Sharon Daboul, trademark attorney at EIP in London, said: 'It’s natural for global celebrities like Rihanna to want to . trademark all the insignia for which they are known, and the best time . to register a trademark is prior to launch, as is the case for the FENTY . brand. 'Trademarks . can include names, nicknames, signatures, slogans and poses and it’s . important for celebrities to have their legal protection in order at the . outset. 'Celebrities . are global brands, now more than ever before. A successful trademark . registration will ensure Rihanna has the monopoly over her brand. If . celebrities do not capitalise on their trademarks, no doubt there will . be someone else who is waiting in line to do it for them. 'Whilst . Rihanna made her name as a performer, her name and image can be used to . sell a huge array of merchandise from clothing to cosmetics. This can . generate an income that outlives her years as an entertainer, and has . the potential to become her most important asset, and her lasting . legacy. An example is the tennis champion Fred Perry, whose name is . associated with sportswear and fashion, over and above his tennis . career.' Fashionable friends: Rihanna (right) is close with model Cara Delevingne (centre) and Joan Smalls (back), would they model her range? 'The best way for celebrities to protect their name for product ranges like fashion is to get a trade mark registration. This effectively guarantees that no-one else can use their name without permission. It's becoming an increasing trend for celebrity artists to cash in on their name by diversifying into fashion lines, added Jason Rawkins, head of fashion at law firm Taylor Wessing. And if that wasn't enough, it seems that her trip to Brazil for the tail-end of the World Cup may have been equal parts business and pleasure.

"Candida Lycett Green, pictured, helped found the satirical magazine Private Eye in the early 1960s . There’s something about laughter in the face of death, a refusal to take yourself too seriously even at the end, that is peculiarly English. Candida Lycett Green, the author who died on Tuesday, aged 71, spent her life in love with England, and laughing at herself. The daughter of the Poet Laureate John Betjeman, she helped to found the satirical magazine Private Eye in the early Sixties with several friends, including Peter Cook and editor Richard Ingrams. As many of this hard-drinking, rambunctious crew died during the Nineties, Lycett Green was diagnosed with breast cancer and joked: ‘If I die, Ingrams will have hardly anyone to go to funeral services with.’ She recovered, to the relief of a wide circle of friends in whom she inspired adoration. The campaigning Left-wing journalist Paul Foot had called her ‘the most beautiful woman in Oxford’ during her student days and in Swinging London she was close to actor Terence Stamp, gambler John Aspinall, Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger. Indeed, she sometimes said that her great regret in life was that she hadn’t ‘gone the whole hog’ with the Rolling Stone. But it is as a writer, not a socialite, that she will be remembered. Her books included a memoir, Over The Hills And Far Away; a guide to the capital’s disappearing architecture called Goodbye London, and Unwrecked England, a collection of her columns in the Oldie magazine. A close friend of Prince Charles, she wrote the definitive handbook to his Gloucestershire estate, The Gardens At Highgrove. She was a war baby, born in 1942, and as a child lived at Uffington in the Vale of the White Horse where her family’s cottage was overlooked by the ancient chalk carving. Her father, whose imagination was fired by steam trains and cricket on the green, instilled a love of English heritage in her. Childhood car journeys on holiday to Cornwall used to take four days, as Betjeman stopped to examine every canal lock, parish church and tumbledown farmhouse. ‘England is my nirvana,’ she said. ‘I will never tire of exploring it. Compared with any other country, its variety is astonishing. One minute you can be high in great, gloomy, rugged moorland and the next deep in a verdant valley with thatched cottages strung along the fern-banked lanes.’ All her life she would revisit Trebetherick in Cornwall, reliving the family pilgrimage. She felt the memories defined her soul. Her father, though he was content to stop for hours to inspect cathedrals and abandoned railway stations, would lose his temper if their battered Vauxhall got stuck in a narrow country lane behind a lorry. ‘He used the word “bloody” a lot,’ she said. Betjeman’s idea of fun was to tell his daughter that she must marry his friend John Sparrow, a crusty old Oxford don. She was not sure if this was a joke, but she had no intention of obeying — she rarely did anything she was told as a child. An enthusiastic rider, one of her favourite games in summer was to gallop through fields of corn, often seriously damaging the crop. ‘I was very naughty, and behaved pretty badly really,’ she recalled gleefully. Candida Lycett Green, second left, was the daughter of John Betjeman, left, pictured at their home in Farnborough around 1948 with her brother Paul and mother Penelope - and dog Peter Pudding . This idyllic childhood ended in 1954, when she was sent to boarding school. ‘I was a revolutionary at heart,’ she said, ‘so I hated it.’ A half-hearted attempt to study sculpture at Oxford Polytechnic followed, before she joined Richard Ingrams and others including David Dimbleby and Auberon Waugh at the Edinburgh Fringe. Self-deprecating as ever, she claimed she had earned a place in their Town And Gown revue because the producer had heard her singing in the bath. What he was doing in her bathroom, she never attempted to explain. A few months later, in London, during a short-lived stint as a magazine sub-editor, she met Savile Row tailor Rupert Lycett Green. An obsessive gambler who played poker till the small hours, he played backgammon with customers in the window of his shop. His designs ushered in the multi-coloured peacock attire of the Sixties, with gold-embroidered jackets and rainbow ties. His shop did for men what Mary Quant was doing for women, offering ‘a young man’s view of cut and proportion’. As a child, Candida, pictured, was an enthusiastic horse rider who rarely obeyed her parents' wishes . Candida claimed it was his flair on the dance-floor that won her heart, but it was also his cavalier sense of adventure. He had a sporty Mini Cooper, and drove it so violently that Candida’s beehive hairdo would collapse as he took corners. They married and on honeymoon attempted to drive around the world in a Land Rover. It was stoned by locals in Tripoli, held up at gunpoint in Kabul, and overturned in Rajasthan in India. In Damascus, the newlyweds found themselves in a military coup, and in Beirut they were adopted by Ba’ath separatists who took them clubbing at the city’s decadent Folies Bergeres club. Back in London, they were more fashionable than ever. Painter David Hockney wanted a Lycett Green suit, and in lieu of payment did a drawing of Candida. Her magazine career, though, was scuppered when the editor caught her working for his rival, Private Eye — although her job was stapling the pages together and handing out advertising on the Tube. But no Betjeman would be deterred that easily from writing. As her family grew — she and Rupert had five children — she did what her father had done and started writing bedtime stories. These became the basis of two children’s books about Hadrian the Hedgehog. Candida, centre, pictured alongside author Jilly Cooper, left and the Duchess of Cornwall, right, was a close friend of the Prince of Wales and even wrote the definitive guide to the gardens of his Highgrove Estate . In 1970, angry that her husband had gone to the football World Cup in Mexico with a group of friends, she persuaded the editor of the Evening Standard to send her to the tournament as the paper’s Cultural Correspondent by arguing that football was the purest form of cultural achievement. She spent most of her time partying with the England squad’s wives. In the Seventies, she took over Private Eye’s architecture column, Nooks and Corners, from her father, and began a passionate defence of England’s buildings that would last the rest of her life. She became a commissioner for English Heritage with a special enthusiasm for protecting churches and cathedrals — a role that would have thrilled her father. He died in 1984, and she spent the rest of the Eighties editing his letters. She celebrated allotments, cooling towers and seaside resorts — and presented BBC documentaries on the suburban front garden, and the nation’s love of horses, as well as a series for Channel 4 on the cottages of England. Both the gardens and the cottages inspired spin-off books that became best-sellers and provided valuable income, because the family finances were often shaky. Candida married Rupert Lycett Green, left who was a tailor based in London's Savile Row . Candida Lycett Green was a fierce defender of the monarchy, once writing to the The Times to declare indignantly that no Hollywood star had ever been half so much in demand as the Queen, who received countless requests to attend every kind of event, from international summits to children’s parties. After being diagnosed with breast cancer, her matter-of-fact courage was an inspiration to countless women. After recovering, she undertook a 200-mile journey on horseback to raise £125,000 for the complementary care centre at the Churchill cancer hospital in Oxford. Last year she was told she had inoperable cancer of the pancreas and would live just a few months. Her response was as wry as ever. Exasperated that the disease came so low down the league table of research as to be ‘the Sheffield Wednesday of tumours’, she began fund-raising for more research into pancreatic cancer — too late to help herself but, typically, a life-saver for sufferers in the future. In her introduction to John Betjeman’s letters, she wrote: ‘I love my father and want to show the world how great he was, how he revealed the divine in the ordinary and enriched so many people’s lives.’ She deserves nothing less for her own epitaph.","Candida Lycett Green was a staunch defender of the English countryside .

"Arsene Wenger's exit from Arsenal is the biggest test the club will face in the coming years, says Gunners chief executive Ivan Gazidis. Wenger this month celebrated 18 years as manager at Arsenal, who need look no further than Manchester United and life after Sir Alex Ferguson to see how difficult it is to replace such a pivotal figure at a football club. The Frenchman, who is 65 next week, signed a three-year contract extension in May after ending a nine-year trophy drought by winning the FA Cup.

Gazidis told Arsenal Media: 'So much of the attention on a football club is around an individual and that's very understandable at Arsenal because we have a giant who's managing us. 'Arsene has been a fantastic driver and has put the club in a great, great position. The biggest challenge we're going to face as a club is that, when that transition from Arsene to the next manager of our football club happens - and I don't know when that's going to be - that we come through that strongly.' Gazidis, who has been in post for six years, is optimistic for the future and wants Arsenal to join the world's elite. Gazidis added: 'I wouldn't be doing this job if I didn't believe we could compete at the very top level. I know Arsene feels exactly the same way. 'Where we are currently is off the shoulder of the world's top teams. 'I think the best teams in the world are in Europe and you think about the great names in world football like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich - I don't think we're at that level yet but that's where we're aiming to get to. 'It's one thing to say that and it's another thing to be able to deliver it.' Gazidis says Arsenal should be reaching for the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich . Arsenal ended a trophy draught last season but haven't started the Premier League quite as well . During Arsenal's long slump without silverware - the move from Highbury to the Emirates Stadium led to straitened times for the Gunners and saw leading players sold rather than retained - it seemed they might struggle to rediscover former glories, despite reaching the Champions League for 17 successive seasons. 'It has been incredibly frustrating not being able to be where we want to be these last few years, so winning the FA Cup was a fantastic moment,' Gazidis added. '(But) I don't come out of that feeling satisfied like we've achieved what we need to achieve. The hunger for success is immediate. 'The moment you get away from that euphoria of the moment, the next question is, 'How do we have more of that?' 'That's what everybody at this club is focused on.

"Chelsea right-back Branislav Ivanovic has sounded an ominous warning to the rest of the Premier League by insisting Jose Mourinho's team will only get better.

"FIFA executive committee member Michel D'Hooghe has described the £16,000 watches given to officials at the 2014 World Cup by the Brazilian federation as the most 'poisonous present' he has ever received. The world governing body's medical chief was the recipient of one of 65 gift bags, each containing a Parmigiani watch, from Brazil's football federation the CBF in June, which were distributed to all 28 members of FIFA's executive committee. FIFA's ethics committee last month said accepting such valuable gifts contravened its rules and has demanded that all the watches be returned by October 24 otherwise it will launch disciplinary proceedings. FIFA executive committee member Michel D'Hooghe has spoken out about the controversial gift . D'Hooghe, speaking at the Leaders in Sport conference in London, said: 'We (FIFA's executive committee) are absolutely angry on that situation. All my colleagues on the executive committee, not one of them needs that watch. 'I have been in football 42 years and received many watches in my career. It is a classical present in football, so I did not need that watch. 'They say I received that watch. It is not true. I found that watch in a bag that was placed in our room. 'It's only after one week that I opened it, I saw there was a watch with plastic bracelet and the mark 'Parmigiano' (sic). 'For me Parmigiano is a cheese that you put on spaghetti. I thought it was a kind of Swatch (watch).' D'Hooghe (right) poses with FIFA chairman Sepp Blatter during a press conference . The 68-year-old Belgian, a member of FIFA's executive committee since 1988, did not appreciate the gift, insisted there was nothing untoward in its intentions, but was happy to return it. 'The Brazilians gave a present for their centenary,' he added. 'There was nothing asked in return. It was not a matter of corrupting. It was a pure present. 'What I did not like is that they gave a present of such value. 'Please never give me such presents again.' UEFA President Michel Platini has said publicly that he will not return his luxury watch .

"FIFA's credibility cannot be rescued until Sepp Blatter leaves his role as president, a former member of the world governing body's independent governance committee said on Monday. Speaking at the International Centre for Sport Security's 'Securing Sport' conference in London, Michael Hershman, an expert in transparency, accountability and governance, called for a change of leadership at FIFA. Blatter has been president since 1998 and last month declared his intention to run for a fifth term. Sepp Blatter has declared his intention to run for a fifth term as FIFA president . 'I'd rather see more anger (towards FIFA) than cynicism,' Hershman said. 'If we're going to change organisations like FIFA, we're going to have to put pressure on the stakeholders, put pressure on the sponsors, put pressure on the federations to demand change. 'FIFA was the most difficult assignment (of my career) and probably the most unsatisfactory.

Hershman was surprised that, after a number of FIFA's executive committee spoke of the need to make the report public, a statement followed a recent meeting to declare there had been no such demands made.

"Heiko Salzwedel has joined British Cycling's coaching staff for a third time as part of a restructuring led by technical director Shane Sutton. Sutton became technical director when Sir Dave Brailsford left his role as performance director in April to focus solely on Team Sky. German Salzwedel has been tasked with leading the men's endurance squad in the lead-up to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, having worked with British Cycling for short spells post-Sydney and post-Beijing. He will begin his position on November 1. Heiko Salzwedel has returned to British Cycling for the third time as they undergo a staff restructuring . Salzwedel must galvanise a team pursuit squad which has struggled to fire since winning Olympic gold at London 2012, finishing a dismal eighth at the 2014 Track World Championships in Colombia, but bolstered by the return of Sir Bradley Wiggins to the velodrome. Paul Manning returns to overseeing the women's endurance squad which he led to gold in London, while Chris Newton reverts to the coaching the Olympic Academy men's endurance squad. Sutton said: 'I'm pleased to be able to welcome Heiko back on to the Great Britain cycling team in the role of national men's endurance coach. 'He has a wealth of knowledge and experience which I believe will help drive forward the performances of the men's endurance squad.' Sir Chris Hoy was one of the members of the extremely successful British Cycling team at London 2012 . Iain Dyer, a member of the sprint coaching team, has been appointed as coach coordinator and will be responsible for the coordination of podium coach related operations, assisting in coach development planning and will be involved in major event selection panels. Dyer will continue to coach the sprinters, alongside Jan van Eijden and New Zealander Justin Grace, who was appointed last month. Sutton added: 'I am pleased that Iain Dyer has accepted the additional responsibility to become coach coordinator which I think will galvanise the work of the podium coaches. 'I believe that these changes, along with the recent addition of Justin Grace to the sprint squad coaching team, put us in good stead at this stage of the Olympic cycle.'

"Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has been cleared to play on after undergoing precautionary tests following the head injury he sustained during Sunday's 2-0 Premier League win over Arsenal. Courtois played on after requiring treatment for a head knock following a first-half collision with Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez, before being replaced after further treatment and departing Stamford Bridge for precautionary scans in hospital. A Chelsea statement issued on Monday read: 'Chelsea Football Club can confirm Thibaut Courtois went to hospital during our Premier League game against Arsenal yesterday (Sunday) for precautionary tests on a head injury. Those tests came back all clear. VIDEO Scroll down to hear from both managers . Thibaut Courtois took to Twitter to thank fans for his support after being released from hospital . Courtois suffered a heavy blow when he came out to challenge Alexis Sanchez but played on for a while . Sanchez immediately shows concern for Courtois as the keeper appeared badly hurt on the pitch . 'Thibaut was treated for a minor cut to his ear and was released from hospital last night. He is expected to report for international duty (with Belgium) later this week.' The Blues stopper has also taken to Twitter to thank fans for their support as he looks forward to playing again. Courtois tweeted: 'Thanks for all the messages! I'm already feeling better. Now I'm resting to be recovered and back on the pitch soon. Great victory yesterday (Sunday).' Headway, the brain injury charity, has questioned the application of the Premier League's regulations following the decision to allow Courtois to play on. The Premier League is understood to be happy the rules were correctly applied. Headway chief executive Peter McCabe said on the charity's website: 'The new rules introduced this season were designed to ensure no risks to players' health were taken. 'They clearly state that 'If there is any suspicion of the player having sustained a concussion, they must be removed from the field of play, and not allowed to return.' 'This incident calls into question whether these rules are working effectively. Belgian journalist Kristof Terreur revealed that the Blues keeper will be available for Belgium . The Chelsea goalkeeper continued for 13 minutes after the injury before being forced from the pitch . The Belgian is escorted up the tunnel and was immediately treated by paramedics in the dressing room . 'It is hard to understand how a concussion was not suspected following the sickening clash.' Courtois was taken off only after liquid appeared to be coming from his ear. McCabe acknowledged the difficulty of making an assessment from television, but questioned why a 'safety-first approach' was not applied. He added: 'Bleeding from one or both ears is one of the symptoms to look out for that requires an immediate visit or return to hospital following a head injury. 'The fact that the bleeding only became apparent 15 minutes after the injury also demonstrates the evolving nature of concussion and highlights why a safety-first approach must be taken with all head injuries.'","Thibaut Courtois has been cleared to play after head injury suffered against Arsenal on Sunday .

"FIFA medical chief Michel D'Hooghe has supported Chelsea's conduct over the head injury sustained by Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. And he insists team doctors are best placed to assess their own players despite undoubted performance pressures. Courtois was substituted in the first half of last Sunday's Premier League match with Arsenal, but only after playing on for 13 minutes after sustaining a head knock in a challenge with Gunners forward Alexis Sanchez. Thibaut Courtois is caught in the head by Alexis Sanchez's knee during Sunday's London derby . Courtois appeared to be out cold for a short while as Sanchez and John Terry (right) tried to help him . 'In the case of Chelsea, I think sincerely that the team doctor did a correct examination,' D'Hooghe said at the Leaders in Sport conference in London. 'She (Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro) came to a conclusion that he could go on, but she kept an eye on him and from the moment he didn't feel well - and that can happen in the case of concussion - they took again the right decision to take him off.' D'Hooghe insists team doctors must assess their own players and that the Hippocratic Oath means they should not compromise their ethics and morals to benefit the team they are employed by. 'A team doctor can be under pressure of the coach, the whole stadium,' D'Hooghe said. '(But) it is only the team doctor who knows very well the normal behaviour of his (or her) player. Sanchez apologises to Courtois after the Chelsea goalkeeper is able to sit back up . 'If he has had a concussion his normal behaviour can change. That, a neutral doctor can never judge. 'It is the team doctor who has the medical responsibility over his players. He is the only medical person who knows his players. 'But he can ask for assistance. It would, for instance, be good if someone else looked at the television images of how precisely an accident occurred.' FIFA has amended regulations over head injuries to form rules in its competitions to stop the game for three minutes to allow a team doctor to examine a player. If more time is needed for a complete neurological decision the player should be replaced. Courtois is treated again by Eva Carneiro after he went back down with blood coming from his ear . FIFA, football's world governing body, cannot demand full-scale rule changes - that is the role of the International Football Association Board - but D'Hooghe hopes the regulation is adopted throughout the game. 'We have now imposed that rule for our international competitions,' D'Hooghe added. 'I would be very grateful if this would go down to the 209 associations of FIFA. 'I think it will be the case in many, many countries. I am behind that proposal. We must do our very best for the health of the player.' Substitute goalkeeper Petr Cech (left) eventually replaces the young Belgian later in the first half .","Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois accidentally kneed in the head by Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez during Sunday's London derby .

"Tom Daley believes any footballer would be surprised by the support they would receive if they chose to reveal that they were homosexual. The 20-year-old diver, who last December announced on YouTube he was in a relationship with Hollywood screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, does not believe any public figure should have to discuss their sexuality. Yet Daley, an Olympic bronze medalist at London 2012, thinks football would accept an openly-gay player despite no active player making their sexuality known for fear of being the subject of prejudice and target of abuse. Tom Daley said footballers would be surprised by the support they would likely receive if they came out . 'I think people would be surprised how supported they'd be if they were to come out in a football environment,' Daley said at the Leaders in Sport conference in London. '(But) you don't have to do a YouTube video and announce that you're straight. It shouldn't be anyone's business. 'You should just be able to live your life the way you want to live it. 'It comes down to each individual person. At the time I individually felt ready, I did it. Everyone's been really supportive.' The 20-year-old diver chose to reveal that he was homosexual via a YouTube video rather than on television . Daley has no worries with travelling to Kazan for next year's Aquatics World Championships, despite Russia's anti-gay legislation. He has no plans to make any political statement similar to ones made during this year's Winter Olympics in Sochi. 'I have no concerns whatsoever about going to Russia,' he added. 'I've been there five, six times before and never had any problems. 'You go there to dive, you don't go there thinking about doing anything other than that. Daley has no worries with travelling to Kazan, Russia, for next year's Aquatics World Championships . 'For me, I wouldn't go there thinking 'oh, I'm going to do this' or 'I have to do this'. I just go there and focus on my performance.' Daley's YouTube revelation was discussed with his sponsors prior to being posted on the internet and allowed him to control what was said. He added: 'There were so many different opinions of what I should do, how I should do it. A TV interview, a press interview, all those different ideas. 'YouTube just felt natural. I was able to say everything I wanted to say without being asked any extra questions.' Daley won both a gold and silver medal at the latest Commonwealth games in Glasgow . Asked if it had affected his numerous endorsements, Daley, star of TV's Splash!, added: 'I don't think it's massively changed anything (commercially). If anything it's been positive. 'It was a life decision to make. It wasn't a business decision. 'I did it because I felt like it was something I wanted to do and felt natural at the time to do. 'We spoke to all our sponsorship partners before the video went out. 'Everyone has been so supportive. I couldn't have asked for it to go any better. I was very happy with the way it went.'","Tom Daley said discussing sexuality is a personal .

"Bundesliga chief executive Christian Seifert insists the German league would not contemplate staging matches abroad out of concern for supporters after the prospect of playing Premier League matches overseas arose again. Chairmen of the English top-flight clubs discussed the plans at their most recent meeting, and - although no firm plans have yet been drawn up - the belief of those club chairmen is that they could cash in on interest overseas. Plans for a 39th game were dropped in 2008 following widespread opposition, including from FIFA and UEFA. Christian Seifert said the idea of staging games abroad is not something that is on the Bundesliga's agenda . Borussia Dortmund's avid fans recorded an average attendance of 80,297 last season - the highest in Europe . Manchester United vs Liverpool was one of many pre-season games between Premier League clubs in the USA . Seifert is uncertain whether FIFA would countenance the idea, but was adamant it is not something that is on the Bundesliga's agenda. 'I think it's a creative idea, I'm not sure it would work with FIFA,' Seifert said at the Leaders in Sport conference in London. 'We have a completely different approach about our idea of German football. 'For the financial side it would be maybe a good idea to play a matchday all over the world, but for the supporters who are visiting 34 games of that club, no matter if it's snow or rain or wind or whatever and they're travelling. 'And on that game that has the impact that the team is going to be relegated and they cannot be there, because it's in Thailand - I think this would not be an approach for the Bundesliga.' A crowd of almost 110,000 people watched Manchester United take on Real Madrid at the Michigan Stadium . Real Madrid and Manchester United players walk out onto the pitch ahead of their game in Michigan . Carlos Tevez and his Juventus team-mates will be heading to Doha to face Napoli in the Italian Super Cup . The Premier League is not alone in looking to hold games abroad. Italy's Serie A chief confirmed on Tuesday that the Italian Super Cup clash between Juventus and Napoli will be played in Doha, Qatar on December 22, while the French Super Cup clash has taken place away from France for the last six years. The Football Supporters' Federation announced its objection to the proposals. In a statement on its website, fsf.org.uk, FSF wrote: 'The FSF is against the proposals as they have been reported, and will be consulting with Premier League fans' groups and individuals to formulate an appropriate response. Gary Lineker objected the plans for overseas games . 'Once again the idea of potentially huge changes to the game has arisen without consultation with one of the groups who matters most - the fans. 'If the reaction to previous incarnations of 'Game 39' and the idea of matches abroad is anything to go by, we expect this proposal to be met with the strongest possible opposition from supporters. 'The potential impact on the value of season tickets, which would see fans of half the Premier League clubs missing out a home match, could be enormous. 'Inevitably some of the fixtures to be moved will be either local derbies or other high-profile fixtures.' There was a high-profile objection from Gary Lineker, the former England striker and Match of the Day presenter. Lineker wrote on Twitter: 'Reemergence of plans to play PL games overseas is a rotten one. Need to make game more affordable for fans not less.

"Rebecca Adlington expects Great Britain's swimmers to be a future force after a post-London 2012 revival. Britain's most successful swimmer is now retired after winning two gold medals aged 19 at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and two bronze medals four years later in London. Those third-placed finishes were part of a haul of just three British medals in the swimming pool in a disappointing display which Adlington does not expect to be repeated in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Rebecca Adlinton said she expects a bright future for British swimmers after a poor showing at London 2012 . The 25-year-old from Mansfield, who recently married swimmer Harry Needs, takes confidence from the haul of medals won at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Adlington said: 'It was amazing to see the guys swimming so well, being so happy. 'These guys weren't just winning, they weren't just getting medals, they were posting world-class times. 'A lot of people with the Commonwealth Games were saying 'USA aren't there, China aren't there'. 'It didn't matter, because the times they were posting rivalled the rest of the world, so it's going to be interesting going into the World Championships next year and see how good these guys can be. 'They aren't fazed who they stand up next to any more. They're all their to be beaten. Adlington won two bronze medals at the London Olympics to add to the two golds she won in Beijing . 'Everyone in the pool has that attitude which is absolutely incredible.' The strength in depth is best illustrated in the men's breaststroke events, where pre-race favourite and London 2012 silver medallist Michael Jamieson was beaten to Commonwealth 200metres gold by fellow Scot Ross Murdoch. Adam Peaty, the Commonwealth and European 100m champion, Andrew Willis and others are also ensuring competition is tight. Adlington added: 'The depth is fantastic. Men's breaststroke is just insane. Only two people can go to the World Championships. 'When you've got four guys in the top 10 in the world fighting for two places, they're going to have to be on form and on target. British swimmers performed well at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games both in terms of medals and times . 'They can't relax at the trials, which can only be good. 'That's what you've got to do at the World Championships. You've got to step up in the heats and semi-finals and post PBs (personal best times) just to make it through.' While enthusiastic about the improvement in British swimming, Adlington does not yearn for a return to the water. 'I don't miss the competition element,' she added. 'I try to go in the pool as much as I can. It's such a nice way to relax. It's a nice way to think about your day and problem solve. It's a nice time to get 30 minutes to yourself thinking, as well as doing something productive.' Becky Adlington was speaking at British Gas SwimBritain at London Fields Lido.

"Headway, the brain injury charity, has questioned the application of the Premier League's regulations over head injuries after Thibaut Courtois played on during Chelsea's 2-0 Premier League win over Arsenal on Sunday. Chelsea goalkeeper Courtois continued after requiring treatment for a head-knock following a collision with Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez, before being replaced after further treatment and departing Stamford Bridge for precautionary scans in hospital. Headway chief executive Peter McCabe said on the charity's website: 'The new rules introduced this season were designed to ensure no risks to players' health were taken.

'The fact that the bleeding only became apparent 15 minutes after the injury also demonstrates the evolving nature of concussion and highlights why a safety-first approach must be taken with all head injuries.' Chelsea's first-team squad were afforded a day off by manager Jose Mourinho as many of the players prepared to join up with their national teams after the Blues extended their advantage at the top of the Premier League to five points from Manchester City. The Belgian is escorted up the tunnel and was immediately treated by paramedics in the dressing room . Only goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, defender John Terry and striker Didier Drogba, who is currently nursing an ankle injury, will stay behind for training, with all three having retired from international duty. Eden Hazard leaves for Belgium duty - for which Courtois is also expected to depart - on a high after a mixed start to the season. The playmaker, who is expected to sign a new contract shortly to commit to Chelsea, was below par against Aston Villa, but sparkled on occasion against the Gunners, particularly in the run which led to the penalty which he converted himself. Hazard, who was the target of some heavy tackling in the contest, is content to be fouled if it benefits the team. Belgian winger Eden Hazard said he did not mind being fouled if it helped his side win matches . And he believes with Cesc Fabregas over a set-piece, a goal is always possible. 'When I get the ball I need to go forward and win free-kicks, win penalties,' the 23-year-old Hazard told Chelsea TV. 'If they want to play like this it's not my problem. They have two against me, okay, but I can create a lot of space for other players. 'We can score every game with Fabregas from a free-kick or corner.' Chelsea have dropped two points in their opening seven games - in drawing at Manchester City - and are top of their Champions League Group. Hazard knows there is no margin for error, though. He added: 'We have a strong team. We need to concentrate all the time, 100 per cent. 'We know we have bad moments in one season, but we need to be focused all the time.' Cesc Fabregas played an key role as he faced his old side Arsenal, providing an assist for the second goal .","Chelsea keeper Thibaut Cortois suffered concussion against Arsenal .

"Sporting Lisbon coach Marco Silva believes Nani is in the best place he could be after his return 'home' on loan from Manchester United. The Portugal international is in line to play Chelsea in Champions League Group G at Estadio Jose Alvalade on Tuesday night after United appeared to lose patience with the enigmatic forward. 'He came home,' the Sporting boss said. Nani hopes to be among those in action against Chelsea with the winger on loan from Manchester United . Marco Silva's side welcome Chelsea on Tuesday night in the tense Champions League Group G clash . Nani left Manchester United in the summer to move back to Portugal with Sporting Lisbon . 'Sporting was his previous club. He knows his team-mates. This is the best choice he could've made.' Asked about needing to rebuild Nani's shattered confidence, Silva said: 'The confidence of the team is growing collectively. That is what we must focus on.' Sporting drew at Maribor in their first pool game, denied a win which would have seen them take top spot in the standings by a last-gasp equaliser. Jose Mourinho's Chelsea are favourites to advance at the top of the group, despite opening with a 1-1 draw against German side Schalke, but Silva hopes his side can upset the Blues. 'They're a great challenge, but with the right attitude and the right commitment we'll be able to overcome the obstacles and maybe even gain some points,' he added. The Sporting coach is relishing tangling with Mourinho, who is a reference point to many young coaches in Portugal, and does not believe his compatriot's kind words about his hosts were part of a psychological game. Silva added: 'That will have no influence on the match. Ultimately who will decide the destiny of this game are the players on the pitch. 'He referred to our ambition, our style. I'm happy with that.

"John Terry is thrilled with Chelsea's fine start to the Premier League season, but insists it is just that - the beginning. The Blues have taken a five-point lead over Manchester City into the international break after Sunday's 2-0 win over Arsenal, their sixth victory from seven games. Manchester United are eight points behind, with the Gunners and Liverpool nine adrift. John Terry is thrilled with Chelsea's fine start to the Premier League season, but insists it is still very early . With Jose Mourinho's history of claiming titles from the front, some are suggesting the Blues' position is ominous for the rest of the division, but 31 games still remain. 'Clearly it (the title race) is not over,' Terry said. 'Other teams have been in this position. It's nice to have the lead but when you're at the top everyone wants to shoot you down. 'That's the good thing about the Premier League and why everyone loves it. 'Teams are out to get us because we are at the top and playing well. The Chelsea captain said Diego Costa had been causing him constant problems in training . 'The international break is here and we need to come back and maintain our form after that as well. It's very important we do that.' Chelsea are chasing a first Premier League title since 2010 - their only championship since two-time winner Mourinho's first spell ended in September 2007 - and Terry wants the Blues to ruthlessly exploit any slips by their rivals. He added: 'You're just hoping when you're at the top and have a five-point cushion and more on certain teams, a couple of them slip up again and that increases. 'If that happens, it's a lot of points to give up early on. All we can do is keep winning and wait for those teams to slip up.' Terry also took time to praise Cesc Fabregas, who has hit the ground running at his new club . Chelsea finished four points behind champions City last term, but in Diego Costa now have the 'killer' striker Mourinho has craved. The Spain striker netted his ninth Premier League goal on his seventh appearance, despite Mourinho insisting he is barely training as a result of a hamstring problem. Terry questioned where talk of Costa's fitness travails arose, insisting the £32million summer signing from Atletico Madrid was causing him no end of problems in training. 'I'm not sure where that's coming from,' Terry said. Premier League table-toppers beat Arsenal 2-0 at Stamford Bridge at the weekend . 'He isn't showing that in training. He looks sharp, he looks angry, he looks aggressive. 'He's fit and that's the main thing. Diego has been a nightmare for defenders. He popped up with another great finish.' A delightful pass from Cesc Fabregas set up Costa and the former Arsenal captain was praised by Terry. 'When it's quiet and tight like that you need someone to open up the defence,' the Blues skipper added. 'He's not only shown it against Arsenal but from day one.'","Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-0 at Stamford Bridge .

Former Atletico Madrid striker Costa completes his first hat-trick in English football . The Blues have scored 15 goals in four Premier League games but, unusually for a Mourinho team, they have conceded five times in the last two games following the 6-3 win at Everton. “I don’t like (conceding), but we were analysing the goals against Everton and trying to identify the mistakes and we’ll do the same thing with these two goals (against Swansea),” Mourinho added. “If you score more goals than the opponent you win, but you want to be more consistent behind because it’s not possible to always score four, five, six or three. Chelsea skipper John Terry reflects on his own goal which gave Swansea the lead . Jonjo Shelvey also got on the scoresheet at Stamford Bridge andJose Mourinho is worried by the number of goals Chelsea have conceded this season . “There will come a time when we need a point and a 0-0 is a point or we need a victory and 1-0 is also a victory.” Mourinho will demands his defence improve, but in Costa it seems Chelsea have an added cutting edge this season. Mourinho has spoken of his upgraded strikeforce following the departures of Fernando Torres (on a two-year loan to AC Milan), Samuel Eto’o and Demba Ba, with Costa, the returning hero Didier Drogba and Loic Remy coming in. Remy took just nine minutes to open his Blues account after coming off the substitutes’ bench in place of Costa. “For me it was amazing,” the striker signed from QPR said on Chelsea TV. “I’m a striker and a striker wants to score. I was very happy after the goal and after the result. “Diego Costa is on fire at the minute and that’s good for the team. It’s good for the team to have his quality. “I really hope we’re going to stay at the same level. Even if I’m on the bench I try to do my best and score goals.” Loic Remy gets off the mark for Chelsea against the Swans . Ex-QPR striker Remy celebrates with his new team-mates Cesc Fabregas and Oscar . Drogba is a doubt for the Schalke clash with an ankle injury. Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski was beaten by Costa and Remy, but reflected positively on City’s performance. “We’ll have to look at both the positives and negatives and draw some smart conclusions from there, but we did well,” Fabianski said on swanseacity.net. “In the first half I thought we dominated the game. We created lots of chances and probably shocked them with how well we were playing. Swansea keeper Lukasz Fabianski focused on the positives from the visitors' performance . Angel Rangel has a head in hands moment after the Chelsea defeat . “But we were hanging on a little in the closing stages of the first half as they had more possession and crosses in the box. “It isn’t a good time to concede and in the second half Chelsea pushed a lot harder.” Right-back Angel Rangel added: “We have to improve on certain areas and that’s what we will be working hard on in time for next week’s game against Southampton.”","Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa have formed an instant understanding since joining Chelsea in the summer .

"Sir Bradley Wiggins lines up for the start of the Tour of Britain in Liverpool on Sunday, bidding to defend the title he won 12 months ago in a race which has been more competitive each year. Team Sky's Wiggins has the opportunity to show himself on home roads after missing out on selection for a Tour de France which began in Yorkshire, although his priorities are gradually shifting to the track ahead of the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in 2016. If Wiggins, the 2012 Tour de France winner, can stay in contention over The Tumble on Tuesday's third stage, the lumpy fifth Devon stage and the penultimate day's route to Brighton, which includes the brutal ascent of Ditchling Beacon, the gold jersey could be his once more. Aiming for gold: Sir Bradley Wiggins is aiming to retain his Tour of Britain title . The split final day's first test - an 8.8-kilometre time-trial in London - is not entirely to Wiggins' strengths, but he is a fine exponent against the clock and could gain time. Other contenders include the Wirral's Steve Cummings (BMC Racing), Essex's Alex Dowsett (Movistar), the Commonwealth Games time-trial champion, Irishman Nicolas Roche (Tinkoff-Saxo), Dutchman Lars Boom (Belkin)and New Zealander Jack Bauer (Garmin-Sharp) in a race which offers few opportunities for the sprinters. Mark Cavendish (Omega Pharma-QuickStep), who is still recovering following his Tour de France-ending crash in Harrogate, will go head to head with rival Marcel Kittel (Giant-Shimano) in Liverpool and London, on September 14, in the circuit races which bookend the 1376.7km, eight-day race. ""Realistically you have to say that I am not in my best condition after the last few months I've had,"" Cavendish said on tourofbritain.co.uk after requiring shoulder surgery following his crash in Yorkshire. ""I'm racing this week because this is my national Tour, Britain's big race, and I always want to support it when I can. Bouncing back: Mark Cavendish has a point to prove after crashing out of the Tour de France . ""It's always a treat racing on home soil in front of big British crowds. I'm just going to enjoy myself and see what the week brings."" The Manxman is a prolific winner but will end 2014 without a Grand Tour stage success for the first time since his first year as a professional in 2007. Just as it is difficult to predict his own prospects, Cavendish knows the race is wide open and tough to call. ""It's a really strong field at the Tour of Britain this year, the best ever,"" he said. ""It's going to make for really intense racing but I don't think it will change the nature of the race. ""Looking at the route it seems to be bookended by the two sure-fire sprints but after that almost anything can happen and that keeps a lot of riders interested. ""A lot of scenarios are possible.""","Wiggins won the title last year and is keen to defend it .

"Tom Daley responded strongly after again hitting a stumbling block on his nemesis dive to qualify in first place in defence of his Commonwealth Games 10 metres platform title in Edinburgh on Saturday. The 20-year-old has had trouble when it comes to the back two-and-a-half somersault with two-and-a-half twists which he describes as his 'demon' and scored just 37.80, after landing with quite a splash. It was the dive he performed en route to London 2012 Olympic bronze when a camera flash distracted him and he asked to re-perform the dive. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tom Daley react to winning Commonwealth gold . Stumbling block: Tom Daley has struggled with the back two-and-a-half somersault with two-and-a-half twists . The plunge was defending champion Daley's second of six dives and at the end of the round the Plymouth diver appeared on the big screen at the Royal Commonwealth Pool in a recorded message pleading to spectators not to use flash photography. There was no suggestion of a flash being used on this occasion. He was 11th of the 11 divers with four rounds remaining, but all were to progress to Saturday evening's final from the morning's preliminaries. Later U2's Vertigo was played over the public address system, but Daley, bidding for a third Commonwealth gold medal, shrugged off the mishap. He scored 83.20 with his third dive - an inward 3 1/2 somersault - to move up to eighth place at the halfway point before two scores over 100. His sensational forward 4 1/2 somersault was rewarded with 101.75 and his back 3 1/2 somersault scored 100.80 to move him into first place with one dive remaining. Doing enough: Daley finished with a total of 488.85 to go through in first place . Daley finished with a total of 488.85 to go through in first place, with Matthew Mitcham of Australia, the 2008 Olympic champion, second with 450.80. England's James Denny, who on Friday night won synchronised silver with Daley, was sixth with 408.40, while 14-year-old Matthew Dixon advanced in 10th place with 365.65. Twelve of 14 divers advanced from the women's three-metres springboard preliminaries, with Canada's Jennifer Abel leading the way. Spinning around: Daley in action during the men's 10m platform preliminaries at the Royal Commonwealth Pool . The one-metre springboard champion scored 336.90 to advance, with England's Hannah Starling (311.05) in fourth, Alicia Blagg (300.70) in sixth and Rebecca Gallantree in 11th. Grace Reid, who came close to Scotland's first Commonwealth Games diving medal in 56 years in the women's one-metre springboard final on Friday before finishing fifth was also in action. The 18-year-old from Edinburgh was 10th in qualifying. Tonga's Maria Zarka (184.40) and Canada's Emma Friesen (194.40) were the divers eliminated.","Tom Daley secures place in 10m platform final .

"Sir Bradley Wiggins won the penultimate stage of the Tour of Britain as Holland’s Dylan van Baarle clung to his overall lead ahead of the concluding criterium race in Westminster. Van Baarle (Garmin-Sharp) had a 19-second advantage ahead of the first of two stages on the eighth and final day after soaring into the yellow jersey on Saturday’s seventh stage to Brighton. Poland’s Michal Kwiatkowski (Omega Pharma-QuickStep) was his nearest challenger, but could cut the deficit only to 10 seconds after the stage 8a 8.8-kilometre time-trial. Team Sky's Bradley Wiggins celebrates on the podium after winning stage eight of the Tour of Britain . Sir Bradley Wiggins went into third overall after winning the Tour of Britain's individual time trial stage . Wiggins won the stage in nine minutes 50.71 seconds to move up four places to third overall, effectively sealing a podium place in his title defence, to move 22secs behind Van Baarle. Kwiatkowski finished in 10mins 06.78secs, but Van Baarle’s impressive time of 10:15.21 saw him retain the yellow jersey. Intermediate and finish-line time bonuses are available on the 88.8km stage 8b - 10 laps on the same course as ridden in the time-trial - and the deficit is not insurmountable. Tour of Britain teams set up on the Westminster Bridge for the time trial stage on Sunday . Garmin-Sharp's Dylan Van Baarle retains the yellow jersey on the penultimate stage of the tour . But with Kwiatkowski likely working for Omega Pharma-QuickStep team-mate Mark Cavendish for a sprint finish it would take an unfortunate event for Van Baarle to be beaten. Wiggins, who won the 2013 Tour of Britain title, began the day 47secs behind Van Baarle in seventh, but rolled down the ramp intent on claiming a stage success from his national tour. The 34-year-old Londoner is negotiating an extension to his Team Sky contract, which expires this year, and is targeting the Road World Championships time-trial in Spain at the end of this month. Frenchman Sylvain Chavanel (IAM Cycling) was second on the stage, eight seconds behind Wiggins, with Briton Steve Cummings (BMC Racing) a second further adrift in third place.","Sir Bradley Wiggins won the time trial stage in nine minutes 50.71 seconds .

"Gary Cahill has seen off one of his former clubs with Chelsea this week and hopes the Premier League leaders can beat another on Saturday. Cahill, who joined Chelsea from Bolton in January 2012, helped the Blues to a 2-1 Capital One Cup win on Wednesday night to set up a fourth-round tie at Shrewsbury. Now the 28-year-old central defender, whose influence at Stamford Bridge is growing by the game, faces Aston Villa, the side where he began his career. Gary Cahill helped Chelsea beat Bolton in the Capital One Cup as the Blues ended up winning 2-1 . 'I had a great time at Villa, more than anything with the youth team,' Cahill said on chelseafc.com. 'I owe a lot to them, they brought me through and I had a great time, so I'm looking forward to it. 'They've had a great start to the season, apart from their last result, so it's going to be another tough test for us.' Villa are three points behind Chelsea in third place in the table after a 3-0 defeat at home to Arsenal followed their win at Liverpool in the previous game. Cahill wants to ensure Chelsea continue their unbeaten start to their Premier League campaign . Chelsea's win over Sky Bet Championship strugglers Bolton should have been more emphatic, but for some wasteful finishing, but Cahill was satisfied with a fifth win in an unbeaten seven matches at the start of the season. 'It's great to have a winning mentality,' he added. 'If you have a couple of sticky results it puts the pressure on going into games but at the moment we're unbeaten, we're going well and we should have confidence, especially playing in front of our own fans at Stamford Bridge.' Cahill was one of only two players retained from the starting line-up which drew 1-1 at Manchester City, alongside Cesar Azpilicueta, and enjoyed featuring against Wanderers. 'Any player will tell you that when you're playing against your old club there's that added bit of emotion,' he said. The England international moved from Bolton to Chelsea in 2012 and was re-united with his former team . 'You try not to let it affect you and play your normal game but I'm a professional and the most important thing is that we won the game. They made it tough for us but thankfully we won.' Kurt Zouma's debut goal was cancelled out by Matt Mills before Oscar netted what proved to be the winner on a night when victory should have been more convincing and Andre Schurrle, in particular, should have scored. Cahill added: 'Schurrle created a lot for himself, I thought he played well, cutting inside and firing shots at goal. 'People expect you to win the game and it's not that easy. There have already been a few shocks and thankfully we weren't one of them.'","Gary Cahill helped Chelsea beat Bolton in the Capital One Cup .

"Swimming superstar Ellie Simmonds is determined to continue breaking records as the Rio de Janeiro Paralympic Games approach. Simmonds burst on to the scene at the 2008 Games in Beijing with two gold medals as a 13-year-old. Now 19 she shows few signs of slowing down ahead of her third Paralympics after impressing in the recent IPC Swimming European Championships in Eindhoven. History-maker: Paralympian Ellie Simmonds has already broken three world records but she wants more . Glory: Simmonds first broke on to the scene when she won two gold medals at the 2008 Paralympics in Beijing . Simmonds, who has three world records and features in the Guinness World Records book, said: 'To come away with three golds and two silvers and personal best and also a world record, Europeans went pretty well for me. 'My aim to start off with is just to qualify (for Rio) and to go. I'd love to do personal bests out there, that would be great.' For Simmonds, who is from Walsall and now trains in Loughborough, personal bests mean world records. She has three of them - in the 400metres freestyle, the 200m individual medley and in the non-Paralympic discipline, the 800m freestyle - but as a child it was not the swimming records which piqued her interest. All smiles: Simmonds beams after winning bronze in the 50m freestyle event at the London 2012 Paralympics . 'It's great to be featured in the book,' she added. 'I used to get the book every Christmas. I always looked out for the weird records, like how many piercings, or the tattoos. 'But I don't think I could imagine myself all tattooed up. I don't think it's for me. I don't like needles.' Simmonds is back in the pool from Monday to prepare for next July's World Championships and Rio. 'We have World Championships next year in Glasgow, home soil, and then Rio after that,' she added. 'It was so exciting watching the Commonwealths. It's a great pool. I look forward to racing in it next year.' Arms aloft: Simmonds stands on the podium and acknowledges the crowd after winning gold at London 2012 .

"Sir Bradley Wiggins is ready to take on the world after claiming third place in the Tour of Britain. Wiggins (Team Sky) won the penultimate stage of the race, the stage 8a 8.8-kilometre time-trial, before Marcel Kittel (Giant-Shimano) once again triumphed on British soil with a sprint victory over Mark Cavendish (Omega Pharma-QuickStep) on Whitehall. Dylan van Baarle (Garmin-Sharp) had a 19-second overnight advantage and it proved sufficient to succeed Wiggins as champion, the Dutchman taking the yellow jersey by 10 seconds from Polish runner-up Michal Kwiatkowski (Omega Pharma-QuickStep). Team Sky's Bradley Wiggins celebrates on the podium after winning stage eight of the Tour of Britain . Sir Bradley Wiggins went into third overall after winning the Tour of Britain's individual time trial stage . Sir Bradley Wiggins (right) of Team Sky finished third in the Tour of Britain behind overall winner Dylan van Baarle (centre) of Garmin-Sharp and runner-up Michal Kwiatkowski (left) of Omega Pharma-QuickStep . Wiggins, who won the time-trial in nine minutes 50.71 seconds to move up four places to third overall, was 22secs behind and pleased with a podium place after a route that did not suit his style, with short, sharp climbs late in a number of stages. 'They (race organisers) were touting it as the toughest edition (and) most people say it's the hardest race they've done all year,' Wiggins said. 'I was sort of fit for one thing coming here, with only 34 days' racing this year, so I feel like to be here now a week on, in third place, just 20-odd seconds off, I'm pretty pleased with that.' Wiggins, who won the 2013 Tour of Britain title, began the day 47secs behind Van Baarle, but rolled down the start ramp intent on claiming a stage success from his national tour and duly delivered. The 34-year-old Londoner will ride the six-man team time-trial with Team Sky next Sunday at the Road World Championships, before switching into the Great Britain skinsuit for the individual time-trial. Sir Bradley Wiggins of Team Sky celebrates after claiming third place in the 2014 Tour of Britain on Sunday . 'There's a chance I could win it,' added Wiggins, who in 2013 was second to Germany's Tony Martin, who will again be favourite. 'I feel in the form I'm in I'll be in the ball-park. We'll see on the day. I thought I'd be closer to him (Martin) last year and he put 42 seconds into me.' There was a German victory over a Briton in London when Kittel left it late to power past Cavendish. Kittel has won Giro d'Italia stages in Belfast and Dublin, Tour de France stages in Harrogate and London and Tour of Britain stages in Liverpool and London this year. Van Baarle was 29th on the stage to confirm the biggest victory of his career after a decisive move on Saturday. Marcel Kittel (right) edges out Mark Cavendish (left) in a sprint finish to win Tour of Britain's final stage . He said: 'I was expecting top 10. It means a lot. I will remember this day my whole life.' Van Baarle's success was all-but certain before the concluding stage following an 11th-placed finish in the time-trial, 25secs behind Wiggins. Wiggins believes his performance in Westminster, although on a far shorter course than the 57.1km route he faces in Ponferrada, is a good indicator of his form. 'Having done the track in the summer it was just a perfect effort for me,' said Wiggins, who was second with England in the team pursuit at the Commonwealth Games. 'Just to win the stage I was more pleased with that, and confirm that I'm in the shape that I thought I was in going into the worlds next week. Marcel Kittel raises his fist in celebration after claiming victory on the final stage of the Tour of Britain . 'If that top end's there like that to ride an effort like that, once you scale it down a bit in terms of power, for a ride that's sustainable over one hour, it's a good sign.' Wiggins is negotiating an extension to his Team Sky contract, which expires this year, amid suggestions he could lead a development squad as he turns his attentions from road to track at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016. 'I've got meetings next week,' said Wiggins, after riding for an overall stage race victory for probably the final time. 'There has to be a point where I make that switch (to the track), and with the winter months ahead now I have time to go and change body shape and things like that.' Wiggins still has ambitions on the road, with the Paris-Roubaix one-day race over the cobbles of northern France a major target for 2015. Wiggins, who finished ninth in April, added: 'I'll be back at Paris-Roubaix next year. Definitely.'

"Grace Reid came agonisingly close to Scotland's first Commonwealth Games diving medal in 56 years in the women's one-metre springboard final in Edinburgh on Friday, but finished fifth. The 18-year-old, diving in her home pool, was in silver medal position entering the final round, but finished with a total of 269.40 as Canada's Jennifer Abel won with a score of 287.25. Australia's Maddison Keeney (281.95) took silver and her compatriot Esther Qin (278.65) bronze. So close: Grace Reid finished fifth in the one-metre springboard final to just miss out on a medal . Attempt: Reid was bidding to become the first Scottish diver to win a Commonwealth medal in 56 years . Australia's 15-year-old Georgia Sheehan finished fourth, just 0.05 behind Qin. Reid was hoping to become Scotland's second diving medallist, after Sir Peter Heatly, who is now 90 and won the last of his five medals in Cardiff in 1958. Heatly watched his grandson James dive in the Royal Commonwealth Pool earlier this week. England's Hannah Starling (264.05) was seventh. Rebecca Gallantree and Alicia Blagg - the pair who combined for synchronised three-metres platform gold on Wednesday - scored 259.20 to place ninth and 257.50 for 10th, respectively. Struggle: Hannah Starling came in seventh place for England as she failed to get towards the podium . Reid's best dive was her third of five, a forward 1 1/2 somersault with two twists. Keeney was leading after three rounds, but false started with her third dive and was deducted two points from each award to fall to fifth, entering the final dive. Reid was one of those to benefit, climbing to silver medal position, but with her final dive she was unable to supplant Sheehan at the top of the rankings. Abel moved into pole position with four divers left, pushing Reid into third place, and Keeney knocked the Scot out of the medal positions. Reid was competing in front of Scotland's first minister Alex Salmond and rugby union great Gavin Hastings. She was unaware of being in medal contention and happy to achieve a personal best. 'I was in my little bubble,' she said. 'I had my headphones on full blast. I had Run the World by Beyonce - it's a must. 'Someone was telling me I was up and down that leaderboard like a yo-yo. I couldn't have told you.' Reid's fifth dive was 11th out of the 12 in the field, having saved a safe option. 'It's just the way my list works out that that's the easier dive, but it's quite a solid one. When I was feeling a bit nervous I relaxed into that one. 'Whereas maybe if it was a bit harder it might not have gone so well and I wouldn't have got as good a PB.'","Reid finished fifth in the women's one-metre springboard final in Edinburgh .

"Andrew Willis is prepared to be the least popular man in Glasgow by beating home favourite Michael Jamieson in the 200metres breaststroke at the Commonwealth Games. Willis and Jamieson, the Olympic silver medallist and one of the faces of Glasgow 2014, train together in Bath and are close friends. 'If it was going to be anyone I hope it's me,' Willis told Press Association Sport. Man with a plan: Andrew Willis wants to beat Michael Jamieson in his hometown at the Commonwealth Games . 'We got a slight taste of the welcome he'll get at the Duel in the Pool back in December. 'He's going to get a loud reception. I have to use that to my advantage and really just give it my all.' The pair's relationship is likely to be on good terms until they enter the call room - where swimmers wait in the final minutes before their events - when the serious business begins. Willis knows it will not be easy to beat Jamieson, who leads the world rankings this year with two minutes 07.79 seconds, set in the British Championships in the Tollcross pool which will be used for Glasgow 2014. Five of the top-10 200m breaststroke times this year have been set by Commonwealth swimmers, with Willis eighth in the rankings behind Scottish duo Jamieson and Ross Murdoch, Australia's Christian Sprenger and England team-mate Adam Peaty. Competition in the 200m breaststroke has long been strong, with Jamieson, Willis and the now-retired Kris Gilchrist all battling for British team places for some time. Willis believes the strength of domestic competition helps when it comes to major events. 'It's always tight to qualify for Games,' the 23-year-old added. Tables turned: Willis wants to use the raucuous welcome Jamieson, pictured, will receive to his advantage . 'It's all tight stuff, especially when it's two or three of you going through. 'It's quite nerve-racking at the trials. There's so much depth and that does help when you do qualify for the majors. 'It helps through the rounds, through the heats, through the semis, you're used to racing and having to get up to race every race.' Willis was fourth in Delhi, his first major multi-sport Games, but wants to do better four years on. He added: 'I want to be coming away with a medal. That was my first international in Delhi. I was chuffed with coming fourth. 'I've been to all the major Games now, multi-sports, worlds. I need to be stepping up and getting on the podium.' It remains to be seen if that will be above Jamieson, or to one side.Â .

"Flanker Maggie 'The Machine' Alphonsi hopes to play a major role in England's bid for Women's Rugby World Cup glory. England play Samoa on Friday in Marcoussis, Spain on August 5 before the duel with Canada on August 9. Alphonsi has received numerous personal awards in her distinguished career, which has seen her claim seven successive Six Nations titles, six in Grand Slams, but a World Cup honour has proved elusive. Ambitious: Maggie Alphonsi is aiming for the trophy when England's women begin their World Cup campaign . New Zealand have won the last three tournaments by beating England in the final, something England will hope to put right on August 17 at Jean Bouin Stadium in Paris. Alphonsi, who is playing in her third World Cup, said: 'I've been very fortunate to have got the accolades that I have and all the recognition, which is brilliant. 'But the real reason why I wanted to get into the sport and play for England was to be world champion. It would mean the world. 'That's one accolade I haven't got. That's what I want for the team, as well as an individual thing.""I want people to recognise us as the best team in the world.' The hurt of 2010 has driven Alphonsi and the other 11 survivors from the defeat in London on. 'Losing in that World Cup was horrendous,' added the flanker, who recalled a team meeting the following January when head coach Gary Street questioned whether his players were willing to commit to four more years. 'To face it again and say 'right, do you want to commit to another four years to get that medal?' Everyone said 'yes'. 'I remember it well. It was a hard time, but if anything it's been good for us the last four years because it's kept us going. More to come: Alphonsi, pictured here in action against Ireland during the Six Nations, will be competing in her third World Cup next month . 'It's like Olympic gold. It's one of the things that drives you to get up in the morning and work really hard and train hard.' Alphonsi . believes the World Cups have got bigger and better every edition since . 2002 and, coupled with sevens' inclusion in the Olympics, the sport is . only getting better. She is not yet ready to think about playing at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, with the World Cup the full focus. 'The priority right now is this World Cup and doing really well,' she added. 'All I can think about at the moment is this and once August 17 rolls around, after that I can decide what I want to do. 'I've been to one Sevens Rugby World Cup and it was absolutely amazing. 'To go to an Olympics would be anyone's dream. Who knows? There's a lot of good players coming through and I'm not getting any younger.' History: Alphonsi and England suffered defeat against New Zealand in the last World Cup final . Prop Rochelle 'Rocky' Clark is the most-capped player in the squad with 91 appearances. 'Short for Rochelle is Rocky and I got my first cap out in Canada where the Rockies are. It's quite apt really,' Clark said. Clark hopes for 'third time lucky' in 2014. 'We were really close in 2010 and it could've gone either way,' she added. 'That disappointment makes me even more hungry to win this one. I've got four years more experience to take into it.' Clark is often compared to Jason Leonard for her longevity. She added: 'The first goal is to win the World Cup, then the second goal will be to get 100 caps. When we come into next season and the Six Nations I'll think about that.'","England face Samoa in their opening World Cup game .

"Team Sky cyclist Jonathan Tiernan-Locke has requested a delay in the anti-doping hearing which will determine his fate, the United Kingdom Anti-doping Agency has announced. Tiernan-Locke, who won the 2012 Tour of Britain before joining Team Sky, vehemently denies any wrongdoing after the UCI last December opened disciplinary proceedings, to be carried out by UKAD, over alleged doping by the Devon rider. Discrepancies in the 29-year-old's biological passport data demonstrated an anti-doping violation, according to cycling's world governing body, and he was withdrawn from duties with Team Sky until a decision is made in the disciplinary process.

"The back page of the Liverpool Echo always plays to a theme when a big Champions League night comes around and today is no different. In bold, capital letters, above a picture of Steven Gerrard and Brendan Rodgers sitting side-by-side, runs a headline that sums up the mood of one-half of this city’s fans, as they prepare for the glitz and glamour of Real Madrid. ‘Bring on the Champions,’ it declares. So big is the game that the Liverpool players arrived at Anfield hours before the game. Raheem Sterling and captain Steven Gerrard were pictured arriving at the ground in their club tracksuits where they are expected to leave their cars and head to a nearby hotel for their pre-match meal and team meeting. Raheem Sterling and captain Steven Gerrard arrive at Anfield ahead of their Champions League group game with Real Madrid . Joe Allen arrives at Anfield in his club tracksuit along with Jordan Henderson as the pair get ready to face Real Madrid . Though Liverpool’s form this season has, at best, been erratic, all of what has gone before will be forgotten this evening in the build-up to kick-off. These, after all, are the occasions the club have built their reputation on, going head-to-head against the continent’s finest. It was a game of this magnitude, one that captures the focus of the football world, that Liverpool hoped they would get when their return to the Champions League was confirmed on April 20, with a 3-2 victory over Norwich City at Carrow Road. Given that triumph was in the midst of a charge for the Barclays Premier League, the significance of what Liverpool achieved on Easter Sunday was perhaps not appreciated at the time but, during the summer, as supporters began to look forward, realisation began to dawn. For five years between 2004-2009, when Rafa Benitez was in charge, Anfield staged some of the most dramatic nights in its long and fabled history, with each campaign seeming to throw up games that would be talked about for years to come. Those nights added to the stadium’s aura. Gerrard scored a famous late goal at Anfield in the 2004-05 season in the year that the Reds eventually won the competition . Jamie Carragher  celebrates with goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek as Liverpool beat Chelsea at Anfield in 2005 . They are easily recalled: Olympiacos, Juvenuts and Chelsea in 2004-05, the campaign which ended with Liverpool defying the odds against AC Milan in Istanbul; Barcelona and Chelsea (again) in May 2007; Inter Milan and Arsenal in 2008, Real Madrid in 2009. The deeper Liverpool got into the competition, the greater the intensity of their play became which added to the electricity in the stands, the atmosphere crackling beneath the floodlights. Tickets for the Kop became the hottest in town, as fans wanted to experience Anfield on a European night. ‘It is tough to explain what it is like here,’ says Alvaro Arbeloa, the Real Madrid defender who was once of Liverpool. ‘These big Champions League nights are special occasions and it is a special sound. It is a once in a lifetime experience, a special environment you must experience once in your career. Alvaro Arbeloa celebrates with Yossi Benayoun as Liverpool beat Besiktas at Anfield in 2007 . Kenny Dalglish battles for the ball with Viv Anderson as Liverpool played Nottingham Forest in the 1978 European Cup . ‘You put that to one side because it is an important game. It is not case of warning my team mates but I have told them of the tremendous atmosphere. The supporters here will drive them forward. It is a special game for Liverpool as they have been five years out of the Champions League. ‘They will put us under pressure. The Anfield atmosphere will be working against us. I know what they are capable of on a European night. I am expecting a battle. We need to be ready for a tough, tough game.’ Arbeloa knows that Madrid will not just be playing the 11 men Brendan Rodgers selects but also the 40,000-plus who are crammed into Anfield; it is a stadium that can leave a mark on visitors, so much so that a quote from the fabled Johan Cruyff has been printed on a wall by the main entrance. It is also on a wall in the press conference room at their Melwood training base. The famous Anfield Kop will have the flags and scarfs out as the fans get behind Brendan Rodgers' side against Real Madrid . VIDEO Liverpool host Real in European epic . ‘There’s not one club with an anthem like You’ll Never Walk Alone,’ said Cruyff. ‘There’s not one club in the world so united with the fans. I sat there watching the Liverpool fans and they sent shivers down my spine. A mass of 40,000 people became one force behind their team. ‘That’s something not many teams have. For that I admire Liverpool more than anything.’ It will be that way again tonight. Before Liverpool’s first game back in the Champions League last month Brendan Rodgers had two supporters, who travel around the world to watch Liverpool and run the local radio station Anfield FM, into his office at Melwood. During the course of their conversation, Rodgers was told that if he 'thought the atmosphere was good against Manchester City (last April), wait until you see what it is like against Real Madrid.’ The wait it almost over. Liverpool have fought hard to bring occasions like this back. The challenge is now to show that they can compete on this stage and ensure this is not simply a one-off. Anfield needs to crackle again. 1. Inter Milan 3-1 (European Cup semi-final, May 1965) - This was the standard-bearer, a night that showed what Liverpool could become. Liverpool had won the FA Cup a few days earlier and 28,000 were on the Kop 90 minutes before kick-off. The manner of the return defeat in Italy still rankles. 2. St Etienne 3-1 (European Cup quarter-final, March 1977) - The night when Liverpool’s quest to become champions of Europe suddenly became reality. Kevin Keegan, Ray Kennedy and ‘Super Sub’ David Fairclough scored the goals as Bob Paisley’s side were hauled over the line. 3. Auxerre 3-0 (UEFA Cup third round, November 1991) – You may wonder what this game is doing in the list but it was an extraordinary night, as Liverpool overhauled a two-goal first leg deficit thanks a Jan Molby penalty, Mike Marsh’s header and Mark Walters’ sliding late effort. 4. Olympiacos (Champions League group stage, December 2004) – ‘I don’t want to wake up in the UEFA Cup tomorrow morning,’ Steven Gerrard said on the day of the game. He didn’t thanks to an extraordinary comeback that featured goals from Florent Sinama-Pongolle, Neil Mellor and a wonder strike from the captain. 5. Chelsea 1-0 (Champions League semi-final, May 2005) – The next time Anfield will have an atmosphere of this intensity is when they are on the brink of winning the Barclays Premier League. The stadium shook, Chelsea froze and Luis Garcia’s controversial goal sent Liverpool to Istanbul.","Liverpool are preparing for the showpiece game of the group stages of the Champions League .

"Two-time Olympic champion Victoria Pendleton believes the controversy surrounding Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore is symptomatic of a 'ridiculous' wider marginalisation of women in sport. Cyclist Pendleton, who retired after winning gold at the London 2012 Olympics, believes Scudamore should have been fired for his part in emails which made derogatory comments about women. Scuadmore remains in his position after issuing an apology and the Premier League has declared the matter closed. Let off: Richard Scudamore escaped the axe for his sexist emails . Speaking out: Two-time Olympic champion Victoria Pendleton says Scudamore should have been sacked . The emails contained sexual innuendoes, and made jokes about 'female irrationality'. 'It's as disappointing as it is to be racist,' Pendleton, speaking at Halfords' Summer of Cycling launch in London, told Press Association Sport. 'I think if you make comments you should be fired or worse. Instantly. Atrocious. 'Someone of his position and reputation, if he has those thoughts they should only stay way, way, way within his own head. 'For him to express that in an email, he basically just stuck his foot right in, like a stupid fool. He lost a lot of credibility. Unfortunately I also understand that within sport it's male dominated. 'That's a sorry state of affairs. It seems archaic that in this day and age women's sport can be seen as something to fill in the gaps between the men's sport. It's ridiculous.' Asked how to resolve such an issue, Pendleton said: 'You fire them and you never, ever again re-employ them in a role of that stature, nature or importance. They're fired.' It has been suggested that women should be pro-actively promoted to senior positions to rectify the gender imbalance. Blast: Pendleton has branded Scudamore a 'stupid fool' for his comments . Pendleton added: 'It's a hard thing to do because those men are never going to employ women to replace them. 'It would be a step in the right direction, to create a more even sex workforce. 'It's been proven that diverse management groups are the most creative and successful. 'You can't have diversity if you only have men. Women bring a different aspect, a different angle to many scenarios and problem solving. 'I think it would be short-sighted and almost regress if you didn't have women involved. It's just ridiculous. 'More jobs for women. Do I have to say that? More votes for women, that's what it feels like. 'It feels stupid in this day and age. It's ridiculous. It's laughable.' Support: Pendleton believes women need to get behind other women . Women can make the difference themselves, according to Pendleton. She said: 'People ask me what will it take to change people's perception of women's road racing, or women's cycling or women's sport in general - and it would be women supporting women. 'If women became avid supporters of women's sport, across the board in any scenario, I think that would make a really big difference. 'And for women to have more managerial roles in running, organising and delivering sport, then that's when you'll suddenly start to get a bit of balance. It's a very long-term goal.' Pendleton has been a trailblazer for women's sport and in cycling, with the likes of Laura Trott, Dani King, Lizzie Armitstead and others benefiting from her profile. New era: Laura Trott has taken on the mantle in women's cycling . The Friends Life Women's Tour proved there is an appetite for women's sport in the UK.Pendleton, who is undertaking her personal training qualifications next week, added: 'It's really nice to see there's an opportunity for women to have a career in cycling, in the UK anyway. 'There were steps made in the right direction with the Women's Tour. It did get a bit of noise behind it. I'm hoping it's a positive experience. 'I heard the crowds were good and people were very surprised. That's a great thing. They got the support here in the UK. It's a starting point to build on.'","Two-time cycling champion brands Premier League chief a 'stupid fool'

"Fran Halsall is optimistic the future is bright for British swimming ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016. Britain's swimmers struggled in the pool at the London 2012 Olympics, winning three medals, with only Scotland's Michael Jamieson, with silver in the 200metres breaststroke, and the now-retired Rebecca Adlington, with bronze medals in the 400m and 800m freestyle, reaching the podium. The Commonwealth Games often sees new stars emerge and Halsall is confident of success for the home nations at Tollcross later this month. Hopeful: Fran Halsall wants British swimmers to inspire the next generation of talent . The goggles are on: Halsall will be swimming for England at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games . Eager: The veteran Halsall says 'it's great to be part of the Games and to swim for England' The 24-year-old from Southport, who will race for England in Glasgow, said: 'After London a lot of things changed, we had people coming in, people leave. 'It was a rebuilding year last year and now everything's quite settled and in place. We've got a great team around us. 'And everyone that's coming through, the younger swimmers, they're swimming really well. 'If we have a good Games here it will create a lot of momentum going into the next Olympics.' Liam Tancock, the most experienced member of the British team, returned to London's Aquatics Centre for the first time for this week's pre-Commonwealth Games holding camp. The 29-year-old backstroke swimmer from Exeter, who, like Halsall, is coached by James Gibson at Loughborough, said: 'A lot of people look back at London and see it as a failure. 'There's nothing but fond memories for me. This place is a very special place. Experience is key: Liam Tancock believes Britain has learned a lot since London 2012 . Making a splash: Tancock will also be competing for England at the Commonwealth Games . 'As a team we came away with a few medals, but we'd have definitely liked a few more. 'We converted heat swims into semi-final swims, semi-final swims into final swims. It's just that next stage. 'Hopefully in Rio we'll convert more finals swims into podium successes. I think that comes with experience. 'That's what we've been working on over the last few years and we'll continue to work on into Rio.' End of an era: Rebecca Adlington retired from swimming after winning bronze at the London Olympics . Many expected Halsall to reach the podium at London 2012 after medal success at Commonwealth, European and World Championships, plus a strong world ranking, but despite reaching four finals fifth was her best result, much to her disappointment. For me . personally I've re-evaluated everything that happened in London,' added . Halsall, who will compete in her third Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. At . first I was really emotional about it but I've tried to think . logically, take the emotion out of it and just see it as a race that . happened. I did my best and that was the result I got. 'I want to get better than that, I want to do better than that. I've reassessed how I lead-up to it, what I can do there, the actual race, how I can change there.' Halsall . will have five opportunities in Glasgow in the 50m and 100m freestyle, . 50m butterfly, 4x100m freestyle relay and 4x100m medley relay. I did five (events) in Delhi, so I've stuck to that programme,' Halsall added. 'I'm looking forward to seeing what I can do. It's a good marker, the Commonwealth Games, two years out from the Olympic Games. 'The Commonwealth is very strong in sprint freestyle. It's going to be hard, but I like a challenge. 'I . just want to work on the processes I've been doing in training the last . couple of years; there's a lot of things in my race that could be a lot . better.

"For all the goals Real Madrid have scored in La Liga this season they have also managed to concede nine times. That’s nine times more than Barcelona and a higher total than five other teams in Spain’s top flight. They face Liverpool without arguably their best defender, Sergio Ramos, so leaving Anfield with a clean sheet will depend largely on what kind of night Pepe has. The pantomime villain of Spanish football has had many ups as downs in his seven years at Madrid. He was good enough to be one of former coach Manuel Pellegrini’s favourites and the Manchester City manager wanted to sign him at the start of last season. Real Madrid centre back Pepe has been sent off five times during his time in the Spanish capital . Portugal international Pepe will be tasked with marking Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli . Pepe faced Liverpool, including former winger Ryan Babel, in the Champions League in 2009 . 1. 2007-08 - Real Madrid v Roma . 2. 2008-09 - Real Madrid V Getafe . 3. 2010-11 - Real Madrid v Espanyol . 4. 2010-11 - Real Madrid v Barcelona . 5. 2011-12 - Sevilla v Real Madrid . He was also bad enough for Jose Mourinho to relegate him to the bench during his last season at the club, as Raphael Varane emerged as the manager's first choice partner for Ramos. Pepe responded by publicly criticising Mourinho’s treatment of Iker Casillas, and his manager issued a withering comeback. 'Pepe’s problem has a name and that name is Varane,' Mourinho said. 'It’s not easy being a 31-year-old and being overtaken by a 19-year-old kid. But that’s the law of the jungle. Pepe was undroppable, but not any more.' Pepe had looked second best to Varane but they will play together with Ramos out injured. Even without Ramos’s exclusion, the Portugal defender would have started after becoming close to undroppable once again. His speed of recovery helps Madrid play a higher defensive line and his concentration levels are an asset alongside the occasionally renegade Ramos. He has also put his disciplinary problems behind him. France international Raphael Varane will partner Pepe at the heart of Real Madrid's defence . Barcelona fans refer to Portugal and Real Madrid centre back Pepe as the 'assassin' Pepe saw red for kicking Barcelona full back Dani Alves during a Champions League clash in 2011 . Pepe's usual centre back partner Sergio Ramos will miss Wednesday night's game due to a calf injury . Pepe received a 10-match ban for kicking Getafe's Javier Casquero in April 2009 . Jose Mourinho and Pepe did not see eye to eye during the Chelsea manager's time at Real . It’s been over five years since he kicked wildly at the head of Getafe’s Javier Casquero and received a 10-match ban. Saturday’s Clasico will no doubt bring out the worst in him as he tries to cope with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, but so far this season he has responded to becoming, at 33, the senior member of Madrid's back four. Barcelona fans still refer to him as ‘assassin’ but in many ways his reputation as a hatchet man has always been a little exaggerated. He has shocked the sensitive nature of some of La Liga’s more refined watchers but alongside the likes of Jose Camacho and Graeme Souness, who clashed in this fixture during the 1981 European Cup Final, he would be a long way down any 'hardman' pecking order. He will have to marshal Madrid’s defence at set-pieces. It’s been their weakness all season to the point where both Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo have been deployed in the six-yard box to compensate for a lack of height. Set-pieces aside, Wednesday's game ought to be more straightforward than the upcoming meeting with Barcelona. With Liverpool missing the two players who made them so difficult to contain last season, he is most likely to face Mario Balotelli — dubbed ‘the worst striker in Europe’s top leagues' by Marca this week. The label was more a comment on his poor goal return than his overall play but it has not gone unnoticed that the Italian has also faced Iker Casillas twice in international action and failed to score on either occasion. If Pepe comes out on top against both the former AC Milan striker and England’s Rickie Lambert then Madrid may just need Ronaldo to break his Anfield duck at the other end to take the three points.","Pepe will be tasked with trying to stop Liverpool's Mario Balotelli .

"A mix of Cristiano Ronaldo-inspired confidence and utmost respect for an opponent that has won five European Cups summed up the mood in Madrid as Carlo Ancelotti’s team left the Spanish capital for Liverpool on Tuesday morning. Most Real Madrid supporters are aware that Liverpool are not the attacking force they were last season without the injured Daniel Sturridge and the departed Luis Suarez. But Liverpool's European Cup haul means they have always been revered at the home of the ten-times trophy winners and ever since the days of Rafa Benitez’s Spanish Liverpool there has also be no shortage of affection towards them. Cristiano Ronaldo makes his way off Real Madrid's plane after arriving at Liverpool John Lennon Airport . Ronaldo lost only one game at Anfield during his time with United, but never scored . Madrid’s Diario AS newspaper dedicated a page to an interview with Alan Kennedy, who scored the only goal of the game when Liverpool beat Madrid in the final in Paris in 1981. And much was made elsewhere of the fact that Real also lost their other two encounters against Liverpool, 1-0 and 4-0 in 2009. Kennedy is asked at length about Bob Paisley who Real Madrid manager Ancelotti equalled last season when he won the European Cup for the third time. Portuguese superstar Ronaldo has scored 20 goals for both club and country already this season . Hernandez (left) and Ronaldo (right) share a joke as Real Madrid arrive at Madrid airport . Aside from recalling the wit of his former manager – telling his full-back ‘they shot the wrong Kennedy in 1963’ after one of his poorer performances, Kennedy paid tribute to both men saying. ‘There is only one Paisley but I like Ancelotti. He’s very astute, he knows how to manage a dressing room and I have a lot of admiration for him.' Any confidence Madrid have ahead of the tie is also tempered by the fact that not only have they never beaten Liverpool in European football they have also never scored against them. Yossi Benayoun gets up to score Liverpool's winner at the Bernabeu in 2009 . In the return leg Liverpool then battered Real Madrid 4-0 at Anfield; Steven Gerrard celebrates here . Ronaldo is averaging more than two goals a game in La Liga at the moment and is certainly on the kind of form to change that but traditionally he has his own problems when he goes to Anfield. Marca ran with the headline ‘The Anfield Curse’ on Monday and told readers that in five visits to Liverpool’s stadium Ronaldo had failed to score, registering only two goals against them at Old Trafford. The dark statistics cloud did have a silver lining however – Mario Balotelli has faced Iker Casillas twice and failed to score against him. For all of Liverpool's history one thing is certain – Ronaldo and Balotelli are both in frightening form but in very different senses.

"Cristiano Ronaldo will not be rested by Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti, despite wearing an ice pack on his troublesome left knee after being substituted in the 75th minute of Portugal’s defeat by France. Ronaldo will finish the season with an incredible 73 goals if he continues scoring at his current rate and Ancelotti seems determined to play him as often as possible. Ancelotti told Spanish radio station Cope: ‘It is not easy rotating Ronaldo. The statistics say that when he plays he nearly always scores. It is almost as though by selecting him the game starts at 1-0 in our favour.’ Cristiano Ronaldo will be played by Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti despite wearing an ice pack on his knee after being substituted in Portugal's friendly defeat to France last week . The Real Madrid superstar played 75 minutes of the friendly in Paris on Saturday before going off . Ronaldo has scored 13 goals in six games which is more than most other teams have managed in the whole of Europe. Only six European clubs have a better scoring average than Real Madrid’s No 7 with his 2.16 goals per game bettered only by his own club Real Madrid, Chelsea, Barcelona, Benfica, Marseille and Valencia according to figures published on Tuesday in Marca. The one-man team gave Real Madrid fans a fright at the weekend as he put a large ice-pack on his knee but under the orders of Portugal team doctor Juan Carlos Noronha the treatment was just standard precautionary protocol. The measure is designed to prevent inflammation of the left knee and ward off any reoccurrence of the tendinitis problems he suffered last season meaning he lost the Spanish Cup final. Ronaldo has been in sensational form this season, scoring 13 goals in six matches for Real Madrid . Ronaldo's scoring ratio of 2.16 goals per game is bettered only by just six clubs in Europe . Gareth Bale has also been less than 100 per cent on international duty. The Real Madrid winger was feeling his back after his country’s 0-0 draw at the weekend and was then kicked all around Cardiff City Stadium in a 2-1 win over Cyprus. But Ancelotti also sees Bale as fundamental in his plans this season. He wants the Real Madrid forward doing even more work in a Madrid engine room still struggling to come to terms with the departure of Xabi Alonso and Angel Di Maria. Ancelotti has admitted that to fit all his attacking players into the team the Welshman cannot play quite as high up the pitch as last season. He said: 'Bale comes back a little bit more than Ronaldo to make a four in midfield. He is in even better condition this year than he was at the same time last year.' Gareth Bale was on the receiving end of some heavy challenges in Wales' 2-1 win over Cyprus .","Carlo Ancelotti says Cristiano Ronaldo will continue to play for Real Madrid .

"Gareth Bale faces a race against time to prove his fitness for Real Madrid's trip to Liverpool on Wednesday night - and looks increasingly likely to miss out with a muscle strain. Bale sat out of his first league game of the season against Levante at the weekend and coach Carlo Ancelotti confirmed it was not part of his rotation policy. The player has a strain in the pyramidalis muscle where the thigh meets the buttock and looks extremely unlikely to start at Anfield.

Suarez admits in the interview he thought he had 'ruined his career' when his bite on Giorgio Chiellini earned him a four-month ban from all football activity. 'I thought that I had ruined my career,' he said. 'At the start I didn't want to speak to anyone, I hid away behind my family although later I thought about it, I said sorry and I felt relief as a result. 'When I got the call from my representative I couldn't believe the faith that Barcelona were showing in me in this moment after everything that had happened. 'When the talks began with Barcelona and when (his agent) Pere Guardiola phoned me to say that it was all done I started to cry due to the situation that I was in and for the support that Barcelona were offering me. Suarez (far right) has admitted he feared for his career after his bite on Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini . 'I had been worried that Barca would decide against it due to all the repercussions from the situation.' Suarez makes his debut on Saturday against Real Madrid, although he says he is not taking selection for granted and has been blown away by the level of his new team-mates. The former Liverpool striker said: 'If you are impressed by watching them on television then when you see them up close in training you are left even more impressed. Lionel Messi looked relaxed in Barca's training session as the team prepared to take on Ajax . The Argentina star has scored eight goals in the first 10 games of the season for Barcelona . Messi's last Champions League hat-trick was against Tuesday's opponents Ajax . Veteran midfielder Xavi has had a resurgence this season and scored on Saturday against Eibar . 'You see a team-mate with three players around him and he still makes the pass and you just think: 'how did he do that?' 'I don't want to tempt fate by imagining myself playing [against Real],' he added. 'It is not my style to tell the trainer to play me in the game. I wouldn't dream of saying to Luis Enrique that I want to play in the Bernabeu. If I don't play then I won't be angry, I want to help my team-mates and feel like a footballer again.'

"Chris Froome was already looking ahead to the battles to come after negotiating a memorable Grand Depart unscathed. The Team Sky leader was fifth overall entering Tuesday's 163.km fourth stage from Le Touquet-Paris-Plage to Lille. Froome finished Monday's Cambridge to London stage safely in the pack as Marcel Kittel (Giant-Shimano) continued his sprint supremacy on The Mall before the Tour peloton flew to France after a hugely successful Grand Depart in Yorkshire. Scroll down for video . London calling: Defending champion Froome (right centre) cycles past King's College on Monday . 'We can expect a day pretty similar to (Monday) - another case of just getting through it,' the defending champion said on teamsky.com . 'But on stage five we hit the cobbles and that's definitely going to be quite a shake-up. Literally.' The 155km route from Ypres to Arenberg Porte du Hinaut through the battlefields of northern France - marking the centenary of World War One - is one Froome has not been relishing. His chief lieutenant Richie Porte expects a different welcome for Team Sky on French soil after the British squad enjoyed partisan support on UK roads. 'The very vocal home support has been absolutely unbelievable,' the Australian said. 'I don't expect that in France. It's going to be a little more hostile there. Getting shirty: Froome signs a fan's t-shirt in Cambridge on Sunday . 'Yorkshire was probably something that us guys will never experience again but for a working day London was absolutely incredible too.' Team Sky principal Sir Dave Brailsford insisted his priority remains winning the Tour with a British rider after earlier stating his wish to help find a first French winner since 1985. Brailsford established Team Sky with the aim of producing a first British winner and has succeeded, with Sir Bradley Wiggins' 2012 triumph in the 99th edition followed last year by Froome. Now Brailsford has told French newspaper L'Equipe of his desire to give France a first winner since Bernard Hinault won the last of his five titles 29 years' ago. Guru: team Sky principal Sir Dave Brailsford talks to the media last week . Brailsford told L'Equipe: 'I would like to win with a French rider. I think it needs to happen. For the Tour, for France, for the French, for the sport, having a French winner would be massive.' Brailsford, who is rumoured to be targeting Frenchman Warren Barguil, is a fluent French speaker and was keen to satisfy a French audience craving for a successor to Hinault. However, speaking at Horse Guards Parade at the conclusion of the third stage, Brailsford compared the prospect of a French winner to Andy Murray's Wimbledon triumph of last summer. 'The comment was more about a national event, if it's won by the same nation's rider, what a fantastic thing that can be,' he said. 'We've seen it with Andy Murray. It would be an exciting thing to see.' Va va Froome: The Brit is applauded by his team-mates after cycling through the Channel Tunnel . There are just three Britons remaining in the field for the 101st Tour after Mark Cavendish's crash on day one in Harrogate. The 29-year-old will undergo shoulder surgery on Wednesday and faces around six weeks out after rupturing all ligaments around his acromioclavicular joint and a separated shoulder as he sought a first yellow jersey of his career. The Omega Pharma-QuickStep sprinter, who will now not be able to represent the Isle of Man at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, said: 'It's worse than I was hoping but immediately after the crash I knew something was really wrong. 'It is really painful, but at the moment all I can do is focus 100 per cent of my effort on my recovery to be able to get back racing for Omega Pharma-QuickStep as quickly as possible.'

Daniel Sturridge is still unavailable for selection, this time with a calf injury he sustained in training before he had returned to action from a previous thigh problem. And given the woeful form of striker Mario Balotelli, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is under pressure to look at other options up front. Raheem Sterling could play in a more advanced role or Fabio Borini or Rickie Lambert could play. Alberto Moreno should come back in for Jose Enrique at left back, but Mamadou Sakho is still missing from the squad through injury. Rodgers also has a decision to make over who starts at right back with Javier Manquillo pushing Glen Johnson for a starting spot. For Real Madrid, both forward Gareth Bale and defender Sergio Ramos miss out for Carlo Ancelotti's team.

"Luis Suarez began the final countdown to his long awaited debut for Barcelona by scoring twice in a specially-arranged friendly against an Indonesia Under 19 XI. A Barca B team XI won the game 6-0 with Suarez graciously giving up the chance to complete a hat-trick by allowing Maxi Rolon to take a late penalty. One month today he will face Real Madrid in the Bernabeu and in his first full 90 minutes since the World Cup he showed he is not far off full match fitness with an energetic display capped by a goal from his first chance. Luis Suarez started in attack for Barcelona B against Indonesia Under 19s as he looked to build on his form and fitness ahead of his return from suspension . Suarez is congratulated by his Barcelona B team-mates after scoring his side's second goal of the match . The £75million summer signing glided into the box before unleashing a left footed shot to score against Indonesia's Under 19 side . Suarez is unable to take part in La Liga matches until October 25 as a result of his ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup but can play in friendlies. Enrique said he wanted Suarez to take part in a Barcelona B match so he could improve his 'match rhythm' ahead of his return to the first team. Suarez and former Ajax team-mate Thomas Vermaelen warmed up on pitch number seven at their new side's Joan Gamper training complex ahead of their appearance for Barcelona B. The Indonesians, wearing all white, conceded inside the first few minutes when Vermaelen nodded home from close range to put his side in the lead. Suarez also managed to get himself on the scoresheet inside the first half. Barcelona's summer signing latched onto a pass from Croatian playmaker Alen Halilovic before beating the helpless Indonesian shot stopper. Barcelona B could have had a penalty when Suarez and Halilovic linked up superbly once again before the latter appeared to have been brought down by the Indonesian custodian. David Babunski put his side further in the lead when the Macedonian starlet struck from 20 yards in the 27th minute. Suarez tucks the ball away from inside the box after a brilliant pass by Alen Halilovic to score past the Indonesian goalkeeper . Barcelona duo Suarez and Vermaelen pose for a picture with the Indonesian Under 19 national team before the friendly encounter . The opening exchanges of the second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Barcelona camped in their opposition's half. Suarez and Halilovic both showed why they will play a big part in the first team by continuing to pepper Indonesia's goal. Vermaelen's successful first appearance for Barcelona came to an end in the 62nd minute when the Belgium international was replaced by Bicho. It did not take long for Bicho to make an impact on the game as his first touch saw him score his side's fourth as he played a shot underneath the legs of the onrushing keeper. Suarez added another soon after Bicho's strike when the Uruguayan, who was being cheered on by his family, curled the ball into the net. He had a chance to grab a hat-trick when he successfully appealed to the referee for a penalty. However he allowed his younger team-mate Rolon to score from the spot. Former Liverpool ace Suarez looked strong throughout the 90 minutes despite his recent lack of match practice since his last competitive appearance against Italy in Brazil. There was a pitch invasion at the end of the match from Suarez's little girl Delfina, who ran to congratulate her dad in the centre circle before the Indonesian team had their picture taken with the Barcelona No 7. Suarez took to Twitter after the match to say he was 'grateful' of having the chance of playing with Barcelona B and that he was preparing to support his team-mates in their La Liga encounter against Malaga.

"Spanish champions Atletico Madrid still owe £84m in unpaid tax according to the latest figures released by Spain’s football league (LFP). Clubs in Spain have worked hard at driving down their tax debt and Atletico Madrid are sticking to a repayment scheme that has seen the sum they owe halved in the last two years. But their debt remains at £84m and the total owed for Spain’s top two divisions is still a staggering £339m. Real Madrid and Barcelona, along with Osasuna and Athletic Bilbao, both enjoy a different tax status to the rest of the clubs in Spain and as part of that deal there is no public record of their fiscal situation though both big clubs are understood to be debt free. Atletico Madrid are still £84m in debt despite their La Liga triumph, according to latest LFP figures . Many clubs in Europe believe there has been various state assistance with Barcelona and Real Madrid . The figure from Atletico Madrid will upset many clubs in Europe who feel Spanish clubs have been propped up by various state assistance in recent years with Barca and Madrid’s tax status and a land deal between Madrid council and Real Madrid currently being investigated by the European Commission. Other clubs will see this as further evidence that La Liga continues to be ripe for asset stripping with Atletico Madrid’s need to sell players every summer not likely to be changing in the near future. The overall situation of clubs in Spain with those in the first division owing £237m and those in division two owing 178m goes a long way to explaining the exodus of talent from La Liga in recent seasons with clubs outside of the top two no longer able to hold on to their best players. Atletico have had to sell several key players every summer, including Diego Costa who joined Chelsea . Deportivo won La Liga in 2000 (Roy Makaay pictured) but are second in the table of debts . The LFP figures also show 13 clubs in the process of administration as they reduce their debts. Deportivo de la Coruña, who won the league in 2000, and the city of Barcelona’s second club, Espanyol, come in second and third in the league of shame. Deportivo, who are in administration, owe £50m and Espanyol owe £35m, while Madrid-based clubs Rayo Vallecano and Getafe come in fifth and seventh in the table with debts of £27m and £11m respectively. In a determined effort to drive down debt in Spain LFP president Javier Tebas has vowed to stop clubs with unsustainable debts competing in the league. Overall debt has been reduced from £475m euros to £379m in the last year although this LFP figure is disputed by Spain’s Inland Revenue who argue the figure remains closer to £445m.","Atletico Madrid still owe £84m in unpaid tax according to latest figures .

"Barcelona failed to get a single shot on target in the league for the first time since the beginning of the 2003/04 season. On the same day that Luis Suarez scored twice for a Barcelona B team XI, his club were reminded just how much they need the striker available for the first team as they failed to register a single shot on target in a tame goalless draw against Malaga. On a frustrating evening for the visitors Lionel Messi was grabbed by the throat and pushed to the ground by Weligton, only for the defender to be given a yellow card. 'I grabbed Messi's face because he called me a ""son of a b****',"" he claimed to reporters after the match. Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi was well marshalled by Malaga's resolute defensive unit .

Subs not used: Ter Stegen, Xavi, Mascherano, Roberto. Referee: Alejandro Hernandez . Attendance: 24,821 . Luis Enrique's side had to wait 15 minutes for their first real chance when Messi went close with a free-kick that sailed just over Kameni's bar. 'We tried to play our usual game but they were very tight defensively and we could find not way through,' said Andres Iniesta after a game in which Barca failed to trouble Malaga keeper Carlos Kameni. A minute later Jordi Alba crossed for Pedro to shoot just wide. Malaga were comfortable however and it was no surprise when the two teams went down the tunnel at half time still goalless. Messi had dropped deeper in the first half and just before the break he shuffled past three players before playing the ball out wide to Jordi Alba, but then failed to get on the end of Alba's over-hit cross. Barça's threat seemed to be coming only down the left as debutant Douglas played things far too safe down down the right. Playing instead of the rested Dani Alves he did not put a foot wrong defensively but so much more is asked of a Barcelona full-back and he was not offering it in the a very conservative first 45 minutes. Barca laboured at the start of the second half with Neymar getting on the end of a Rakitic cross but Malaga still coping well with the opposition's limited threat. A clumsy jump from Douglas on Amrabat had the referee pondering a penalty but Barcelona were given the benefit of the doubt. As his team continued to toil in vain Enrique made his first changes on the hour taking off the disappointing Neymar and the equally ineffective Pedro.

But at the other end Roberto Rosales flashed a shot just past Bravo's far post as Malaga grew in confidence with Liverpool loanee Luis Alberto on against his former club and forcing a free-kick from another poor Douglas challenge. He took the kick and forced a fine save from Bravo at his near post. Finally on 72 minutes Douglas was replaced by Adriano. Pique connected with a Rakitic corner but with his shoulder instead of his head and Kameni made the save – it seemed to sum up Barça's night. Messi was pushed to the ground by Weligton and should have been sent off for what was a hand to the Barcelona's No 10's throat and then face, but the referee showed only a yellow and Arambat so nearly stole all the points at the end for the home side.

"Real Madrid moved straight to the top of Group B with a win over woeful Basle and Cristiano Ronaldo moved to within three goals of Raul’s all-time Champions League scoring record. This was not Real Madrid rediscovering the swagger that saw them brush aside Bayern Munich in last season’s semi-final and beat Atletico Madrid 4-1 in the final but they still had far too much for last season’s Swiss Champions. They took the lead as early as the 14th minute when right-back Nacho made his first run into the Basle area and played the ball to James whose clever backheel allowed the full-back to continue his run and shoot at Tomas Vaclik in the Basle goal.

Subs: Vailati, Delgado, Gashi, Kakitani, Aliji, Embolo, Calla. Goal: Gonzalez 37 . Referee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia) Madrid were on top without being particularly convincing in those opening stages. Toni Kroos is learning on the job in Xabi Alonso’s defensive midfield position and he was guilty of giving the ball away twice in the first half in dangerous areas. Against a better team the slips would have cost Real dearly but Basle were weak in attack and leaky at the back. Their defence – marshaled by 36-year-old Walter Samuel who played briefly and unremarkably for Real Madrid ten years ago – looked vulnerable to every attack and soon Real had a second goal. Gareth Bale ran on to Luka Modric’s pass and scored past Vaclik. A minute later he turned provider as Cristiano Ronaldo moved to 68 Champions League goals – just three behind Raul’s all-time competition record. The goal flurry had been preceded by Karim Benzema running through in an offside position and missing his chance before a forgiving flag was raised – cue whistles and boos from supporters who were also vocal in their criticism of Iker Casillas. Benzema could have silenced the boos with a goal but instead shot straight at the keeper when played in by Ronaldo and looked on as James tapped in the rebound for goal number four. Casillas was being jeered and cheered in equal measure every time he took a goal-kick but the whistles intensified when he failed to keep out Derlis Gonzalez’ shot out just before half-time as Basle narrowed the margin.

Walter Samuel’s night ended ten minutes into the second half when he was taken off and Sergio Ramos was also withdrawn with Raphael Varane coming on. The Frenchman’s first contribution was to head a Basle through ball on to Gonzalez who should have made it 4-2.

It was then time for Benzema to exact some revenge on his critics rifling in the fifth off the underside of the cross bar before being substituted by Ancelotti – still whistled by some home supporters despite the strike. The 5-1 scoreline slightly flattered Madrid and Fabian Schar could have narrowed the margin when his shot came back off of Casillas’ left-hand post. Bale missed a chance to get his second when a shot from close range was palmed away by Vaclik.

"Cesc Fabregas has dubbed Eden Hazard Chelsea’s very own Lionel Messi and admitted leaving the real thing behind at Barcelona was tough. Speaking to Radio Cope ahead of Spain’s European Championship qualifier with Slovakia Fabregas said: 'Hazard has that incredible ability to unsettle the opposition. He is the link between midfield and attack for us; he is our Messi because he makes the difference.' It was Hazard who set Chelsea on their way to a comfortable win over Arsenal at the weekend winning and scoring the penalty.

Eden Hazard (above) is Chelsea's very own Lionel Messi, according to Blues midfielder Cesc Fabregas . Hazard celebrates scoring Chelsea's first goal of the game against Arsenal on Sunday . Fabregas was closer to Messi than any other player at Barcelona having been reunited with him on signing for the club from Arsenal. The two played together in Barcelona youth teams from the age of 13 until he left for North London aged 16. Fabregas admitted leaving Barcelona this time around was harder than the first time. He said: 'Leaving the second time was much worse. When you leave as a teenager you don’t even imagine being a first team player. Hazard can unsettle defences in a similar way to former Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi (right) 'I would still repeat the experience because it was a dream to play at the Camp Nou. Even though some people don’t want to accept it I left this time with five trophies.' Fabregas even admits the beginning of the end at Barca comes against Chelsea. He said: 'My first seven months were great. 'But after we were knocked out of the Champions League by Chelsea I began to be singled out for criticism. From then on I knew I could be whistled at games. But I coped with it.” Despite it being tough to leave Fabregas said Jose Mourinho made the switch as smooth as possible for him and hinted at two other clubs also being in the running for his signature other than former side Arsenal. Former Arsenal man Fabregas has settled into life quickly at Chelsea, bagging seven assists and one goal . He said: 'It was during the last season that the Chelsea option began to look like the best one for me. [Arsene] Wenger had my position well covered with [Mesut] Ozil, Santi [Cazorla] and [Jack] Wilshere. It was the position he needed least and so I chose Chelsea even though Arsenal had the first option. 'My first meeting with Mourinho was face to face. There was a lot of respect and he convinced me very quickly. We were very honest with each other that everything that had happened [between Barcelona and Real Madrid] was now in the past. 'My mind was made up talking to him. Of the three options I had in England I told him I that I had made my mind up.'

"The match-fixing investigations shaking Spanish football may extend to a match between Malaga and Elche last season involving now Manchester City keeper Willy Caballero. Caballero is in no way under suspicion and sources close to the investigation have even suggested he may have been one of the players who alerted the Spanish League to possible attempts to rig the game. Mid-table Malaga were beaten 1-0 by relegation-threatened Elche last April and the game is understood to be one of 13 matches being investigated by the Spanish league - who are desperate to clean up the game - although this has been denied by both clubs. Manchester City keeper Willy Caballero (right) played for Malaga against Elche last season, one of 13 La Liga matches being investigated for potential match-fixing, although he is under no suspicion himself . The Spanish state prosecutor has already interviewed 33 players and directors in connection with a 2011 fixture between Zaragoza and Levante. And last week Atletico Madrid’s captain Gabi, who was playing for Zaragoza at the time, told the state prosecutor: ‘I did what the club told me to do’ - in reference to an apparent order by then Zaragoza president Agapito Iglesias to give back, in cash, the sum of £67,000 (€85,000) that Agapito had deposited into the midfielder's account in the week leading up to the game. Agapito claims the money was a bonus to the players but Gabi’s statement to the authorities, which was that bonuses were never paid before matches. The state prosecutor is investigating claims that Zaragoza’s president deposited money into his own players' accounts then asked them to return it to him in cash. Levante were Zaragoza’s rivals on the last day of the 2010-2011 season. Zaragoza needed to win the game to stay up and Gabi scored both goals in the 2-1 win that secured safety. Gabi scored two goals during the game against Levante in 2011, which is now being investigated . Gabriel Fernandez 'Gabi' was questioned over match-fixing allegations dating back to 2011 . The allegations relate to the suggestion that Zaragoza players paid Levante players in cash to throw a match . Levante are also implicated in another suspicious result in the 2012-13 season. This time it was Deportivo who needed the points in a match at Levante’s Cuitat de Valencia stadium. Levante were 3-0 down at half-time and, in the dressing room during the break, midfielder Jose Barkero accused some of his team-mates of deliberately not trying. He pointed the finger at goalkeeper Gustavo Munua and defenders Sergio Ballesteros, Juanlu and Juanfran in a heated exchange that had to be calmed down by then Levante coach Juan Ignacio Martinez. Levante lost the game 4-0 and the following day Barkero apologised to his team-mates for the accusation and subsequently gave a press conference in which he said he regretted suggesting that they had deliberately lost the match. Then Malaga coach Bernd Schuster said his many of his side were 'unrecognisable' when they faced Elche . Authorities are planning to speak to players from that game, and the Malaga match involving Caballero is also under the spotlight. After that game, which was lost 1-0 to Elche, Bernd Schuster, the Malaga coach, said: 'I had various players out on the pitch who were completely unrecognisable. We were on the pitch in spirit only.' The Spanish league has set up a hotline for players to call when their integrity is threatened by the offer to throw matches and 13 games have so far been pinpointed as suspicious. Some of those identified are matches in which one side has nothing to play for and the other is fighting relegation. But in seven of the games, suspicious betting patterns have been identified as a possible motivation for the result being fixed. Having heard evidence from those involved in the match between Zaragoza and Levante, the public prosecutor must now decide if the case should go to trial. Both the then Zaragoza president Agapito, and all the players so far questioned, have denied any wrongdoing. Willy Caballero featured for Malaga against Elche but is not himself under suspicion of any wrong-doing .","La Liga authorities are investigating 13 incidents of potential match fixing .

"Basle will be very welcome visitors to the Santiago Bernabeu. They come fresh from a 3-1 defeat to Zurich Grasshoppers at the weekend, they have a new coach in Paulo Sousa who has not convinced supporters, and they have 36-year-old Walter Samuel holding their defence together. It should be a morale-boosting win for Real Madrid... and how they need it. The team that followed up winning last season’s competition by signing three of the stars of the World Cup are currently languishing in 13th place in La Liga having lost two of their opening three fixtures. Carlo Ancelotti has admitted there is an ‘attitude problem’ among his squad while the players believe the difficulties have been created by the sale of two of the team’s most important players - either way it’s a mess. Gareth Bale and his team-mates are busy preparing for Tuesday's Champions League clash against Basel . Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Real Madrid have only won one of their first three La Liga matches this season . Carlo Ancelotti could come under pressure at Real Madrid soon if results do not start to improve . Real Madrid star Bale helped his side to a Champions League win last season but was still targeted by fans . Real Madrid won the Champions League last season but a crisis is starting to brew in the Spanish capital . Supporters jeered Iker Casillas throughout the defeat to Atletico Madrid at the weekend and whistled the whole team off at the end of the game. Several autograph hunters tried to kick out at Gareth Bale’s car as he drove away from the club’s Valdebebas training ground without stopping for signings and photographs, and some of the club’s supporters even took to draping banners over various bridges on the city’s M30 ring road calling for the resignation of president Florentino Perez. It is Perez who makes the transfer-market decisions in Madrid and his tried and tested formula of signing the latest boy wonder of world football at whatever cost - financing such outlay through commercial deals and the sale of other players - is nothing new and was in evidence again this summer. Champions League winning coach Carlo Ancelotti was told Angel di Maria was going and that Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez would be incoming. At first Ancelotti, who after years at Milan under Silvio Berlusconi is a master of keeping a very hands-on president happy, did not fret. Kroos, Luka Modric and Xabi Alonso still made for solid midfield three. Iker Casillas has been the subject of booing by Real Madrid fans after the side's poor start to the season . Basle are managed by Paulo Sousa (right) and their defence is led by the 36-year-old Walter Samuel (left) Gareth Bale (left) could be shifted further back into midfield in order to accommodate all the attacking players . But then the club sanctioned Alonso’s move to Bayern Munich. Again Ancelotti kept his calm and moved on to plan C - using Sami Khedira alongside Modric and Kroos. But Khedira got injured and is out for a month so the Italian coach was on to plan D which, judging from defeats to Real Sociedad and Atletico, is not working too well. The president would like to see Kroos and Modric as a pair in midfield with Bale, James and Ronaldo behind Karim Benzema in attack but Ancelotti and his coaching staff see that option as offering Real Madrid’s full-backs, attacking by nature, little or no protection. Either Bale and Ronaldo would have to spend half the game tracking back, or the likes of Dani Carvajal, Marcelo and Fabio Coentrao would be left exposed. One-time Madrid sporting director Arrigo Sacchi says in the first galatico era between 2003 and 2006 he once asked Perez to give him his first XI. Owing to the abundance of attacking players the president had Zinedine Zidane at centre-back and David Beckham at right back. This is what Ancelotti must contend with. Isco (left), Javier Hernandez (centre) and Marcelo (right) train in Madrid ahead of the match with Basle . The Madrid players are preparing for their Champions League opener against Basle after a poor La Liga start . It has been suggested to the coach that he put Bale back in midfield to cover the loss of Di Maria. The logic behind the suggestion - understood to have come from on high - is that as a former full-back Bale would be able to do the defensive work that Di Maria used to do. Having scored the winning goal in the Spanish Cup final last season - running from the half-way line in the 87th minute - and then the goal that put Real Madrid in front in the Champions League final, not to mention 21 other goals and 20 assists, asking Bale to do more defensive work seems bizarre. But maybe no more bizarre than selling the team’s top assist provider Di Maria rather than pay him 4m euros a year more in wages. On Monday Ancelotti was saying the right things: he is happy with his squad and wouldn’t swap it for any other in Europe. Win on Tuesday against the Swiss and then beat Deportivo away at the weekend and Elche at home, then talk of crisis will subside. Any slips however, and with a visit to Villarreal in the league - where Madrid could only draw last season - and a trip to Bulgaria to play Ludogorets on the horizon, the question marks will soon go from centring on whether the coach is happy with his squad to whether his president is happy with Ancelotti.

United sit fourth in the table after an inconsistent start of three wins, two draws and two losses, but will be heartened by their last result - a 2-1 win over Everton at Old Trafford. And while Neville, who spent 19 years as a player at United, believes the future is bright for his old side, he feels the coming month will prove how good Van Gaal's fledgling side is compared with their rivals.

'I'm not dropping down there because I haven't been playing so it's for me to help out the Under 21s.' 'It's not just me - Calum Chambers and Berahino might have got a call-up. We're all happy to help. It's always been a privilege to play for my country, no matter what level it is and I will do it and do my best.' Shaw has been unavailable for the Under 21s in the past because of injuries but is looking forward to stepping up to help Southgate's young side in the matches with Croatia. 'I've been unlucky with the Under 21s as I've had a lot of injuries but I still feel I can go and help out. I'm really looking forward to it.' 'Of course, I always want to help out my country and I know there are few other lads who can also drop down as well that summer. Who knows yet? 'Obviously, I've had a little discussion about it with Gareth Southgate but nothing too big. I'm away with them for the next couple of weeks and can get to talk about it properly then (should England qualify)' The United youngster gave away a first half penalty for this foul on Everton's Tony Hibbert (right) Meanwhile, Shaw has thanked goalkeeper David de Gea for saving Leighton Baines' penalty in Manchester United's 2-1 win over Everton after the left back brought down Tony Hibbert in the area to give away a penalty. 'It was a great win. I'm not going to say the penalty was a bad decision but it was one I did not feel was right,' said Shaw. 'I thought I touched the ball and, if you look at the replay, I think you can see I do touch the ball. 'I'm devastated it was a penalty but all thanks to David De Gea. I did Tweet straight afterwards to thank him! He was world-class and made us get the three points. 'It was a good game overall but, at times, we need to keep possession as we've been giving it away too cheaply and it's costing goals from that. We know we can do much better than today. The main thing, overall, is the three points.'","Luke Shaw has revealed he will be fit to play for the England Under-21s .

"Chelsea will be refereed by Mike Dean for the first time since Jose Mourinho blasted him after a defeat by Sunderland. Dean will take charge of the Blues' testing trip to Manchester City, where they look to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League. But there will be no love lost between Mourinho and Dean after Chelsea's 2-1 loss at the tail end of last season.

Mourinho said aftet the April clash: ‘The first [point] is to congratulate my players. They did everything they could, playing from the first minute to the last seconds, and deserved that. Sometimes we praise the players when we win. I think it’s fair to praise my players after the defeat. ‘Secondly, congratulations to Sunderland.

"Xabi Alonso has completed a £5million move to Bayern Munich from Real Madrid. The former Liverpool midfielder had been linked with a move to Manchester United after five years at the Bernabeu, but will now link up with Spanish compatriot Pep Guardiola. The 32-year-old will provide cover for the German champions after injuries to Javi Martinez, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thiago Alcantara and will, bizarrely, wear the No 3 shirt. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Xabi Alonso in a swimming race with Daniel Carvajal . Confirmation: Xabi Alonso has joined Bayern Munich from Real Madrid in a £5m deal .

Real Madrid confirmed the move via an official club statement: ‘Real Madrid CF and Bayern Munich have reached an agreement for the transfer of the player Xabi Alonso. Xabi Alonso is the latest Spanish player to join Bayern's ranks since Pep Guardiola took over as manager. Javi Martinez was already at the club before Guardiola took over, but he has since brought in Thiago Alcantara, Juan Bernat, Pepe Reina and now Alonso. Guardiola has also surrounded himself with Spanish staff, such as aide Manel Estiarte, assistant coach Domenec Torrent, fitness coach Lorenzo Buenaventura and match analyst Carles Planchart. ‘The player will appear before the media on Friday at 11:00pm in the press room at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium, accompanied by the Director of Institutional Relations Club , Emilio Butragueno.’ The La Liga giants sanctioned Alonso's departure following the arrival of former Bayern midfielder Toni Kroos.Munich's sporting director Matthias Sammer believes Alonso will give Bayern new options, saying: 'If that will work, I would have a very good feeling for the club and the coach.

"It was almost the perfect start. A pinpoint cross from Raheem Sterling, movement to win a free header… and straight into Hugo Lloris’ arms. Again within the first 15 minutes, Mario Balotelli found himself with the goal at his mercy, but his heading was found wanting for a second time, the ball directed tamely wide. A dream debut duo it may not have been, but in those chances alone Balotelli showed he’s more than capable of fitting into Brendan Rodgers’ attack. VIDEO Scroll down to see Rodgers say it was first time Balotelli  ever marked from a corner . Early signs: Mario Balotelli (left) celebrates Steven Gerrard's penalty with the skipper and Daniel Sturridge . So close: Balotelli shoots at an open goal past Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris, but to no avail as the ball sails wide . Already, he showed he offers Liverpool a new dimension. The relationship between Liverpool’s front three of Balotelli, Sterling and Sturridge is in its infancy, but the plan is clear to see. Balotelli runs through the middle, holding the ball up and driving attacking moves forward, with the more nimble English duo dovetailing either side. The No 45 showed he is more than up to that challenge, with possibly his most impressive moment in the first half being holding off the not-inconsiderable Younes Kaboul just inside Liverpool’s half before sprinting past the Spurs defender with a trademark change of pace. It was a 20 seconds that typified his performance, with the end shot bobbling wide of a goal shorn of the onrushing Lloris. The stroke of half-time saw the striker in tune with Liverpool’s style yet again, working a training ground corner routine perfectly before lashing Steven Gerrard’s delivery over the bar. There were no histrionics, either, when Eric Dier unleashed a challenge best described as ‘lively’ after the Italian had chased a lost ball down on the flank. Down on his luck: Balotelli rues a missed chance but showed he is capable of enhancing Liverpool's system . Tireless: Balotelli jets through Tottenham's Christian Eriksen (left) and Eric Dier in an impressive display . Getting stuck in: Balotelli challenges Spurs midfielder Etienne Capoue as he showed off his physicality . After recovering from the sliding tackle, Balotelli made no mention of the Phil Dowd’s ludicrous decision not to award a free-kick. It’s early days but Rodgers will be hoping he keeps that cool head. Winning those headers and pulling defenders out of the way offers Rodgers a weapon he didn't have at his disposal last season. Luis Suarez was a tour de force of attacking prowess - and will be for Barcelona - but wasn't a target man in the same way Balotelli is. Suarez would interlink with Sturridge and Sterling to create last season's potent, free-flowing mix of piercing attack and speed. With Balotelli, none of the speed and threat is diminished, but it adds a real focal point, a solid presence in the middle of the attack for his English partners in crime to play off. Signing off: Balotelli came off for fellow new boy Lazar Markovic after the hour mark . Jack of all trades: Balotelli's heat map from his hour on the pitch shows him getting the ball in all areas . That's not to say the Italian's movement was static - far from it. His heat map from his hour on the pitch before being replaced by Lazar Markovic shows touches from all over the pitch. He can be a crucial component of the lightning-quick Liverpool, adding power, menace and thought to an attack admired by all last season. His holding up of the ball and early understanding with Sterling and Sturridge had all the hallmarks of being £16million well gambled. If only he'd bought his shooting boots.","Mario Balotelli made his debut for Liverpool in 3-0 win at Tottenham .

"Try finding Lionel Messi's top goals on YouTube and you'll understand how many there are. With so many to choose from, it's difficult to pinpoint just 10 after a decade of watching the Barcelona master at work. But we've done it and here, Sportsmail presents 10 of Messi's best-ever goals from his career at the Nou Camp. Lionel Messi scores against Granada in September and Sportsmail picks out the Barcelona forward's top goals . The 'Diego Maradona' goal (against Getafe, 2007) In 1986, a newspaper posed a question to Diego Maradona after he single-handedly cut through the England team to score one of the greatest-ever goals: 'What planet did you come from?' After Messi's similar goal in 2007 against Getafe, the question was repeated. Starting in his own half and taking on five players, including the goalkeeper, Messi scored a goal that deserves a place on the mantelpiece as Barcelona beat Getafe 5-2 in the Copa del Rey semi-final. Messi scores one of his greatest-ever goals against Getafe after taking on five players from his own half . That header (against Manchester United, 2009) Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United learned the hard way that, despite his height, you can't leave Messi unmarked in the box when the ball's in the air. Meeting a looping cross by Xavi in the 2009 Champions League final, 5ft 6½in Messi headed the ball beyond 6ft 5½in goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar from the most awkward of angles to complete the 2-0 victory. Messi met Xavi's cross to kill off the Champions League final against Manchester United in 2009 . Messi proved he could be just as deadly with his head as he is with his feet for Barcelona in the 2009 final . Messi (left) and Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta  celebrate with the Champions League trophy after the win . Sheer power (against Arsenal, 2010) Arsenal were leading 1-0 at the Nou Camp, thanks to a Nicklas Bendtner goal in the 19th minute. Barcelona needed inspiring and Messi, with four goals, did just that in this Champions League tie. It was the forward's equaliser that arguably stole the show when a fortunate one-two with Arsenal defender Mikael Silvestre allowed Messi to put his laces through the ball. Keeper Manuel Almunia could do nothing. Barcelona needed inspiring and Messi, with four goals, did just that in this Champions League showdown . On the chest (against Estudiantes, 2009) A fiercely-whipped cross found Messi who, instead of ducking to use his head, opted to go for the  chest against Estudiantes in 2009. It proved just as clinical as the ball sailed into the far-right corner beyond goalkeeper Damian Albil and won Barcelona the FIFA Club World Cup final in 2009. Barcelona's Messi opted to use his chest to win the FIFA Club World Cup final in 2009 against Estudiantes . The flick (against Deportivo, 2013) The most nonchalant goal you'll ever see. Technique, a cool head, pace, it had the lot. The Barcelona star starts with the ball outside the box and, after a one-two down the right-hand side, Messi cheekily flicks the ball over onrushing goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia. The nutmeg (against Sevilla, 2012) Messi loves a nutmeg almost as much as he loves a chip. Against Sevilla in 2012, he opted for both. The Barcelona forward was fed the ball on the edge of the box. He left Emir Spahic for dead, sliding the ball through the defender's legs, before sublimely chipping goalkeeper Andres Palop. Messi nutmegged Emir Spahic first before chipping goalkeeper Andres Palop to score for Barcelona . Messi's 10 years since making his Barcelona debut has been fantastic with plenty of records broken . The dancer (against Real Zaragoza, 2010) Real Zaragoza thought rugby tackling Messi might stop the forward. They soon found out that was wrong. As part of a hat-trick, Messi shakes off rough defending in the middle of Zaragoza's half before running at the back-line, turning those up against him inside out. He takes on four men - one of them twice, who is left in a spin - before drilling a low shot beyond goalkeeper Jimenez Gago Roberto. 'A one-man show,' the commentator says afterwards. Messi celebrates scoring against Real Zaragoza in 2010 - one of the Barcelona forward's many great goals . Real Zaragoza thought rugby tackling Messi might stop the forward but found it didn't work . The off-guard (against Atletico Madrid, 2012) Catching the goalkeeper off guard while he's organising his wall isn't always as easy as it looks, particularly from this angle against then-Atletico Madrid's Thibaut Courtois. Positioned on the left of the 18-yard box, Messi's curled shot somehow dips and lands in the far-right corner of the net. Afterwards, the commentator labels him a 'ball whisperer'. Hard to disagree. New Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao (left) during the 2012 match against Messi's Barcelona . The trickster (against Arsenal, 2011) Unfortunately for Arsenal, Messi seems to have a knack for scoring sensational goals against them. The Barca star finds himself through and Almunia narrows Messi's options by rushing forward, only for the Argentine to flick the ball over the goalkeeper before tapping it into the net. Whether he could do this on a cold, wet, windy Monday night at Stoke is another matter. Messi celebrates while Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and defender Gael Clichy looks dejected . A Great Escape (against Real Madrid, 2011) There can be no better game for Messi to exhibit his skills than in El Clasico. So, in 2011, the Barcelona forward decided to single-handedly double his team's lead in this Champions League semi-final at the Bernabeu.

'I get advice, but the final decision about my life is one I always take alone. I have long agonised about it. It was a very, very important decision for me. 'I'm 22-years-old.

"Loic Remy insists he can be fit to face Manchester United on Sunday despite limping out of Tuesday night's Champions League win against Maribor. Remy hurt his groin and was forced to come off after scoring the opening goal in a 6-0 win at Stamford Bridge which puts Chelsea in command at the top of Group G. It was a scare for manager Jose Mourinho ahead of the trip to Old Trafford because Diego Costa has missed the last two games with hamstring problems. Loic Remy leaves the field after pulling up with a groin injury after he opened the scoring at Stamford Bridge . Remy was replaced by Chelsea veteran Didier Drogba with only 15 minutes of the match played . Mourinho's post-match reaction was to rule Remy out for 'a couple of weeks' but the France striker will go for a scan today and refuses to give up on the idea of starting against United. 'I don't think it is too bad,' said Remy. 'I felt something in my groin. We will see with the scan. I really hope it's not too bad. Fortunately I stopped playing because I felt something.' The problem was evident before he scored but when he drove the ball into the net he winced and pulled up quickly. He was replaced by Didier Drogba two minutes later, with only 15 minutes gone. Remy fires Chelsea ahead in the 15th minute; the Blues would go on to hammer the Slovenians 6-0 . But the French striker is in visible discomfort after opening the scoring against Maribor . 'Even in my run I didn't feel comfortable,' said Remy. 'It was a bit stiff. That's why I prefer to come off. I have to care about myself and if I'm not feeling very good it's better to leave for another player who is 100 per cent. 'It's frustrating of course because I had a chance to play because Costa is injured but I am not afraid. I don't think it is really bad. We will check and I really hope to play again this weekend. 'It is a huge game. Every game is tough and especially this one because it is a big game against a good opponent. I will try to recover as quickly as possible.' Costa's prolific form has limited Remy to only three starts since his summer move from Queen's Park Rangers. 'For me, I have more motivation like that because I know I have to work more than the other players to have a chance to play,' said the 27-year-old France international. 'That's why I work hard every day at training to show the manager that I can play and score. Chelsea's star striker Diego Costa has missed the last two games with hamstring issues . 'When I came to Chelsea, I knew there was a team, so I couldn't come and play straight away. So I was waiting. This kind of situation can happen when someone is injured and you take his place. I was happy to score. 'Every game I play I want to score but I don't put stupid pressure on myself. I just want to give my best every game. Even if I am not scoring I want to give assist or help the team as much as possible with my runs. 'I don't put pressure but I know I have to score because Diego is a good striker and scoring a lot of goals so if I can help the team I do it. 'I think we can win the Champions League, but we will take game after game. We have enough quality to win it but the way is long and taking it game by game is better.' Veteran striker Drogba, who has started only once since his return in the summer, is Chelsea's only fully-fit centre forward. If Remy is ruled out by today's scan, Mourinho will have to start with the 36-year-old Ivorian at Manchester United or hope he can patch-up Costa to return despite his hamstring injuries. At the start of the week, the Chelsea manager claimed nine-goal Costa had 'very little' chance of being ready for Old Trafford and he was nowhere to be seen last night among the non-playing players who watched the game at Stamford Bridge.","Loic Remy opened the scoring in 6-0 hammering of Maribor but left the field soon after with a groin injury .

"He's been labelled the 'Mozart of football' by Radomir Antic, 'from another planet' by Arda Turan and the equivalent of 'having an orgasm' by Luis Figo. Lionel Messi is celebrating 10 years since his league debut for Barcelona - a decade which has seen the forward play 434 games for the La Liga giants. Here, Sportsmail narrows down 10 of the four-time Ballon d'Or winner's best games. Argentina forward Lionel Messi is celebrating a decade of football with La Liga giants Barcelona .

All in a day's work for the man who now calls Neymar his team-mate. Neymar (right) and Messi are team-mates at Barcelona now but went up against each other in 2011 . Barcelona 3-1 Manchester United (Champions League final, 2011) A Champions League final in England against Manchester United was potentially daunting - but not for Messi.

"Raheem Sterling appeared to hit back at those criticising him after England manager Roy Hodgson revealed the 19-year-old said he was too tired to start against Estonia. The Liverpool winger tweeted a cryptic response shortly after midnight on Monday: 'Now listening to... Excuse me for being human. On my way home.' The message came after Sterling retweeted those criticising his decision, including one post that suggested he should 'try getting up at 5am six days a week and putting in a proper shift'.

Sterling started on the bench for England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia before being brought on in the 64th minute, winning the free kick that led to Wayne Rooney's only goal. Sterling failed to complete training on Saturday night after only playing 45 minutes in Thursday's 5-0 win against San Marino at Wembley, and Adam Lallana started in his place on Sunday. After the 1-0 win, Hodgson said: 'People don't like it when you simplistically tell the truth. 'We were training at The Grove doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically. 'Just before we started, Raheem had done the warm up and he came to me and said, ""Look I really am feeling a bit tired, I'm not in my best form at the moment because I am feeling a bit tired"". 'So I said the best thing is Adam Lallana starts the game and you rest and I have got you to bring on from the bench, simple as that. 'As you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he isn't suffering from anything.' Hodgson also claimed Liverpool's poor start to the new Premier League season could be behind Sterling's decision to pull out of the starting line-up in Tallinn. The England substitutes watch on as 19-year-old Sterling (second right) was rested from the starting line-up . Sterling's Liverpool team-mate Adam Lallana started in his place after the 19-year-old complained of tiredness . 'There is an awful lot going on in his head,' the England manager added. 'Perhaps it's quite simply the season hasn't started quite as well for Liverpool as they wanted. 'He's a player who's always in the focus and spotlight for England and Liverpool, maybe that's had some effect. But I don't know, it's a theory. 'In mitigation of a young player, when you break into a team like Liverpool and you have a fantastic season, then you go to the World Cup and you do well and people regard you as one of the few who lived up to his reputation. 'Then you come back and you're still only 19 years of age, there are a lot of other things that play a part it people's make up. It isn't quite as simple as the training you're doing maybe taking some juice from your legs.'

Hodgson insists the Liverpool youngster played at his best in the A. Le Coq Arena, and says bringing Sterling on in place of Jordan Henderson should be no cause for concern. 'Don't forget it was two days after quite a difficult game against San Marino. It was two days after the game,' Hodgson continued. 'It was fatigue he hadn't managed to shake off after the San Marino game, it was no more complicated than that. Is it common? I don't really know. 'At international level, when there are so many good players trying to get their hands on the shirt, I don't think you should keep hold of it when maybe you are feeling yourself that you're not at your best.

"One hundred years since Brazil and Argentina first locked horns, it wasn't Lionel Messi, Neymar or one of the modern household names on offer that separated the South American rivals. Instead, it was a 29-year-old striker by the name of Diego Tardelli who settled the so-called 'friendly' in Brazil's favour to salvage some much-needed pride after a dismal  2014 World Cup on home soil. Two shots and two goals were enough to justify him sporting the No 9 shirt on Saturday in Beijing's first Superclasico de las Americas, but who exactly is the Atletico Mineiro man? Sportsmail examine the Brazilian who remains adamant the 2018 World Cup is his next target. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from Brazil manager Dunga .

Perhaps we should have expected nothing less from a man named after Argentina's 1986  World Cup winner Diego Maradona and Italy's 1982 winner Marco Tardelli. The 29-year-old's last name is, in fact, Martins. But the veteran has gone by Tardelli ever since emerging from the youth ranks at Sao Paulo  a decade ago  at the age of 19. There, he was sent on loan to Spain's Real Betis, Brazil's Sao Caetano and Holland's PSV to cut his teeth. The Eredivisie club are notorious for giving the original Ronaldo, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Arjen Robben early chances  in their prestigious careers, and Tardelli was hungry for the same in Eindhoven. But it has been Mineiro that truly backed the striker in his two stints at the Brazilian  club. Tardelli, after an initial spell between 2009 and 2011, remains at the Estadio Independencia in Belo Horizonte and has nine goals in 19 appearances so far this year in Brasileirao. He is named after Argentina's 1986 World Cup winner Diego Maradona and Italy's 1982 winner Marco Tardelli . Maradona (left) holds the World Cup trophy in 1986 while Tardelli (right) celebrates his win for Italy in 1982 . Tardelli may not be the youngest in the Brazil starting XI, but he  wasn't the oldest! 31 - Jefferson (GK) 30 - Miranda . 29 - Tardelli, Elias, Filipe Luis . 27 - Luiz Gustavo, David Luiz . 26 - Willian . 23 - Oscar, Danilo . 22 - Neymar . A little old, isn't he? Tardelli, born in 1985, was surrounded by youth in Brazil's attack on Saturday. To name a few, Neymar is 22, Oscar, 23 and Willian, 26. Nevertheless, Tardelli, a fast-paced attacker by nature, was gifted his seventh international cap by Dunga after a strong start to the season and made it count with his first goals in the yellow of Brazil. The man born in Santa Barbara d'Oeste received his first call up in 2009 from Dunga, but never managed to get further than finding himself on the back-up list for Brazil at the 2010 World Cup. And last year he revealed his disappointment in not being given a chance by Luiz Felipe Scolari. Now, though, Dunga is back at the helm and seems willing to back the veteran. Tardelli, substituted in the 83rd minute for 2002 World Cup-winner Kaka,  repaid his new manager's faith in Beijing. Tardelli was substituted in the 83rd minute for 2002 World Cup-winner Kaka, a man three years his senior .

So, what's he worth? When Tardelli returned to Atletico Mineiro from a fairly successful spell at Al-Gharafa in Qatar, the Brazilian club's president Alexandre Kalil announced it cost about £4.1million. In fact, it was his own mum, Ivania, who revealed the transfer on Twitter, writing: 'I'm very happy! My son is coming back to Galo (Atletico Mineiro's nickname). Thanks, Lord!' Tardelli's stock has slightly dropped in value as his career has developed, but he looked as clinical as any other  on Saturday with two well-taken goals against  Lionel Messi and Co of Argentina. The first, a volley that found the far corner beyond frustrated goalkeeper Sergio Romero after sloppy Argentinian defending. The second, a typical goal poacher's header. Tardelli scored two decent goals - the first a volley to the far corner and the second a quick-reaction header . Tardelli's heat map in Sportsmail's Match Zone shows the striker got about but wasn't always in the box . So, 2018 World Cup... 'It's a unique feeling,' Tardelli reportedly said after netting his brace. 'Scoring my first goal for Brazil, and against who? Against Argentina. Then I even got my second. 'My goal is to play World Cup 2018. I need to enjoy the moment now. I want to celebrate with my family, with my wife.' Tardelli will be 33 when the next World Cup in Russia rolls around. Though arguably be too old to beat others to a call-up, the striker refuses to give up on what he sees as his ultimate reward. Brazil manager Dunga gave Tardelli his first international call-up in 2009 and still has faith in the 29-year-old .","Diego Tardelli scored two goals for Brazil as they beat Argentina 2-0 .

As the Premier League elite soak up the viewing figures, fans of Burnley, Hull and West Brom have been dealt a particularly bad hand. They are the only clubs to be snubbed by BT Sport and Sky Sports, closely followed  by Aston Villa and Crystal Palace with one game apiece. Chelsea, current favourites to win the Premier League ahead of reigning champions Manchester City, find themselves joint top with Manchester United and, slightly surprisingly, Newcastle. Jose Mourinho - never one to shy away from the spotlight - appears to have gotten the better of rival manager Manuel Pellegrini. The 'Special One' and his side verse Newcastle, Stoke, West Ham, Southampton and Tottenham in their five TV fixtures. City, on the other hand, find themselves on the box just three times when they face Everton, Crystal Palace and Sunderland. That won't help season ticket holders, however, given all those matches are at the Etihad. Arsene Wenger and Brendan Rodgers have fared better than Pellegrini, too. The managers of Arsenal and Liverpool have four live matches apiece, including against each other at Anfield on Sky Sports on December 21. In the red half of Manchester, though, manager Louis van Gaal best get used to Sky Sports and BT Sport cameras being present to capture - and scrutinise - his every move. United have a hectic Christmas period on the box, taking on Southampton, Newcastle, Tottenham, Stoke and, surely the pick of the lot, Liverpool at Old Trafford on December 14, won by Sky Sports. It seems the most undesirable fixtures fall on a Monday, though, with Van Gaal among the victims. Louis van Gaal's Manchester United find themselves on TV five times during the Christmas period .

As for Newcastle, under-fire manager Alan Pardew may not welcome the additional pressure, particularly in games against Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and an Everton side looking to recapture their Champions League-chasing form of last season. Schadenfreude? Perhaps, but the Tyne-Wear derby against Sunderland on a dominant day for Sky Sports on December 21 means late Christmas shopping should be avoided. BT Sport look to have won the bragging rights for Boxing Day and New Year's Day, however. They snag the majority of games on both prime days, including a tasty Manchester United vs Newcastle clash and a London derby between Tottenham and Chelsea.

"Roberto Mancini has pledged his support to Galatasaray ahead of the Turkish club's Champions League match against Arsenal. The 49-year-old left Galatasaray as manager in June with rumours of the club's transfer policy and budget behind the departure, but it seems the former Manchester City boss bares no grudge. Mancini, donning a bright orange jacket with the club’s crest on, posted a ‘good luck’ snap on Instagram and wrote: 'Come on Galatasaray.' Roberto Mancini posted an image in a Galatasaray jacket with a message of support for his former club .

Prandelli will look to take advantage of a weakened Arsenal team, though, as Wenger remains without key midfielders Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey due to injury. However, Jack Wilshere has been deemed fit enough to be named in the squad after picking up a late injury in the north London derby against Tottenham, and is a chance to start.

"Liverpool stars arrived to training on Thursday morning looking glum following their humbling Champions League defeat at the hands of Spanish giants Real Madrid - with Mario Balotelli catching the eye once more as he pulled up in his flash red £240,000 Ferrari. A Karim Benzema brace and a brilliant strike from Cristiano Ronaldo condemned the Reds to defeat at Anfield, leaving Brendan Rodgers' men third in Group B. Captain Steven Gerrard led the Liverpool contingent arriving at the Melwood training complex for a warm-down session, followed by Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and the rest of the squad.

But it is Balotelli who will once more catch the headlines after appearing in his brash supercar - before training with a red-and-white striped scarf on. The Italian caused controversy on Wednesday night when he agreed to swap shirts with Madrid defender Pepe before heading down the tunnel at half-time without registering a shot of note during the first 45 minutes. Balotelli was then hauled off by  Rodgers at half-time and replaced by Adam Lallana - and his manager has insisted he will 'deal' with the striker for exchanging jerseys so early. Interestingly, Balotelli's team-mate Henderson has insisted the squad have not discussed the shirt-swapping incident because nobody in the dressing room knew it had happened. 'It hasn't been discussed in the dressing room,' he explained. Jordan Williams (right) passes the ball away from the reaches of Brad Smith during Liverpool's training session on Thursday .

It's certainly the first I've heard of it.' Meanwhile, Henderson has also admitted the Reds were taught a footballing lesson by the reigning European champions. The England midfielder said: 'This Real Madrid team is top class with the best players in the world but that's who you want to be playing against and testing yourself, always trying to improve ourselves as a team. 'That's where we want to get to - to be a top team like Madrid playing at the highest level and I think we can do that.

'Hopefully we can keep improving and work on the things we didn't do quite so well.' Liverpool travel to the Bernabeu in two weeks' time to face Ronaldo and Co once more but they will go there aiming for victory insists Henderson. He continued: 'We always believe we can get a result, no matter who we play,' he said. 'We just need to concentrate on winning our games. We've got Madrid away next and we need to go there and hopefully get something. 'After that we then just have to win our games.'
