A girl who cannot feel pain has enabled scientists to find a gene mutation that influences pain perception . A girl who cannot feel pain has enabled scientists to find a gene mutation that influences how we feel pain. The German researchers hope that the finding may lead to the creation of new painkillers that work by blocking pain signals. The scientists compared the gene sequence of the girl, who has congenital insensitivity to pain, with the gene sequences of her parents who do not have the condition. The girl's condition means that she can feel touch but not pain and, as a result, is liable to burn herself - because she cannot tell if something is too hot to touch - and suffer frequent injuries. This comparison allowed Dr Ingo Kurth, at Jena University Hospital in Germany, to find a mutation in the SCN11A gene, New Scientist reports. The gene influences the creation of channels on pain-sensing neurones. Ions pass along these channels causing the development of electrical nerve impulses that go to the brain. These nerve impulses cause the brain to register pain. The mutation in the girl’s SCN11A gene means that the charge neurones need to transmit an electrical impulse cannot build up. As a result, the body cannot detect pain. To ensure that their suspicions were correct, the researchers bred mice with the mutated SCN11A gene and then tested their ability to detect pain. They found that these animals were much more likely to suffer injuries than ordinary mice are, suggesting that they are also unable to feel pain. These mice were also much slower to react to pain when their tails were exposed to a hot light. The scientists have already begun work on a drug that blocks the SCN11A channel. The German researchers hope that the finding may lead to the creation of new painkillers that work by blocking pain signals . ‘This is a cracking paper, and great science,’ Professor Geoffrey Woods of the University of Cambridge told New Scientist. ‘It's completely unexpected and not what people had been looking for,’ he added. Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) is a rare condition that means a person cannot feel pain. People with the condition are able to feel touch but cannot feel pain. They often suffer unnoticed infections and injuries which can become serious as they are not treated. The condition can be caused by a gene mutation but it can also be caused by the brain over-producing endorphins.

A jockey has had a near miraculous recovery thanks to a pioneering new treatment to regrow a finger that his horse bit off as he fed the animal a treat. Paul Halpern, 33, turned up at the Delray Beach, South Florida practice of Dr Eugenio Rodriguez with a third of his right index finger in a zip-lock bag. His insurance company wanted medics to amputate the rest of the digit, but Dr Rodriguez instead tested out a unique new procedure to heal it without surgery. This image shows Paul Halpern's regrown finger after he was treated with a new procedure to restore it . Using a pig bladder the doctor made a template of the severed portion of Mr Halpern's finger then attached it to the stump that remained. Astoundingly, the finger's cells, bone, soft tissue and even nail regrew into the mould. Mr Halpern, from New Jersey, had been feeding a treat to his prized horse when he reached a little too far between the animals chomping jaws, costing him the top third of his index finger. 'One of the guys that worked with me reached his hand in the horse’s mouth, took the fingertip out, and I jumped in the car, grabbed the rest of my finger wondering what we should do,' he told CBS Miami. Although he stopped to put the severed digit on an ice lolly in an effort to preserve it, emergency room medics told Mr Halpern there was no way to re-attach it. Mr Halpern's mangled finger before the treatment: The procedure involved applying powder made from pulverised pig bladder to the unhealed stump every day then wrapping it in a protective sheet soaked in saline . It was then that he heard of 52-year-old Dr Rodriguez, of the Deerfield Beach Outpatient Surgical . Center, who had a new way to restore the mangled extremity. The . procedure, known as an implantation of a xenograph, involves applying . powder made from pulverised pig bladder to the unhealed stump every day . then wrapping it in a protective sheet soaked in saline. 'It . stimulates your body to attract your stem cells and then the stem cells . start producing the tissue that is missing,' Dr Rodriguez told NBC Miami. Despite . the complex science behind it, the treatment was so easy and painless that Mr Halpern was able to do it at home over the course of two months. 'I . couldn't notice at the time but once everything had healed and the . fingernail grew back, which is quite miraculous, and the skin healed . over, then you really notice,' the patient said. Pioneer: Mr Halpern, 33, left, a jockey from New Jersey, traveled to the south Florida practice of Puertan Rican Dr Rodriguez, right, after emergency room medics told him there was no way to reattach the severed digit . Dr Rodriguez, who believes he is the first medic in south Florida to prescribe the treatment, added: 'It’s very interesting to see a patient heal. That’s my passion, wound healing. It is fascinating to have the new results.' The results could pave the way to using the treatment for worse injuries. Mr Halpern added: 'I’m really grateful. I think it’s fantastic. I think in the future there’s going to be other uses for it but it wasn’t a life threatening injury to me it was something that was an accident.'","Paul Halpern's finger grew back after pig bladder powder was applied .

A 15-year-old Louisiana boy was arrested this week for using an iPhone app to jokingly shoot up his high school. Using ‘The Real Strike,’ a simulated first person shooter overlaid onto video of the app user’s choice, the student uploaded the fake shooting of H.L Bourgeois High School, in Gray, LA., to YouTube and was arrested on terror charges soon after. Authorities allege they were thwarting a potential threat to the school despite the student’s parents insisting their son has no access to guns. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Police became aware of the video after another parent saw it on YouTube. The boy did admit to police that he was frustrated about being bullied, the station reported, but insisted he never meant to actually shoot or harm anyone.

An Ohio man who confessed in an online . video to causing a fatal wrong-way crash after a night of heavy drinking today changed his plea to guilty. Matthew Cordle, 22, pleaded guilty . to aggravated vehicular homicide and operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol at a hearing in . Franklin County Court. He faces two to eight-and-a-half years in prison at sentencing, . which was set for October 10. Cordle, who lives in Powell, a Columbus . suburb, said little during Wednesday's hearing, simply replying, 'Yes, . your honor', as the judge asked him a series of questions. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Guilty: Attorney Martin Midian, left, talks with Matthew Cordle in the Franklin County Common Pleas Court in Columbus, Ohio, on Wednesday, September 18, 2013 . Hearing: Judge David W. Fais questions Matthew Cordle, not seen, about the night of the fatal accident when Vincent Canzani was killed in a DUI crash . Victim: Vincent Canzani was 61 at the time of . his death (pictured recently at right) and previously served in the Navy . (seen in his uniform in an undated photo at left) He wanted to plead guilty to make good . on his pledge to accept responsibility for the crash, according to his . lawyers. They did not ask for him to be released on bond before . sentencing, and a judge revoked his bond. In a three-and-a-half minute video posted two weeks . ago, Cordle admitted he killed a man from another Columbus suburb and . said he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive that night. 'My name is Matthew Cordle, and on June . 22, 2013, I hit and killed Vincent Canzani,' he says somberly. 'This . video will act as my confession.' He had entered a preliminary plea of not . guilty last week in a procedural move, but the judge didn't allow . Cordle to go ahead with it, saying his lawyers didn't follow court . procedures for first appearances. Franklin County Judge Julie Lynch also . alleged the attorneys balked at coming before her because she wouldn't . promise a specific sentence, something they deny. Lynch took Cordle's not guilty plea in a . brief hearing the next day and set a combined $255,000 bond. Cordle . appeared Wednesday before veteran Franklin County Judge David Fais. After last week's hearing, Canzani's . daughter told a TV station the attention the case has gotten is forcing . her to relive what happened. Angela Canzani told WCMH-TV in Columbus . that people seem to forget a person died. Video confession: The 3.5 minute video starts out with his face blurred and voice altered as he explains how he was driving drunk when he killed someone . Moment of truth: Matthew Cordle identifies himself when the effects are taken away and says that he will plead guilty to any charges that he faces stemming from the June 22 accident . His pledge: Cordle, 22, said that he was fully aware of the legal implications of making the video . The video was filmed on September 3, and the . version posted on YouTube has been viewed more than 2 million times. It begins with Cordle's face blurred as he describes how he has . struggled with depression and was simply trying to have a good time with . friends going 'from bar to bar' the night of the accident. He then . describes how he ended up driving into oncoming traffic on Interstate . 670. Cordle's face becomes clear as he reveals his name and confesses to . killing Canzani. He ends the video by pleading with viewers not to drink and drive. 'I can't bring Mr. Canzani back, and I can't erase what I've . done, but you can still be saved. Your victims can still be saved,' Cordle . says. Then a message appears on the darkened screen: 'Make the promise to never . drink and drive.' The victim's daughter spoke out against Cordle, saying that the reason he made the confession publicly was so that he could try to get a lighter prison sentence. Angela Canzani believes Matthew Cordle, who says he hit and killed Vincent Canzani, 61, on June 22 in, was ‘totally misleading’ with his confession because he was already suspected of the crime. ‘There was a traffic cam. There was a . third car involved,’ Canzani told NBC News. ‘So people are kind of . looking at this like he’s just coming out of nowhere…Like he’s some hero . or something.’ But on Friday, the . ex-wife of Mr Canzini told MailOnline she 'applauded' the decision of . Cordle - who now faces criminal charges brought by the county prosecutor. Cordle . says in the video he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive his . truck home after 'drinking heavily' and hit the other car, killing Mr . Canzani, of suburban Columbus. An obituary for Mr Canzani says that he served as a missile technician for a submarine from 1980 to 1986. Since leaving the Navy, he flourished . as 'a gifted photographer' and was survived by two daughters and three . great grandchildren. The video was released in conjunction with a not-for-profit start up called Because I Said I Would, which is focused around having individuals make commitments to themselves and their goals using index cards. A fan: Cleveland kidnap victim Gina DeJesus posed for a picture with the group's shirt after the founder met with her mother . Its website says that it aims to become a 'a social movement dedicated to bettering humanity through the power of a promise'. The organization was founded by Alex Sheen who was inspired by his father, who died of lung cancer last September. At his father's funeral, they handed out promise cards in tribute to how his father always kept his promises. In a message that was posted on the group's website when the confession video was published, Mr Sheen says that Mr Cordle was the one to reach out to him via Facebook message about the hit-and-run. 'After getting to know Matt, I can say with confidence that he truly regrets his decision that night. He describes the guilt he has as “insurmountable,”' Mr Sheen wrote in the post. 'Against all legal advice, Matthew decided to make this video and release it prior to any charges being filed against him. His goal is to raise awareness about the terrible consequences that drunk driving can have on innocent people.' Cordle's confession is not the only high-profile action the group has been involved with. After the three young women were . discovered in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home, Mr Sheen was moved to . launch a ten-day walking campaign across the state in their honor. Movement: The group's founder, Alex Sheen (seen closest to the camera) was inspired to go on a 10-day state-wide walk to raise awareness for sexual abuse victims after DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight were found .

He said that he lives six miles away from the now-razed 'House of Horrors' and was moved by the girls' perseverance. He used the walk as a way to raise awareness about sexual assault, and at the end, he was greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother.

'He kissed me on the head before he left,' she said. 'That was just the craziest . thing. Like, you just did that and you’re going to act like this is a . tender moment?' He then demanded she give him the $22 in her purse and skulked off into the night. When Batts was arrested he allegedly told police he approached her because 'he was bored'.

'It's just the most powerless thing ever': As Batts forced Miss Walker inside the vehicle and raped her she thought of reaching for the pepper spray in her handbag. But she couldn't move . At the time of the assault, Batts was already on bail for aggravated robbery and attempted rape in 2001. And before the weekend was through, police claim, he would attack and rob three more women in the carparks of three nearby hospitals. He has pleaded not guilty and awaits hearings on all of the charges having been transferred to a mental health clinic to determine if he is capable of standing trial. In the aftermath of the attack, Miss Walker became unrecognisable to herself. She became too terrified to go outside and became a recluse, imprisoned by her own fear. She says she stopped dressing up or wearing make up because, thereafter, she simply 'didn't care' about her appearance. But now the law graduate says she has turned a corner after a year of therapy to help handle her anxiety and gradually return to a normal life. Fighting back: Miss Walker, a law graduate, has now become an advocate for rape victims and is soon to train as a lawyer to 'put the needs of victims first' in a country where, she says, rape is an 'epidemic' Trying to help others: Miss Walker says that, while she may never 'recover' from the ordeal, she is on the way to creating 'a new normal' and wants to share her experience with others 'less lucky' than her . 'I do not remember who I was before the rape,' she said. 'I do not remember who that girl was.'

The eldest suspect Galileo Mondol, 17, was held pending a hearing to determine whether he is a danger to the public. Mondol and two 16-year-olds attacked the freshman and attempted to rape the others on August 25 in a cabin at Camp Lenox in Otis, a prosecutor said in court on Tuesday. Arraigned: Galileo Mondol, 17, of Somerville, Massachusetts, stands with his attorney William A. Korman, right, at Central Berkshire District Court today . Violent: Mondol and two 16-year-olds attacked the freshman and attempted to rape the others on August 25 in a cabin at Camp Lenox in Otis, a prosecutor said on Tuesday . Mondol was not involved at first but joined in, Berkshire Assistant District Attorney Rachel Eramo said. 'I want to have a crack at that,' Mondol is reported to have said, according to Eramo. The three defendants then tried to convince the accusers not to report the attack, she said. Mondol pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated rape of a child, assault on a child with intent to commit rape, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, indecent assault and witness intimidation on Tuesday. His dangerousness hearing was scheduled for Friday. The two 16-year-olds, whose names were not released because of their age, were to be arraigned in juvenile court on similar charges.

Acknowledging that the student groups practiced blatant discrimination, University President Judy Bonner ordered the school's 18 all-white sororities to reopen recruitment, which ended in August, and begin accepting new members. 'While we will not tell any group who they must [accept], the University of Alabama will not tolerate discrimination of any kind,' Bonner said in a video statement posted to the university's website.

Bonner's order comes after the university's student newspaper, The Crimson White, reported last week that all-white sororities had blocked chapters from adding two black students as new members in August.

Several hundred students marched at the university on Wednesday in protest of the discrimination. The marchers began the demonstration near the university library and ended up gathering on the steps of the administration building, where Bonner's office is located.

The Baltimore school’s cheerleading squad has been suspended for a recent hazing incident that the school has not yet disclosed. An investigation into the matter has been completed, but an appeal is still on-going, Gay Pinder, media relations, told MailOnline. The university first learned of the allegations Aug. 6. A total of 10 incoming freshman co-eds were hazed, Ms Pinder told MailOnline, adding that they went unharmed. No title defense: Despite an automatic place in the next cheer championships, in 2014, it appears unlikely the team will defend its title . The team has been suspended for the entire 2013-2014 academic year, according to Ms. Pinder. First enacted while the university looked into the allegations, the punishment stood after the investigation was completed. The suspension was first reported by the university’s student newspaper The Torchlight. ‘Towson has a policy of no hazing and we do take that very seriously, said Ms. Pinder, ‘we have high expectations of our students and expect them to treat each other with the utmost respect.’ The school has not yet released the details surrounding exactly how the students were hazed, and Ms Pinder declined to provide those details to MailOnline.

It is not clear if this is the first incident of hazing involving the cheer team, according to Ms Pinder.While sports teams have usually been in the hazing spotlight, pep squads have been outed as hazers as well. A drum major at Florida A&M University died after a 2011 hazing incident during which he was beaten by several members of the school band. ‘I have never heard of a whole team getting suspended,’ Jim Lord, executive director of the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators told the Baltimore Sun. ‘That is pretty rare, maybe unheard of,’ he added. In April, Towson’s cheerleaders placed first in the All-Girl Division I section of the National Cheerleaders Association's Collegiate Cheerleading Championship. Their win proffered them an automatic spot in the 2014 competition, one they look unlikely to attend.","10 incoming freshman co-eds were hazed but suffered no harm .

"By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED: . 11:01 EST, 18 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:34 EST, 19 September 2013 . France has banned children’s beauty contests in an attempt to prevent the ‘hyper-sexualisation’ of youngsters. A new law enacted on Tuesday night prevents anyone under the age of 16 from being judged on their physical appearance. It follows concerns expressed all over the world, including Britain where pageants are still legal, about girls being forced to grow up too fast. Concern: French senator Chantal Jouanno (right) was concerned about a Vogue magazine shoot in 2010 featuring provocative photographs of 10-year-old Thylane Loubry Blondeau (left) Now anyone caught organising a beauty competition for children in France faces up to two years in prison and fines equivalent of around 25,000 pounds. The new law is part of an equality bill introduced by  women’s minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, and now passed by the Paris Senate. French senator Chantal Jouanno, author of a report called ‘Against Hyper-Sexualisation: A New Fight For Equality’ proposed an amendment to Vallaud-Belkacem’s bill, calling for the end of children’s contests. It was passed by 196 votes to 146 against.  ‘Let’s not let our daughters think from such a young age that they will be judged according to their appearance,’ said Ms Jouanno. ‘Let’s not let commercial interest impact on social interest.’ There is a long tradition of young girls in France taking part in beauty pageants, which are usually called ‘Mini Miss’ competitions, with children and young teenagers  sometimes wearing make-up and high heels. Many believe they are harmless fun, however, and there was fierce opposition to Ms Jouanno’s amendment. She also wanted to bring in tough new regulations concerning child models, but these were rejected by the Senate. Ms Jouanno was particularly concerned about a Vogue magazine shoot in 2010 featuring provocative photographs of a 10-year-old French girl. The child, Thylane Loubry Blondeau, and two others wore make-up, tight dresses, high heels and designer jewellery. Vogue defended the images, saying they merely portrayed the desire of young girls  to dress like their mothers. While pageants have traditionally been a purely American phenomenon, with competitions across the States regularly filmed for downmarket reality shows such as Toddlers And Tiaras, they are becoming increasingly common in Britain. The trend has attracted criticism from parenting groups and children's charities about the sexualisation of children. The director of children's charity Kidscape, Claude Knights, warned recently: 'These children are so young, it's impossible for them to be giving their consent to wearing swimwear and pseudo-evening dresses, as well as fake eyelashes and spray tans.'","New law prevents anyone under the age of 16 from being judged on their physical appearance .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:36 EST, 20 September 2013 . A Florida woman known as 'hiccup girl' who is accused of masterminding a mugging that ended in murder told her mother from a police cell that she 'set it all up', a court has heard. Jennifer Mee, 22, allegedly lured Wall-Mart worker Shannon Griffin to an abandoned home under the pretense of selling him marijuana in October of 2010. Once there, two of Mee's friends robbed him at gunpoint - but the victim struggled and was shot four times. Mee, who found international fame in 2007 after developing a case of hiccups that lasted for five straight weeks, was charged with first-degree murder despite not pulling the trigger. She denies the charge. Under Florida law, someone who participates in a robbery that leads to a death can still be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Scroll down for videos . Trial: Defendant Jennifer Mee, pictured on Wednesday, reacts to testimony during her murder trial after she was deemed fit to stand . Hiccups: Mee, 22, found fame in 2007 as a teen because of her uncontrollable hiccupping . And today a court heard a recording of the phone conversation she had with her mother hours after her arrest. 'I didn't kill nobody,' Mee said. '…I . set everything up. It all went wrong, Mom. It [expletive] just went . downhill after everything happened, Mom.' On Wednesday, Mee's attorney told the . court her client was a schizophrenic. The judge then ordered Mee to . undergo psychological evaluation. It was later determined Mee is . competent to stand trial. Assistant State Attorney Christopher LaBruzzo admitted Mee wasn't the one who aimed the gun at Shannon Griffin in his opening address, but he said she was still guilty of first-degree murder because 'she set everything up.' He told the jury the then-19-year-old used a social networking site through a cell phone to contact Griffin and offer to sell him marijuana but it was all a con. 'There was, in fact, no marijuana to be sold. In fact, instead of marijuana they had a loaded .38-special handgun with six shots in it,' LaBruzzo said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. He explained that the two men she lived with robbed the 22-year-old Griffin before they struggled over the gun and 'shot him... four times in the chest and they left him for death in a dark alleyway.' The victim's wallet, keys were later found at Mee's apartment and her fingerprints were discovered on Griffin's driver's license, LaBruzzo said. Mee's lawyer, John Trevena, used his opening statements to claim that Mee wasn't even at the home when Griffin was fatally shot. Crime scene: Kurt Bradshaw, St. Petersburg Police officer, shows the jury a photograph of the crime scene during Jennifer Mee trial on Wednesday, September 18, 2013 . 'She is not at that scene but they want you to convict her of murder in the first-degree based on their theory that Ms Mee was setting up a marijuana deal that somehow went bad,' he told the jurors. Trevena suggested Mee couldn't have been behind the disturbing plot because she didn't even own a cell phone, and therefore couldn't have planned the drug deal with the young man. Also on Wednesday, Kurt Bradshaw, an officer with the St. Petersburg Police Department, showed the jury a photograph of the crime scene. A handgun and a pair of shoes can be seen on a sidewalk near a white fence. The jury was selected on Tuesday in the murder trial of the woman who appeared on several national television programs as a teen because of her out-of-control hiccuping. Judge Nancy Moate Ley told potential jurors in a Pinellas County courtroom that the trial would probably wrap up by the end of the week. Miss Mee is one of three people accused in the 2010 killing of Walmart employee Shannon Griffin Jr during a burglary gone awry in St. Petersburg. Back in court: Jennifer Mee holds her head after she looked at family members, as jury selection begins her murder trial Tuesday . Defense: Mee talks with her attorney Bryant Camareno at the Pinellas County Justice Center in Clearwater, Fla. Bleak prospects: Mee, 22, faces a life in prison if convicted in the 2010 murder of a Walmart employee . Relapse: Mee's lawyer said she has experienced periodic bouts of hiccups while in jail, and she is being treated with a drug called thorazine . Judge Moate Ley said in court Tuesday . that the prosecution and defense will have to choose a dozen jurors from . a pool of about 70, The Tampa Tribune reported. Two prospective members of the panel were excused . after explaining that they would not be able to be impartial. Two . other would-be jurors were also dismissed: one of them because Judge . Moate Ley had presided over her husband's divorce case, and the other . because she had to take care of her ailing mother. The . case has attracted widespread attention because Mee had gained . notoriety in 2007 when she had a case of hiccups that wouldn't stop. Videos . of her hiccuping up to 50 times a minute gained her national attention, . as did her attempts to quell the problem. She tried home remedies and . consulted medical specialists, a hypnotist and an acupuncturist, until . the hiccups finally stopped on their own. Just over two weeks ago, Mee's . co-defendant Laron Raiford, 23, was sentenced to life in prison after . being convicted of first-degree murder. Mr Raiford was the first of the three suspects to go to trial. If convicted of murder, Mee could face a life sentence. At . issue is whether Mee was a bystander or the person who planned the . robbery — prosecutors say she played an active role in planning the . robbery, which lead to Griffin's death. Under . Florida law, a person can be convicted of murder if he or she committed . a serious felony crime — such as robbery — and someone was killed as a . result. Trevena, . Mee's attorney, said his client suffered from Tourette's Syndrome, a . neurological disorder that can cause involuntary movements and speech . problems. Charged: Jennifer Mee, 22, is accused of luring Shannon Griffin (right) into a robbery in 2010, which ended in him being shot dead . Co-defendants: Mee's then-boyfriend Lamont Newton, right, is still awaiting trial, while his friend Laron Raiford, left, was sentenced to life in prison August 30 . He said that the hiccups were one symptom of Tourette's and said Tuesday that he will mention that during the trial. 'It . won't be used as a direct cause for what occurred but it might help . explain her errors in judgment and her often thoughtless response to law . enforcement,' said Trevena, who said Mee did not participate in . the robbery. Trevena said Mee has been in jail pending trial since her October 2010 arrest — much of that time in isolation because detention deputies say she is a high profile inmate. Mee has experienced periodic bouts of hiccups while in jail, said Trevena, and she is being treated with a drug called thorazine. 'It controls the hiccups,' he said. During a tearful prison interview on . the Today show in 2011, then-19-year-old Mee blamed her short-lived fame . for taking her down 'the path of the devil' and drawing her into bad . company. In the spotlight: Jennifer Mee first appeared on television as 'hiccup girl' when she was 15 (left), and she was even invited on the Today show (right) When . Mee was 15 years old, she became known as 'hiccup girl' when she began . hiccuping 50 times a minute. Her condition left doctors baffled and . earned her international publicity. Three . years later, she appeared in the news again - this time charged with . first-degree felony murder after police claimed she acted as bait to . lure Shannon Griffin, 22, into a robbery. Mee . is not accused of firing the gun, but under Florida law a defendant can . be charged with murder if they willingly take part in a felony which . then leads to someone's death. She has been held in Pinellas County jail ever since she was charged. Talking from the prison, she told NBC's Amy Robach in 2011 she cannot bear to . think about the possibility she could spend the rest of her life behind . bars. Fifteen minutes of fame: Mee had gained notoriety in 2007 when she had a case of hiccups that wouldn't stop . Downward spiral: Mee is accused of using a social networking site to lure the 22-year-old victim to an empty house where he was robbed and killed . She said: 'I’m scared. I want to go home; I can tell you that. My . sisters are growing up, my mom is missing me' The teenager said at the time she thinks about Mr Griffin's death every day. Prosecutors claim Mee plotted with her boyfriend, . Lamont Newton, and his friend, Laron Raiford, to rob Mr Griffin. Newton is still awaiting trial for first degree murder. She is . accused of using a social networking site to lure the 22-year-old on October 23, 2010, to . a dark alley in St Petersburg, where the two men robbed then shot him, getting away with $50. Initially Mee told police the shooting happened because Raiford found out Mr Griffin had been romantically involved with his girlfriend in the past. But later she changed her story and allegedly confessed she lured Mr Griffin to his death. Defense strategy: Mee's lawyer said his client had suffered from Tourette's syndrome and didn't know what she was doing . Blame game: Mee contented that her short-lived fame led her astray and drew her into bad company . Mee left home at 17, two years after she became known as 'hiccup . girl'. She claims her short-lived celebrity 'went to her head' and made . her go off the rails. Months of incessant hiccups left her temporarily unable to attend school as she disrupted other students. She tried home remedies and consulted medical specialists, a hypnotist, a . chiropractor, and an acupuncturist, until the hiccups finally just . stopped on their own a few weeks later. Her lawyer, Trevena, said: 'If you really believe her story, she’s really not guilty of anything except poor judgement of who she associated with.'","Jennifer Mee, 22, is charged with murder in 2010 killing of Shannon Griffin .

Royal connections: Alexander Gilkes and his wife, fashion designer Misha Nonoo on their wedding day in Venice in August 2012 . Alexander’s links to the Royals go back to his school days at Eton. His . older brother Charlie is a firm friend of Prince William and dated the . Duchess of Cambridge’s sister Pippa after they were both students at . Edinburgh Univeristy. Charlie, . who founded London nightspots Maggies and Kitts, was even spotted on . board a barge, the Spirit of Chartwell, alongside the Middletons during the Thames Diamond Jubilee . Pageant to celebrate the Queen’s Jubilee in 2012. And Eugenie, alongside her older sister Beatrice were in attendance at Alexander and Misha's wedding last year, a three-day affair that saw the couple get hitched at the Forte di Sant’Andrea, a 16th-century island fort that had once guarded Venice and had before never been used for a private event - for which they had to obtain permission from the mayor of Venice. Also in attendance were James Middleton, Kate and Pippa’s younger brother, while guests including bride’s cousin Houda Nonoo, the Bahraini ambassador to the U.S, multi-millionaire banking scion Matthew Mellon and Helen Rockefeller were treated to a performance by singer Lana Del Ray. Good friends: Pippa Middleton and Alexander Gilkes leave Soho House in New York last September. Pippa attended Alexander's wedding to designer Misha Nonoo in Venice . Sharing a smile: Pippa Middleton and Alexander Gilkes in New York last summer . Former flames: Pippa Middleton and ex-boyfriend- and close friend of Prince William - Charlie Gilkes - leave The End of Summer Ball, Berkeley Square, London, in September 2008. Charlie's brother Alexander has now given Princess Eugenie a job . In fact, Alexander remains so close to the Royals that he was spotted out with Pippa Middleton, 30, during her visit to Manhattan last summer. The couple were seen leaving Soho House - while Pippa was clad in a bright red dress designed by Mishal Nonoo. And while it's as yet unclear where Eugenie will be living in New York, there's more than enough room at the Gilkes' new pad. Last month, they bought a sprawling Greenwich Village condo formerly owned by Nate Burkus, a frequent guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show until he got his own talk show - now axed. The couple splashed out $4.95million on the 3,000 square feet pad that's spread out over two floors - and also features 1,000 square feet of outdoor private deck space. Dashing: Princess Eugenie is dating Jack Brooksbank. The couple are seen together at the Masterpiece Midsummer Party in aid of Marie Curie in London in July . Connected: Princess Eugenie will be working for Alexander Gilkes, who went to school with Prince William, and whose brother dated Pippa Middleton . Friends in high places: Charlie Gilkes (far left) joins former flame Pippa Middleton and her family on board a barge during the Diamond Jubilee Thames River Pageant in June 2012 . Having a laugh: Charlies Gilkes with Carole and Michael Middleton, former girlfriend Pippa Middleton and her brother James Middleton on board the Spirit of Chartwell . The Daiy Mail was the first to report Eugenie's move to the States in June. And although she will have to leave behind her Stowe-educated boyfriend Jack Brooksbank, who works in the gastro-pub trade, the two plan to commute whenever possible. ‘Since leaving university Eugenie has been committed to working in the arts world and has done some internships but is now set to take on a permanent role at graduate level,’ a friend of the Duchess of York told the Mail's Richard Kay. Eugenie got a degree in Art History and English Literature at Newcastle University and will work in New York before returning to London to help set up Paddle 8 in the UK. She has already done a stint at auction house Christie’s, where her cousin Viscount Linley is chairman. She . has also worked at the Royal Collection in Buckingham Palace, where she . won praise after queuing and joining fellow workers in the canteen . there. The move is significant for it comes in the wake of plans inspired by Prince Charles to slim down the number of front-rank working royals, which would almost certainly exclude Eugenie and her sister Princess Beatrice. Following the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son, Prince George, Eugenie has now slipped down the line of succession from six to seven. The Firm: Princess Eugenie joins her father, the Duke of York, the Duchess of Cambridge, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry on the balcony at Buckingham Palace during the annual Trooping the Colour Ceremony on June 15, 2013 in London . Siblings: Princess Eugenie and her older sister Princess Beatrice enjoy Derby Day at the Derby Festival in Epsom, Surrey, in June . Status-driven Andrew has always . insisted that as the only two ‘blood’ princesses, his daughters should . be a central part of a working Royal Family. But while devoted to the Queen, Eugenie is a modern young woman who wants to make her way in the world. ‘She is determined to be a working woman with a full-time job,’ according to her mother's friend. A spokeswoman for Paddle 8, whose backers include art world luminaries such as Damien Hirst and Jay Jopling, said there were 'no updates at the moment.'

British explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes is to to lead the first team on foot across the Antarctic during the southern winter, he revealed today. The 68-year-old will brave temperatures of minus 50C (minus 58F) during the expedition next year when his group will make the trip called the Coldest Journey On Earth. In some places temperatures are expected to be as low as -90C. The team will carry out readings and measurements for scientists, . providing data on marine life, oceanography and meteorology. Scroll down to hear from Sir Ranulph . Trimphant: Sir Ranulph Fiennes reached the summit of Everest in 2009 on his third attempt at conquering the Himalayan giant. Now he is attempting to break more records with a six-month expedition across Antarctica . On ice: In the 2009 television series Top Dogs: Adventures In War, Sea And Ice, Ranulph Fiennes (right) travelled with Robin Knox-Johnston and John Simpson across the frozen wastes of the Canadian Arctic . 'There is a huge, blank knowledge of the winter of Antarctica, what is happening to Antarctica during a period when the scientists can't normally get out there,' Sir Ranulph told BBC Breakfast. 'Our caboose will be bristling with scientific instruments, for Nasa, for the European Space Agency.' The explorer is hoping to raise 10 . million US dollars (£6.17 million) for Seeing Is Believing, a charitable . initiative to tackle avoidable blindness around the world. Sir Ranulph has broken several records and led many expeditions to remote regions. He was described by Guinness World Records in 1984 as 'the world's greatest living explorer'. The greatest: Ranulph Fiennes pictured in 1961, left, before starting his career as an explorer, and, right, in 1993 returning haggard from the trip where he became one of the first men to walk unaided across Antarctica . Endurance: Sir Ranulph (left) pulls a sled across the frozen Canadian wastes in 2009. He is the oldest explorer to have climbed Everest as well as completing a long list of startling achievements . He is famous for taking part in the first successful circumnavigation via both the geographical poles, completed with Charles Burton in 1982. Fiennes also achieved a world first in 1992-1993 by completing the first unsupported crossing of the Antarctic Continent with Mike Stroud in what was the longest unsupported polar journey in history. He also successfully reached the summit . of Mount Everest in 2009 at the age of 65, becoming the oldest Briton to . achieve this feat - despite despite having a heart condition, a fear of . heights, and a few missing fingertips after frostbite attacked his . fingers so badly he performed a DIY amputation in his garden shed.

A ship will drop the team off on the Pacific coast of the continent, where they will set off over the ice shelf when the equinox arrives on 21 March 2013. Sir Ranulph will then ascend 10,000ft (3,000m) on to the inland plateau, and head onwards to the South Pole. It will be hundreds of miles before the team drops 11,000ft back on to the ice shelf. After covering around 2,000 miles (3,200km) in total their journey will end at the Ross Sea. While Sir Ranulph and a skiing partner will lead on foot, the BBC revealed they will be followed by two bulldozers dragging industrial sledges. Inside three containers on the sledges will be the team's living quarters, supplies, and a science laboratory. Dragged behind this will be the fuel they need. Making it alive across one of the most inhospitable terrains in the world will be a challenge. One hundred years ago on the same ice shelf, Capt Scott died on his polar expedition as he was caught out by the start of the southern winter. Over 40 years the former SAS officer has carved a career as one of the world’s top explorers. Between 1979-82 he circumnavigated the world via both Poles. In 1993 he became the first person to cross the Antarctic continent on foot, dragging a 450lb sledge. He undertook several expeditions to the North Pole in the 1990s while striving to become the first person to reach it solo and unaided. In 2003 he ran seven marathons in seven days, just four months after his heart attack. And in 2007 he climbed the North Face of the Eiger, one of the hardest challenges in the Alps. In 2009 he became the only person to have crossed the ice caps of both Poles, and to have climbed to the highest point on Earth. VIDEO: 'A journey worth it's polar salt'.

Two gunmen riding on motorcycles assassinated Amanullah Aman, the head of a provincial election commission in Kunduz, north Afghanistan, at 8.45am (5.15am GMT) today, according to police. Just an hour later, Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, took to Twitter to publicise the attack. 'At 9am this morning, engineer Mohammad Aman, head of Kunduz Independent Election Commission, was killed by our Majahedeen in Takharistan area of Kunduz city', the Tweet read. The shooting is believed to be the first insurgent attack on an official of the Independent Election Commission in recent years. It came as Afghanistan's campaign season started this week, with authorities accepting candidate nominations for presidential and provincial elections next spring. Mr Aman, who has run the commission's Kunduz office since 2003, had been collecting rent from shopkeepers in a Kunduz city bazaar, where he owns property, when he was shot three times in the chest by the passing gunmen. He was taken to hospital, but later died, according to Hamidullah Daneshi, the deputy governor of Kunduz province.

However, a spokesman for the commission in Kabul said it was too early to conclude who was behind Mr Aman's death. 'We will wait until the investigation is completed by the security organs and then say who was behind this attack,' spokesman Noor Ahmad Noor told the New York Times. Today, Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack, saying it would not dampen the determination of the Afghan people to vote.

Deliberately ruining a wedding dress soon after a couple's big day is a romantic ritual meant to symbolise commitment, as the wrecked gown can never be worn again, and it's big business for photographers in the U.S. Now photographer Arran Tomlinson is pioneering the idea - also known as 'fearless bridal' or 'rock the frock' - here in the UK. Scroll down for video . Rachael Snape is photographed for a Trash the Dress shoot celebrating her wedding day as her gown is ruined . He says the aim is to give brides ‘stunning’ and ‘unusual’ pictures to contrast with those taken on their wedding day.

An innuendo-filled letter sent from Ernest Hemingway to Marlene Dietrich, in which the author imagines performing a surreal sex act onstage with the German-born actress and singer, is up for auction. Hemingway’s letter to the Hollywood star is dated August 28, 1955, and begins affectionately, ‘Dearest Kraut.’ The odd couple met while traveling across the Atlantic on the Ile de France in 1934 and their friendship lasted until the Nobel Prize-winning author committed suicide in 1961. Although their ‘love affair’ was never consummated, Hemingway and Dietrich corresponded through a series of at least 30 flirty letters and telegrams over the years . Although their ‘love affair’ was never consummated, they corresponded through a series of at least 30 flirty letters and telegrams over the years. Those letters were donated by their families to the John F. Kennedy Library and were made public in 2007. But now another of couple’s correspondences has being put up for auction through Gary Zimet’s Moments in Time with an opening bid of $54,000, reports the New York Post. The letter reveals an unguarded Hemingway playfully using language to express deep and intense emotions for Dietrich. A series of letter exchanged between Ernest Hemingway and Marlene Dietrich feature in the Ernest Hemingway Collection room at the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Library in Boston . The letter starts with Hemingway writing about an imagined theater project for the Hollywood star - after, it seems, she had asked him to collaborate on one in a previous letter. ‘It would probably have something novel like having you shot onto the stage, drunk, from a self-propelled minnenwerfer [sic] which would advance in from the street rolling over the customers,’ wrote Hemingway. ‘As you landed on the stage drunk and naked, I would advance from the rear, or your rear, wearing evening clothes and would hurriedly strip... to cover you revealing the physique of Burt Lancaster.’ Hemingway imagines her onstage, ‘foaming at the mouth,’ while they ‘break into the Abortion Scene from [the French opera] “Lakmé”’ and he brings a ‘giant rubber whale’ called ‘Captain Ahab’ into the mix. Then, ‘we bottle the foam and sell it to any surviving customers.’ The letter reveals an unguarded Hemingway playfully using language to express deep and intense emotions for Dietrich . In a serious shift, Hemingway writes, ‘Marlene, darling, I write stories but I have no grace for f****** them up for other mediums,’ and, ‘I love you very much and I never wanted to get mixed in any business with you… neither of us has enough whore blood for that.’ He signs the letter, ‘Papa.’ Hemingway once remarked to his friend and future biographer A.E. Hotchner, that he and Dietrich were ‘Victims of un-synchronized passion.’ Whenever one party was unattached, the other was not. The lack of physical consummation may have contributed to the often-heated sentiments Hemingway expressed. 'What do you really want to do for a life work?' he wrote on June 19, 1950. 'Break everybody's heart for a dime? You could always break mine for a nickel and I'd bring the nickel.' Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. Marlene Dietrich began her career in Berlin in the 1920s acting on stage and in silent films, such as The Blue Angel, above left, before moving to Hollywood and by the 1950s, right, she was a successful show performer . Many of his works, such as For Whom The Bell Tolls, are considered classics of American literature. He committed suicide in the summer of 1961.

A Wheel of Fortune contestant who lost out on the chance to win a $1 million prize after mis-pronouncing his answer has been given a second chance by Jimmy Fallon. Mr Atkinson's misfortune on the popular game show hosted by Pat Sajak attracted a lot of sympathy, after nerves got the better of him, causing him to stumble through his answer. But after Fallon saw his attempt he invited the contestant to come to New York and appear on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon to prove to the world he did know how to say 'corner curio cabinet'. Scroll down for video . Second chance: Jimmy Fallon and Paul Atkinson celebrate as the Wheel of Fortune contestant says his phrase correctly . Fallon said: 'I felt sorry for that guy ... it broke all our hearts,' referring to how Mr Atkinson missed out on his chance to play for a $1 million prize and was left dumb founded as the contestant next to him went on to solve the puzzle by saying it correctly. Mr Atkinson told Fallon: 'It was part nerves - Pat Sajak was right there and he's a legend - and I had no idea what a curio cabinet was. Never seen the word, never said the word.' After a drum roll, Fallon then let Mr Atkinson redeem himself, by showing that he does know how to say 'corner curio cabinet'. And, while it may not have been a $1 million prize, Fallon also presented him with his very own curio cabinet, filled with goodies from the show. Wheel of Fortune rules state that proper pronunciation of the word or phrase is required to win each puzzle. Winner: He may have missed out on his $1 million chance but Paul was presented with his own corner curio cabinet by Fallon . Although he had landed on the $1 million wedge, Mr Atkinson would not have necessarily won the prize. Contestants who land on the wedge hang on to it for the rest of the game and, if they have the highest score and have not landed on the bankruptcy wedges, they are given the chance to play for the big prize. Only two contestants in the game show's history have ever taken home the big prize. The first was Michelle Loewenstein in 2008 and the second was Autumn Erhard, who won more than $1 million in cash and prizes in May of this year. Ecstatic: The tuxedoed contestant named Paul was thrilled when he won the chance at $1 million on Wheel of Fortune during their season premier in Las Vegas .

It landed on the coveted Million Dollar prize, in between treacherous Bankruptcy spots. Mr Atkinson asked for a C, and there were three. He triumphantly held his million dollar panel, which would have turned into a real million dollars had he continued on his winning track. But his unfortunate misstep came when he solved the puzzle. Still happy: Paul triumphantly held up his game piece. Had he kept on that track, he could have eventually won the million bucks . 'Curry-O': With only one missing letter, Paul's win seemed like a lock, but he mispronounced 'curio' and lost big time . The words ‘CORNER CURIO CABINET’ tried to come out, but curio just didn’t sound quite right. After a long, hushed pause, the judges hit the wrong answer buzzer and Mr Atkinson’s neighbor went on to pronounce the words correctly. Mr Atkinson first looked shocked. ‘It didn't come out the way you intended it to, we'll take a look at it during the commercial to make sure we treated you fairly,’ said host Sajak.

Need for speed: The dog house speeds along a race track in Indianapolis, Indiana, leaving a trail of flames and smoke in its wake . Paul Stender was left inspired after visiting a group of school children who shouted requests for a jet-powered dog house . Its creator, speed enthusiast Paul Stender, 48, was inspired to build the vehicle, which he has called Snoopy, after hearing requests from thrill-seeking school children. Mr Stender and his extreme sports entertainment team, Indy Boys Inc, were looking for their next idea after coming up with a jet-powered toilet and school bus. 'We visit pupils at a lot of schools and we usually ask what they would like to see jet-powered and the dog house was one of the ideas mentioned.' The innovative vehicle, which features a modified go-kart chassis, didn't take too long to put together, says Mr Stender, whose wife Therese, 29, helped with its construction.

A disgraced Communist politician who was once a member of China's innermost circle of power has been sentenced to life in prison on corruption charges. Bo Xilai, 64, a former member of the powerful Poliburo which rules China, was today convicted of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power by the Jinan Intermediate People's Court. The trial has been one of the most lurid scandals in Chinese politics, involving defection, defiance and murder. Disgraced: Bo, pictured earlier in the trial, was today sentenced to life in prison at the Jinan Intermediate People's Court in China . He was sentenced to life in prison on the bribery charges, 15 years for embezzlement and seven years for abuse of power. The senior politician's downfall began when a senior aide, Wang Lijun, defected to a US Embassy and revealed details of a murder committed by Bo's wife, Gu Kailai. In August 2012 a Chinese court convicted Gu of the murder of Neil Heywood, whom she was said to have killed with poison in a hotel after a business dispute. Bo was then dismissed from his political office and investigated for corruption. In a marked departure from other recent politically charged trials, which are typically understood to be closely choreographed proceedings, Bo launched an unusually vigorous defence during his trial last month. He denied all charges and blamed the corruption on others in his inner circle, thus forgoing the opportunity to earn leniency as is customarily given in Chinese courts when a defendant expresses contrition. Bo also became the highest-level politician convicted for corruption under China's leader Xi Jinping, who has staked his reputation on combating graft within the Communist Party. Downfall: Bo Xilai (right) was investigated for corruption charges after his wife Gu Kailai (left) was convicted of murdering a British businessman . Investigation: Mrs Gu was given a suspended death sentence for murder in August 2012 . 'I think the point is that Xi wanted to punish Bo Xilai for daring to go against the party's arrangements,' said Willy Lam, an expert on party politics at Chinese University in Hong Kong. 'He was punished for his disobedience and defiance.' According to details of today's proceedings released by the court in Twitter-like posts, Bo was escorted into the courtroom by marshals and stood to listen as the judge read out the lengthy verdict. The court rejected Bo's defence that he did not know about the £2.2 million in bribes from two business associates in the form of extensive valuable gifts to his family - including a French villa, expenses-paid trips, an electric scooter and fancy delicacies such as abalone. Power: Mr Bo was previously a member of China's powerful Politburo . However, the court said a small portion of the bribes alleged by prosecutors, of about £100,000 were not proven in court. The trial proceedings had been publicised through partial transcripts that gave a measure of legitimacy to a trial seen by many observers to have a foregone conclusion of guilt and predetermined sentence because of the Communist Party leadership's control over the court system. 'This is a big victory for Xi Jinping's leadership, because you cannot say this is a secretive trial. It is at least a semi-open trial,' said Li Cheng, an expert of elite politics at Brookings Institute. 'Bo's political career is zero, and the trial really transformed Bo from a charismatic leader to a self-indulging person.' Bo's downfall was set in motion in February 2012 when his former top aide attempted to defect to a US consulate with information about his wife's murder of British businessman Neil Heywood. Prosecutors later accused Bo of interfering with the investigation into the murder, as well as unrelated corruption uncovered by investigators. Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, confessed to the murder and was handed a suspended death sentence last year that will probably be commuted to life imprisonment.","Bo, a former member of the powerful Politburo, was found guilty of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power .

Syrian President Bashar al Assad has vowed to destroy his country's chemical weapons stockpile. The doctor-turned-dictator insisted that he has not used chemical weapon and rejected the findings of the United Nations report that declared that an attack involving sarin gas did occur in the country on August 21. But, in a sign that he may be seeking a diplomatic thaw with the West after decades of acrimony, he said his government would abide by a U.S.-Russian agreement to . dispose of Syria's chemical weapons and hand them over to whatever . nation was willing to take them. He added that the operation to destroy the weapons will cost about $1 billion and take approximately one year to complete. Promise: Syrian President Bashar al Assad has vowed to destroy his country's stockpile of chemical weapons . Horror: Hundreds of children were killed in the attack which reportedly rained nerve gas upon thousands near the Syrian capital of Damascus . In an interview on the Fox News television channel, Assad said: 'I think it is a very complicated operation technically and it needs a lot, a lot of money. Some estimated about a billion for the Syrian stockpile.' Asked whether he would be willing to hand over chemical weapons to the U.S. government, Assad said: 'As I said, it needs a lot of money. It needs about one billion. It is very detrimental to the environment. If the American administration is ready to pay this money and take the responsibility of bringing toxic materials to the United States, why don't they do it?' Assad denied that his forces were responsible for a chemical weapons attack in Ghouta, outside Damascus, on August 21 that brought the United States close to attacking Syria in response. He did not deny that the attack . occurred - saying that 'it's despicable, it's a crime' - but he did . clearly try to distance his forces from any culpability. Indignant: Syrian President Bashar al Assad used his latest televised interview to say that there is still no evidence that his soldiers used chemical weapons . Under attack: Assad maintained that the government was continually being attacked by outside terrorist groups who are masquerading as internal opposition forces . 'Sarin gas is called the kitchen gas you know why? because you can make it anywhere,' he said. Assad . said that the evidence cited in the United Nations report was not all . of the proof and did not prove that the weapons were used by his armed . forces. He said the Syrian army was advancing in the area at the time and had no need to fire rockets filled with the nerve agent sarin, as the United States says it did. 'The whole story doesn't even hold together. It's not realistic. So, no, we didn't. In one word, we didn't use any chemical weapons in Ghouta,' he said. U.N. chemical investigators confirmed on Monday the use of sarin in the attack in a long-awaited report that the United States, Britain and France said proved government forces were responsible. Assad said it was too early to make a definitive comment on the U.N. report. Sit down: Assad was interviewed by former Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich (left) and Fox News reporter Greg Palkot (next to Kucinich) inside the Presidential palace in Damascus . Attacks: The chemical gas attacks occurred on August 21 in the rebel strongholds near Demascus and was thought to have left more than 1,000 dead . 'We have to look at it. We have to discuss it before saying if we agree or disagree. It was only yesterday evening,' he said. Asked whether he had a message for President Barack Obama, Assad said: 'Listen to your people. Follow the common sense of your people. That's enough,' in an apparent reference to opinion polls that show Americans oppose any U.S. strike on Syria. Former U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich, a liberal Democrat and eight-term congressman from Ohio who is now a commentator for Fox News, took part in the interview on Tuesday in Damascus along with Fox senior correspondent Greg Palkot. Kucinich has visited Assad twice before, most recently in June 2011, after the uprising against the Syrian president began. Syrian media quoted Kucinich as saying on that trip that Assad was 'highly loved' by Syrians. The congressman said he had been misquoted.","Syrian President admitted that 'it's not a secret' that they have chemical weapons but said that they will agree to hand them over to be destroyed .

Two teenagers, ages 13 and 14, from Spokane, Washington, are in custody after a horrifying sword attack fueled by 'blue pills' on the mother of one of the boys where they discussed eating her liver. 'The 14-year-old came up with the idea of, 'Hey, let's rip her open and . eat her liver,' but it never happened,' Spokane County Sheriff's Deputy . Craig Chamberlin told CNN on Friday. While the woman was the younger boy's mother, it is alleged that the 14-year-old beat her with the handle of a sword. The rampage occurred after the suspects took some mystery blue pills. Grotesque: Two friends ages 13 and 14 were arrested after police say they tried to kill the younger boy's mother with a sword and then eat her liver as she slept in her home along East Mission Avenue in Spokane, Washington . 'I think that was their original plan, . to cut her open, but then they changed their minds,' Chamberlin added. The mother remained hospitalized with head injuries but in stable . condition on Friday. The . teenagers were apprehended after the incident when they stole another . parent's car, then burglarized and vandalized another home. Spokane Valley deputies responding to an . assault call early Tuesday found the bloody woman on her bed; next to her were . two knives and a sword with a handle bent at 45-degree angle. ‘It doesn't sound like she remembered the . attack,’ Chamberlin said in a phone interview. The woman told deputies the . sword handle wasn't previously bent. It wasn't clear who called for help. With no signs of forced entry into the . apartment in the 13000 block of East Mission Avenue in Spokane, deputies went . looking for the victim's 13-year-old son and a 14-year-old friend. The other boy's father thought his son had . stayed with the 13-year-old, Chamberlin said. Then the man noticed his 2005 Dodge . Durango SUV and its keys were missing. Deputies tracked the teens through a crime . spree that included breaking into a home and crashing the SUV into the side of . a mobile home. A K-9 dog eventually located them. Horrific scene: The mother of the 13-year-old suspect woke up with blood covering her head and a sword (not pictured) with a bent handle resting on her bed . The injured woman's 13-year-old son told . deputies that his friend tried to kill the sleeping mother with a sword, . Chamberlin said. The younger boy said he talked his friend into trying to kill his mother . because he had taken ‘blue pills.’ The spokesman said it was unclear what the pills were. The boy said he would never have done . anything like that sober, Chamberlin said. The son also told deputies his friend tried . to talk him into eating his mother's liver, the sheriff's spokesman said. ‘Your guess is as good as mine’ as to where . that idea came from, Chamberlin said.

An 86-year-old Oregon man on trial for the shooting death of his wife carried out the attack after a series of grievances with his family, including his stepdaughter's failure to wish him a happy birthday and his complaint that his wife put the lid on the ketchup bottle too tightly, prosecutors say. Deschutes County prosecutor Mary Anderson told jurors about Lawrence Loeffler's complaints during opening statements Wednesday at his murder trial. Anderson said Loeffler made the criticisms about his family during questioning by officers about the death of 83-year-old Betty Loeffler. The prosecutors said the killing was a calculated act. Lawrence Loeffler, 86, is accused of killing his 83-year-old wife, Betty Jane Loeffler, on on January 28, 2013 . Anderson said Lawrence Loeffler took the phone off the hook, retrieved a .25-caliber handgun in the middle of the night from the bedroom where she slept and then 'set a trap' to get his wife onto the deck at the back of their house near La Pine, a town of about 1,670 people on the east edge of the Cascade Range in Central Oregon. He shot her once in the neck and then again in the head in what he described to investigators as a 'kill shot' to make sure she was dead, Anderson told jurors. While Lawrence Loeffler admitted having planned to kill his wife, defense attorney Jacques DeKalb said his client was not guilty of murder because he was suffering from delusions. 'He had no idea what reality was at that time,' DeKalb told jurors. Prosecutors say Loeffler killed his wife over a series of grievances, including that she screwed the ketchup top on the bottle too tightly . DeKalb said Lawrence Loeffler spent about 10 days in a Bend retirement home after surgery to remove his gall bladder in December, receiving hospice care. He said Loeffler was fixated on the death of his own father and became disoriented, irrational and obsessed with death. On Wednesday, jurors listened to a 911 call Loeffler made after the shooting. During the recording, the dispatcher asks Loeffler about the shooting, and he says his wife was threatening him and he was afraid for his life, so he shot her. Some of the call is nearly impossible to understand as Loeffler sobs and screams repeatedly that he doesn't know the details of what had taken place in the home. Lawrence Loeffler breathes with the help of an oxygen concentrator, and he began to cry as he sat at the defense table listening to the call.","Lawrence Loeffler, 86, of Oregon, is on trial for killing his wife, 83-year-old Betty Loeffler, by shooting her in the neck and head .

A giant rooster - the symbol of France - has taken up a perch beneath the admiral's statue in Trafalgar Square, which celebrates Britain's 1805 defeat of Napoleon's armies. The 15.4ft fibreglass artwork took its place on the vacant Fourth Plinth today and will stay up for 18 months. London's mayor Boris Johnson unveiled the ultramarine blue sculpture, named Hahn/Cock, today alongside German artist Katharina Fritsch. Scroll down for video . A 15.4ft giant blue cockerel is the latest sculpture to take its place on the vacant Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square . The sculpture, called Hahn/Cock, was unveiled by London mayor Boris Johnson, left, alongside its creator, German artists Katharina Fritsch, right . 'I definitely never thought about the French thing. But it's a nice humorous side-effect to . have something French in a place that celebrates victory over Napoleon,' Fritsch told The Guardian newspaper. She also said she hoped the double meaning in the work's name would appeal to the British sense of humour. 'I know they like to play games with language,' Fritsch said, adding that her sculpture mocked male posturing in a square full of military statues. Mr Johnson told BBC London: 'It is a ginormous blue Hahn Cock, as it's called.' He also joked about David Cameron's plans to get internet providers to block pornography, saying: 'I think if you tried to Google it in the future, the Prime Minister would stop you from finding it.' Local conservation group The Thorney Island Society objected to the sculpture and had tried to block its display. 'It is unrelated to the context of . Trafalgar Square and adds nothing to it but a feeble distraction,' its . members wrote in a letter to Westminster City Council. The rooster is painted in ultramarine blue and made of fibreglass . The large bird is a feathered friend for Trafalgar Square's famous pigeons . 'The only tenuous argument put forward is the artist’s dubious claim that the “cockerel is a symbol for regeneration, awakening and strength”. 'More to the point is that the artist boasts it is seen as “a rude interruption to the grey formal architecture of the square”. This is neither a happy nor pleasing criterion for the use of this most significant location.' Fritsch said Hahn/Cock was a 'victory for feminism' in the square. She told the Evening Standard: 'I'm a . female sculptor. The man is the model. For thousands of years they've . made pictures of us, the women. I've changed the role.' The statue was unveiled today on the Fourth Plinth outside the National Portrait Gallery . The newspaper's contemporary art critic Ben Luke said: 'Cock has a sense of mischief rather than posturing mockery. It is as much a celebration of the square as it is a satire.' The Fourth Plinth was erected in 1841 . for an equestrian statue that was never completed. It remained empty for . a century and a half, and since 1999 has been occupied by artworks . erected for 18 months at a time. They are paid for by the Mayor's office and Arts Council England. Fritsch's . sculpture was chosen from a shortlist of six potential occupants. It . follows works by the likes of Marc Quinn and Alison Lapper in finding a . temporary home on the plinth. Hahn/Cock will stay atop the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square for 18 months . The previous occupant, a boy on a rocking chair by Scandanavian artists Elmgreen & Dragset, has been bought by the Arken Museum of Modern Art in Ishoj, near Copenhagen in Denmark. In 2009, Antony Gormley's One & Other saw . 2,400 members of the public take it in turns to stand atop the plinth . for an hour at a time. Mr Johnson said: 'Katharina Fritsch commands tremendous respect internationally and her giant blue bird will provide a striking new focal as well as talking point for Londoners and tourists alike.'","Sculpture called Hahn/Cock by Katharina Fritsch will stay up for 18 months .

True wealth: Russian businessman Boris Berezovsky, above, died with an estate of luxury properties and business interests including mansions in the south of France . The Russian oligarch who was found hanged in the bathroom of his ex-wife's Berkshire mansion had a fortune of £500m, rubbishing theories he had committed suicide because of unpayable debts. Boris Berezovsky, who was an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, was discovered in March this year with injuries police described as 'consistent with hanging'. Many believed that the exiled tycoon had taken his own life because of depression after he lost a high court battle with Chelsea Football club owner Roman Abramovich in 2012. But new evidence has shown how Berezovsky, who made his fortune in the soviet car industry, had a portfolio of luxury properties in France as well as millions in business assets. The true extent of the businessman's wealth is believed to far outweigh any debts he owed and casts fresh doubt on the reason for his death. As well as revelations about his assets, it has also emerged that Berezovsky completely re-wrote his will the week before he died. He is said to have replaced the original with a drawn up new version which omitted his first wife Nina. Also cut out of the will was his second wife Galina who he split with in an acrimonious divorce which cost the tycoon £100m in 2011. The replacement was completed by the Berezovsky on March 14 this year. It is signed in scruffy scrawled handwriting in the name of Platon Elenin, which is a pseudonym Berezovsky assumed for . security reasons when he fled Russia in 2003. Clash of the tycoons: Berezovsky's high court loss to Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich is said to have cost him £100m. But his remaining wealth suggests that bankruptcy was not a factor in the oligarchs death . Nine days after signing the will, he was found dead. Despite those closest to the the man insisting that he would never have taken his own life, police were unable to find any evidence which would rule out suicide. Berezovsky's portfolio are said to include 'trophy assets' which include mansions set in a 35 acre estate on the French Riviera, they are believed to be worth more than £200m. Another property called Villa Gal, again in the South of France, is valued at around £50m. High roller: The ""Thunder B"" yacht, which Russian authorities say belonged to Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky, is moored in Golfe Juan port, southeastern France . Legal documents seen by the Sunday Times suggest that Berezovsky's estate was in receipt of payments from his former business partner, Badri Patarkatsishvili, the Georgian billionaire who in 2008. Sources close to the paper say the amount paid was around £200m. Berezovsky had business interests in hotels, as well as being the owner of a private art collection, the value of which is believed to be around £50m. His assets, which are thought to total £500m, outstrip the claim that Berezovsky's estate for more than £150m from Aeroflot, the Russian state airline. That case is yet to be head in court and there is guarantee that the tycoon would lose. It is also suggested that he owed £100m to HM Revenue & Customs for the sale of his shares in Sibneft, an Russain oil company, and Rusal, an aluminium firm also based in his homeland. No entry: Police block the road leading to the home of the Russian oligarch after he was found dead on March 24, 2013 in Sunningdale, Berkshire . The fortune will now be distributed in accordance with his new will. In the two page document, he leaves 18 per cent shares to his remaining four children, Ekaterina and Elizaveta who are in their thirties, the two teenagers Arina and Gleb, and to his exgirlfriend Helena Gorbunova. The remaining 10 per cent is to be split down the middle between Michael Cotlick, his loyal Israeli assistant, and his mother Anna who has since died. She left her five per cent to Ekaterina, now acting as her father's executor. A friend of the family said: 'The family are aware that there is a large amount of money in his estate. They are watching developments very closely.'","Oligarch had a portfolio of 'trophy properties' in the south of France .

Ferdoush Hasan, 22, pictured at Newcastle Crown Court, where he was found guilty of raping a 14-year-old schoolgirl . A Bangladeshi student has been found guilty of raping a 14-year-old schoolgirl within weeks of moving to the UK. Ferdoush Hasan, 22, raped the vulnerable girl at his house in Beaufront Terrace, South Shields, in February last year. He led the girl, who had drunk half a litre of vodka, to a room in another part of the house from her friends, where he forced himself on her and raped her. Hasan, Abu Sufian, 21, and Raabsan Khan, 19, were all found not guilty of a second joint charge of rape, during which Sufian and Khan were alleged to have held down another girl while Hasan raped her. After hearing the guilty verdict, Hasan sobbed with his head in his hands, before being led away into custody. It took the jury just over three hours to reach the unanimous verdicts this afternoon. Tom Moran, defending Hasan, asked that his client, who has no previous convictions, be sentenced immediately. However, Judge Simon Hickey said that Hasan would be sentenced after the preparation of a probation report. Hasan came to the UK on January 18 or 19 last year to study an HND in nautical science at South Tyneside College. The following month he raped the schoolgirl at the house that he shared with 13 other Bangladeshi students. Throughout his police interviews, Hasan lied about knowing the victim and denied having sex with her. During the trial, however, he claimed to have had consensual sex with the teenager, although he said he thought she was 17. Hasan along with Abu Sufian, 21, pictured left, and Raabsan Khan, 19, right, were all found not guilty of a second joint charge of rape of another girl . He said that he had previously lied to police because he was 'afraid' and 'no-one was looking after him'. During the five-day trial at Newcastle Crown Court, Hasan's victim told how she feared she was pregnant with his baby. The girl's mother told how her daughter 'went off the rails' after the rape and had begun to self harm and even talked about taking her grandfather's tablets. The troubled teenager was taken to a doctor by a school counsellor but the pregnancy test was negative. Hasan, of Ocean Road, South Shields, will be sentenced at a later hearing.

Six days after Aaron Alexis shot and killed 12 people at the Navy Yard in Washington, DC, the National Rifle Association has issued their response. In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday morning, Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president and CEO of the NRA, said the shooting got out of control because 'there weren't enough good guys with guns' and that when 'the good guys with guns got there, it stopped'. He said that US military bases are 'largely left unprotected' and that leaves them susceptible to attacks like the one last week at the Washington Navy Yard. Scroll down for video . More guns: The executive vice president of the National Rifle Association said Sunday that more armed soldiers could have prevented the mass shooting at the Navy Yard last week . So the NRA is calling for increased security at US military bases to prevent future shootings. 'We need to look at letting the men and women that know firearms and are trained in them do what they do best which is protect and survive,' he said. The sentiment fell in line with what LaPierre said on Meet the Press following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School last December. At the time he proposed the idea of enlisting former military and police officers as volunteer armed guards at schools. 'If it's crazy to call for putting police and armed security in our schools to protect our children, then call me crazy,' LaPierre said in a broadcast interview. 'I think the American people think it's crazy not to do it. It's the one thing that would keep people safe.' Start the debate: Wayne LaPierre spoke on Meet the Press to make the group's first statement since the shooting . While the shooting is certainly drumming up the gun licensing debate again, this time the concern lays mostly in the Defense Department's vetting of private contractors. Gunman: The shooter Aaron Alexis, was shot dead by authorities after opening fire at the Washington Navy Yard last Monday . Alexis was recently hired as a civilian information technology contractor to work on the Navy and Marine Corps intranet and that's how he had access to the Yard that morning. Defense Secretary Check Hagel admitted that 'something had broken down' in the vetting process since Alexis had been treated for mental illnesses. Hagel pledged to change the system in an effort to prevent possibly dangerous people from getting contracts. 'Where there are gaps, we will close them. Where there are inadequacies, we will address them. And where there are failures, we will correct them,' Hagel said. The shooting happened around 8:20 last Monday morning at the Washington Navy Yard and resulted in the deaths of 12 people. Alexis had previously claimed to be suffering from PTSD after helping rescue efforts in New York following the 9/11 terror attacks. It emerged that he used three . guns during the massacre, one of them an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle - . the same weapon used in the Sandy Hook and Aurora mass shootings. He was killed in one of several running gun battles with police after he entered the Naval Sea Systems Command headquarters and started picking off victims in a cafeteria from a fourth-floor atrium, witnesses said.

An Indian student says she was kidnapped, tortured and repeatedly raped by a canteen owner for 17 months after he drugged her food at college. The 20-year-old disappeared from her home in Hyderabad in April, 2012, and only managed to escape this month. News of the kidnap has sparked protests on the streets of Hyderabad and more than 15,000 people have joined an online campaign in support of the girl. The student says she was the tortured and repeatedly raped by Satyaprakash Singh. Pictured: Indian students of Saint Joseph Degree college during an anti-rape protest in Hyderabad . Satyaprakash Singh, owner of a canteen at TRR College, has been arrested. The case will be heard under the stricter laws of the Nirbhaya act, which was introduced this year following the gang rape and murder of a student on a bus in Delhi. Last week, four men were sentenced to death by hanging for her rape and murder. Tarun Joshi, deputy commissioner of South Zone, was quoted by Gulf News as saying: 'We have booked a case under the Nirbhaya act and an impartial and prompt investigation has been taken up.' The student said Singh drugged her by mixing something in her food and she was then taken to a flat where he raped and tortured her and chained her with a belt. During the horrifying 17 month ordeal, the student says at one point three police officers visited the flat where she was being kept after a complaint by neighbours. However, instead of helping her she said they too raped her at Singh's suggestion before leaving. The suspect will be tried under the same stricter laws brought in following the death of the Delhi student. Four men have been sentenced to death for the crime . She said Singh kept her in one flat for the first month but moved her to another at Bala Nagar, Gayatri Nagar, with the help of another woman. The student said he claimed he had raped and murdered Muslim girls before her and had been protected from prosecution by powerful friends. In the complaint to police, she said: . 'He used to say that I am the fifth Muslim girl who he has raped and . killed and thrown in a river. 'He . claimed that his father is and former Defence employee and his brother . is a criminal lawyer who always saves him from getting into the police . net', according to Gulf News. In May 2012, she told police she was able to steal Singh's phone and call her brother. However, despite her family going to police, she says officers did not respond to the claims. The student only managed to escape on September 4, this year, after Singh got drunk and left the door open.

A source has told authorities in Pennsylvania and the FBI that he knows the location of missing DA Ray Gricar's body . One of the most shocking things about the Penn State sex abuse scandal when it came to light in 2011, was the fact that the local District Attorney knew about the case back in the 1990s. The mother of one of the children abused by football coach Jerry Sandusky, reported the crime to DA Ray Gricar in 1998 but he decided not to bring up charges. Gricar, 59, was never able to explain why he let Sandusky slip away, since Gricar himself vanished in 2005. After the sex scandal revelation, some hypothesized that Gricar's disappearance was somehow tied to Penn State. But now a former person of interest in his disappearance has told the Altoona Mirror that it was a former Hell's Angel that carried out the killing and had nothing to do with Penn State. The last time anyone saw Gricar was on April 15, 2005, when he left for work in his red mini cooper. Gricar never showed up and the next day his car was discovered parked in an antique mall parking lot. Eventually, authorities also found his computer and hard drive. Over the years the FBI has worked with local police to investigate leads in the case.. Last May, a former Hell's Angels ranking officer decided to come forward to authorities and the Altoona Mirror with what he says is the real story behind Gricar's death. Sex abuse scandal: After the Penn State sex abuse scandal came to light in 2011, it was revealed that Gricar heard complaints about football coach Jerry Sandusky as early as 1998 but decided not to bring up charges . Without a trace: Gricar was never able to account for why he let Sandusky, above, off since he himself went missing while driving to work in April 2005 . According to the source, Gricar was murdered by a former Hell's Angel who was getting back at the DA for receiving a long prison sentence for an aggravated assault conviction in the 1990s. The man who carried out the killing was also an FBI informant. According to a  statement read by a judge at a sentencing hearing, the former Hell's Angel reported information to the FBI on illegal activities by the motorcycle gang after his release. The source says he decided to come forward with the information on Gricar's death to clear himself and because he believed the former Hell's Angel responsible was dead. He has since learned that the Hell's Angel is actually still alive and living in another state. Revenge: The latest lead comes from a former ranking officer with the Hell's Angels (above, unrelated file photo) who says it was a former member who killed Gricar out of revenge for a long prison sentence . He also said speculation that Gricar's disappearance had something to do with the Jerry Sandusky scandal was 'especially annoying'. According to Bellefonte police Detective Matthew Rickard, the investigation into Gricar's disappearance is 'ongoing' but both the FBI and local police have questioned the source. The source took FBI agents to the location in Pennsylvania where he says Gricar's body was disposed of, but at the last minute wouldn't give the specific location since he wants to secure immunity first. The shaft where Gricar is buried contains the body of four others as well as guns and he doesn't want to incriminate himself or others by opening it up. The source says Gricar's body was hidden there after his 'knee caps were spun' and his throat was slit. Murdered? According to the source, Gricar faced a gruesome end. He had his 'knee caps spun' and his throat slit. His body is allegedly buried in a shaft on a property in Pennsylvania . Since contacting the authorities and the paper, the source has hired a Harrisburg-based lawyer to represent him. Gricar's family has been informed about the latest lead but aren't getting their hopes it that will give them any closure. Gricar's nephew Tony Gricar says he takes all of the leads with a grain of salt. 'We've heard pretty much all the theories that anyone's ever come up with,' he said.

Clinton said she's enjoying being able to spend more quality time with her husband - former President Bill Clinton. ‘We get to be at home together a lot more now than we used to in the last few years,’ Clinton said. ‘We have a great time; we laugh at our dogs; we watch stupid movies; we take long walks; we go for a swim. You know, just ordinary, everyday pleasures.’ Clinton said her husband is also ignoring talk of her potential 2016 presidential run. ‘I don’t think even he is, you know, focused on that right now,’ she said. ‘Right now, we’re trying to just have the best time we can have doin’ what we’re doin’. ’ However she wasn’t shy about talking up her qualifications for the job, in particular following her term as secretary of state. Hillary Clinton has spoken of her 'personal friendship' with President Obama cultivated during her term as secretary of state . ‘I’ve had a unique, close, and personal . front-row seat. And I think these last four years have certainly . deepened and broadened my understanding of the challenges and the . opportunities that we face in the world today,’ she said. She also spoke of her ‘personal friendship’ with President Obama. ‘I feel comfortable raising issues with him,’ she said. ‘I had a very positive set of interactions, even when I disagreed, which obviously occurred, because obviously I have my own opinions, my own views.’ Asked is she wrestles with running for president, Clinton said, 'I do. But I’m both pragmatic and realistic. I think I have a pretty good idea of the political and governmental challenges that are facing our leaders, and I’ll do whatever I can from whatever position I find myself in to advocate for the values and the policies I think are right for the country.' 'I will just continue to weigh what the factors are that would influence me making a decision one way or the other,' she said. The annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting starts on Monday in New York and all three Clintons will speak at the event . Despite the Clinton's reluctance to seriously speculate about 2016, the buzz about her anticipated bid refuses to go away. On ‘State of the Union’ on Sunday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) described Clinton as ‘one of the best-equipped, best-prepared people to enter the White House in a very long time,’ and said she was ‘more prepared’ than the last three presidents to enter the White House. On ‘Meet The Press’ on Sunday, conservative pundit Bill Kristol said Clinton was ‘a good candidate for Republicans to run against.’ The annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting takes place from Sept. 23 to 26 at the Sheraton Hotel in Times Square. President Obama, Bill Gates, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, CNN's Piers Morgan, U2 frontman Bono and all three Clintons - including daughter Chelsea - are featured speakers.","Clinton claims she hasn't decided yet if she'll run for the presidency in 2016 .

Denial: The Kremlin dismissed rumours that Mr Putin has married ALina Kabayeva . The Kremlin was forced to deny claims yesterday that Vladimir Putin has married former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabayeva. Rumours that the recently divorced Russian president was marrying in the town of Valdai swept the internet. Alexei Navalny, Putin’s most charismatic political rival, tweeted: ‘I’m told that Putin and Kabayeva are marrying today at the Iver Monastery. All of Valdai sealed off.’ However, Mr Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later dismissed the claims as ‘an internet exercise to relieve boredom’. Valdai is in the Novgorod region, where 60-year-old Putin was based last week for an international conference involving politicians and journalists. His aides have repeatedly denied he is involved in a relationship with the gold medal-winning gymnast, 30, pictured right. Claims that the pair have children together have also been dismissed. This week the former KGB man indicated he may stand for office again in 2018. Putin was first elected in 2000 and served two four year terms until he handed control of the country to puppet president Dmitry Medvedev who served until 2012 when Putin was reelected, this time for a six-year term. If reelected the hardline ruler will have been in power for nearly a quarter of a century which will make him the nation's longest-serving leader since Joseph Stalin. Putin, who served two consecutive four-year terms starting in 2000, stepped out of the presidential limelight and became prime minister in 2008 to observe a limit of two consecutive terms. However, he maintained his grip on power from the shadows with his longtime ally, Dmitry Medvedev, serving as a placeholder. Hint: Mr Putin has this week revealed he could run for a fourth consecutive term bringing his tenure to 25 years .","Claims dismissed by aide as 'an internet exercise to relieve boredom'

The tweets were in response to Monday's deadly Naval Yard shooting, in which 12 people were killed. In the post, Associate Professor David Guth blames the fatal attack on the NRA, and goes on to say that next time there's a mass-shooting that he hopes the victims are the children of NRA members. He ends his 140-charecter rant with 'shame on you. May God damn you.' Suspended indefinitely: Advocated for the murder of the children of NRA members. He has since been suspended .

Young women are often told about the pains associated with menstruation, but one 10-year-old was in over her head when she complained about a pain early Thursday morning. That's because what her family deduced was her first period was actually a gunshot wound. The 10-year-old was sleeping in her bed at her home in Hayward, California around 2am Thursday morning when shots fired outside hit her in the buttocks. The girl's father, 42, told KPIX that he heard the shots, but thought they sounded like bulbs popping. Scroll down for video . Painful period: A 10-year-old girl in Hayward, California nursed a gunshot wound for five hours after her family believed the blood was her period. Her father, above, said they didn't know it was from a bullet . Soon after, his 10-year-old daughter came out of her bedroom complaining about a pain in her pelvic region. He says the girl's mother and sister examined her and believed the blood was from her starting her menstrual cycle. 'An older sister gave her a pad and told her to put it on and go back to bed,' Hayward Police Lt Mark Stuart told the San Jose Mercury News. But when she woke up for school the next morning, she was still in pain. Shots fired: The family lives in a neighborhood known for gang-activity, and her father says they don't call police when they hear gunfire on the streets . The damage: A car parked outside the home was hit by some of the bullets in the gunfire. Police are still uncertain why the house was targeted . That's when her parents examined her more closely and noticed the wound on her buttocks. The girl's 15-year-old sister called 911 and emergency responders were dispatched around 7:30am. Despite nursing a bullet wound for five hours, police say the girl was 'in good spirits' when they arrived. She went into surgery Friday to remove the bullet and was last reported recovering in the hospital. At first, police were suspicious as to why they weren't called sooner about the shots. 'How come we weren't called? We really need to know why we weren't called,' Hayward Police Sgt Mark Ormsby told KPIX. 'If they were scared - understandable. But we still need to be out there to treat whoever we can treat.' Shot while sleeping: The girl was last reported recovering from surgery to remove the bullet . The girl's father explained that it isn't customary in the gang-ridden neighborhood to call the police every time gunshots are heard. 'We don't call the cops when you hear shots on the streets. I didn't know it was in front of my house and I didn't know my daughter was shot,' he said. The doctor who examined the girl agreed that the parents could have mistaken the blood for a period since the entry wound was 'rather small'. 'The doctor said that if that's what they were seeing and they never initially saw the entry wound from behind, that it's plausible to believe it was a period as opposed to being shot,' said Lt Stuart. After the evaluation, the police said they would no longer be pursuing child neglect charges. It's still uncertain why the family was targeted, and so far police have not arrested any suspects in the shooting.","A 10-year-old in Hayward, California was sleeping in her bed when a bullet from gunfire outside struck her in the buttocks .

Pre-orders for Apple's new brightly-coloured iPhone 5C have not been 'overwhelming', according to a U.S network operator. The unnamed source told Reuters that supply for the plastic handset, as well as for the top-end iPhone 5S, has been disappointing, leading to suggestions Apple's bubble with consumers may have burst. Both handsets are due to go on sale Friday and pre-orders opened last week. The handsets were announced in Cupertino on 10 September to a wave of criticism from industry experts claiming they were too expensive. Pre-orders for Apple's new brightly coloured iPhone 5C have not been 'overwhelming', according to a U.S network operator. The source told Reuters that supply for the plastic handset, as well as for the top-end iPhone 5S, had been disappointing, leading to suggestions that Apple's bubble with consumers may have burst . Apple's shares fell more than 5 per cent last week, following the announcement of the firm's' new iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. The share price ended at a one-month low of $467.24 at midday after at least three brokerages downgraded the stock. It is thought that investors were put off by the price of the handsets, especially the so-called 'cheap' iPhone 5C which starts at £469, claiming they weren't low enough for Apple to attract new customers, especially in emerging markets such as China. At the event, Apple's CEO Tim Cook unveiled the two new models - the 5C and the more expensive 5S. He also announced the tech giant would be discontinuing the current iPhone 5 model. The colourful 5C had been dubbed 'cut-price' before the event, with rumours suggesting it would be a departure from Apple's focus on purely premium phones. However, with pricing for SIM-free versions of the device starting at £469, analysts predicted that Apple had made the 'wrong move' and the pricing was 'way off the mark.' Apple began taking online orders for the iPhone 5C, which comes in blue, green, pink, yellow and white, on Friday. The pricier 5S starts at £549 SIM-free in the UK and comes in grey, silver and gold. Both phones go on sale in major territories including the U.S and UK on 20 September. It will also be the first time an iPhone is sold in China from the day of launch, too. As well as unveiling the new iPhone 5C and 5S at an event last week, Apple's CEO Tim Cook, pictured, announced the firm would be discontinuing the iPhone 5 in favour of its new iPhone 5S, pictured, and iPhone 5C. Experts believe this is a strategic shift for Apple to keep profits high . The level of inventory Apple has said it would provide for the 5S and 5C on launch day and in the week after launch is very disappointing, the source said, adding that supply of phones to all carriers appears to be limited. Pre-orders are 'not overwhelming' either, the source continued, who refused to be identified because Apple had not disclosed the number of pre-orders for either of its two new smartphones. Both models will be available through all major mobile network operators in the UK, including Vodafone, O2, Three, EE, Orange and T-Mobile. Monthly prices vary depending on which operator the phone is bought from, whether the customer wants a 16GB or 32GB model and if they take out a 12-month or 24-month deal.","Demand has been 'disappointing' according to a U.S network operator .

BlackBerry said Friday that it will lay off 4,500 employees, or 40 per cent of its global workforce, as it reports a nearly $1 billion second-quarter loss a week earlier than expected. The stock dropped 23 per cent to $8.11 after reopening for trading. Shares had been halted earlier pending the news announced the same day rival Apple's latest iPhone models went on sale. BlackBerry had been scheduled to release earnings next week. But the Canadian company said late Friday afternoon that it expects to post a staggering loss of $950 million to $995 million for the quarter, including a massive write down of the value of its inventory due to increasing competition. Culling the herd: Blackberry announced Friday it will lay off 4,500 workers . Revenue of $1.6 billion is only about half of the $3 billion that analysts expected, according to FactSet. The company's expected adjusted loss of 47 cents to 51 cents per share falls far below the loss of 16 cents per share projected by Wall Street. BlackBerry said it wants to slash operating costs in half by the first quarter of 2015 so cutting its global headcount to 7,000 total employees is necessary. 'We are implementing the difficult, but necessary operational changes announced today to address our position in a maturing and more competitive industry, and to drive the company toward profitability.' Thorsten Heins, President and CEO of BlackBerry, said in a statement. The BlackBerry, pioneered in 1999, was the dominant smartphone for on-the-go business people and other customers before Apple debuted the iPhone in 2007. Since then, BlackBerry Ltd. has been hammered by competition from the iPhone as well as Android-based rivals like Samsung.

Marked by the usual lines around the block and triumphant Apple fans walking out of Apple Stores to cheers, the new models received rave reviews from consumers and media alike. The most-hyped new feature on the 5S is a new fingerprint sensor used to unlock the phone, making passwords and finger swipes 'a waste of time.' It also comes with an improved camera and a faster processor. It has sold out around the world, say reports.

The 5C, a more budget-conscious model, also debuted to rave reviews. 'Set to become Apple’s biggest selling iPhone to date,' writes MailOnline's Mark Pigg, the lower cost model has almost identical specs to the iPhone 5C - but comes with customizable plastic shells. Apple offers the 5C in five different colors and expects more affluent customers to perhaps buy more than one. More drama: The man at right apparently had been hired by the other to purchase Apple's new iPhone 5s and when he was unable to do so the man apparently refused to pay him . Victorious: The first customer to purchase the Apple iPhone 5S celebrates Friday after exiting the Apple Retail Store on Fifth Avenue in New York . WSome waited for days: A huge queue formed outside the Apple store in Covent Garden, London, England, today as fans of the technology giant waited in anticipation for the official release of the iPhone 5S . In January, the company unveiled new phones running a revamped operating system called BlackBerry 10. The Z10 and Q10 were designed to better compete for customers and rejuvenate the brand. But vendor marketing was uneven and BlackBerry's market share continues to lag its rivals. BlackBerry said last month that it would consider selling itself. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company reiterated Friday that a special committee of its board of directors continues to evaluate all options. It also seemed to say that it would shift its focus back to competing mainly for the business customers most loyal to its brand. Not an iPhone killer: New Blackberry models have failed to impress ever-more choosy consumers flocking to Apple and Android devices . 'Going forward, we plan to refocus our offering on our end-to-end solution of hardware, software and services for enterprises and the productive, professional end user,' said Heins. 'This puts us squarely on target with the customers that helped build BlackBerry into the leading brand today for enterprise security, manageability and reliability.' A stark contrast to the hype surrounding every iPhone launch, Blackberry's last new model dropped with a thud. Despite a massive advertising push and aggressive in-store sales tactics, the Z10 fell flat - despite rave reviews from the tech press. Blackberry's once leading market share has been eroded by both Apple and Samsung. Though there haven't been many lines for Samsung products, the South Korean electronics giant sells more smartphones than any other phone manufacturer - android or otherwise.

Computer and smartphone users in Sutton, Cleveland and Watford can surf the net faster than anyone else in Britain, a new survey has revealed. Their broadband speeds are around three times quicker than internet users in Llandudno, Galashiels and Carlisle, who experience the slowest service. The speeds were disclosed after an independent speed test carried out in 118 locations across the UK. Speeds were highest in London, the South East, the North East, the North West and Northern Ireland . The study was carried out during the summer on behalf of the broadband information website thinkbroadband. Researchers found computer and smartphone users in the London borough of Sutton experienced the best broadband speeds in the whole country. The average download rate in Sutton is 19.8 megabits per second (mbps) and the average upload rate is 1.9mbps. Llandrindod Wells in Mid Wales has the slowest average download speed of just 2.4mbps and an average upload rate of 0.7mbps. Carlisle was found to have a broadband speed ranging fom 5.3 mbps to 0.6 mbps- one of the worst in the UK . 1.     Sutton: 19.8 mbps; 1.9 mbps2.     Cleveland:18.7 mbps; 1.6 mbps3.     Watford:16.8 mbps; 0.7 mbps4.     Manchester:16.5 mbps;1.0 mbps 5.     Harrow:16.2 mbps; 1.7 mbps6.     Telford:16.1 mbps; 1.1 mbps 7.     Ilford:16.0 mbps; 1.6 mbps8.     Romford:16.0 mbps; 1.9 mbps 9.     Uxbridge:15.9 mbps; 1.7 mbps 10.   Enfield:15.8 mbps; 1.8 mbps . Speeds were highest in London, the South East, the North East, the North West and Northern Ireland, the analysis found. They were poorest in Wales, the East of England and Scotland. The survey also found that BT Retail has maintained its dominant hold on the broadband world with its 31.3 per cent market share. It has around 6,780,000 broadband customers in the UK after launching an expansion drive. This includes around 21,700,000 fixed-line broadband connections. Its closest rival is Sky which trails by around 10.5 percentage points. Sebastien Lahtinen, co-founder of thinkbroadband.com, said: 'It is an extremely busy time for broadband in the UK, with criticism around the delayed rollout of superfast broadband, and the recent Government initiative to provide high speed connections for business in cities.' He said that the campaign to boost British broadband speeds was now beginning to succeed. But he added: 'It is still early days and there is long way to go until the 4million target is reached.' A separate survey by 4G revealed that even if you live in a city with fast broadband, the actual speed of your internet will vary dramatically within the city . 1.     Llandudno: 5.9 mbps; 0.7 mbps 2.     Galashiels: 5.6 mbps; 0.4 mbps 3.     Carlisle: 5.3 mbps; 0.6 mbps4.     Wrexham: 4.9 mbps; 0.6 mbps5.     Shrewsbury: 4.8 mbps; 0.8 mbps6.     Dumfries & Galloway: 4.7 mbps; 0.4 mbps7.     Inverness:4.4 mbps; 0.4 mbps 8.     Hereford: 3.9 mbps; 0.5 mbps9.     Kirkwall & Orkney:3.8 mbps; 0.4 mbps 10.   Llandrindod Wells:2.4 mbps; 0.4 mbps .

From pop art prints at Prada to luxe minimalism at MaxMara and big blooms galore at Just Cavalli, Milan Fashion Week has gotten off to a typically stylish start. Gucci kicked things off on day one with creative director Frida Giannini offering up a typically glamorous collection that pivoted around a succession of sleek silk dresses worn with fishnet bras followed by a rainbow of block colour separates. Print also made its presence felt on Giannini's catwalk with luxe tunics in inky black emblazoned with exotic florals in suitably tropical hues. And Giannini wasn't the only one to embrace print. Kicking off day two was the flamboyant Roberto Cavalli, showing his diffusion line, Just Cavalli. Cool girl clothes: Milan's fashion grand dame Miuccia Prada showed a typically quirky collection that is bound to top fashion wishlists come next summer .

Must-have: Miuccia Prada's shoes are always a highlight and this season was no exception as this stunning pair of bejewelled buttercup yellow heels proves . No stranger to bold brights and lashings of print, Cavalli sent a typically colourful collection down the runway that nevertheless surprised with its carefully drawn delicate blooms emblazoned across silk pencil skirts and the flashes of graphic monochrome check that popped up on structured blouses. Later came MaxMara, the restrained opposite of Cavalli, where minimalist good taste prevailed in the form of slick loosely tailored separates in black, palest dove grey and camel, broken by jolts of bright orange. By contrast, at Fendi, where both Cara Delevingne and Georgia May Jagger took to the runway, Karl Lagerfeld's typically slim silhouette was lifted by delicate hues of crimson, pink and cream. Loose waves of fabric and delicate ruffles heightened the effect, broken up by the odd shift dress beautifully tailored in cheeky high shine fabric. Rounding off day two was Milan's much-copied grande dame, Miuccia Prada, whose S/S14 effort combined ladylike knee-length skirts with playful pop art prints and eye-catching jewelled embellishment. Is that you Cara? Model of the moment Delevingne was almost incognito underneath a blunt-fringed black wig during Karl Lagerfeld's most recent outing at Fendi . Simple: Crimson, blush, silver and white dominated the colour palette at Fendi . Wigs: Both Cara Delevingne and Lindsey Wixom (pictured) were rendered unrecognisable . Stylish: Karl Lagerfeld's trademark tailored jackets were very much in evidence at Fendi .

Elegant: Accessories at MaxMara were practical and perfect for workwear . Exuberant: Roberto Cavalli unveiled a typically flamboyant new collection at Just Cavalli - complete with the designer's trademark prints, in floral and in check . A navy blue wool pencil skirt flecked with crystals might not scream summer but it's guaranteed to be at the top of many a wishlist come next June.

Shocked: Julleen Marter pictured with the offending packet of passata sauce . No laughing matter: The 'brain' that Julleen Marter believes she has found in a packet of Lidl passata . After cutting the carton open, Julleen discovered a strange round ‘brain-like’ object at the bottom which measured about 10cm in diameter. Astonishingly, Julleen, from Worcester, claims a Lidl’s customer service worker laughed at her when she rang up to complain. Julleen said: ‘After pouring the tomato passata in, I noticed the consistency was not as it should be.‘I also noticed the normally bright red sauce was turning a really horrible black colour. ‘I realised that there was something in the bottom of the carton so proceeded to cut it open with scissors and to my horror discovered something which I can only describe as strange. ‘I am not sure if it was animal or plant but it looks like a brain-type material. The Lidl store on Newton Road in Worcester where Julleen Marter bought the passata containing the disturbing substance . ‘It’s like something out of a horror movie. I was so disgusted I almost threw up. ‘At the moment it is frozen because that is what environmental health told me to do. ‘I’m waiting for them to come back to me to take it away and have it tested. ‘I rang Lidl and the advisor just giggled and said it was probably just a tomato. ‘I have examined the object and it certainly isn’t a tomato. It’s spongy and looks like a small brain. ‘She asked me to send them an email and a photograph of the object which I did but I have not heard back at all. ‘I don’t think I will be going back there again. I think I shall be staying away for a while. ‘I just need to put my mind at rest as I am concerned a whole batch may have been contaminated. ‘I don’t want compensation, I just feel that this has now become a public health issue.’ Lidl said the company was investigating the incident with its supplier. A spokesman said: ‘It's categorically wrong that there was laughing from the Lidl employee. It’s a matter we take very seriously. The substance is currently with the Environmental Health Office, but our initial thoughts are that it’s something tomato-based. However, we will wait until the conclusion of the investigation.' A spokesman for Worcestershire Regulatory Services - the umbrella body for Environmental Health and Trading Standards - said people should report any similar issues to them. He said: ‘If anyone has any concerns over any foreign bodies in food, contact regulatory services and we can investigate. ‘We would also advise people to keep as much information as possible including the item itself, the packaging and any receipts - it will all help.’","Horrified Julleen Marter, 47, bought the sauce from a store in Worcester .

A prison guard, a mother who home-schooled her children and a stand up comedian are among the 200,000 people from around the world who have applied to be among the first colonists on Mars. The hopefuls, who will be shortlisted into a group of 40 before their training starts, said why they would leave behind their loved ones and revealed what they would take in their suitcase if they were chosen. One applicant from Australia said he would take his ukulele, which he has named Amanda, while another from the United States said she would pack her fluffy mongoose toy. Scroll down for video . The colony as it is expected to look in 2015 - with four astronauts arriving every two years on the one-way mission . By 2015, the selected candidates will start an eight-year training regime where they will learn to deal with long periods of isolation. The majority of applicants for the . one-way trip to Mars came from the United States, with India . and China coming in second and third place. Twenty-two-year-old hopeful Thomas Eccles, told The Guardian: 'Can you imagine . how deranged and unstable I would eventually become? That would make for . some impressive TV gold.' Dutch group, Mars One, wants to launch a supply mission that will land on Mars as soon as October 2016 . The mission will begin with a landing rover set to launch in 2018 to scour the planet looking for a landing site . In 2021 all the components of the settlement reach their destination in six separate landers. Two living units, two life support units, a second supply unit, and another rover arrive on Mars . Mars One says it is not necessary to have military training nor experience in flying aircraft nor even a science degree. Candidates must: . 'Be at least 18 years of age, have a deep sense of purpose, willingness to build and maintain healthy relationships, the capacity for self-reflection and ability to trust. They must be resilient, adaptable, curious, creative and resourceful. Mars One is not seeking specific skill sets such as medical doctors, pilots or geologists. Rather, candidates will receive a minimum of eight years extensive training while employed by Mars One. Erica . Meszaros, another potential candidate from the United States, said: 'I want to see the sun rise over a completely new horizon, in a completely new sky. I think that's worth any price. 'The day they stop trying to colonise Mars will be the day I stop trying to help them do it. 'I . have a stuffed animal of a mongoose that's been everywhere with me. 'My . husband bought her for me when we were just dating, and ever since she's . followed me to work conferences in Hawaii and internships in . California. I'd love to take her to Mars, too. Josh . Richards, Australia from Australia said: 'If there was one thing I . could take to Mars it would be my semi-acoustic ukuele named Amanda. 'It has travelled around the world and has never failed to lift my spirits or those around me.' Ben . Pearce, a self-confessed 'momma's boy' from Canada said: 'I've spent a . couple of years working in the software industry, sitting at my desk . writing tedious code and I began to wonder: is this it? 'There . are so many profound scientific questions that can be answered if we . set out and explore the red planet, that I would be remiss if I didn't . apply. 'What gets . me through the idea of leaving my friends and everyone I love forever is . the knowledge that this settlement is bigger than my relationships; . bigger than anyone's relationships, because it will truly impact the . entire planet.' Rickard . Feiff, from Sweden said:'Columbus could have skipped going west and . waited a few hundred years for satellite technology to tell him what's . was out there. He did not wait, nor will (or should) we. 'I'm . a correctional officer in the Gothenburg jail, working with people that . are in desperate need of positive contact and change. 'It is a great insight into the human mind and a chance to work with the betterment of ones fellow humans. Pamela . Nicoletatos, mother from Netherlands who home-schooled her two sons . said: 'I've always had a passion for space and scientific discoveries. 'Humanity is more than just Earth, or even our solar system, but rather a small fraction of what all the Universe holds. 'I . hope to only inspire others to have an innate curiosity for adventure, . discovery and a desire to see things outside of the box. I just honestly . think it is an opportunity of a life time and would be a shame to pass . up.' As of the application deadline a week ago, more than 200,000 people from 140 different countries have applied to be among the first colonists on Mars . The £4bn project, founded in 2010 by . engineer Bas Lansdorp, is set to recoup its costs by selling the . broadcasting rights to the mission. The . applicants have agreed to stay on the red planet for the rest of their . lives – and be filmed for a reality TV programme, said the company . behind the mission, Mars One. The . Dutch group wants to launch a supply mission that will land on Mars as . soon as October 2016.  A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018. They . added that landing systems will be tested eight times before they are . used to transport humans – a move that Mars One said will make the trips . ‘much safer than moon missions’. The second round will include an . interview with Mars One committee members, and candidates advancing to . the third round will compete against one another. The . third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates . for the potential mission and will be broadcast on television and . online. The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days. ‘Going to Mars would make me feel like I am a true Star Trek officer,’ said one applicant, Michael Archavian. He said that if selected he would ‘do a lot of exploring, see the sites, and stay up at night to see the dual moons’ But Dr Veronica Bray of the University of Arizona has expressed concerns about the project. ‘Radiation . exposure is a concern, especially during the trip,’ she said.  ‘This . can lead to increased cancer risk, a lower immune system and possible . infertility.’ The colony . budget is £4 billion, compared to the £1.8 billion spent on Nasa’s rover . Curiosity, the most advanced and biggest robot to ever traverse Mars. Mars . One aims to raise money to help fund the project through a . long-running, global, reality TV show, which will select the first 24 . candidates and follow their training. Viewers . would vote for who should be on the first team of four to leave Earth . in ten years’ time. By 2033 the colony would reach 20 settlers. Dr Chris Lintoot, from Oxford University, said that while the mission was plausible, the problem would lie in the funding.","Candidates include a Swedish prison guard and a stand-up comedian .

They look worlds apart – a trunk road buzzing with traffic and the stunning beauty of remote heathland. Yet these astonishing photographs show how what was once a notorious traffic bottleneck has been returned to nature. Just two years ago, the busy A3 skirted the edge of the Devil’s Punch Bowl, near Hindhead in Surrey. Scroll down for video . The route of the old A3 main road is now a ramblers' paradise - grassed over at the Devil's Punch Bowl in Hindhead Common, Surrey . Just two years ago, this was the same scene - the old single-carriage bend at Devil's Punch Bowl . Queuing cars pumped out fumes and blighted this area of outstanding natural beauty – featuring a natural amphitheatre that gives the popular spot its name. Now the road has vanished – moved deep underground – where more than 1,000 vehicles an hour thunder unseen through the £371million, 1.25-mile Hindhead Tunnel. Before it opened, this stretch of the main London to Portsmouth road was regularly clogged as drivers were funnelled on to its single lanes between sections of dual carriageway. More jams were caused by traffic lights as the A3 wound through Hindhead village. Today, the Punch Bowl is reunited with Hindhead Common and the peace and quiet of the old route are a tribute to nature’s ability to regenerate itself. Now the road has vanished - moved deep underground, where more than 1,000 vehicles an hour thunder unseen through the £371m, 1.25-mile Hindhead Tunnel . Main construction of the tunnel started . in 2008 and when it opened in July 2011 it became the longest under-land . road tunnel in the UK. The development is said to have reduced peak-time journeys by 20 minutes. Above ground, the project has opened up new routes for joggers, cyclists and ramblers – among them Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville who is regularly seen walking his dogs on the common. And wildlife has benefited too. Protected birds such as Dartford warblers, woodlarks and nightjars, and heathland species such as  silver-studded blue butterflies are now colonising the new wilderness  for the first time in living memory. Before the Hindhead Tunnel opened, this stretch of the main London to Portsmouth road was regularly clogged as drivers were funnelled on to its single lanes between sections of dual carriageway . Sonia Rehman, owner of the Devil’s Punch Bowl Hotel in Hindhead, said: ‘We’ve seen a large increase in  walking groups and cyclists and ramblers and people coming here for the day from London. ‘The difference is the lack of traffic here now. It used to take five or ten minutes just to cross the road.’ Around 92 per cent of the soil shifted to create the tunnel has  been relaid on top of the old road, sown with heather and planted  with 200,000 new trees and shrubs as part of a National Trust restoration project. The Highways Agency and its contractors, Balfour Beatty, also landscaped the area to begin to restore it to its natural contours, using  320,000 cubic metres of soil. Kate Colley, 76, a member of the Godalming and Haslemere Ramblers, said: ‘Since the tunnel opened, it has transformed the whole place. ‘The air quality is amazing and the noise levels nil. ‘The fact the old A3 is now a path is lovely. And over time it will only get better. ‘You really get the feeling you are in the middle of nowhere.’","The busy A3 used to skirt the edge of the Devil’s Punch Bowl, near Hindhead in Surrey .

A computer designed to tell witty one-liners has been criticised for being sexist and un-PC. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh created the software to tell one-line jokes using a simple set of rules in which a statement is followed up with an amusing punchline, such as 'I like my coffee like I like my war...cold'. However, some of the lines the computer has produced have been criticised for being sexist or in bad taste including 'I like my men like I like my acorns...buried' and 'I like my women like I like my gas...natural.' A computer designed by the University of Edinburgh to tell witty one-liners has been criticised for being sexist. The software creates jokes using a simple set of rules but has ended up comparing men and women to different objects such as 'I like my women like I like my gas...natural' I like my women like I like my gas...Natural. I like my men like I like my acorns...Buried. I like my boys like I like my sectors...Bad. I like my men like I like my monoxide...Odourless. I like my men like I like my court...Superior. I like my coffee like I like my war...Cold. I like my relationships like I like my source...Open. I like my fish like I like my text...Raw. I like my business like I like my fish...Small . The software was based on the comedy of stars such as Tommy Cooper, Les Dawson, Tim Vine and Stewart Francis - all renowned for their one-line humour. Yet the software has ended up with a politically incorrect approach to the comedy by producing jokes that some people consider to be sexist. While other jokes are more surreal than funny. The computer software works by finding 'unlikely pairings of words and to make a connection between them.' According to reports in The Telegraph, the computer most commonly creates jokes that compare men or women to objects. Such jokes include: 'I like my women like I like my gas...natural', 'I like my men like I like my court...superior' and 'I like my men like I like my acorns...buried.' Jokes that erred more on the side of surrealism included 'I like my men like I like my court...superior' and 'I like my fish like I like my text...raw.' David Matthews, a computer scientist who helped develop the software, told The Telegraph that volunteers laughed when they were told the computerised jokes. However, they laughed more at man-made humour. Matthews added that the software would need to 'develop cultural awareness' if the jokes were to improve. He told The Telegraph: 'Computers have an advantage over people in that they can process masses of information, so we fed computers a wealth of material from which they extracted creative and unusual word combinations to fit our joke template. Dr Matthews is presenting the software at the Association for Computational Linguistics conference  in Bulgaria. Comedians including Tommy Cooper, pictured, Tim Vine and Stewart Francis are renowned for their brand of one-liner comedy. The software was created to try and mimic this type of humour but needs more 'cultural awareness' to become as funny as human comedians .","Software creates comedy by finding a connection between pairs of words .

Scared: Tulisa Contostavlos, pictured here at the Academy Awards, called police after men were spotted outside her house . English Defence League boss Tommy Robinson was questioned by police after he was spotted outside the home of Tulisa Contostavlos with a cameraman. Mr Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - was confronted by police officers and had his car searched after the former X Factor judge dialled 999. Friends of the star have said she feels 'victimised' by their activities and is still too scared to return to the £6million Hertfordshire home. However the men, who claim they were filming a documentary, were not arrested, and police decided that no crimes had occurred, the Sunday People reported. Mr Robinson had used her house as the backdrop for a video six days earlier in a video asking viewers for money. At the end of the video, he jokingly adds that the money could let the EDL 'buy a house like this', before walking towards it as if to go inside. The former N-Dubz member reportedly . tried to ignore the activity but eventually felt compelled to call the . police once she spotted the men outside her gated home late at night. A friend of Miss Constostavlos said: 'She's really shaken up - she has no idea why the EDL targeted her. 'She's absolutely not a supporter of the EDL, but she's never said anything publicly about them, so feels pretty victimised.' Four police cars and a dog unit were called to the house on September 11, while Miss Consostavlos's PA Gareth Varey confronted the men. A Hertfordshire Police spokesman confirmed that they had been called to the incident. He said: 'We were called at 10.23pm to reports of suspicious behaviour of two men in a vehicle outside a property. Scroll down for video . Filming: A video uploaded to YouTube shows EDL leader Stephen Lennon gesturing towards the star's house . Spotted: At the end of the video he walks towards the gated house as if to go inside . 'Both men were spoken to. As a precaution, we also searched the area. We were satisfied no crimes had occurred.' Mr Robinson, who tweeted pictures of the officers questioning him and searching his car, later said: 'It was just me and a camera guy who is making a documentary.' He then said that Mr Varey had 'started piping up cos we was [sic] making a 3 min vid in a lay by outside'. After the news emerged this morning, Mr Robinson tweeted 'Worst idea I've ever had!' Online: EDL Leader Stephen Lennon sent this tweet after police questioned him outside Miss Contostavlos's house . Some of the video the two men made outside the star's house had been uploaded to Youtube, and shows the EDL leader begging viewers for donations to pay legal fees. Mr Robinson tells his audience that he desperately needs money to pay a legal bill he said he had already run up trying to challenge police restrictions on one of the EDL's controversial marches. In a bizarre sign-off at the end of the video, Robinson addressed the camera and jokes: 'Please give us some money - so we can by a house like this.' He then adds: 'Who lives in a house like this?' before walking towards it as if to go inside. Miss Contostavlos, who is currently on bail on suspicion of dealing drugs, is said to be staying in north London, in a flat she previously shared with Mr Varey, until she feels safe enough to return to her Hertfordshire home.","Former X Factor judge called police after men seen filming outside her house .

The snug-fitting Equafleece, which comes in three colours, is said to relax nervous dogs, in the same way that swaddling soothes fractious babies. As stress levels fall, the dogs find it easier to breathe and cope with their fears. Scroll down for video . Tate the Tibetan Terrier wears his calming Equafleece which comes in three colours . By lightly touching the skin from back to belly, it is believed to encourage the release of oxytocin, the ‘cuddle hormone’ credited with creating feelings of calmness and closeness. Tate, a Tibetan terrier, is put in his Equafleece two or three times a week. His owner, Lisa D’Aguiar, of North London, said: ‘He panics if he hears people outside. ‘The T-shirt makes him calmer. His nerves don’t completely go away but he is chilled and he looks adorable in it.’ Another happy customer, Kate Reeves . from Shropshire, said: ‘I cannot believe how incredibly effective the . t-shirt was in calming my very anxious greyhound and how quickly she . changed from a shaking, drooling wreck into a snoozing, relaxed dog. ‘It continued to work brilliantly during fireworks and thunderstorms.’ Animal behaviour specialist Sarah Fisher says the Equafleece can also be used to reassure dogs that are anxious about travelling in a car or nervous of other animals. Matilda the British bulldog sports another variation of the t-shirt which is said to calm nervous dogs . Tate, Molly and Matilda pose in their Equafleeces that come in different sizes, the smallest being for a Chihuahua . Miss Fisher believes the hug-like feel of . the cotton over-rides the brain’s primeval instinct of fight or flight . in terms of trouble. Those with two legs also benefit. She said: ‘The owner feels he has . something proactive to do to help their dog instead of them getting . worked up by whatever is going on.' Miss Fisher, who assesses dogs for . court cases and teaches staff at animal shelters including Battersea . Dogs Home, said that a normal T-shirt should also have a calming effect. However, the Equafleece is a better option as it is doggy-shaped and contains enough stretch to allow pets to move properly. She said: ‘I am not a fan of dressing up dogs but I am a fan of t-shirts for dogs because they are so calming.’ Dog coats and jackets are thought to be less beneficial because they do not completely close over the belly and so fail to make the creature feel like it is being enveloped in a hug. The Equafleece t-shirts start at £13 for a Chihuahua or a small terrier. An XL shirt, for a retriever or a large greyhound costs £19.","The Equafleece comes in different sizes and colours to suit all dogs .

Appalled, she took a photo of the lid and its printed insult and sent it to her father, Doug Loates, who immediately penned a letter to the mega-firm. In the letter, seen by the Huffington Post, he told the company, '... the ""R"" word is considered a swear word in our family. We don't use it. We don't tolerate others using it around us.

The car is believed to have been shunted by another vehicle and forced off the road towards Mrs Cowley - who is registered blind and has tunnel vision - and her one-year-old son. Although the pram fell on its side Jacob only suffered a cut lip following the road accident. The incident happened close to a veterinary surgery and staff there came out to help Mrs Cowley, Jacob and Jet. Vet Caroline Purnell took Jet to see her owner immediately after the accident. Mrs Cowley said: 'She was worried about me but once she had licked my face and checked I was conscious she was fine.' Ms Purnell added: 'Mrs Cowley was face down on the floor with her left leg trapped on one side of a bollard. 'We really feel that she demonstrated exactly how important these dogs are. She showed no concern for her own safety and went to protect her handler’s child before helping her handler.' Mrs Cowley said Jet had been given extra treats and cuddles since the accident. 'She loves Jacob and thinks of him as her own. What she did was extremely brave and I am very proud of her,' she said.

Peaceful fungus-farming ants use their house guests as a useful standing army to protect their colony against dangerous threats, scientists claim. Here they go about their farming duties before any enemies arrive . The invasion begins as a group of hostile ants enter the colony. Danish researchers studied ant warfare between three parties to discover that cohabiting guest colonies of ants can serve as an effective front line defense for a colony. While ants are unusually free of infectious diseases, their societies are often invaded by social parasites; insects that exploit the resources of ant colonies for their own benefit and force the hosts to work harder. Such lodgers escape detection by the social immune . system of their hosts by producing bar-code like chemical recognition . labels similar to the host's own, while others use brute force or obnoxious chemicals to infiltrate or usurp host colonies. However, these unwelcome guests can come in useful for the host colony - despite the risk of being attacked from within - during times of great threats from the outside. More ants follow the impetuous scout into the colony and begin fighting the ants that live there. While ants are unusually free of infectious diseases, their societies are often invaded by social parasites; insects that exploit the resources of ant colonies for their own benefit . Researchers from the Centre for Social Evolution at the Department of Biology at the University of Copenhagen studied a colony of peaceful fungus-farming ants facing two natural enemies and reported the scenes were 'reminiscent of dramas in human history and literature'. Raider ants, the genus Gnamptogenys hartmani, seeking to enter the host's home, favour a swift style of attack to kill defenders, plunder a nest and steal food to usurp the original colony in a style of warfare not dissimilar to Genghis Khan in the Middle Ages. But the attackers did not reckon on the fungus-farming ants having powerful protectors - the fierceMegalomyrmex symmetochus guest ant parasite. Gnamptogenys hartmani raider ants favour a swift style of attack to kill defenders in a style of warfare not similar to Genghis Khan in the Middle Ages. Without the help of fiercer house guests the gentle farmer ants are easily killed by the hostile invaders (pictured) The researchers said the Megalomyrmex ants are the second natural enemy of the farmers and use alkaloid poison to permanently move in with a farming host colony to exploit its fungus farm at relative leisure. While these invader ants are a lifelong burden for the farmers, they can turn out to be a life-saving asset when mobile raiders threaten them, as the guest ants rise to the defense of their hosts. The scientists found that the guest ant defenses are so effective . that they not only kill raiders, but their mere presence greatly . decreases the probability of a raid. The researchers said house guest Megalomyrmex ants are the second natural enemy of the farmers but while they are a lifelong burden for the farmers, they can turn out to be a life-saving asset when mobile raiders threaten them, as the guest ants rise to the defense of their hosts, pictured . Their study showed that scout ants planning an attack can detect whether or not a host colony has a . cohabiting guest ant colony before deciding to initiate a raid so the . guest ants serve as an effective front line defense. Dr Rachelle Adams, the lead author of the study published in PNAS, said when a Megalomyrmex worker discovered an invading raider, she quickly returned to the cavity to excite her sister workers, and one by one they came out, soon overpowering the invaders, so a raid was prevented. The results of the study help explain why . the guest ant parasite is common in the Panamanian sites where the . colonies were collected; a very unusual situation as socially parasitic . ants are normally very rare. Here the house guest ants rush to defend their hosts and temporary home. The scientists found that the guest ant defenses are so effective that they not only kill raiders, but their mere presence greatly decreases the probability of a raid . The study illustrates how sophisticated and subtle co-evolutionary processes driven by natural selection can be. The results not only show that the idea that 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend' can work in the world of ants, but also that natural selection can maintain lesser evils when that helps prevent greater harm. Dr David R Nash, who was also involved in the study, said these kinds of interaction - where being a foe or friend depends on a the presence of a third party - are probably far more common than we realise, and may be fundamental for the co-evolution of interacting species. Here the house guest ant battles and eventually overpowers the raider.

His quips have helped make him one of Britain’s best-loved politicians but Boris Johnson last night confessed he sometimes has to ‘dare to be dull’. The man who once famously stated, ‘my policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it’ said he occasionally has to disappoint those awaiting his next gag. Mr Johnson, tipped as a future Tory leader, said some topics were too serious to merit witticisms. Serious: despite being seen as a sometimes comic figure Boris says some subjects are too serious for jokes . ‘Sometimes you have to have the wit to be dull. Dare to be dull. Dull it down,’ Mr Johnson, 49, insisted on the BBC Radio 4 documentary How To Be And How Not To Be A Politician.

The RAF's new £650milion fleet of second-hand spy planes will fly in U.S. colours because defence bosses say it is not cost effective to repaint them. Instead of the air force's uniform light grey, the three RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft, which were bought from the U.S., will keep their design of a white top, black nose and grey underside. The Ministry of Defence said it would cost £3million to repaint them. Paint job: The RAF's three RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft will retain the U.S. air force's colours of a white top, black nose and grey underside but the air force's roundels will be painted on . Repainting the aircraft would cost £3million to pay for trials to ensure the paint did not interfere with computer surveillance technology . Only the RAFs blue, red and white roundels will be added to the wings and fuselage of the aircraft. The MoD said repainting the craft would involve a series of expensive trials to check the paint did not cause problems with the planes' computer surveillance equipment. It is a further embarrassment for the ministry after it emerged that the RAF cannot refuel the planes in mid-air. Britain must rely on NATO nations and the U.S. to fill up the aircraft once they are in the skies. Critics are concerned about the reliance on Britain's allies. Mark Ayton, the editor of AIR International magazine, told The Sunday Times said: 'Anything the Ministry of Defence does to jeopardise sovereignty has got to be questioned.' Ministers bought three second-hand Rivet Joints from the U.S. Air Force in March 2010 to eavesdrop on enemy communications. The three planes replace the Nimrod fleet (pictured) after one crashed in Afghanistan, killing 14 servicemen . Renamed the Airseeker by the RAF, the vintage jets are being introduced to replace the Nimrod surveillance planes axed in 2011 after one blew up over Afghanistan, killing all 14 men on board. The aircraft are due to enter service next year but refuelling must be done on the ground, which will make it impossible to carry out airborne missions of more than 12 hours without begging help from allies. The problem is that the U.S. Air Force and other Nato countries use a different method of air-to-air refuelling than the RAF. The U.S. uses a boom refuelling system so a tanker aircraft would fly ahead of the Rivet Joint and pass back a rigid, hollow pipe which fits into its tank so fuel can be pumped into it - similar to how a car would be filled up at a petrol station. A MoD spokeswoman said: 'The MoD decided to configure our Rivet Joint aircraft to as close a common standard with the USAF as is possible, this has significant support cost benefits through life of the aircraft. 'When 51 Squadron personnel begin operating UK Rivet Joint aircraft they will wear RAF flying suits.'","Ministry of Defence said retain U.S. colours has 'significant cost benefits'

'Ghost' patients on the NHS cost the taxpayer a staggering £150m a year it has been revelaed. The scandalous statistics reveal the number of people signed up with GP's exceeds the population by more than 2million people, costing £450m over the last three years. It means hundreds of family doctors around the country could be boosting their income by keeping patients who have died or moved away on their treatment list. Crisis: The number of patients registered on the NHS database exceeds the population by more than 2million costing the taxpayer £450m (stock picture) The figures present a national 'crisis' while patients are struggling to get a doctors appointment, according to campaigners. The NHS have to cover the costs of these . phantom patients because doctors are given £66.25 for each person registered to their practice. Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'This is a scandalous waste of taxpayers’ money and further proof, if more was needed, that the heath budget is not being spent wisely. 'Given the amount of cash that has been thrown at NHS record system in recent years it’s absurd that so many ghost patients exist. 'Those who have cynically exploited this leak, along with officials who have allowed this problem to go unchecked, must be held to account for their actions.' Resigned: In 2011 Doctors Javanti and Arun Singh denied that more than 1,000 patients registered at their clinic were either dead or had moved overseas . The . Chief Executive of the Patients Association, Katherine Murphy said: . 'The NHS has been dogged by costly IT failures, PFI (private finance . initiative) projects and failures to manage its finances properly. 'It is facing an unprecedented funding squeeze, with billions of pounds to find in a budget which may in itself have a black hole of up to £30bn.' Last year 55,724,785 patients were listed with GPs, but only 53,493,729 people were said to be living in this country, costing £148m. Allegations: Dr Nusrat Mazhar was suspended in 2011 after she was found to have 'ghost patients' on treatment list in Streatham, South London . The system takes time for the systems to update when someone has died. so areas with a high number of elderly . patients such as Cornwall and Blackpool, Lancashire, are heavily affected. University cities also feature high up the list because students tend to register with a doctor for three to four years before moving away. Berkshire had the highest number of . phantom patients with 138% of the population being registered to . practices, according to an investigation by The Sunday Times. Cambridge and Hertsmere in Hertfordshire follow closely behind with 126%. The scandal comes two years after four doctors were suspended when 3,00 patients on their list were found to be non-existent or had false information about them. In addition, some patients at the practice, in South London, were recorded as suffering from dementia or obesity, or stated they were given drugs they had not taken, according to the General Medical Council. A report by the Audit Commission in . 2004 warned that the NHS could be wasting £100million a year paying . surgeries for patients who don’t exist. While many are kept on lists accidentally, officials at the watchdog warned that some GPs ‘conveniently forget’ to remove them. In the wake of the 2004 report, the . Department of Health ordered family doctors to ‘cleanse their lists and . remove ghost patients but many have failed to do so. In 2009 Birmingham GP Mohammad Cheema . was found to have more than 30 ghost patients, earning him an . additional income of about £2,500 a year. Practice: Doctors from Streatham Place Surgery, in London (pictured) were suspended during an investigation into their practices . In one case a family said they had been receiving letters from a surgery addressed to another person for 20 years. Dr David Geddes, NHS England’s head of primary care, said: 'In the majority of cases, GP practices work hard to keep their registered patient lists as accurate as they can and our area teams are working closely with them to achieve this. 'One of the main issues they face is that patients often fail to notify practices when leaving the area or country and this can mean that so-called ‘ghost’ patients remain registered. It is really important that patients keep their GPs informed if they are changing practices or leaving the area so that their registration can be amended. 'There can also sometimes be a short time lapse between updating national practice systems when a patient registers with another surgery, which can result in duplication. All efforts are made to ensure this is resolved as soon as possible.'","GPs are paid £66.25 for every patient on their treatment list .

Advert: Russian tennis player Anna Kournikova advertised the Shock Absorber sports bra range . Three of Britain's biggest department stores have been accused of colluding in a three year scheme to rip off thousands of consumers by fixing the price of sports bras. John Lewis, Debenhams and House of Fraser could face fines totalling more than £1billion if found guilty by the UK's competition authority. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) alleges the high street giants teamed up with DB Apparel to set the price of its Shock Absorber sports bra range on nine separate occasions between 2008 and 2011. DB Apparel, which also owns other brassiere brands including Wonderbra and Playex, allegedly told the retailers how much to sell its bras for - and even when to raise prices by as little as 50p. Shock Absorber was one of the most popular brands in the market, accounting for one of every six sports bras sold in the UK at the time. 'The OFT takes allegations of price-fixing seriously,' said Ann Pope, a senior director at the OFT. 'Resale price maintenance limits competition between retailers and can lead to consumers paying higher prices.' The recommended retail price for Shock Absorber's bras ranges from £25 to £38. But the manufacturer cannot dictate to retailers how much to charge for their wares. As a result most stores and websites sell the products at a much lower rate to try and undercut competitors. The four available bras on John Lewis website yesterday cost between £18 and £31. What the OFT is alleging is that, rather than suggesting the price to John Lewis, Debenhams and House of Fraser, DB Apparel told the three exactly what prices to charge, and even when to bring in increases. All three agreed with DB Apparel to these charges for the group's Spring and Summer ranges between 2008 and 2011, it is alleged. It is not known whether each of the retailers knew whether their rivals were in collusion with the clothing supplier. Disputed: DB Apparel UK, John Lewis, pictured, and the two other stores have all denied the claims . The news yesterday follows a 17 month-long investigation by the OFT into the alleged affair. Each . of the groups - John Lewis, Debenhams, House of Fraser and DB Apparel - . could face a fine of up to 10per cent of their global turnover if found . guilty. For John Lewis, the largest group, this could land it with a hefty charge of £950million. Debenhams, . which last year reported annual sales of £2.2billion, could face a . charge of £220million, while House of Fraser could end up with a . £120million fine. DB Apparel UK limited, the smallest of the group, only reported sales of £39million last year, so would face the smallest charge. But the group's parent company, which is registered in Paris, does not report results in the UK. None of the retailers would last night say how many bras they had sold in the period, or how much money they had made from the sales. Not just fixing prices: Anna Kournikova poses for the Shock Absorber sports bra in an advertisement campaign . 'We reject any allegations by the OFT that we have entered into any agreement or understanding with retailers as to their retail prices of our products,' said a spokesman for DB Apparel. 'We have been transparent with UK authorities since the beginning of this process and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this investigation.' A John Lewis spokesman said: 'John Lewis always strives to operate within the law and comply with regulations. We are fully cooperating with the OFT and will respond in due course.' A spokesman for Debenhams said: 'Debenhams disputes these provisional findings of the OFT but is not in a position to comment further at this stage. The matter is being dealt with by its external lawyers.' A House of Fraser spokesman said: 'We are co-operating fully with the Office of Fair Trading and the ongoing investigation and will respond accordingly. 'We are confident that we have been operating within all laws and regulations and are very supportive of any initiative which ensures pricing policies are fair for our customers.'","The Office of Fair Trading investigating makers of the Shock Absorber bra and three of Britain's biggest department stores .

And he warned of the ‘corrosive effect’ on players’ personalities when they spend hours ‘hunkered down in front of their computer’. Family: Nick Clegg, pictured with wife Miriam, said parents had a heavy responsibility to limit the time children play computer games . Mr Clegg was challenged about the impact of computer games after yobs mugged a fan who had become one of the first to the new Grand Theft Auto V — battering him over the head with a brick and knifing him in the back. The Lib Dem leader said his three sons Antonio, 11, Alberto eight and Miguel four played tennis and football games and not the 18-rated Grand Theft Auto. But he warned: ‘Even for very small kids they just get very wound up with these games so you have to try and ration them a bit. Clearly these games can have an incredibly powerful, and I suspect in some cases corrosive, effect on someone’s behaviour, someone’s outlook. ‘They get shut off, they don’t talk to other people, they just stay in their living room, their bedroom, hunkered down in front of their computer. ‘They occupy a sort of hermetically sealed world really of their own, and that can have a very detrimental effect.’ Popular: Hundreds of fans queued in anticipation of buying Grand Theft Auto V in Oxford Street, London, this week . He said many parents struggled in a ‘frightening unknown world’, and age restrictions were not enough. ‘But . in a free country what do you do, do you start saying to people they . can’t use it for more than x number of hours, no you can’t do that. ‘All . parents, we’ve got a heavy duty on our shoulders, a heavy . responsibility on our shoulders, particularly for those of us who didn’t . grow up with these games.’ Mr Clegg said he sits alongside his sons to watch what they are playing before calling time on the games. Copycat: Teachers warn children are increasingly copying the content of games, like Grand Theft Auto V . Asked how many hours is suitable on a Saturday night, he replied: ‘Not much, about an hour and a half on a Saturday night.’ The Association of Teachers and Lecturers has carried out research suggesting video games are  increasing violence among primary school-aged children. Alison Sherratt, president of the ATL said she was worried about the impact on children: ‘Until now, we’ve been warning of the dangers of children seeing these games, but saying it’s the parents responsibility to keep children away from them. 'We’ve had children crashing into others in toy cars in the playground. When asked about it they say they’ve been watching Grand Theft Auto. They are quite open about it — children of nine and ten.’","Deputy Prime Minister says he limits three sons' games use to 90 minutes .

Dismissed: Lord Chief Justice Sir John Thomas, pictured, judged that the claims of sex offender Chrisopher Prothero had no merit, and that he should be named . A child sex offender embroiled a High Court battle has been named after losing his fight to remain anonymous. Christopher Prothero, who was convicted of nine counts of indecent . assault and indecency with a child, was identified today by judges after losing his case. He had claimed that being identified would make it harder for him to get work and become a normal member of society - and also that it could identify his victim. But judges Sir John Thomas and Mr Justice Hickinbottom today slapped down his request and named him in a judgement delivered at the High Court in London. Prothero, who was jailed for his crimes in 2007 and released in 2010, had taken his case to the High Court to avoid having to give his bank account details to the authorities. Because he is on the Sex Offenders' Register, Prothero has to provide details of bank, debit or credit card accounts to the relevant authorities to enable them to track him down or investigate any potential offences. While his claim was being processed he was granted anonymity by the courts, but the judges said that they 'cannot see any basis' for keeping his identity secret. In their judgement Sir John said and Mr Justice Hickinbottom said: 'We are satisfied that nothing set out in this judgment will identify the victim of the claimant's crime.' They added: 'As to the contention that the claimant should be anonymised on the basis that he would be identified as a person on the Sexual Offenders Register and his rehabilitation impeded, there is nothing in the evidence before us which suggests that there are any special risks to him or to public order by him being identified.' As well as revealing Prothero's identity, the judgement also rubbished his claim that giving his details to the authorities was a breach of his human rights. He had argued that handing over the financial information was 'not proprtionate', 'not necessary', and that it was 'incompatible' with his human rights, which entitle everybody to a private and family life. The judgement was given at the High Court, which sits in London's Royal Courts of Justice, pictured . Outlining his case, the judges explained: ‘His case is that the requirements ... were an invasion of his privacy as he was concerned that the information might get into the wrong hands or be used by the authorities for some purpose other than that for which it was intended.' But they then went on to dismiss his argument, saying: 'We do not consider that the means employed are in any way inappropriate or disproportionate. 'They are plainly a practical and proportionate means of providing further protection to prevent other persons becoming potential victims of those on the Sexual Offences [sic] Register.'","Christopher Prothero was named today when judges slapped down his High Court bid .

More than £1.4 trillion has been spent on welfare payments since the turn of the century, the equivalent of every single person in the country paying out £22,500. The staggering sum – which includes state pensions, disability support and jobless benefits – is close to all the money made by Britain’s economy in a single year. Benefits spending has nearly doubled over the past decade to reach £157 billion last year, more than is spent on health and transport combined. More than £1.4 trillion has been spent on welfare payments since the turn of the century, the equivalent of every single person in the country paying out £22,500 . Official figures show the Isle of Wight as the unlikely welfare capital of Britain because of its many retirees. But when payments made to the elderly are excluded Liverpool is the country’s benefits hotspot. Sickness benefits are highest in old mining towns in Wales and County Durham while inner-city Birmingham gets the most dole money. Ministers insist they are carrying out the most radical reforms to the welfare state in 70 years: introducing a £500-a-week cap, forcing those signed off work sick to undergo tough assessments, introducing a simplified universal credit and by cutting child benefit for millions. But some experts believe they must go further as the population ages and millions languish out of work. Even the richest pensioners remain entitled to the winter fuel payment (at least £100 annually), a basic state pension (£110 a week) and free bus passes, while just this week Ministers pledged to extend free school meals to all children aged between five and seven as part of a £1 billion giveaway. Labour leader Ed Miliband announced this weekend that if his party wins the next Election it will scrap the so-called ‘bedroom tax’. Official figures show that when payments made to the elderly are excluded Liverpool, pictured left,  is the country's benefit hotspot, while the Isle of Wight, right, is the unlikely welfare capital of Britain because of the number of retirees . Doing so would add another £470 million to the annual welfare bill. Matthew Oakley, head of economics at Policy Exchange, David Cameron’s favourite think-tank, said: ‘If we are ever going to bring spending under control, we need to continue to reduce how much we spend on benefits. ‘Firstly it will mean making sure people who are mentally and physically able to work do all they can to wean themselves off benefits completely. ‘Some jobseekers are spending less than an hour a week looking for work. This is unacceptable. Even the richest pensioners remain entitled to free bus passes . 'Some claimants should have to spend more time in job centres. Others with little or no experience of working should be made to do community work for their benefits. ‘Secondly we need to tackle the rising cost of the state pension. It is expected to rise by £40 billion in the next 50 years. 'This means we need to both face up to the fact that we can’t afford universal perks like the winter fuel allowance and to accept that we all need to continue to work later in our lives.’ Patrick Nolan, chief economist of the think-tank Reform, added: ‘I think that while the Government has made some good moves they need to go much further and look at areas that have been politically off-limits, particularly around pensioner benefits.’ This graphic shows which areas have the largest welfare bills . Figures published by the Department for Work and Pensions show the massive growth of the welfare state. In 2000-01, as Labour started to roll out Gordon Brown’s complex system of tax credits, payments stood at £81.1 billion. Of this, £38.7 billion went on state pensions. Within a few years the total topped £100billion and on the eve of the last General Election in 2010 it had reached £146.2 billion. Ruth Porter, communications director at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘These figures are startling. They show throwing more money at poverty isn’t the answer.’ Liam Byrne, Labour’s Work and Pensions spokesman, said: ‘We’ll judge our success not by the money we spend but by the difference we make. 'We’ll put the social security system back on an even keel, once again setting a course for full employment, a living wage and a revolution in homebuilding.’ But a spokesman for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘Labour spent 13 years in government pouring billions of pounds into the benefits system and, in doing so, trapping the very people it was designed to help into cycles of worklessness  and dependency. ‘Our welfare reforms are returning much-needed fairness into the system and giving people an incentive to go back to work.’","Benefits spending has nearly doubled over the past decade to reach £157 billion last year .

Paul Gascoigne reportedly spent £4,000 in only a few hours during a drunken betting spree. Witnesses said they saw the troubled England legend dropping bundles of £20 notes at a bookmakers following a two-day drinking bender. Staff at the Coral shop in Boscombe, near his Bournemouth flat, eventually had him ejected, according to reports. Gascoigne, 46, was with a number of apparently drunk friends during the session on Wednesday. One member of staff even warned workers at a BetFred shop over the road about the former footballer's state in case he tried to continue gambling there. An onlooker told the Daily Star Sunday Gascoigne was 'swaying' and a worker behind the counter said he had spent thousands. He said: 'He is known as a legend, especially around here. But things are going too far now. 'He was surrounded by his entourage of drunken hangers-on, which was no surprise but God knows where he is getting all that cash from.' The former Newcastle, Tottenham Hotspur and Lazio star Gascoigne has battled alcoholism for many years and was sent to rehab in America in February. The £100,000 stay was organised and paid for by his host of famous friends including Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans and TalkSPORT presenter and former England cricketer Ronnie Irani. The move came following a charity appearance in Northampton during which the star appeared unwell and shaking, before breaking down and sobbing on stage in front of a room full of fans.

Comedian Jason Manford has slammed the ticket policy of the theatre company where he is performing, describing booking agents as 'parasites' that rip off fans. The married former One Show presenter - who quit the progamme in 2011 after being outed for sending graphic text messages to other women - is back on the stand-up trail. However, there was nothing funny about his comments regarding the management of Oxford's New Theatre company over their cut of his ticket sales. Disgusted: Comic Jason Manford launched an extraordinary Facebook tirade at the Oxford New Theatre over its ticket policy . Manford queried why the management were adding a £9 booking fee to the £22.50 face value price of the ticket, as well as taking a 20 per cent cut of the sales. Controversy: Manford may be performing at the Oxford New Theatre, but that didn't stop him laying into its policies . He took to his Facebook page and advised people not to book the tickets in that way and he would 'of course put on my best show as I do every night'. He wrote: 'Please please please do NOT buy these tickets. These booking agents are parasites of the highest order, overcharging you and making it look like it's the performer. 'I can only apologise for the people already booked, God bless you, I will of course put on my best show as I do every night. 'I just wish I'd have spotted it bloody sooner but all that is left to promoters and such like but just know that after this tour I will never play an ATG venue again until they lower their preposterous booking charges.

'I do my best to never rip anyone off but this makes my blood boil. I'm kicking myself for not noticing it sooner! Argh! Sorry!'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 08:11 EST, 22 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:16 EST, 22 September 2013 . Ed Miliband today tried to distance himself from New Labour’s vile culture of spin and smears. He insisted he had never been engaged in the sort of ‘reprehensible’ briefings against colleagues exposed in the memoirs of disgraced Gordon Brown spin doctor Damian McBride. And he insisted it was not in his nature to take part in such behaviour, claiming: ‘I am not sure I have ever been accused of being macho.’ Pressure: With the Labour conference dominated by revelations from the McBride memoirs, leader Ed Miliband tried to distance himself from the parties past . Critics will claim that this latest . allegation underlines the public interest in the amoral political world . in which Mr Brown’s spin doctor operated . The Labour party conference in Brighton risks being dominated by the McBride memoirs, which have lifted the lid on the relentless in-fighting, briefings and smears which dominated the last government. The scandal risks reminding voters of Mr Miliband’s role as a close lieutenant of Mr Brown, alongside shadow chancellor Ed Balls. This weekend Mr Balls admitted he was part of a blokeish culture which damaged Labour. He told The Times: 'The period up to 1997 and after, yes, it was macho. I look back on that as a time we were young and inexperienced. 'It was something both [Blair and Brown] allowed to happen. It was a mistake and it was damaging to the government.' But Mr Miliband today insisted he had urged Mr Brown to sack Mr McBride amid suspicions about his behaviour, which he said were ‘not my kind of politics’. Image conscious: Mr Miliband was seen walking in Brighton with his adviser Rachel Kinnock, daughter of former Labour leader Neil . The police could be called in to investigate whether Damian McBride broke the law when leaking government secretes, former No.10 spin chief Alastair Campbell has suggested. He accused Mr McBride, Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor, of having ‘admitted not just to venality but criminality’. Mr Campbell added: ‘I think the other thing that people should be aware of is he [McBride] has admitted to criminal offences in this.’ In his memoir, Mr McBride confesses to logging into Mr Brown’s official email account in the Treasury. He also admits leaking details of restricted and confidential documents. Labour frontbenchers said that Mr Miliband read the riot act to the first meeting of his shadow cabinet, insisting anyone caught briefing against colleagues would be fired. Mr Miliband insisted that he now led a ‘unified’ party. During an appearance on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Miliband was asked whether he could ‘look into your heart during that period and say to yourself that you were completely clean’. He replied: ‘I think that people who know me would say that I am someone who has never engaged in the factionalism and was never engaged in the briefing. ‘That wasn't my style of politics. It has never been my style of politics and I find it reprehensible and not something I would engage in. ‘I am someone who is deeply committed to the Labour Party and deeply committed to Britain and that is the way I have always approached my politics.’ However Mr McBride's account of vicious Labour in-fighting, serialised in the Mail, has cast a shadow over the party's conference. In particular serious questions have been raised about Mr Brown’s failure to act to stop the behaviour. Ex-cabinet minister Dame Tessa Jowell said Mr Brown must publicly state that he did not know about the activities of Mr McBride or have his own reputation tarnished. She says she is ‘sure’ Mr Miliband was aware of his activities. Dame Tessa, who claimed to be a victim of smears from Mr Brown's faction, told the Mail on Sunday: ‘Gordon is not an innocent, it is inconceivable he did not know what Damian was doing. Damian clearly felt it was implicitly sanctioned.’ Mr Brown should be ‘ashamed’ of employing Mr McBride. He must disown him – or suffer the consequences. ‘In the absence of a very clear statement by Gordon that he didn’t know about it, it damages his reputation. Only Gordon can deal with that.’ ‘If he refused, it would destroy the credit given to him for rescuing the country during the banking collapse.’ Revelations: Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper (left) warned Labour not to go back to the navel gazing of the past while Tessa Jowell said it was 'inconceivable' Gordon Brown didn't know about the smears revealed in Damian McBride's memoirs . Energy firms will be banned from increasing prices while making huge profits under a plan to be unveiled by Labour this week. Ed Miliband will take on gas and electric firms to stop them ripping off customers. Companies will also be forced to pass on savings when wholesale prices fall. Up to 4million pensioners will be automatically put on the cheapest tariff in a move which could save them up to £200 a year each. Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said: 'People are sick and tired of paying over the odds.' Senior Labour figures lined up to distance themselves - and their leader- from the McBride revelations. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, whose husband Ed Balls was a key Brownite, said Mr McBride was 'out of control'. She told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: 'I think this is ... about a kind of politics that really is appalling, that we should never go back to. 'It is something that happened some years ago, but I think it's a sign of how much the Labour Party has changed, the very different climate, the very different way in which Ed Miliband is managing things and operating things now, that's a good thing, we don't want to go back to the navel gazing of the past.' Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said of the ex-spin doctor: 'He's a relic from the past. There is no place for that kind of nasty, vile politics in Britain today. I am glad we've seen the back of him.' He said he was at a shadow cabinet meeting where Mr Miliband was 'very clear he will not tolerate any of that kind of behaviour'. 'If anyone is found to be briefing against anybody you will be out, there's no discussion. That's not the way Ed Miliband does things,"" he told a fringe meeting organised by the New Statesman magazine. 'If any good comes from Damian McBride's indulgence, it's to remind people that that's not the way we do things. 'Everybody who was around then, and is still around, knows how damaging that was. Think how much more we could have achieved if so much energy had not been expended on this nonsense.'","Labour leader condemns 'reprehensible' behaviour by ex-No.10 spin doctor .

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling accused Labour and the Lib Dems of wanting to 'clobber the rich' A Tory Cabinet minister has launched an attack on Labour and his Liberal Democrat colleagues, claiming they want to penalise the nation's 'wealth creators'. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling hit out at Labour as he warned against the 'politics of envy' and efforts to 'clobber the rich'. Mr Grayling said protecting the interests of job creators would be a Tory 'red line' in any future government. Yesterday, Ed Miliband declared he was bringing back socialism as he unveiled a raft of left-wing policies including an increase in wages for the lowest paid and forcing schools to stay open for longer. Mr Grayling said Labour wanted to squeeze the rich to pay for a larger welfare state. In an article in the Sunday Telegraph timed to coincide with the start of the Labour Party conference today, Mr Grayling said: 'The politics of . envy is back. What do Labour want to do? They want to penalise the . wealth creators. Higher taxes for the rich. 'To pay for what Labour really wants - a bigger and bigger welfare state.' The CBI and Institute of Directors criticised Labour's manifesto pledges, insisting that 'growth must come first'. Labour shadow Treasury minister Rachel Reeves indicated people earning £60,000 a year might not feel 'particularly rich' and should not be targeted by tax increases. She insisted Labour had 'no plans or desire' to increase taxes for people in that income bracket, but instead the focus would be on the 'privileged few' at the very top of the income scale. Ed Miliband (pictured with family in Brighton) pledged to bring back socialism at the Labour party conference . Labour shadow minister Rachel Reeves (left) said people earning £60,000 a year should not be targeted by tax rises and aides to Nick Clegg say the Lib Dems want to focus on taxing wealth rather than income . The Liberal Democrats have made a levy on properties worth more than £2 million a flagship policy and at the party's conference a briefing to MPs suggested people with an income of £50,000 could be in line for tax hikes. Aides to Nick Clegg strenuously denied that there was any plan to 'clobber' people on £50,000, insisting that the party was focused on taxing wealth rather than income. Mr Grayling's comments will be seen as a further distancing in policy between the Conservatives and their Coalition partners, whose party conference was held last week, as the Tories seek an outright victory at the General Election. 'One of the big themes of last week's conference was higher taxes,' Mr Grayling said. 'They want to penalise the wealth creators too. Both say it's a red line for any future government.' But in a message aimed at rallying support ahead of his party's conference in Manchester later this month Mr Grayling said: 'Conservatives want to support wealth creators and job creators. That's a red line for us.'","Chris Grayling said parties want to penalise UK's 'wealth creators'

When the crash site was located earlier this year by excavation teams from the U.S. and Laos, the men were identified and personal items were collected. 'We have made a commitment as a state . and country to never forget the sacrifices of Prisoners of War and those . still Missing In Action,' Veterans Affairs Commissioner . Many-Bears Grinder told Fox News. Major Sizemore was flying the aircraft, and Major Andre was acting as his navigator when they were hit by enemy fire, according to the POW Network. In an online tribute, James Sizemore said his father had been returning to a base in Thailand after a bombing mission over the Ho Chi Min trail when he crashed. A ground team was said to have later . reported that the men could not have survived the crash and they were . listed as 'killed in action - body not recovered'. When . the servicemen are laid to rest on Monday, an unofficial flyover, including the same model of aircraft the airmen had been using, will take . place near the cemetery. It is being organized by the Warrior Flight Team, and all the aircraft will be flown by veterans. Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam has also ordered flags to be flown at half mast on state buildings to honor Major Andre. Honor: The airmen will receive a full military burial at Arlington on Monday . 'The recovery of Major Andre is a reminder that our commitment to remember should endure until all of our service members are brought home,' Ms Grinder said. The Defense POW Department uses a team of about 100 people to help trace missing servicemen and prisoners of war from the Second World War to current conflicts. More than 83,000 American servicemen are still unaccounted for since the Second World War.","Bodies of Major Andre and Major Sizemore identified in Laos this year .

Ed Miliband’s party conference risks being derailed by claims he has a £27billion blackhole in his spending plans. Analysis by Treasury officials suggests a raft of Labour promises would require more than £1,000 extra borrowing per household in 2015. In a further sign of confusion in Labour promises, Mr Miliband today refused to guarantee he would increase the minimum wage despite complaining that it has fallen as the cost of living soared. Questions: Labour leader Ed Miliband was forced to deny making spending commitments worth £27billion . The Labour faces increased pressure with a new poll showing just 20 per cent of people think he has the right policies for the economy, just half of the 38 per cent who back the Tories. He used the start of the party conference in Brighton to declare that he was ‘bringing socialism back’ to Britain. He unveiled a raft of promises including more 8am-6pm childcare at schools, monitoring the number of women on TV and forcing firms who hire foreign workers to also take on British apprentices. But he was forced to deny committing to billions of pounds of promises without saying how they would be paid for. Borrowing: The Tories produced this list of policies which Labour has committed to . The Tories produced a document dubbed a Budget for Borrowing, which points to pledges including cutting VAT to 17.5 per cent, at a cost of £12.75billion, scrapping the one per cent cap on benefits rises worth £2.68billion and introducing a 10p starting rate of tax at a cost of £2billion. By contrast Labour has promised to raise only £105million from scrapping the winter fuel allowance for pensioners on the top rate of tax and reversing stamp duty changes to raise £145million. Today Mr Miliband dismissed the claim that there is a £27.9 billion black hole in his party's spending plans as ‘nonsense’. He insisted Labour would not increase borrowing to fund day to day spending in its first year of power if the party wins the next election. He told BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show: ‘Let me be clear, we have said in 2015/16 that Labour won't be borrowing more for day to day spending. ‘We have been absolutely clear about that. The next Labour government will be facing different circumstances from the last. ‘Ed Balls and I have both said times are going to be tough and frankly I think Treasury ministers should be worrying about the cost of living crisis facing families and not making up things about the Labour party.’ The Tories compiled the figures after anaylsying speeches, articles and interviews given by Labour frontbenchers since Mr Miliband became leader, and added up what their pledges would cost. Conservative treasury minister Savid Javid said the £27.9 billion of unfunded policies in 2015-16 was the equivalent of £1,059 additional borrowing for every household. Issues: When asked which party has the best policies on the economy, 38 per cent said the Conservatives compared to just 20 per cent who said Labour . Mr Javid added: ‘In the three months since Ed Miliband promised ‘discipline’ on borrowing, Labour have committed themselves to £27.9 billion of debt-funded spending – more than £1,000 of additional borrowing for every household. ‘This shows that Ed Miliband is too weak to deliver on his promises. Nothing has changed. ‘It’s the same old Labour. They still want more spending, more borrowing and more debt – exactly what got us into a mess in the first place. ‘And it’s hardworking people who would pay the price through higher taxes and higher mortgage rates.’ Clash: BBC interviewer Andrew Marr repeatedly pressed Mr Miliband on whether he would increase the minimum wage . Mr Miliband repeatedly insisted he would take action to help families cope with rising cost of living. He said Labour would 'crack down' on companies that failed to pay workers the minimum wage and would look at 'strengthening' a higher minimum wage in certain sectors, such as finance. Labour . claims the £6.19 rate for adults is now 45p lower than if it had kept . pace with the rate of inflation. If increased to restore its value, . someone working 37 hours-a-week would by £865 better off, before tax. But asked if the minimum wage should increase, Mr Miliband repeatedly refused commit to a rise. 'The minimum wage must be set at a level where it is not going to cost jobs, that's really important and so that's what we have got to look at,' he said. Asked if the basic minimum wage would go up, he told Andrew Marr: 'That's something we are going to look at. 'I want to see the minimum wage go up over time but if I was coming on this programme and saying I'm just going to pluck out of the air a figure of how much the minimum wage will go up by, you would say ""is that really responsible?"".' Family affair: As the Labour conference got underway in Brighton, Mr Miliband was joined by wife Justine take their children Daniel (right) and Sam (left) for a walk along the beach . Mr Miliband also said large firms will have to train up a British apprentice for every overseas worker they bring to the UK while he would ensure apprenticeships in Britain are 'gold standard'. He believes the policy could result in the creation of 125,000 new apprentices over five years because the long-term solution for the UK economy is to develop a highly skilled homegrown workforce.","Tories claim promises mean an extra £1,000 of borrowing for every family .

Senior Aircraftman Scott Hughes, 20, who was on his way home from a tour in Afghanistan, was killed by a speedboat while on a stop off in Cyprus . A British airman on a Cyprus beach break after fighting in Afghanistan died when he was struck by a speedboat, an inquest heard. Senior Aircraftman Scott Hughes, 20, was relaxing with comrades before they were due to return home the next day. SAC Hughes, from Gwynedd, North Wales, had survived a six-month tour of duty battling the Taliban and taking part in ‘demanding and dangerous operations’, including evacuating wounded soldiers. But as the gunner with 1 Squadron Royal Air Force Regiment swam in the Mediterranean in November 2010, he was hit by the boat. He suffered severe head injuries and died two days later in a hospital in Limassol. Flight Sergeant Scott Andrews told the hearing that his comrade said ‘help me, I’m dying’ as he was pulled from the water. SAC Hughes and his comrades had been flown to Cyprus by the military for two days of 'decompression activities' before returning to civilian life back home. The military organised water sports on a beach within hours of them landing. About 120 soldiers and airmen were given a briefing before going kayaking and riding on the rubber ring being towed by the boat. All the men had to pass a simple swimming test before being allowed to take part wore helmets and brightly coloured buoyancy vests. But the inquest heard SAC Hughes, of Caernarfon, North Wales, fell off the rubber ring and began swimming back to the pontoon - as many others had that day. The Cypriot speedboat driver and helper were then seen heading back towards the pontoon where others were waiting for their turn. Pictured here is the beach where the young gunner was enjoying a day of 'fun and relaxation' after the gruelling tour . Llandudno coroners’ court heard witnesses shouted 'stop' because they could see it heading for Scott. 'Scott was pulled onto the wooden pontoon and said: ""Help me, I'm dying""' Flight Sergeant Andrews . Flight Sergeant Andrews told the inquest: 'My opinion was that they didn’t see him fall in or he would have been collected.' Coroner Nicola Jones asked: 'Do you think they should have seen him considering what he was wearing?' Flt Sgt Andrews replied: 'Yes.' He said the boat travelling at a 'fairly low speed' went over the young gunner. Flt Sgt Andrews struggled to hold back tears as he told the inquest how SAC Hughes was pulled onto the wooden pontoon and said 'help me, I’m dying.' He said he was obviously seriously injured after being struck by the power boat operated by the Military Training Wing. He was treated by colleagues from the Cyprus Sovereign Base who were trained paramedics and had medical equipment nearby. The gunner underwent three operations in a hospital in Limassol, but died two days later in November 2010. The inquest heard he had been on 'dangerous operations', including taking part in casualty evacuation tasks. The inquest is expected to last until Friday.","Senior Aircraftman Scott Hughes, 20, was struck by a speedboat in Cyprus .

One of two rusting cars hauled out of an Oklahoma lake this week is believed to contain the remains of three teenagers who have been missing since 1970, police say. The blue Chevrolet Camaro matched the description of the car 18-year-olds Thomas Michael Rios and Leah Gail Johnson, and 16-year-old Jimmy Allen Williams were last seen in. An Oklahoma sheriff has now said investigators are confident that three sets of remains found in the car belong to the friends, who were last seen heading to a football match. Vanished: From left, Jimmy Williams, 16,  Leah Gail Johnson and . Thomas Michael Rios disappeared in 1970 . Missing: Jimmy Williams poses next to his then brand-new Camaro as a 16-year-old in 1970 . In total, six sets of remains have been found in the two car wrecks, which were discovered as police tested sonar on the lake last week, according to Fox News. 'We believe that we have two vehicles related to two different missing persons cases,' Custer County Sheriff Bruce Peoples said. 'One is a case from Beckham County in 1970, and the other is a case from Washita County in 1969.' Even though the cars are linked to cases years apart, they were found submerged side by side, 12ft under the surface. Bottles of beer were also found in the car believed to belong to the teenagers, according to the Daily Elk Citian. 'None of the human remains in the Camaro show signs of trauma on first inspection, but keep in mind that they're covered in mud and will need to be examined further,' Sheriff Peoples said. Although officers are confident they have found the teenagers, it could take up to a year before DNA results confirm the identities. Police are also just beginning to investigate the remains found in the second car. 'They're getting into the trunk. We don't have any information yet on how many sets of remains may be in there,' Sheriff Peoples said. Scroll down for video . Baffled: The discovery of two rusting vintage cars containing six bodies has reignited the mystery of how three teenagers and three other people vanished more than four decades ago . Evidence: An investigator takes a picture of a shoe at the crime scene where six bodies and two cars were pulled from the lake . Shock discovery: It happened in Custer County, Oklahoma, when officers went to Foss Lake to take out a new sonar detection system, just to see how well it worked . Three bodies believed to be those of local teenagers who disappeared in 1970 were discovered inside the Camaro . The other car - a 1950 model Chevrolet - contained three bodies believed to be those of Washita County residents who went missing in the early 1960s . He added: 'This lake isn’t crystal clear. It’s a . typical western Oklahoma lake with a lot of silt in it. The visibility . is only 6 to 12 inches on a good day,' he said. The mystery surrounding the teenagers' disappearance led to theories that they had stumbled across a crime and been murdered. It is too early to tell what happened to the victims found in the two cars, but Sheriff Peoples said: 'We'll treat it as a crime until we're able to determine it's a simple car wreck.' he added that it was possible the people simply drove into the lake and drowned. Retired Sheriff Howard Sampier had been working the night the teenagers went missing. He said: 'Never really had any good leads to speak of. We never had any sort of lead or idea about the Foss Lake area.' The . friends had told their families they were heading to a football game so . the search for them centered on possible routes they could have taken. A . lake on the route they were supposed to have taken had even been . searched previously, but it turns out the police could have been looking . in the wrong place entirely. Although . the cars were found close to a boat ramp, Sheriff Peoples said the . water is so cloudy it was understandable that they had remained . undetected. Investigation: It could take up to a year to fully identify the remains of those found in the two cars . Closure: The sheriffs office hopes the discovery of the cars will help provide answers to the victims' families . The . second car is thought to contain the remains of a 69-year-old man and . his two friends who went missing in the state in the late 1950s or early . 1960s. Reports yesterday by local station KFOR states that one of the victims in the car thought to have belonged to the teenager has been identified but they are waiting to notify all of the relatives of the victims involved before releasing any names. The teenagers went missing on November 20, 1970. They . are still listed as missing persons and were thought to have been . headed to a football game in nearby Elk City but also could have . detoured to go hunting at Foss Lake. Authorities . discovered the cars accidentally. Betsy Randolph, spokesman for the . Oklahoma Highway Patrol, said dive teams were at Foss Lake conducting . training with sonar when they came upon the vehicles last week. 'So . they went back and did a scheduled dive today and were going to recover . the cars. When they pulled the cars out of the water, the first one . that came out they found bones in the car,' she said.

Other victims: Local news reports claim that the three people inside the Chevrolet were a 69-year-old man from Elk City and his two friends . Rusted: Police divers were sent down to investigate the cars before they were pulled out of the lake and the bones were discovered . Investigation: Custer County Sheriff Bruce Peoples said the decomposed nature of the cars made it difficult to positively identify them at the scene . The two cars are seen above. The remains found inside are to be turned over to the medical examiner's office who are expected to use DNA from surviving family members to identify the skeletons . When . they pulled the second car out, another set of bones was discovered. The divers then went back in the water and searched around and found a . skull, she said. Jimmy Allen Williams, 16, and his friends Thomas Michael Rios, 18, and Leah Gail Johnson, 18, disappeared on On Nov. 20, 1970. Jimmy, who had a part time job at a grocery store, had bought himself a brand new Camaro muscle car six days earlier. He told his parents he was going to a football game, but according to reports at the time, he backed up his car to the back door of the home and loaded several shotguns into the trunk with the help of one of his younger brothers. According to one of his friends called Wayne, the three friends were actually going on a shooting trip. Wayne said he was had planned to join them but changed his mind at the last minute because there was not enough room for him in the car. The three teenagers never returned home. The . remains were turned over to the medical examiner's office who are . expected to use DNA from surviving family members to identify the . skeletons. 'We thought it was just going to be stolen vehicles and that's not what it turned out to be, obviously,' Ms Randolph said.

Claims: Scotland Yard has reportedly interviewed the wife of a soldier that said Princess Diana was assassinated by the SAS . An SAS soldier claimed Princess Diana was killed after a member of the elite unit shone a light in her driver's face causing him to crash, it has been claimed. The man, known only as Soldier N, is said to have made the astonishing allegations to his wife after taking Prince William on an advanced driving course in 2008. Scotland Yard reportedly decided to review the historic case 16 years after Diana's death in a Paris underpass, after interviewing the woman who insists her former husband was telling the truth. And in a dramatic twist, the investigation could unearth recordings of the crash after security experts today revealed Diana's phone was bugged. It is understood the recent development comes after Soldier N's ex-wife told police last month her husband revealed the secret when he was teaching William how to drive with SAS colleagues. 'We were talking about it...and I said it was sad that his mum wasn't there to see it. 'Then he said one of the guys was responsible for the accident, for the death of Diana. I was shocked. I believed what he said', the Sunday Mirror has reported. When the woman quizzed her husband about his theory he reportedly told her the SAS had been following Diana and Dodi Al Fayed, who also died in the accident, and that a light was shone into the Paris tunnel before their car crashed. When she asked him how anyone could do something like that he allegedly responded: 'It's an order, a job's a job.' The wife reportedly claimed her husband had told her the 'hit' had been instructed by individuals in the royal inner circle because they disapproved of Diana's relationship with Fayed. The forthcoming investigation will probe claims today from a key source in the UK security industry that GCHQ was remotely taping Diana and Dodi up until the moment of the crash. The source told the Sunday Express the controversial couple had their phones tapped. It follows news confirmed by a French inquiry that CCTV images of Diana's final hours, supposedly lost, have been held in secret. The source, who worked in 'black ops', told the paper: 'There is no doubt that this technology was used on Diana and all around her, and for very human reasons she was regularly listened to live in the moment.' He added, because she was a prime intelligence target, GCHQ operatives 'would have wanted and had the capacity to listen live to the conversations in the car as it sped away from the Ritz.' Diana, 36, Fayed, 42, and their driver Henri Paul, 41, were killed in the crash in 1997. The Princess' bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was seriously injured. Soldier N, a former sniper, told his former wife, who revealed the conversation to her own mother years later when asked who would possibly have carried out the murder. Crash: Conspiracy theories have long surrounded Diana's death in Paris in 1997 despite the official finding that it was an accident caused by paparazzi photographers . She alleged a white car and . motorbike were involved in the plot which enlisted the services of one . of Soldier N's former SAS colleagues. Al . Fayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed has always asserted the pair's deaths . were the result of a planned murder at the hands of the British . Establishment and MI6, and similarly claims a white Fiat was involved in the . crash but has never been traced. The . woman and her mother reportedly met with detectives last month . including a senior officer who worked on the original Operation Paget . investigation into Diana's death. The . two women offered convincing accounts of what caused the crash. The . soldier's former wife insisted he had made the claims two years before . the break up of their marriage at a time when he confided in her with . full trust. Couple: Diana and Dodi pictured on CCTV at the Ritz Hotel in Paris just hours before the fatal crash . When asked by officers why she hadn't reported her husband's theory earlier the woman said she had been sworn to secrecy. The woman's mother first alerted authorities to the claims in September 2011 in a letter to Dyfed Powys Police after her daughter and son-in-law divorced. She reportedly also wrote to Prime Minister David Cameron, Defence Secretary Phillip Hammond and army head General Sir Peter Wall about the Soldier N's aggressive behavior following the break down of his marriage. It is believed these correspondences contained details of the plot. Though the woman claims to have received acknowledgements from Downing Street and General Wall, neither made any mention of Diana or any suspicion surrounding her death. In 2011 Dyfed Powys Polcie seized a gun and ammunition from Soldier N's marital home after his mother-in-law reported his tendencies for violent behavior. Last journey: Diana leaves the Ritz Hotel shortly before her death in the Paris underpass . Diana is pictured moments before the crash which the woman claims was caused after an SAS soldier shone a light into the eyes of driver, Henri Paul (right). Diana's bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones (left) was the accident's only survivor . The man was jailed for two years by a military court last May after admitting illegal possession of a firearm, but was freed in July and later discharged from service. Later that month the man appeared in the court martial for his former SAS housemate, Danny Nightingale, 38, for illegal possession of a pistol and ammunition. It was during this time the allegations about Diana's death were revealed. An inquest into the accident found Diana and Al Fayed died unlawfully as the result of gross negligence of driver, Henri Paul, who was said to have been drinking before the crash.

British hop growers are celebrating a vintage crop after the perfect blend of warm sunshine and rain helped farmers produce one of the best batches in years. But the crisp autumn sunlight which was shining as farmers brought in the harvest cannot hide the dark clouds which have gathered over the country's once great hop growing industry. From its heyday in the 19th century, when around 77,000 acres were dedicated to growing the beer making ingredient, just 2,471 acres are now farmed for hops. Mists and mellow fruitfulness: Ali Capper family's farm in Suckley, Worcestershire, grows enough hops to make 46 million pints of beer . Sweet delight: Warm summer weather has resulted in a perfect crop of aroma-rich hops . Ripe for harvest: Workers inspect the hops in Suckley, Worcestershire, to ensure they are in the perfect condition for harvesting . Today, British hops account for just . 1.6 per cent of the world's production, while the two giants America and . German of the industry have each managed to grab around a third of global production. Ali Capper, who grows 100 acres of hops, from her family run farm, in Suckley, . Worcestershire, said: 'British hop aromas are delicate, complex and . brew the most interesting and balanced beer in the world. Fact. We are . famous for it. 'Because of our maritime climate - . we're the only maritime climate growing region in the world - that's . what makes our hop aromas so distinct. But there has been a gradual decline in production since the 80s. 'One of the biggest factor's in . British hop production decline is down to the explosion in popularity of . lager, which uses far fewer hops.' Balancing act: Once the time is right, workers spring into action to cut down the bumper crop of hops . Hard work: Workmen get stuck into the arduous task of harvesting the 100 acres of hops at one of the country's biggest producers of the plant . Harvest: Hundreds of miles of hop bines are brought into a warehouse to being the painstaking process required to make beer . Reaping rewards: Within a few days of harvest starting, workers will have reaped the crop from the fields and begin the process of making beer . Sorting: The rush is on to get the hops, pictured left up close, from field to fermentation as soon as possible after harvesting in order to preserve their freshness . Still going strong: The giant Bruff Hop Picking Machine was built in the village in 1960 . Taking the strain: The aging Bruff Hop Picking Machine resembles a giant threshing machine and helps the farm sort millions of hop flowers from the leaves and wood . 'She added: 'We've . been less adept at exporting our hops, probably due to the vertical . integration of our industry - i.e., the grower doesn't sell directly to . the brewer, he sells to a merchant.' Brewing starts with barley which is malted, or soaked in water until grains germinate, to unlock the starches. The grains are heated in a kiln, which stops germination. The malt is crushed into a powder, and then mixed with hot water. Hops were introduced to Britain in the 16th century by Dutch brewers; they add bitter flavour and aroma to the beer, but also act as a preservative. The porridge-like mixture, called Wort, is boiled with hops in a vessel called a copper for at least an hour. The most traditional brewers use the whole flowers of the hop. After boiling, the hopped wort is run over a bed of the boiled hops as a filter. The wort is then cooled and run into fermentation tanks, where yeast is added. Yeast is a microscopic fungus which feeds off the fermentable sugars, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide. Leftovers from this process might be turned into Marmite. There are four merchants currently operating in Britain - two are German/American owned. Much of Britain's hop production is still based in two traditional growing areas of Britain: the Midlands and the South East. Mrs Capper explained: 'Herefordshire and Worcestershire grow the largest proportion of crops - just over half of the country's production. Kent, and neighbouring counties produce the rest. 'The reason for those two areas is purely labour. Pre-mechanisation, from the 1950s back, all hops were hand picked and that involved thousands of people. And they came on hop picking holidays from Birmingham and the Black Country factories and the factories of the East End of London.' But it is not all bad news for British hop growers. In the past few years the humble plant has seen a resurgence, in part thanks to the growth in micro-breweries and customers seeking a more local and unique product. Last month alone, 187 micro-breweries were set up - bringing the total number of niche producers to well over 1,000. And this year's fantastic harvest means beer . drinkers are in for a tasty treat as the weather caused an increase in the aroma levels in the hops. The yield will be slightly less than . average because the bines stopped growing at the height of summer, but . this helped to concentrate the exceptional flavours. Mrs Capper's farm has grown enough of . the plant to make a dizzying 46 million pints of beer. But all this . crop was not harvested with the latest, state-of-the-art technology. Instead, the same machine, which has been helping process the harvest . for more than 50 years was, again, hard at work at Stocks Farm. The giant Bruff Hop Picking Machine, . built by in the village in 1960, resembles a giant threshing machine . that you might see at a vintage machinery fair or on the pages of a . history book. Over the . five-week harvest the noisy machine separates 80 tons of hop flowers. The hops are separated from the leaves and stalks as they move around an . elaborate system of pullies, conveyor belts and open spinning wheels, . before being dried and bailed. Laborious: The ripe hops are painstakingly raked into a thin layer to be dried . Hard work: Despite the advent of more modern machinery, human toil is still a vital part of the hop harvesting process . Mrs Capper said: 'It's all very Heath-Robinson. But we prefer to use this old machine ‚ it's really quite gentle on the hops. 'Bruff machines, built here in Suckley, were shipped all over the world. 'They're still in use today in farms as far a field as New Zealand.' Stocks . Farm supply their hops to many large British regional breweries . including Marston's, Fullers and Greene King and also ship to thousands . of craft brewers across the country and round the world. Mountains of work: A staggering 80 tons of hop flowers will be processed during just a few days of harvest . Putting your back into it: Each refreshing pint of beer is the result of hours of labour and hard effort . Ready for brewing: These hops are destined for many large British regional breweries including Marston's, Fullers and Greene King . The 19th century was the golden age of the hop industry. Hop acreage continued to increase until 1878 when it reached its peak with 77,000 acres. Families would flock from the industrial heartlands of Birmingham and the East End of London to help harvest hops, in a scene similar to the one pictured right, in nearby counties. Tastes changed and a decline in the demand for porter and a surging demand for a lighter beer known as Indian Ale or Pale Ale, became fashion. Pasteurization arrived in the late 1870s and fewer hops were needed as a preservative. Clean water became more available and this may have reduced demand for beer. There were only 32,000 acres of land growing hops by 1909 and a renewed import of foreign hops. This was due to breweries being contracted to brew foreign beers under licence, and thus being required to use the hops stipulated in the original recipe. Twenty-three years later and acreage had fallen to 16,500. The producer-controlled Hops Marketing Board was created to control the flayling industry. The Board would negotiate a guaranteed price with the growers and the brewers would indicate their expected demand to the Board, resulting in allocated quotas to each grower. This brought stability and by 1968 acreage had slowly increased to 17,900 acres. However, in 1982 EEC rules led to its disbanding and the introduction of independent producer groups for the marketing of English hops. Today, the current acreage given over to hops is just 2,471.

A driver claimed he could not tax his car because he had taken too much Viagra. The motorist suggested he had been unable to leave the house to buy a new tax disc after over-dosing on the anti-impotence pill. He was one of dozens of people who tried to avoid paying road tax for their vehicle by submitting increasingly implausible excuses. Scroll down for video . Excuses: A claim that a driver had taken too much Viagra is among a list of silly excuses given to DVLA to explain why vehicles are not properly taxed . Almost all drivers pay to tax their vehicles or declare that it has been taken off road. But the DVLA today released some of the silliest excuses given by people caught out for not paying their road tax. It includes admissions that the money has been spent on betting on a horse race instead or that the person could not tax their vehicle because they had ‘man flu’ or had fallen out of a tree while picking plums. Tax: More than 99 per cent of people do pay for a tax disc for their vehicle . Others suggested that they did not have to tax their car because it would have cost more than the vehicle was worth or their were owed more in a rebate from the taxman. The age old school favourite – that a dog had eaten the papers – also featured on the list. Carolyn Williams, DVLA’s head of digital services, said: ‘The vast majority of people tax their car on time but it amazes me to see the excuses people come up with. ‘It’s easier than ever before for people to tax their car and our digital services are designed to be used any time of day or night to fit in with people’s lifestyles - so there really is no need for silly excuses.’ Latest figures show that 99 per cent of vehicles are properly taxed or declared off road. If a vehicle is not taxed or declared ‘SORN’ the owner could face a penalty fine. If the vehicle is seen parked on a public road it could be clamped, impounded and ultimately crushed.","Implausible excuses falling out of a tree and spending the money on a bet .

But hidden beneath Birmingham's Longbridge site lies a greater, even prouder British secret - and one that helped with the war against Nazi Germany. The ‘Shadow Factory Tunnels’ are the remnants of Lord Austin’s secret plans that were hatched to bolster British military might in the face of German military aggression in the arms race that led up to the start of the Second World War. Scroll down for video . Hidden depths: The abandoned Shadow Tunnels, built in the pre-war years, lie hidden beneath the Longbridge factory in Birmingham . This was where munitions workers produced the Merlin engines that powered the Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes used to regain control of the British skies during the Battle of Britain in 1940. The Shadow Scheme involved two parts - building nine new factories and extending existing factories - including the Longbridge plant. Australian-born industrialist and . Conservative MP, Lord Austin - also the founder of Austin Motors - had already contributed to the war effort in the First World War, turning his factories to munitions and engine production. He was appointed to lead the Shadow Scheme by the head of the Air Ministry, Lord Swinton, . after then Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain vowed in the desperate . build-up to WW2 to rapidly expand UK production of war machines, . weaponry and ammunition. While . the factory at Longbridge was built underground to ensure the increase . in war production was well-protected from possible bombing. Video courtesy of Michael Scott at photoaddiction . Shadow plan: The Government scheme involved the development of nine different factories and extensions to existing factories - such as the site at Longbridge . War effort: At the peak of the scheme in the 1940s, there were 26 shadow factories operating in Britain, producing munitions and parts for war vehicles and aircraft . Mass production: Tens of thousands of workers across Britain worked in shadow factories during the peak years of the scheme, producing around one aircraft every hour . Automobiles: Most of the factories involved in the scheme, like Longbridge, were car factories . Redevelopment: Since the collapse of MG Rover in 2005, part of the Longbridge site has been turned to commercial and residential purposes . At peak production point in the mid-1940s, there were 26 shadow factories in operation in Britain. The factories employed tens of thousands of people, including munitions workers and sub-contractors. Urban explorer Tom Robinson, 20, from Stoke-on-Trent delved into the tunnels to bring back exclusive pictures of Great Britain’s hidden wartime heritage. 'In 1936 Austin became Chairman of a shadow factory scheme set up by the government. 'At Longbridge, a flight shed was built, which is distinctive for its interior space and impressive roof structure. 'Close by was a new Aero Factory which would become known as the East Works. 'My pictures show the series of tunnels was also prepared to provide shelter from air raids and a safe place to relocate manufacturing operations in case of heavy bombing.' Development: The 15-acre East Works site at Longbridge was built as part of a wider Government scheme, spearheaded by Lord Austin . Power: Coal-fired boilers with an underground cooling apparatus powered the East Works, where the engines were made for British planes . Cavernous: The tunnels stretch under most of the 15-acre site and had space for 10,000 workers . Equipment: Urban explorer Tom Robinson found much of the old machinery and lighting still in place when he photographed the tunnels . After the war, the factory returned to producing automobiles and the tunnels were abandoned. By the late 1960s, the Longbridge plant was the second largest car plant in the world, employing some 250,000 workers. But since the collapse of MG Rover, part of the site was redeveloped for housing and commercial purposes. It was bought by the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation in late 2007 into 2008. Tom explained why he felt it important for Britain to better-preserve wartime sites like this. “It’s a travesty that nothing has been done to preserve any of the history of the Longbridge works, where British manufacturers such as Austin Motors and later MG Rover were based,” he said. Defence: Herbert Austin - Lord Austin - who became Chairman of the Government's shadow factory scheme in 1936, is pictured (right) visiting the shadow factory site at Longbridge in 1937 . Engine driver: Lord Austin (in foreground), an Australian-born industrialist, founded the Austin Motor Company - which had already turned its services to the war effort from 1914 to 1917 . 'There’s little to show what was once a huge employer in the area and a key player in the automotive industry. 'But I try to document what I’m seeing as I visit these places. 'I’m trying to give who ever looks at the photos a good insight into what there is to be seen.' Lord Austin died in May 1941, four years before the Allied forces finally defeated Germany in Europe thanks in part to his effort. Monarch of the skies: King George VI with J.W. Gillan in 1938, as he is shown a Hawker Hurricane. Many of the planes owed their engines to the shadow factories . ...and now: MG6 vehicles on an assembly line at the now Chinese owned MG factory in Longbridge, Birmingham in 2011 . Women of Britain: Hundreds of female workers were employed at the Longbridge shadow tunnels during the war when many men were sent to fight . Daily work: Even the warning signs, clocks and sinks are still in tact in the tunnels that made up the shadow factory . What lies beneath: The factory continued operating on the surface too, with more production going on below .

But a newly found status as the Viagra capital of England was probably not what the writers had in mind. Statistics show that the North Warwickshire town, with a population of around 6,000, consumes Viagra and similar anti-impotence remedies with a passion which leaves other communities trailing. Up for loving: The market town of Coleshill in North Warwickshire which has the highest rate of prescriptions for Viagra and other anti-impotence drugs of any region in England . Last year, 54.87 prescriptions per . 1,000 men were issued by GPs in the district for erectile dysfunction . drugs such as Viagra, Cialis and Levitra, placing the town well ahead of . its nearest rival for the title, Wychavon, across the border in . Worcestershire. When the Daily Mail visited Coleshill yesterday, it did not take long to find one local who readily admitted taking a sex drug. Al .

New York City mayoral candidate Bill Thompson conceded the Democratic primary race to Bill de Blasio on Monday. Thompson dropped out of the race and endorsed de Blasio at an event dubbed a 'unification rally' just after 11am on Monday at New York City Hall. The move comes as a relief to frontrunner de Blasio, who will now avoid an October 1 runoff in what has become a dramatic battle to replace three-term Mayor Michael Bloomberg . Out of the race: Bill Thompson conceded Monday to Bill de Blasio in the long battle for New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg's job . With Thompson out of the race, de Blasio will face Republican nominee Joe Lhota on November 5. 'If this were a general election,' said Thompson, 'you could bet I'd fight to the last vote.' Now twice an also-ran, Thompson graciously conceded to his fellow Brooklynite Bill de Blasio. 'Today I am proud to stand next to a great New Yorker and throw my full support behind him,' Thompson said. de Blasio took the stage praising the man he bested and referring to the press event as 'a gathering of friends.' No run-off: Bill de Blasio will now avoid an October run-off that many Democrats feared would throw the race's momentum to Republicans . party pressure? Here, de Blasio hugs New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The governor reportedly had a hand in convincing Thompson, who only yesterday said he planned to stay in the race, to leave the race . 'For years I've had the honor or working with Bill,' said de Blasio. 'There's no man of greater integrity.' de Blasio also took the opportunity to praise New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose work for the state de Blasio called 'nothing short of miraculous.' Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was also in attendance, played a role in brokering the deal, reports the New York Daily News. 'At the end of the day the voters acted and they acted smartly,' Governor Cuomo said at the concession event. Like fellow Democrat Thompson, Cuomo threw his support behind de Blasio. 'It is my honor to support him,' said Cuomo. In unofficial returns with 99 percent of precincts reporting, de Blasio had had 40.3 percent of the vote - slightly more than the 40 percent threshold needed to win outright. Thompson was at 26.2 percent. A runoff had long been expected in the crowded Democratic race. But after last week's unofficial returns put de Blasio above the 40 percent mark, Thompson faced pressure to concede and spare the party further division ahead of the general election. He said as recently as Sunday he would wait until the official tally was finished. 'It it my honor to support him': Governor Andrew Cuomo, like Thompson, threw his personal support behind de Blasio . ‘I think that's important. We want to see every vote counted,’ he said then. Currently the city's elected public advocate, de Blasio has been riding a wave of momentum that built during the last month of his campaign, which he billed as 'a progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era.' After lagging in the polls, de Blasio got voters' attention by protesting a hospital closing - and getting arrested - and airing ads in which his teenage son gave voice to his liberal platform and showed New Yorkers de Blasio's interracial family. Thompson, a former city comptroller and the only African-American in the race, ran a more centrist campaign, offering himself as a seasoned, thoughtful manager. He hadn't led in polls of the crowded Democratic field this year, but supporters noted that he had been underestimated in the past: Thompson came much closer than polls predicted to unseating Bloomberg in 2009, despite being vastly outspent. De Blasio has said Thompson had every right to want the official count. On Friday, elections officials began checking vote totals from more than 645,000 ballots cast via lever machines that were hauled out of storage for the primary, after the elections board worried it wouldn't be able to reprogram the city's newer, optical-scanner devices for a potential runoff. That count was finished Sunday night and was to be announced Monday afternoon. The elections board was beginning to count some 78,000 absentee and other paper ballots Monday. While a runoff had been anticipated, trying to figure out who would be in it had been something like Parcheesi for politics junkies. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn was the front-runner for months and was jousting with Thompson for second place in polls as recent as early September. Ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner leaped to the front of the pack for a time after getting into the race in May, before the public learned that his X-rated exchanges with women online continued even after similar sexting spurred his 2011 resignation from Congress. Regardless of the mayor's race, Democrats still will be asked to go to the polls again on Oct. 1. There's a runoff between City Councilwoman Letitia James and state Sen. Daniel Squadron for the party's nomination to succeed de Blasio as public advocate. If de Blasio's final vote count ends up below 40 percent, the mayoral primary will also be on the ballot, because Thompson missed the Friday deadline to have it removed.","Just yesterday, Thompson maintained his intention to stay in the race throughout the long recount .

Battle: The trial over the fortune of Huguette Clark, pictured, could now go ahead on Thursday . Huguette Clark's nurse will have to return part of the fortune she was left by the reclusive heiress to relatives who never met her. Clark, who was the daughter of former U.S. Senator William Clark, died aged 104 in May 2011 and her distant relatives have been battling over her $300 million fortune ever since. As part of Friday's agreement, her family, including some members who never met Clark, will receive $34 million and the lawyers involved, including those for the multi-millionaire, will get $24.5 million. The legal battle is raging over two wills, both written in 2005, when Clark was 99, which name her nurse, Hadassah Peri as the beneficiary of her fortune, with the remainder going to family members by default. Under the terms of Friday's agreement Peri will have to return $5 million of the $30 million she was left as well as her former employer's prized doll collection. The second will left instructions for a foundation to be established at Clark's Santa Barbara estate, in addition to leaving money for her attorney, accountant and a painting for the Corcoran art gallery. As part of Friday's agreement, a $1 million gift to New York's Beth ISrael Hospital, where Clark spent the last 20 years of her life will stay according to the New York Post. Returned: Hadassah Peri will have to return the best part of $7 million to the estate of Huguette Clark under an agreement worked out between her lawyers and those for the late copper heiress's family . Estate: 19 relatives are now fighting for a share of the $300 million estate. Pictured, inside her Manhattan home . What has emerged from the agreement is that many of Clark's relatives who are spread out across the United States and Europe have never even met her. The settlement will also create a $85 million foundation at Clark's Californian estate, Bellosguardo and will become a memorial for her love of the arts. The law firm which negotiated the settlement, Holland and Knight will be paid $11.5 million in fees and John Morken, of Farrell & Fritz will get $11.5 million, while Peri's lawyer stands to take home $1.5 million. The case, which involves more than 60 lawyers, concerns the last will of Clark, who owned lavish properties from New York's Fifth Avenue to the California coast but opted to spend her last 20 years in a Manhattan hospital. She died in 2011, at age 104. The dispute pits nearly two dozen of Clark's distant relatives against a goddaughter, the hospital, a nurse, doctors, a lawyer, an accountant, and other professionals and aides who benefited from her April 2005 will, which left nothing to her family. Gifts to Clark's chief nurse included . multiple Manhattan apartments and a $1.2 million Stradivarius violin. Her primary doctor received cash Christmas presents totaling $500,000, . among other gifts. Deserted: Le Beau Chateau was bought by Clark and remained empty for more than 60 years . Gracious: Huguette was shy, but not sad. Her friends and the few relatives who knew her describe her as cheerful, gracious, stubborn, and devoted to her art. She poses at about age 37 . The hospital got hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and a $3.5 million painting by French pre-Impressionist Edouard Manet. 'The persons and institution named herein as beneficiaries of my estate are the true objects of my bounty,' the will said, noting that the childless, briefly married Clark had had only 'minimal contacts' with her relatives over the years. But it was signed just six weeks after another version of her will, which left almost all her money to the family members. They're descendants of her half-siblings. The relatives say a coterie of hospital executives, medical professionals and Clark's lawyer and accountant took advantage of their access to the secluded, aged heiress to manipulate their way into her millions of dollars. The beneficiaries say Clark was simply a generous woman who wanted to help those who helped her. Clark's father, U.S. Sen. William A. Clark, was one of the richest Americans of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He served as a senator from Montana, where he initially made his fortune from copper mines. His business empire later grew to include building a Western rail line and establishing a Nevada railroad town called Las Vegas. The surrounding Clark County is named for him. The trial will decide only whether Huguette Clark's April 2005 will is valid. But testimony might also peer into pricey presents her caregivers and advisers received while she was alive. 'There may be some connection between gift-giving and undue influence in the will,' Manhattan Surrogate's Court Judge Nora Anderson said at a pretrial hearing Friday.

"By . Becky Barrow . UPDATED: . 19:35 EST, 13 September 2011 . Shopping: Persistently high food prices have contributed to a rise in inflation in August . Families are being hit by the biggest increase in the price of clothes for more than three decades, figures revealed yesterday. Average price tags on clothes and shoes have soared by 13.2 per cent in the last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. This is the biggest annual rise recorded since 1980 and comes at a time when families are facing an unprecedented attack on their finances. Overall, the ONS figures showed the consumer prices index measure of inflation rose to 4.5 per cent last month, from 4.4 per cent in July. This is more than double the Government’s inflation target of 2 per cent, and means inflation is higher in Britain than any other G7 country. The rise in clothes costs  means a pair of jeans priced at £20 in August last year now costs an extra £2.64. Many retailers warned last year that the surging price of cotton due to extreme weather in Pakistan and China would lead to higher prices in shops. CPI RATE SINCE AUGUST 2009 . Earlier this year, the price of . cotton hit the highest level –  in relative terms – since the American . Civil War, but has dropped sharply recently. However, this will take . time to feed through to the high street. The bleak outlook for families is made worse by the paltry pay rise, or pay freezes, they are being forced to accept. A typical private sector worker is getting a pay rise of just 2.6 per cent. Public sector workers are in the middle of a two-year pay freeze if they earn £21,000 or more. And nearly all bills from energy to . fuel, clothes to food are rising far faster than their pay, plunging . millions of families into debt. Mervyn King: The Governor of the Bank of England has repeatedly had to explain high inflation rates . One of the biggest bills – the weekly . food shop – has also ballooned, with food and soft drink prices jumping . 6.2 per cent over the last year. To make matters worse, economists . predicted yesterday that inflation will keep on rising, although few say . pay rises will too. Andrew Goodwin, senior economic . adviser at the accountant Ernst & Young’s Item Club, said: ‘There is . probably worse to come in the short-term.’ He blamed double-digit hikes . in energy bills, with many families paying a record-breaking £1,300 a . year to heat their homes. The situation is far worse for older . people who are hit harder by inflation than any other age group, . according to old age specialists Saga. Since the credit crunch began in . 2007, it said prices have risen by 13.9 per cent for the average person, . but by 19 per cent for those aged 75 and over. This is because old people spend more of their money on costs which are rising the fastest, such as food and energy. Inflation is also wiping out their savings with rates as low as 0.01 per cent. Dr Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, said: ‘Older people are trapped. ‘They cannot cope with living costs rocketing through the roof. Are they expected just to sit, wait and suffer?’ Gas: Rises of up to 19 per cent in the price of bills have driven higher inflation . Unions leaders said yesterday that high inflation is further evidence of the squeeze in living standards. Brendan Barber, general secretary of . the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘Those who did least to cause the crash . are bearing the biggest burden in clearing up the mess.’ n As the cost of living continues to surge, so does the cost of dying, a survey revealed. End-of-life costs – including . funerals, headstones and flowers – increased to an average of £7,248, up . 20 per cent since 2007, according to the Annual Cost of Dying Report. Funeral bills have increased by 61 per cent over the past seven years and will continue to rise, according to the annual survey.","CPI at 4.5 per cent (up from 4.4 per cent in July)

A mother and her daughters, an aspiring musician about to release her first album, and a group of friends celebrating a birthday are among the people believed to have died in the Quebec train crash. The death toll for the disaster, when a 73-car train carrying oil derailed and exploded, has reached 50, officials said. One week after the crash the bells of Ste-Agnes, the Roman Catholic church on the edge of the disaster zone, tolled 50 times at midday in honor of the dead today, followed by a minute's silence. Vigil: Friends and family of those who lost their lives in the Quebec train crash gather for a memorial . Twenty bodies have been found in the charred remains of  Lac-Megantic's town center, but the 30 people still missing are believed to be dead too. In several cases, a snap decision to order another drink at the bar, or step outside for a cigarette was all that stood between them surviving or being added to the missing list, according to the Globe and Mail. Musician Guy Buldoc had just completed a set at the Musi-Cafe bar, close to where the train derailed, on Saturday. While he went to the bar to order a beer his friend Yvon Richard went outside for a cigarette. Mr Richard survived the blast, but Mr Buldoc, who was married and had two children, has not been seen since. Family tragedy: Marie-Semie Alliance and Jimmy Sirois's daughter was staying with family the night they died . Musician: Guy Bolduc had just finished a set at the Musi-Cafe .

'The last words he said to me were, ""Yvon, I really like playing with you. We have so much fun together"",' Mr Ricard said. A mother and her two young daughters are also believed to have been victims of the deadly crash, which sparked massive fires in the town centre. Talitha Coumi Bégnoche and her children, nine-year-old Bianka and four-year-old Alyssa have not been heard of since the disaster, but their home was close to the crash site. For parents Jimmy Sirois and Marie-Semie Alliance, their young daughter Milliana survived, but they lost their lives. Milliana had been staying with her grandmother because the family's apartment, across the road from the Musi Cafe, was so hot. Because her father was due to work the next day, her parents had stayed at home. 'It must be fate. Milliana, her time hadn’t come yet,' Solange Bélanger, the child's grandmother, said according to the Globe and Mail. Waiting for answers: Residents stand on the tracks as they listen to an update from the mayor . Rescue: Gaétan Lafontaine was last seen as he ran back to the cafe to try to find his wife, Joanie Turmel . Party: Marie-Noëlle Faucher had been at a family party when the train derailed and exploded . Family tragedy: Karine Lafontaine, Gaétan's sister-in-law, is also missing, believed dead . New start: Stéphane Bolduc, who lost his partner in 2011, was celebrating his birthday with Karine Champagne . Kind hearted: Marie-France Boulet, 62, came from a large family who paid tribute to her generous nature . Independent: At 93, Éliane Parenteau-Boulanger, who lived by herself, was the oldest victim . The explosions and fire from the crash destroyed 30 buildings in all, including the public library that housed irreplaceable historical archives. About 2,000 people - a third of the population - were ordered to leave their homes, and the town's central business district was cordoned off throughout the week. Gilles Fluet, a 65-year-old who used to work at a door-making factory, left the Musi-Cafe just moments before the first explosion and saw the train go by. 'It was moving at a hellish speed ... no lights, no signals, nothing at all,' he said. 'There was no warning. It was a black blob that came out of nowhere.' He added: 'I realized they were oil tankers and they were going to blow up, so I yelled that to my friends and I got out of there. If we had stayed where we were, we would have been roasted.' One of the victims who was unable to escape was 28-year-old Geneviève Breton, who had been due to release her first album. The singer, who had already found fame on reality show Star Académie in 2009, was sitting outside Musi Cafe with her boyfriend at the time of the crash. She ducked back in for a bottle of water and was never seen again. Remembered: Doves are released outside the town's church after a minute's silence for the victims . New resident: Massage therapist Kathy Clusiault moved to the town in June . Father: Mathieu Pelletier, a 29-year-old hockey coach, had a young son .

Night out: Éric Pépin, 28, was a carpenter who was enjoying a night out at the Musi Cafe . Promotion: Élodie Turcotte, 18, was due to start her new role at the cafe the day after the crash . Businesswoman: Henriette Latulippe had run several businesses in the town and lived near the tracks . Support: Messages of condolences are left in the Lac Megantic church . A group of four friends who were celebrating the 40th birthday of one of their children are also missing. Gaétan Lafontaine had managed to escape the initial explosion but has not been seen since he ran back to the Musi-Cafe to try to find his wife Joanie Turme, a librarian and mother of two. Their sister-in-law Karine Lafontaine, and friend Marie-Noëlle Faucher, who had two teenage sons, are also missing. One of the oldest confirmed victims was 93-year-old Éliane Parenteau-Boulanger, who had lived next to the railway line for years. Her son, Michel Boulanger, said his mother - one of 11 siblings - had refused to move to a nursing home. He added: 'She had a spirit like David Letterman. She makes you a part of the joke.' Destroyed: Shells of buildings that were burned down in the blaze . Desolate: Firefighters douse the rail cars among burned trees and debris from the explosion . Many of the evacuees have been able to return home, as the investigation into the crash continues. Investigators are also examining details of a fire on the same train just hours before the disaster. A fire official said the train's power was shut down as standard operating procedure, meaning the train's air brakes would have been disabled. In that case, hand brakes on individual train cars would have been needed. The derailment is Canada's worst railway disaster since a train plunged into a Quebec river in 1864, killing 99.","Mother and two daughters aged 9 and 4 among those feared killed .

"By . Clare Goldwin . PUBLISHED: . 17:30 EST, 16 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:30 EST, 16 September 2013 . Katherine Robinson brought back many souvenirs from her eight months teaching English in Indonesia - including one that was unexpected and unwelcome. Within a week of returning home in June she suffered fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss and a cough when she bent over. Her GP initially suspected a chest infection and prescribed antibiotics, but the symptoms did not clear up and when, two weeks after getting back, Katherine developed breathlessness, a severe ache in her upper back and night sweats, she returned to her doctor. Unwelcome souvenir: Katherine Robinson caught TB whilst teaching in Indonesia . He sent her straight to hospital for an X-ray, which revealed the area between her left lung and her ribcage was about two-thirds full of liquid. While we all naturally have some fluid - a few spoonfuls - here to lubricate the lungs, Katherine had two-and-a-half litres drained during a week-long stay in hospital (the fluid had been compressing her lung, causing the discomfort and cough). Doctors suspected pneumonia, and she was prescribed more antibiotics, and warned it might take her weeks to recover. As a precaution, they ran other tests, and six weeks after becoming ill Katherine was shocked to learn she had TB. 'The doctors are almost certain I caught it while I was in Indonesia,' says Katherine, 34, from Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. Like most teenagers in the Eighties and Nineties, she had been given the BCG vaccine (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) against TB when she was 13, and assumed she was protected. TB is spread by inhaling tiny droplets from coughs or sneezes of an infected person. Most common in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia, it's one of several diseases still prevalent in far-flung destinations. The concern is that with tropical travel now viewed as routine - whether for a two-week holiday or a longer period, such as a gap year - it's easy to forget that many of these unpleasant and even deadly diseases still pose a serious risk. False sense of security: Katherine, like many people, thought her jabs would protect her . And while you might think you're covered by a jab, as Katherine did, there are many cases when protection is limited at best. 'Jabs give people a false sense of security when they travel because they don't provide 100 per cent protection,' says Dr Ron Behrens, of the Faculty of Infectious & Tropical Diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Although childhood vaccinations give good protection for life, people should always be cautious when it comes to what they eat and drink, adds Dr Hilary Longhurst, consultant immunologist at Barts and the London NHS Trust. 'It also depends where you travel,' she says. 'Some vaccines, such as typhoid, only protect against one strain of two, and even then have varying efficacy depending where you are and the resistance of the strains there. 'One study in Nepal showed the efficacy of the typhoid jab was 75 per cent, while in South Africa it was only 55 per cent.' Another problem for many affected travellers is that the symptoms don't manifest themselves until they're back in the UK. This can be because the disease only becomes active when your immune system is low, or because the incubation period means you may not see symptoms for days or weeks after infection. The downside of getting ill once back in the UK is that diagnosis and treatment is likely to be slower because doctors here are not used to dealing with such diseases. 'My sheets would be drenched in sweat in . the morning. I also felt exhausted and my body ached enormously. It was . as if I could feel every internal organ aching. Even my eyeballs . ached.' Poppy Mardall, 30, from South London, is all too well aware of these problems. Despite being vaccinated against typhoid - as advised by the NHS - when she went back-packing in Ghana for five weeks with her husband in 2011, she still contracted the disease. Highly contagious, the typhoid bacterium is spread through food - often poultry - and less commonly water contaminated by faeces from an infected person. 'I began to feel ill on the way home - washed out and hot,' recalls Poppy. 'But I put it down to the long flight. The fever came and went after I got home, but I felt well enough to go to Belgium for a few days after coming back.' But while in Belgium, Poppy's symptoms worsened. Her temperature shot up at night: 'My sheets would be drenched in sweat in the morning. I also felt exhausted and my body ached enormously. It was as if I could feel every internal organ aching. Even my eyeballs ached.' Poppy came back early and saw her GP, who couldn't diagnose the problem but said to go to hospital if her symptoms worsened. For the next week her condition fluctuated, but when her temperature hit 105f (40.5c), her husband took her to A&E immediately. 'At this point I was starting to hallucinate,' she says. 'Every time I closed my eyes I was convinced I could hear a band drumming. At one point the light switches seemed to be dripping from the walls. I also totally lost my balance.' Poppy was placed in an isolation ward for infectious diseases and finally diagnosed with typhoid a few days later. 'It wasn't something I expected, especially considering I'd been vaccinated,' she says. After a week in hospital Poppy was discharged, but five days later her condition deteriorated. After a second stint in hospital, on stronger antibiotics, she was allowed home again. But her recovery was painfully slow. She had extreme fatigue and it was eight months before she was anywhere near better. Dr Behrens points out the typhoid vaccination is only about 60 per cent effective for those who live in countries where typhoid is prevalent, and likely to be much less for tourists who've never been exposed to the bugs. Promising start: Katherine pictured with students at the school she taught at in Indonesia . 'I don't believe the vaccine actually works in tourists,' he says. 'The only studies that have been done are on people who live in these countries and they will have a certain amount of natural immunity, so you can't say that it worked for them so it will work for someone who's never seen the bug.' The problem is also diagnosing such illnesses when most UK doctors have very little, if no, clinical experience in them. As Dr Behrens explains: 'While TB is a little more common (there are 9,000 cases annually in the UK) - especially in parts of London, a UK doctor may see a case of typhoid once in their career, if at all. It's very important that if you get ill after coming home from travelling, you say where you've been, especially as some illnesses may not display symptoms until weeks later.' Katherine and Poppy both told their doctors where they had been. Dr Behrens adds: 'Flu, pneumonia and TB have symptoms common to each other so are easily misdiagnosed. The implications can be very serious.' Artist Alex Florschutz learned this the hard way. The 44-year-old from Forest Row, East Sussex, contracted dengue fever while visiting Bali in the summer of 2009. A common, but sometimes fatal, viral infection found in tropical regions, dengue fever is spread by mosquitoes - there is currently no vaccine (though one is in development) and no cure. Alex had been bitten twice by mosquitoes the day before she flew home from Bali. 'I got ill within a few days of arriving back, but it took doctors three weeks to diagnose me. People are always terrified about going to hospitals abroad, but if I'd been ill in Bali, I'm sure dengue would have been diagnosed sooner because it's so much more common there,' she says. Although she mentioned where she had been on holiday to her doctor, she was initially told she had flu. Her symptoms started with vomiting, diarrhoea, and mild lung and urine infections. 'After a few days I couldn't lift my head off the pillow,' she says. Because her return home in 2009 coincided with an outbreak of swine flu, doctors assumed this was what she had. 'But then I started bleeding, like a heavy period, and I was struggling to read - the type was blurry.' An eye specialist thought she might have type 2 diabetes, then friends suggested dengue fever. A blood test confirmed Alex had the potentially fatal haemorrhagic dengue fever, which kills by triggering internal bleeding - her blurred vision was caused by bleeding behind her eye. Illness strikes: Katherine in hospital, with her lung drain inserted; Katherine is finally on the mend after taking strong antibiotics for six months . Four years later, Alex still suffers from fatigue, while for Poppy, catching typhoid has changed her outlook for ever. 'It was very scary, but gave me a new respect for my body and made me fearless about life,' she says. While previously an art expert for auction house Sotheby's, she has now launched a business - Poppy's Funerals - to provide a family-led funeral service. Meanwhile, Katherine is finally on the mend after taking strong antibiotics for six months. But while the past two-and-a-half months have been tough, she's also had something to celebrate - she's pregnant. Thankfully she's been told neither the TB, nor her treatment, will affect her baby. Due in December and conceived with her fiance in Java, Indonesia, it will be a far happier reminder of her time there.","With tropical travel seen as routine, many forget diseases are still prevalent .

A transgender widow of a Texas firefighter who died in a blaze is taking her fight for his benefits to an appeals court after it was ruled that their marriage was not legally binding. Nikki Araguz, who celebrated a wedding ceremony with her second husband this week, was married to volunteer firefighter Thomas Araguz when he died while fighting a fire three years ago. She says she's entitled to the Wharton County firefighter's death benefits as she had changed her gender on her birth certificate and they were married in 2008. But Houston state district Judge Randy . Clapp ruled in 2011 that Araguz was born male and that the state's 2005 marriage . amendment does not recognize same-sex marriages. Loss: Nikki Araguz at her wedding to Thomas Araguz, who was killed fighting a blaze in 2010 - two years after their marriage. Texas says she is not entitled to his benefits as she was born a man . Araguz's first wife, Heather Delgado, sued to have Araguz's marriage declared entirely void so that she could receive benefits instead to take care of the sons she had with the fallen firefighter. Araguz lost her appeal to the ruling in 2012. But in an interview with ABC News, she resolved to keep fighting on behalf of the transgender community. 'As difficult as this has been for me in my grief, I cannot in good conscience allow someone else to go through this again,' she said. The appeal comes as Araguz celebrated a marriage ceremony with her second husband, WIlliam Loyd, The Corpus Christi Caller-Times reported.

They shared the ceremony in front of the Nueces County Courthouse surrounded by a small group of family and friends in Corpus Christi, Texas on Wednesday. The celebration came despite their struggle to achieve a marriage license because Texas law still considers Araguz a male, even though she presented documentation showing her gender transition, KHOU reported. Mrs Araguz, who was born Justin Graham Purdue, legally changed her name to Nikki Paige Purdue in 1996, and married Mr Araguz in 2008. She underwent a sex-change operation that October. Her husband died at a fire at an egg farm in Boling, Texas, on July 4 2010. His estate was frozen after the launch of the lawsuit which claimed that he did not know the truth about his wife's sexual identity, a claim she has rejected. 'My husband and I loved each other very, very much,' Araguz told the Houston Chronicle on Sunday. 'We had a completely honest marriage, a 100 percent loving, honest marriage.' Happy: Araguz, pictured with Lloyd, continues to battle for her late husband's benefits, saying she will not give up the fight because she wants to improve conditions for the transgender community . New venture: She is pictured with her 'gallery girls' who work at her gallery where she sells handmade jewelry .

Medical equipment worth millions of pounds that was used as recently as 2009 is gathering dust at Britain's last military hospital. The Royal Hospital Haslar, which was where the cure for the naval disease scurvy was discovered, closed its doors for the last time four years ago, when it was sold by the MOD to private firm Our Enterprise for a reported £3 million. Now an undercover photographer has gained access to the 63-acre site in Gosport, Hampshire, and captured the apparently fully equipped hospital - paid for by the taxpayer - that has been left abandoned to its fate. Waste: medical equipment worth millions of pounds and paid for by the taxpayer is gathering dust . Abandoned: None of the medical equipment at the Royal Hospital Haslar has ever been removed . Bizarre: Much of the equipment inside the Haslar looks in good condition and appears ready for use . Operation: The firm behind the project insisted most of the equipment that had value was taken . Fabric: The equipment that remains is said to be embedded into the ceiling and walls making it difficult to remove . Exactly why is a mystery. 'Urban explorer', known only as Chaos, said: 'It was almost impossible to take these pictures. 'I . almost gave up after searching for around an hour for a way in, whilst . avoiding active security patrols, who are renowned for being merciless. 'A lot of effort from the security company had gone into making sure that this location was incredibly well sealed. 'But even the keenest eye can overlook a tiny detail, which can be all we need to find our way inside.' Once inside, Chaos described a seen that was a monument to the past, with modern-looking CT scanners, operation . theatres, wards and other medical equipment potentially bought for . millions when they were first purchased still looking like they were ready to use. He said:'Behind those beautiful Georgian walls remains the familiar sight of a fairly modern hospital albeit, now completely deserted. 'Staggering amounts of seemingly priceless medical machinery remain, such as X-ray machines, MRI and CT scanners. Historic: The Royal Hospital Haslar was built in 1746 and was at the centre of the cure for scurvy . Scrap: The owner of the property says everything of value was removed and what remains has no value . Empty: This room would have contained other equipment, that was removed by the NHS . Eerie: The beds might have been removed, but other equipment remains in the abandoned ward . Spotless: A corridor inside the hospital show very few signs of wear and tear . Notes: Procedures and guidelines remain pinned up on the hospital's walls . Deep clean: Other equipment with no value even remains on site, never having been cleared away . 'No . doubt these have now fallen victim to rapid advances in technology and . are more than likely obsolete by the standards of today. 'I found departments of the hospital that would otherwise be inaccessible to the general public in a working hospital. 'We . can see what it’s like in the operating theatres and the laboratories . littered with chemistry equipment, biopsy scanners and centrifuges.' The hospital was built in 1746 during the reign of ‘mad’ King George I, and was once the last exclusively military hospital in the UK that was . once the largest brick-built building in the country was closed in 2009. Reception: The fixtures and fittings of the X-Ray unit remain in place . Technology: Even computer equipment remains onsite at the former hospital in Gosport . Theatre: The view shows an operating theatre at what was the last British military hospital . Embedded: This piece of equipment, fitted into the wall, could not be removed without causing damage . OurEnterprise: The new owner of the hospital claims the only equipment that remains is that which could not be sold or even given away . Containers: This equipment was considered surplus to requirements when the NHS moved out . The most eminent surgeon serving at the . hospital was James Lind, who sailed with the legendary British explorer . Captain Cook. He correctly linked the lack of fruit and vegetables in the . diet of sailors as being the root cause of scurvy. 'I always try and imagine the place when it was operational and wonder what it would have been like to be a fly on the wall,' said Chaos. 'People can’t quite believe that I had free roam of a fairly modern hospital in its entirety. 'I feel privileged to be one of the people to have explored this great site before redevelopment commences.' After . campaigning against the closing of Haslar, disgruntled local people . pointed out that Britain became one of the only Western nations not to . have a dedicated military hospital. Since the Ministery of Defence sale of site there are now plans to turn the it into a retirement home with leisure facilities for former UK military personnel. Patients: Although it was originally a military hospital, the Haslar eventually opened its doors to the public . Worthless: This piece of equipment could not even be given away . The new owner of the building, OurEnterprise, has insisted everything was done to either redeploy, sell or given equipment away. Director Matt Bell said when the NHS opened its new 'super hospital' the Queen Alexandra, any equipment that could still be used was moved to the new centre. The rest of the equipment was either sold or given away. During the Pakistan floods, Mr Bell said he personally worked with several charities to pass on equipment to the crisis hit country in 2010. Equipment with scrap value was even removed. He added: 'The NHS took the equipment they thought had value. The stuff that remained was obsolete. 'We sent some equipment to Pakistan, but most of it was not even of use to them. 'What was there that was of any value was taken. What's left there now is of zero value. 'Most of what's in the operating theatres couldn't be taken out without pulling the walls away.' An MOD spokeswoman denied abandoning the medical equipment, saying: 'We sold the building and all its contents to a private company, thereby safeguarding taxpayers’ money. 'Our medical training facilities have now relocated to a number of Ministry of Defence Hospital Units (MDHUs) which provide world class medical care to all injured Service personnel.'

A prosecutor demanded severe punishment for disgraced politician Bo Xilai because of his lack of remorse as the court ended a five-day corruption trial Monday that offered glimpses into the shady inner workings of China's elite. The trial, aimed at cementing Bo's political downfall and wrapping up the scandal set off by his wife's murder of a British businessman, painted a colorful picture of how Bo's alleged misconduct enriched his family. Prosecutors said the proceedings have shown adequate proof of Bo's guilt on charges of netting £2.7million through bribes and embezzlement and abuse of power in interfering with the murder investigation. Former Chinese politician Bo Xilai appears at the Intermediate People's Court in Jinan. He is accused of massive corruption, a key issue in modern China . 'The defendant's crimes are extremely grave, and he also refuses to admit guilt. As such, the circumstances do not call for a lenient punishment but a severe one, in accordance with the law,' the prosecutor said, according to a transcript of court proceedings. Bo is accused of providing political favors to a businessman, Xu Ming, in return for having him at his family's beck and call. According to Bo's wife, Xu gave the family expensive gifts that included a villa in France and international airfare to three continents. Bo also is accused of funneling £510,000 in government funds from a secret project. The charges of bribery and embezzlement carry penalties of between 10 years and life imprisonment, or death in severe cases, while the abuse of power charge could result in up to seven years' imprisonment.

Disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai has told a court his wife stole government funds without his involvement and revealed how the couple became estranged after he had an affair. The courtroom revelations in Xilai's politically charged corruption trial have already exposed information about one of China's elite families. However, for the first time, the 64-year-old was forced to disclose details of his family and how his wife Gu Kailai had taken their son to Britain after discovering he had been having an affair. Former Chinese politician Bo Xilai appears at the Intermediate People's Court in Jinan where he is on trial . According to a journalist who was imprisoned for digging up information about Bo, he had an affair with a secretary in her 20s called Li and spent so much time with other women he was nicknamed 'Erect Mr Bo' - or Bo Qilai. Bo's wife travelled to Poole, in Dorset, in 2000, where she lived with her confidant Patrick Devillers, a French architect, and her son who was enrolled at Papplewick School, near Ascot. It was unheard of a child of the a communist party leader to go to a foreign prep school. Bo agreed to take legal responsibility for the fact £500,000 of public money had made its way into his wife's bank account. 'I am ashamed of it. I was too careless, because this is public money,' Bo told the Jinan Intermediate People's Court. 'I failed to retrieve the money later, and that's a factual statement, but can you say I had the intention to embezzle the money? No.' It has been said that the ruling Communist Party is using the trial against Bo, a former Politburo member and party leader of the city of Chongqing, to cap a messy political scandal after his wife was convicted for the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood in August 2012. Denial: Chinese politician Bo Xilai denied bribery when he appeared in court . That scandal led to Bo's political ousting, cemented by criminal charges of interfering with a murder investigation and netting £2.76 million through corruption. Courts in China are controlled by the Communist Party so a conviction is expected, but Bo has mounted an unexpectedly spirited defence. Bo's trial had been expected to be swift, but observers say giving him a chance to defend himself helps lend a veneer of legitimacy to what is widely seen as a political show trial. 'The leadership wants to have a trial that's seen as fair. You can't have a completely secret trial in today's China, it would be an embarrassment,' said Brookings Institution scholar Cheng Li. 'Bo Xilai is taking advantage of that trial to continue to perform as he did before.' Gu Kailai, wife of China's former Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai (left) was convicted of murdering British business man Neil Heywood (right) whose body was found in a hotel in 2011 . Authorities remained on high alert for any unrest that might be triggered by the trial, closely guarding a security perimeter that expanded several miles around the court with main roads in the vicinity sealed and many shops and restaurants shut. Inside the courtroom, Bo questioned the testimonies of his wife Gu Kailai and others that prosecutors presented, that in 2000 he had told Gu to take the government funds to cover the expenses of accompanying their son in Britain while he attended school. Bo said that Gu had piles of her own money, and that she had taken their son overseas in a fit of rage after he had been unfaithful. 'She left after giving me only the courtesy of a notification,' Bo said. 'At the time, I had had an affair, and she was very angry. She took Bo Guagua away, largely because she felt wronged and was acting rashly.' The courtroom revelations in the politically charged trial have already exposed details about one of China's elite families . He said Gu, who is serving a suspended death sentence, could be seeking a more lenient jail term by denouncing him. Bo similarly questioned the testimony of Wang Zhenggang, who was then an official with a land planning department in Dalian, where Bo was party boss at the time. Wang had testified that Bo made a call to his wife in front of him and explicitly said he was going to funnel 5 million yuan ( 800,000) in funds from a government project to their family, an account Bo called implausible. 'Is this in line with the way an embezzler would think?' Bo said of the account of the alleged event that took place 13 years ago in Dalian. 'Would I say something this sensitive on the phone?' Prosecutors have also said that he accepted bribes from businessmen in the form of money or gifts to his family - including a villa in Nice, France, and plane tickets to three continents - in exchange for political favours. The charges of bribery and embezzlement, based on the indictment's specified monetary amounts, carry penalties of between 10 years and life imprisonment, or death in severe cases, while the abuse of power charge could result in up to seven years' imprisonment. The trial on Saturday also began hearing allegations that Bo interfered in the investigation of the murder of a British businessman and of the events surrounding his top aide's attempted defection at a U.S. consulate. Courtroom revelations by the prosecution have laid bare the way shady ties between powerful officials and businessmen can play out in China. Part of the couple's influence comes from their pedigree as the children of revolutionary veterans, a status that gives them access to important political and business networks.","The 64-year-old forced to disclose how his wife Gu Kailai took their son to Britain after he had an affair .

President Obama is facing widespread backlash for his decision to deliver a speech touting his fiscal policies on Monday while three miles away, Navy Yard was under siege by a gunman who slaughtered 12 people in Washington's deadliest day since September 11, 2001. The move was baffling to Obama's critics and supporters alike. In the midst of the confusion and bloodshed that unfolded Monday, TV networks cut away from the drama to hear Obama address the massacre only briefly before quickly pivoting to an attack on Republicans in Congress. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd blasted Obama's decision in a piece published Wednesday. In this photo taken Monday, September 16, 2013, President Barack Obama pauses as he speaks in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington . 'He could have posted his original remarks on the White House Web site and replaced them with a cri de coeur on gun control, or comfort for the shaken city,' she wrote. 'The 12 who died were, after all, under his aegis as workers in a federal building.' 'But, jarringly, the president went ahead with his political attack, briefly addressing the slaughter before moving on to jab Republicans over the corporate tax rate and resistance to Obamacare.' Calling the move 'out of joint,' Dowd declared: 'The man who connected so electrically and facilely in 2008, causing Americans to overlook his thin résumé, cannot seem to connect anymore.' MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' host Joe Scarborough offered an even more scathing review. 'On the day while people were hiding, while people were bleeding, while people were dying, while the nation was locked in on this - he’s talking about harsh partisanship and Republicans wanting to hurt people,' Scarborough said of Obama. Frantic Search: Emergency responders arrive at . the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, where 12 people were killed and . eight injured on Monday . One of Alexis' victims was Richard Michael . Ridgell and a candlelight vigil was held in his honor at Jaycee Park in . Westminster, Md.m on Tuesday . 'What is more partisan than not being able to put aside one of these stupid Washington battles - [postponing it] for a day? Never came under consideration. Never considered it. There’s not one person in the White House that said, ""You know right down the block, people are dying right now and there’s a gunman on the loose and there’s local schools shutdown. The Capitol is on shutdown. And there may be a second or third gunman. And you know what? Maybe we’ll just give this speech tomorrow.""' Republican lawmakers have also been quick to attack Obama, with House Speaker John Boehner calling his speech a 'shame.' Former House Speaker and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich also weighed in, saying, 'President Obama should have recognized that an event this painful and tragic, in the nation's capital, required being president rather than partisan, and being concerned about people rather than concerned about attacking.' Vigil for the victims: Frank Calderon, who . became step dad to Aaron when he was eight years old, said he did not . see any initial signs of PTSD in Alexis after 9/11 . Chaos: More than 3,000 people work at the site in Washington D.C. where gunfire erupted on Monday . Feeling the need to jump to his own defense, Obama on Tuesday tried to explain his remarks. He told Telemundo in an interview to 'keep in mind' that he delivered the remarks 'while we were still gathering information' about the shooting. 'I think that everybody understands that the minute something like this happens, I'm in touch with the FBI, I'm in touch with my national security team, we're making sure that all the assets are out there for us to deal with this as well as we can,' he continued. 'What is also important to remember is that Congress has a lot of work to do right now.' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also sought to defend the president's actions, saying Tuesday that Republicans are 'trying to make something' out of nothing.

'The president spoke about the Navy Yard at the very top of his briefing,' he said. 'He talked about the cowardly act that had taken place, the tragedy that was unfolding and the loss of life and he called for and demanded a seamless investigation with federal and local law enforcement officials and that is what we're seeing now.' But a brief statement at the top of his remarks just wasn't enough in light of the tragedy at hand, a Democratic consultant told CNN. The speech was 'suprisingly tone-deaf,' the consultant said, speaking anonymously. 'National unity has been at the heart of the .

Disgraced politician Bo Xilai has told of an illicit affair between his wife and former right-hand man as China’s biggest political trial in 30 years came to a close. In his testimony yesterday Xilai denounced his wife Gu Kailai and his former police chief Wang Lijun – both key witnesses against him – as a last-ditch effort to redeem his reputation. The 64-year-old former Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary denied charges of embezzlement and bribery in which he is said to have netted £2.7 million and abuses of power by interfering with a murder investigation. My wife had an affair: Disgraced politician Bo Xilai (pictured) denounced his wife Gu Kailai and his former police chief Wang Lijun in his defence against corruption and embezzlement charges . Xilai said in court: ‘He [Lijun] was secretly in love with Gu Kailai, his emotions were tangled and he could not extricate himself.’ During the five-day trial in Jinan, Shandong province Xilai has vigorously defended himself against the criminal charges, recanting earlier confessions, rarely expressing contrition and blaming his wife and others. According to a transcript of the court proceedings, the prosecutor said: ‘The defendant's crimes are extremely grave, and he also refuses to admit guilt. Secret love: Xilai (pictured left with wife Gu Kailai) said his former police chief Wang Lijun (right) was in love with Kailai in China's biggest political trial in 30 years which came to a close on Monday . ‘As such, the circumstances do not call for a lenient punishment but a severe one, in accordance with the law. ‘We . remind the defendant that, Bo Xilai: the facts of the crimes are . objective, they cannot by changed according to your subjective wishes.’ The corruption charges carry a maximum penalty of death but many believe his sentence will be in the range of 20 years’ imprisonment. The trial has exposed the complex web of allegiances and dysfunction within Xilai’s family. Blamed others: Xilai denied charges of bribery and embezzlement in which he is said to have netted £2.7 million and for interfering in the murder investigation of British businessman Neil Heywood . Xilai said: ‘I know I am not a . perfect person and I had a bad temper and acted subjectively and I made . serious faults and mistakes. ‘I . deeply feel that I failed to govern my family and it had a negative . effect on the state. I sincerely accept the investigation from the party . and the judicial departments, but the charge of corruption is not . true.' Murdered: Kailai was convicted of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood (pictured) whose body was found in a hotel in 2011 . Bo is accused of providing political favours to a businessman, Xu Ming, in return for having him at his family's beck and call. According to Xilai's wife, Ming gave . the family expensive gifts that included a villa in France and . international airfare to three continents. Bo also is accused of . funnelling £510,000 in government funds from a secret project. The court heard allegations over the weekend that Xilai abused his power as the Communist Party secretary of Chongqing to block an investigation into the British businessman Neil Heywood's murder, as well as to hide his aide's embarrassing flight to a U.S. consulate - an event that help set the scandal into motion. Kailai was convicted of murdering Mr Heywood whose body was found in a hotel in 2011. Xilai repeated his doubts about the evidence presented by prosecutors yesterday while introducing a bizarre twist to the narrative. He said that Lijun tried to defect to the consulate early last year, not because of the investigation into Mr Heywood’s murder, but because he confessed his feelings for Kailai to the politician. Xilai's downfall had been widely perceived as the result of his defeat during party infighting ahead of last fall's once-a-decade leadership transition. Xilai testified: ‘He [Lijun] knew my . personality, he'd trespassed on my family and violated my basic . emotions, this is the real reason he decided to defect. Wang Lijun in . reality is trying to muddy the waters.’ He . also said that Lijun and Kailai were as close as ‘glue and lacquer’ and . that they had a ‘very special relationship; I was frustrated by that’. Lijun had earlier said in court he went . to the Americans because he feared for his safety after he told Xilai . that the politician's wife had murdered the Briton. Complex web of allegiances: Chinese policemen stand guard as vehicles leave for the trial in Jinan, Shandong province which exposed the dysfunction within the politician's family . Xilai was accused of sacking Lijun as police chief and deputy mayor last year without consulting senior authorities. He also allegedly fabricated Lijun’s medical records to indicate that he was insane. With a note of resignation, Xilai thanked the court for letting him fully defend himself yesterday. He said: ‘I know there is no escape from my fate and sometimes I was weak at heart. Faced by imprisonment, I have mixed feelings and the only thing I have is the rest of my life.’ A date for the verdict has not yet been given.","China's biggest political trial in 30 years came to a close yesterday .

Scientists have made a major breakthrough in determining the cause of age-related memory loss, which they hope will herald the development of a new drug to reverse the process. A report released yesterday offers strong evidence that age-related memory loss really is a distinct condition from pre-Alzheimer's — and might eventually be treatable. Researchers at Columbia University Medical Center examined brains, young and old ones, donated from people who died without signs of neurologic disease. Scientists believe they have pinpointed the cause of memory loss offering a breakthrough that could lead to the development of drugs to reverse the process . They discovered that a certain gene in a . specific part of the hippocampus, the brain's memory center, stops . working properly in older people. It produces less of a key protein. That section of the brain, called the dentate gyrus, has long been suspected of being especially vulnerable to aging. Importantly, it's a different neural neighborhood than where Alzheimer's begins to form. But it's circumstantial evidence that having less of that protein, named RbAp48, affects memory loss in older adults. So the researchers took a closer look at mice, which become forgetful as they age in much the same way that people do. Sure enough, cutting levels of the protein made healthy young rodents lose their way in mazes and perform worse on other memory tasks just like old mice naturally do. Clue: A certain gene in a specific part of the hippocampus, the brain's memory center, was found to stop working properly in older people . More intriguing, the memory loss was reversible: Boosting the protein made forgetful old mice as sharp as the youngsters again, the researchers reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. 'It's the best evidence so far' that age-related memory loss isn't the same as early Alzheimer's, said Nobel laureate Dr. Eric Kandel, who led the Columbia University team.And since some people make it to 100 without showing much of a cognitive slowdown, the work begs another question: 'Is that normal aging, or is it a deterioration that we're allowing to occur?' Kandel said. 'As we want to live longer and stay engaged in a cognitively complex world, I think even mild age-related memory decline is meaningful,' added Columbia neurologist Dr. Scott Small, a senior author of the study. 'It opens up a whole avenue of investigation to now try to identify interventions.' This is early-stage research that will require years of additional work to confirm, cautioned Dr. Molly Wagster of the National Institute on Aging, who wasn't involved with the report. But Wagster said the findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting 'that we're not all on the road to Alzheimer's disease' after we pass a certain age. For example, other researchers have found that connections between neurons in other parts of the brain weaken with normal aging, making it harder but not impossible to retrieve memories. In contrast, Alzheimer's kills neurons. How does Wednesday's research fit? Many pathways make up a smoothly functioning memory, and that protein plays a role in turning a short-term memory — like where you left those car keys — into a longer-term one, Kandel explained. Some good news: Scientists already know that exercise makes the dentate gyrus — that age-targeted spot in the hippocampus — function better, Small said. He's also studying if nutrition might make a difference.","New evidence suggests age-related memory loss is a distinct condition from pre-Alzheimer's .

Playboy's annual party college list was spoofed by a group of activists on Tuesday, who created a fake website highlighting the importance of practicing consensual sex. PartyWithPlayboy.com featured a list of the 'Top Ten Party Commandments' on how to have a 'consensual good time', parodying the magazine's annual list of the Top Ten Party Colleges. While many believed the magazine run by Hugh Hefner was responsible for the site, it was actually a hoax launched by anti-rape group FORCE, with the aim of opening up a dialogue about the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses. Copycat: Playboy's annual party college list was spoofed by a group of activists on Tuesday, who created a hoax website highlighting the importance of practicing consensual sex . Updated list: The hoax site featured a list of the 'Top Ten Party Commandments' on how to have a 'consensual good time', parodying the magazine's annual list of the Top Ten Party Colleges . Playboy's annual party school list examines the colleges with reputations for partying cultures and the most drug and alcohol use. In reaction against partying culture which leads to sexual assault, FORCE - along with students from 25 colleges across the country - created a parody website that looked exactly like the Playboy one, with a focus on the issue of rape culture. 'Over the years, it has been brought to our attention that some of our long-standing party picks have a not-so-toast-worthy, rape-ridden side to their campus life,' read the fake website. 'Rape is kryptonite to sexual . pleasure. The two cannot co-exist. For our revised party guide to live . up to our founder’s vision, we had to put a new criterion on top. Namely, consent.' 'Our culture needs influential leaders like Playboy  to step up and change the conversation' Responses to the 'updated' list were . overwhelmingly positive, with the website going viral within hours and . news sites praising Playboy for their 'progressive' new stance. One of the 'commandments' listed on the fake website read: 'Ask first. . . consent is not just sexy. It's necessary.' Another said: '[Don't] take advantage of sloshed persons. . . because drunk does not equal consent.' Party rules to live by: One of the 'commandments for a consensual good time' listed on the fake website reads: 'Ask first. . . consent is not just sexy. It's necessary' Sparking a conversation: According to a release from FORCE - the activist group behind the hoax - the fake websites received over 3,000 hits an hour on Tuesday . Serious problem: 'With one in four female undergrads being assaulted while they are in school, obtaining a bachelor's degree in this country comes with an untenable high level of violence,' says the e-mail release . Along with the fake Playboy website, the activists also posted fake news . stories about it on Huffington Post and BroBible.com, with students who . were involved linking to it via Twitter and Facebook. And they evidently achieved their goal of sparking up an important conversation about consent. According to a release from FORCE, each . of the hoax websites received over 3,000 hits an hour on Tuesday, and the fake Huffington . Post site garnered more than 5,000 Facebook likes. 'With one in four female undergrads being assaulted while they are in . school, obtaining a bachelor's degree in this country comes with an . untenable high level of violence,' says the e-mail release. Spreading the word: 'One reason we used Playboy is that it's important for these messages to come from men and not just women,' said FORCE co-founder Rebecca Nagle (pictured: Playboy owner Hugh Hefner) 'All college students, male, female and gender queer, deserve better.' While . writers at BroBible wrote that they 'agree with the overall messaging' that the hoax promoted, Playboy has asked that the website be taken . down. 'The politics of Playboy and women’s bodies is really complicated and something that we thought about a lot,' FORCE co-founder Rebecca Nagle told MailOnline. 'One reason we used Playboy as a platform is that I think it's important for these messages to come from men and not just women.' Responsibility: Katya Palsi, a student who helped with the hoax, said in a release: 'Our culture needs influential leaders, like Playboy and other enterprises, to step up and change the conversation' Rebecca also explained that the fact so many readers believed the Playboy website was real means that the company has the capability - and the responsibility - to promote such a message. Indeed, Katya . Palsi, a student at Rowan University who helped with the hoax, said in a release: 'Our culture needs influential leaders, like Playboy . and other enterprises, to step up and change the conversation. 'The excitement generated by this just shows how ready we are as a society for a cultural shift.'","Playboy magazine publishes an annual list of the best 'party colleges'

Unlike a normal camera that captures a . picture in one exposure, the day-night band produces an image by . repeatedly scanning a scene and resolving it as millions of individual . pixels. Then, the day-night band reviews the . amount of light in each pixel. If it is very bright, a low-gain mode . prevents the pixel from oversaturating.

This allows the instrument to capture images on . nights with or without moonlight, producing crisp views of Earth's . atmosphere, land and ocean surfaces. The satellite, Suomi NPP, was launched on October 28, 2011. It's latest images show the Nile River bathed in city lights, while a map of the United States shows the heavily populated East Coast illuminated. Light from fishing boats can also be pinpointed.

Happy couple: Rebecca Cottam, with her husband Trevor, wears the ring on their wedding day. A woman has been reunited with her wedding ring more than a month after it was stolen from a gym in Sandy, Utah. Rebecca Cottam, 29, only managed to retrieve it after striking a deal with the thief, promising not to press charges if she lead her to the ring. 'The most important thing was just to get my ring back,' Cottam said, according to Deseret News. 'I was just willing to do whatever I could. I think she’ll get what’s coming to her in time. 'I just don’t want to be a liar. She’s a thief. I don’t want to be a liar,' said Cottam. The thief lead Sandy police to a store at The Gateway shopping center in Salt Lake City where they recovered the heirloom diamond. Cottam said the thief, who has not been named, admitted to selling it to the pawn shop for $200. She said it made her ‘sick to my stomach’. The ring's stone once belonged to her husband Trevor's grandmother, Melba Cottam. Victims of theft: Newly-weds Rebecca and Trevor Cottam were devastated when the ring was stolen . The thief stole the ring from Rebecca Cottam's locker at Gold's Gym in Sandy, Utah . Heirloom: The diamonds in the ring belonged to Trevor Cottam's grandmother, Melba . Cottam said she was relieved the diamond had not been resold. She said it had only been modified to remove a small flaw. She had earlier written on her Facebook wall that she feared the pawn shops would ' rip the ring apart and sell the diamonds'. The story of Cottam and her diamond ring began on August 13 at the Gold’s Gym at 7990 South 1300 East. Detectives believe the thief likely used bolt cutters to cut through a lock and gain access to Cottam’s belongings. The next day, Cottam began a social media campaign to recover her ring, which went viral, resulting in thousands of shares on Facebook. On her Facebook wall she wrote: 'Not giving up hope!!! I'm offering a reward for the return of my ring. The stone belonged to my husband's grandmother! I know you are out there. If there is ANY amount of kindness in you, please turn it in anonymously!

Cottam promised the thief not to press charges if she would lead her to her ring. Sandy Police Sgt.

A World War II veteran facing eviction by his own daughter from his home of 56 years has avoided being forced out after generous strangers raised thousands of dollars online so he could buy it back. John Potter, 92, and his granddaughter, Jaclyn Fraley, 35, collected nearly $140,000 on a GoFundMe.com page and his daughter has finally accepted a payout after rejecting initial offers. Janice Cottrill and husband Dean tried to kick him out of the home in Zaleski, Ohio after they overtook general power of attorney from Potter and his now-deceased wife. Fraley said the fallout was exacerbated when her grandfather and mother argued over visitation rights for Mr Potter's autistic son, Joe after Mrs Cottrill took over his care in 2008. Saved: John Potter, 92, can remain in his home after his granddaughter Jaclyn Fraley (pictured left) and thousands of strangers raised enough money online for him to buy the house back . Staying put: He faced being evicted from his home in Zaleski, Ohio, which he had built 56 years ago . The deal came at the eleventh hour for the elderly man, who was to hear his fate at an eviction hearing at Vinton County Courthouse in October. But Fraley told ABC News that the court has been notified that paperwork was filed to dismiss the eviction. She said she 'shrieked for 10 seconds and starting bawling' when she heard the news. Her grandfather added: 'I want to express my appreciation for all those people who helped me. It wasn't one person, it wasn't a hundred but over five thousand people and I certainly appreciate it more than they will ever know. 'I had this house for over 50 years . before this took place... I have worried all day every day ever since and now I am so happy I . don't have to worry about it anymore.' 'Cruel': Potter's daughter Janice Cottrill, pictured, tried to evict him after taking over control of the deed . Battle: The duo took the problem to GoFundMe.com, where they raised $140,000 through donations . Potter must now wait for the deed to be prepared and for the paperwork to be signed by the couple. Fraley said she will then present them with a check. 'Janice and Dean agreed to sell back Grandpa's house!' Fraley wrote on the GoFundMe page on Friday. 'This has been the longest and hardest fight of our lives and it is finally over! Grandpa can spend the rest of his life in the home he built to spend it in!!!!!!' Fraley did not say how much they agreed to take for the house, but said that it was 'five figures' and that all remaining money would go to her grandfather's care and to items for his home. The last rejected offer was about $60,000. The ordeal began in 2004 when Mr . Potter was battling a serious illness when he handed his general power . of attorney rights to Cottrill. Since then, his wife has passed away. Unbeknownst . to Mr Potter, his daughter allegedly used that power to convey the deed to the one-story, . three-bedroom home he built 56-years ago to herself. Ms Cottrill has not said why she is so insistent about kicking her own father out of the house he built. Proud: Mr Potter fought for his country in World War II and proudly displays a hat showing his veteran status . Thankful: He said he appreciated the outpouring of support and he was grateful he no longer had to worry . 'To me the situation is just so heartbreaking,' Fraley told ABC. Mr Potter says appraisers told him the home was worth just less than $50,000 - far less than he thought. Mr Potter said his first offer to buy . the home for appraised value was greeted with a counter offer for . $85,000 - plus $4,000 in eviction fees and $11,500 in attorney fees. Mr Potter raised the offer to $66,000 on June 13, but never heard back from his daughter. ‘I laid awake at night trying to figure . out what in the world I could have done to these people to make them so . angry at me,’ he told a local TV station earlier this year. He didn't want to agree to his . daughter's demands because he didn't want to give her more money than . the house is worth, he said. Earlier this year, Mr Potter said he was 'amazed' by the more than 5,000 people who donated toward his original $125,000 goal. 'I never knew people could love an old man so much,' he told his granddaughter. Loved: The paperwork needs to be signed but Mr Potter's daughter has agreed to let him stay . After Mr Potter's daughter sent him an eviction notice earlier this year, Ms Fraley organized the desperate fundraiser for him in April while sharing with the public his dire situation. Donations immediately poured in from . around the world from those touched by the military veteran in Zaleski, . Ohio whom they too called 'grandpa.' 'When . I got out of the army and got on my feet on the ground, I rented a . power shovel and dug a hole in the ground, built a basement and built a . house on top of it,' he told ABC of the home. Fraley hasn’t spoken to her mother and . stepfather in two years since she learned about their plan to sell her . grandfather's home and place him in a nursing home. Mr Potter has already attempted to . sue to get his home back, arguing that his daughter had transferred the . deed to herself illegally. He . initially won a county court ruling, but last year an appeals court . ruled that because the statute of limitations of four years had passed . on the accusation of fraud the deed could not be handed back to Mr .

A bumblebee species reintroduced after being driven to extinction in the UK has nested and produced its first offspring. The short-haired bumblebee vanished in the 1980s, having declined over 60 years as its wildflower-rich grassland habitat was lost. It was officially declared extinct in 2000. Seven of the UK’s 27 bumblebee species are in decline and two have become extinct. The short-haired bumblebee has nested and produced its first offspring in the UK since it became extinct here in the 1980s . Short-haired queens were brought over from a healthy population in Sweden, and after two releases at the RSPB’s Dungeness reserve in Kent, worker bees have been discovered for the first time. Nikki Gammans, who led the project, said: 'This is a milestone for the project and a real victory for conservation. 'We now have proof that this bumblebee has nested and hatched young, and we hope it is on the way to become a self-supporting wild species in the UK. 'It’s been a long journey to get here, from creating the right habitat for them, collecting queens in the Swedish countryside, scanning them for diseases and then eventually releasing them at Dungeness. 'Seeing worker bees for the first time is a fantastic reward for all that hard work but we still have a long way to go to ensure this population is safe and viable.' A first generation of queens collected and released last year struggled in the cold wet conditions last summer, but a second generation brought over from Sweden and released this summer bolstered the colony. Seven of the UK's 27 bumblebee species are in decline and two have become extinct . Further releases are planned to help build the population at Dungeness. The reintroduction project has involved work with farmers to create flower-rich meadows and field margins in Dungeness and Romney Marsh, which have boosted populations of other threatened bumblebees. Sightings of rare bees, including the ruderal bumblebee, the red shanked carder bee, the moss carder bee and the brown-banded carder bee, have increased. Nationally, seven of the UK’s 25 native bumblebee species are in decline and two have become extinct, including the short-haired bumblebee.

Corked wine is caused by a chemical that ruins the sense of smell, claim scientists. The damp, soggy fragrance of rotten cardboard of corked wine is because of the way it masks the pleasant aromas of the drink, according to a new study. The compound, called TCA, has long been known as being the culprit behind the bane of a wine lover’s life. But the study is the first time the molecular mechanism of corked wine has been fully explained. The damp, soggy fragrance of rotten cardboard of corked wine is because of the way it masks the pleasant aromas of the drink, according to a new study . Dr Hiroko Takeuchi, of Osaka University in Japan, said experiments on insects and humans show TCA may degrade the flavour and nose of wines by ‘suppressing the sense of smell.’ A corked wine is one that has become contaminated with ‘taint’ caused by TCA (2,4,6 - trichloroanisole). This forms when natural fungi, which resides in cork, come in contact with certain chlorides found in winery products. If a winery uses infected corks, the wine becomes tainted and TCA can contaminate not just a single batch but an entire cellar. Once entrenched it is very difficult to eradicate. Since the discovery in the early 1990s of the cause of cork taint most wineries have totally eliminated the use of chlorine based products. A corked wine is one that has become contaminated with 'taint' caused by TCA. This forms when natural fungi, which resides in cork, come in contact with certain chlorides found in winery products . The latest study shows the musty, unpleasant flavours and aromas characteristic of corked wine in TCA knocks out odour detection in smelling or ‘olfactory’ cells in consumers’ noses. Dr Takeuchi and colleagues monitored the activity in the cells of newts exposed to TCA and showed rather than sparking odour perception it suppressed them - even at extremely low concentrations. A series of experiments involving 20 human participants also showed the original odours of wines were reduced when they were contaminated by TCA - causing unpleasant flavours. Dr Takeuchi said: ‘Throughout culinary history consumers have been disturbed by naturally generated off-flavour substances that can greatly reduce the palatability of foods and beverages. ‘Because off-flavours appear at very low concentrations of contaminants chemical identification of responsible compounds has been limited. A series of experiments involving 20 human participants showed the original odours of wines were reduced when they were contaminated by TCA - causing unpleasant flavours . ‘One of the most potent off-flavour compounds identified to fate is TCA - known specifically for inducing a cork taint in wines. ‘Our findings not only reveal a likely mechanism of odour loss but also reveal potential molecular architectures for the development of novel odour-masking agents.’ While unpleasant to taste cork taint is not in any way harmful to humans. It dulls the fruit in a wine, renders it lacklustre and cuts the finish. The obviousness of the corked smell and taste depends both on the extent of the taint as well as the wine drinker’s sensitivity to it. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable and on other occasions it knock your socks off the moment you open the bottle.","Corked wines are contaminated with a ‘taint’ caused by the compound TCA .

The extraordinary scenes came as Foreign Secretary William Hague said today that Britain is willing to send experts to Syria to assist international efforts to rid the Assad regime of chemical weapons. But Mr Hague ruled out UK troops being deployed to provide them with security, adding that such action might create strong feelings within Syria and alternative arrangements would be looked at. Under an agreement between the United States and Russia, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's regime is required to submit a full inventory of its chemical stockpile by the end of the week. A staggering 6 million Syrians, nearly a third of Syria’s pre-war population of 20 million, have been torn from their homes since the start of two year long conflict, . Almost 5,000 Syrians are fleeing into neighbouring countries every day, and UN officials have warned of the need for a big increase in humanitarian aid. The UN says that . 2 million Syrians have registered as refugees in the region - including 716,000 . in Lebanon, 515,000 in Jordan, 460,000 in Turkey, 168,000 in Iraqi Kurdistan and . 110,000 in Egypt.

More than half of them are children. Women and children together make up three-quarters of the refugee population and the UN says most have arrived with 'no more than the clothes on their backs'. The US, the UK and others blame Syrian president Bashar al-Assad for a sarin gas attack on August 21 in the suburbs of the capital Damascus. Mr Assad, supported by Russia, denies the charge, blaming Syrian rebels. The UN has called the attack a war crime but has not assigned blame. An estimated 1,400 people died in the attack. Overcrowding in the refugee camps has intensified since the chemical attack as tens of . thousands more Syrians have joined the exodus. Many of those displaced by fighting are now desperate to seek refuge further afield, so pitiful are conditions in the camps. Trouble in Syria began in 2011 after 15 schoolchildren were allegedly tortured for writing anti-government graffiti on a wall. The army opened fire on protesters and killed four people. Anger over the killings soon spread. Displaced: A Syrian woman carries her baby across the border into Turkey at Cilvegozu border gate, across from Bab al-Hawa in Syria, in Reyhanli, Hatay, Turkey .

President Barack Obama told family and friends of the men and women killed in the Washington Navy Yard shooting Sunday that he fears 'there's a creeping resignation' of mass shootings in the US and that these attacks are 'the new normal.' Mr Obama's remarks came about mid-way through the memorial service, held at a Marine barracks near to the naval base where 12 innocent people were shot dead Sept 16 by crazed gunman Aaron Alexis. 'Sometimes I fear there is a creeping resignation... that this is somehow the new normal,' said Mr Obama, adding 'we can't accept this.' Solemn day: President Barack Obama pauses as he speaks Sunday during a memorial service for the victims of the Washington Navy Yard shooting . 'Once more, our hearts are broken,' the President said, before lamenting that he's now spoken after five such tragedies while in office. 'We must insist here today - there is nothing normal about innocent men and women being gunned down where they work,' said Mr Obama, before defending the rights of gun owners. People should be allowed to own guns, said the President, but not at the expense of others' safety. 'I do not accept that we cannot find a common-sense way to preserve our traditions,' said Mr Obama, 'including our basic Second Amendment freedoms and the rights of law-abiding gun owners while at the same time reducing the gun violence that unleashes so much mayhem on a regular basis.' Not the new normal: President Obama preached that he fears people are beginning to accept mass shootings in the US . Still mourning: President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama arrive Sunday at a memorial service for the victims of the Washington Navy Yard shooting . Admitting that shooting can't be stopped, the President said that should not at least stop the effort to prevent them. 'We cannot stop every act of senseless violence… but if we can prevent even one tragedy like this, we've got an obligation to try,' said Mr Obama. Additionally, the President remarked that there must not only be a change in how people obtain firearms, but also in the mindset of the Americans. 'The change we need will not come from Washington... it'll come from the American people,' said Mr Obama, 'the tears are not enough.' Will not accept this: Mr Obama told crowd of over 4,000 people that he will not accept these shootings as normal . A sad day: President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama sit during a memorial service after visiting with families of the victims . Though defiant in the wake of yet another mass shooting, the President admitted that only so much could be done and said that they are likely to occur again. 'Wisdom comes from the recognition that tragedies like this... are not inevitable.' Sunday's late-afternoon service is being held at the Marine Barracks Washington in southeast Washington, not far from the Navy facility where authorities say 34-year-old Aaron Alexis fatally shot a dozen people last Monday morning. Police killed Alexis in a gun battle. The dead range in age from 46 to 73, and include civilian employees and contractors. Eight people were also hurt, including a police officer and two others who suffered gunshot wounds. Obama spokesman Jay Carney says the president wants to mourn the loss of life and share in the nation's pain after another mass shooting. The service is closed to the public, says barracks spokesman Capt. Jack Norton. About 4,000 people have been invited, he said. As authorities searched Monday for the gunman, Obama lamented that ""we are confronting yet another mass shooting, and today, it happened on a military installation in our nation's capital."" He said the gunfire targeted military and civilian personnel, men and women who were going to work and doing their jobs. Two of many: The President and First Lady were among the thousands that attended the memorial service at a Marine barracks near the Navy Yard . Addressing an awards dinner Saturday night in Washington, Obama said these families ""now know the same unspeakable grief of families in Newtown, and Aurora, and Tucson, and Chicago, and New Orleans, and all across the country, people whose loved ones were torn from them without headlines sometimes, or public outcry."" But he said that kind of violence is happening every day. He urged supporters ""to get back up and go back at it"" to push gun control legislation that stalled in the Senate earlier this year, part of a package of measures Obama promised to push after the December killing of 20 first-graders and six educators at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. ""As long as there are those who fight to make it as easy as possible for dangerous people to get their hands on a gun, then we've got to work as hard as possible for the sake of our children,"" Obama said, in a likely preview of his remarks Sunday. ""We've got to be ones who are willing to do more work to make it harder."" Slowly returning to normal: Navy security stands watch at the Washington Navy Yard . The Navy Yard itself re-opened for normal operations on Thursday, three days after the shooting. The building where the shooting took place remains closed. Obama has taken on the role of the nation's chief consoler several times already this year, and many more times throughout his nearly five years in office. This year, he led the mourning for victims of an explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas, and a double bombing at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. He also consoled victims of a major tornado that flattened the town of Moore, Okla. Obama also has mourned victims of other mass shootings, including in Newtown, Conn., and at shopping mall in Tucson, Ariz., that severely wounded then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.","The memorial service was held at a Marine barracks near the site of last week's mass killing of 12 innocents .

The smugglers, who became known as the ‘Tesco’ of the cannabis world, hid super-strong skunk in crates of flowers from Holland to conceal its stench for delivery into ports in Essex and Hull, in the North East. The 'Flowers Gang' enjoyed holidays in Dubai, Italy and Spain, and invested in 12 plush . £500,000 property developments in Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands. Wads of rotting £10 and £20 notes were discovered by police when they raided the drug smuggling gang's safehouses after a 14-month undercover operation . The activities of the 12-strong mob, who were all jailed for a total of more than 100 years, earned them more than £20million in profits and inspired an episode of BBC crime drama The Shadow Line. The gang flooded Britain’s streets with almost 19 tonnes of the drug between June 2006 and November 2008, believed to be the UK’s biggest wholesale cannabis operation. But they could not spend their . cash quickly enough, and when police raided  safe houses after a 14-month undercover operation they recovered . wads of decaying £10 and £20 notes. Today Judge Gregory Stone QC ordered four members to pay a total of nearly £6million and warned the convicts of years added to their sentence if they don’t pay within six months. Southwark Crown Court heard how the criminals ‘have been reduced to a state of bankruptcy’ by the orders. Kingpin Anthony Mills, 44 , was described as one of Britain’s most wanted fugitives before his arrest two years ago. Mills created a ‘board of directors’ overseeing a nationwide drug sales network from company headquarters in Surrey. Large packages of super-strong skunk cannabis were recovered when police stopped the gang's smuggling network - believed to be the biggest of its kind in Britain .

The drugs were hidden inside crates of flowers from Holland, labelled 'American Leaf', then taken to a network of distribution hubs across Britain were they were sold on at a large mark-up . Boxes of imported flowers were found to contain skunk cannabis, pictured, and played a key part in the gang's estimated £20million profits . Prosecutor Timothy Cray said: ‘If the man pushing cannabis on the . street, the small-time dealer, is equivalent to the market trader . selling his fruit and veg outside London Bridge station, then this group . were the big players, the Tesco. Mills also oversaw a huge money laundering operation, setting up . companies in international tax havens Switzerland, Panama and the . British Virgin Islands, to hide profits. He also had interests in UK property through his security consultancy . company, A and M Services, which claimed to specialise in surveillance . and phone tapping. The cannabis was grown in vast greenhouses hidden among legitimate crops. Regular shipments arrived via Harwich port in Essex hidden inside . boxes of flowers from Holland, labelled ‘American Leaf’. When customs officials at the ferry port disrupted their supply chain by . seizing a £750,000 shipment, the crooks simply switched their operation . to Hull in the North East. The crates were dropped off at a warehouse registered to T&K Flowers . in Chatham, Kent, before being delivered to secure lock-ups in . Kingston, Worcester Park, Epsom, and Ashtead, all in Surrey. A trial in 2010 and 2011 heard how the gang flooded the market with £62million worth of skunk over two years. Mark Kinnimont, left, who is also serving 14 . years, must pay nearly £1.3million within six months or face another six . years in prison and Peter Moran, right, was ordered to pay nearly . £1.5million or face another six and a half years on top of his 14-year . sentence . The gang paid £2,200 per kg for the drug, and made profits by selling it to regional UK wholesalers at £3,400 - who peddled it on the street for £5,760 per kg. Today Mills, 44, who was earlier jailed for 17 and a half years, was ordered to pay back nearly £1.7million and told he would face an extra seven years behind bars if he refused. His deputy Terence Bowler, 44, who is currently serving a 16-year sentence, was ordered to pay nearly £1.5million or face an extra six and a half years.

Since then, he has reportedly fallen behind on mortgage payments for his $11.4million estate to the tune of $127,686.91, JPMorgan Chase Bank told TMZ. When reached for comment, the porn peddler told the website his accountant was handling the problem. Just last month, Mr Francis was sentenced to a minimum of 270 days in jail for assault and false imprisonment after a 2011 incident in which he grabbed a woman by the neck and slammed her head into the floor of his soon-to-be repossessed home. The house that spring break built: The Francis estate, center bottom, is reportedly worth over $11million .

Prince William and Kate Middleton’s university landlady has revealed how she almost turned away the future King – because she wasn’t sure how he would behave ‘off the leash’. The couple are said to have fallen in love at the flat they shared with two other friends – Fergus Boyd and Olivia Bleasdale – while studying at St Andrews University. But the flat was almost refused to them. Speaking publicly for the first time, landlady Charlotte Smith said she initially decided against renting her Victorian terrace to the Prince because she had a ‘no-boys’ policy. She said: ‘We’d had an unfortunate experience with some boys in the flat once before and we were determined not to have young men there again. ‘Broken furniture, broken windows – there was a lot of damage, so that put us off really.

She also revealed that William, whom she described as a ‘very friendly, very charming … thoroughly nice man’, did not try to negotiate on the ‘very reasonably priced’ rent. She added: ‘We arranged to meet Kate Middleton, Fergus and Olivia before they moved in but we thought we’d better not ask to see Prince William because we thought his credit rating must be quite good. But he insisted on meeting us.’ Speaking about Kate, Mrs Smith said: ‘She was very friendly. She had her younger brother there at the time – I think just visiting – and she was very caring, making sure that he knew what was going on. They came across as a very nice group of people.’ But she kept tight-lipped about the fledging Royal romance: ‘I imagine that they all got on very well together,decided to take the flat and whatever happened then happened.’","Landlady Charlotte Smith almost turned away the future King because she had a 'no-boys' policy .

Paul O'Grady has spoken out in support of soap actor Michael Le Vell, who was recently cleared of sex abuse charges . Comedian Paul O'Grady has thrown his support behind soap star Michael Le Vell, claiming the Coronation Street actor has been the victim of a 'witch hunt'. Le Vell was cleared of child sex charges just two weeks ago and O'Grady, the presenter of ITV's For The Love Of Dogs, called the claims made against the TV veteran 'completely false'. He also said prominent sports stars get away with shocking behaviour while TV stars are relentlessly pursued. O'Grady said: 'It seems to be one rule for one and one rule for the other. If you’re a sportsperson you can get away with murder. 'You can get as many prossies and snort as much coke as you like and get paid billions a week.' Instead of celebrities like Le Vell, O'Grady says 'villains' like corrupt bankers and politicians should be hounded. He told the Daily Mirror: 'It’s shocking what they put him through and what they put his family through. 'That stigma, it’s the worst stigma. Imagine being accused of that? It’s dreadful, it’s completely falsified.' After Mr Le Vell’s acquittal Mr Starmer spoke out in defence of the decision, saying: ‘It was a properly-brought case. The idea that if a case results in an acquittal it shouldn’t have been brought is wrong.’ Following the verdict, questions arose over whether the prosecution should have been brought at all after it emerged the case against Mr Le Vell was initially dropped by the CPS in January 2012 due to a lack of evidence. Only following the intervention of Alison Levitt QC, principal legal adviser to Keir Starmer QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, in February did the CPS change their mind and authorise Greater Manchester Police to charge the actor. Innocent: The Coronation Street star, 48, was cleared of rape and indecent assault .

Self-confessed alcoholic Le Vell, 48, has to prove to ITV chiefs that he can resist a drink before they can put him in the jungle. During his trial he admitted to drinking up to 12 pints a night. Corrie bosses have allegedly offered him a £200,000-a-year deal to come back after his character was last seen heading to Germany to look after his father who suffered a heart attack.

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 12:44 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:49 EST, 23 September 2013 . Victim: Matthew Shepard was a 21-year-old college student when he was beaten and left to die in Laramie, Wyoming in October 1998 . New claims have been made about the murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard in 1998 saying that his death was not actually a hate crime like it has so often described. Journalist Stephen Jimenez claims that Shepard was pistol whipped, beaten and tortured before being tied to a fence and left to die not because he was gay but because his attackers were high on meth and wanted to take his money. Attackers Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson were both given life sentences and spoke out in 2004 saying that they had been on methamphetamine fore days before the October 6, 1998 beating in Laramie, Wyoming but gay rights activists have blasted the book for being an attempt at re-writing history. Jimenez maintains that over the course of more than 100 interviews with people with connections to the case he discovered that Shepard was made into a gay rights martyr after the fact. He claims to have found a previously-sealed letter in the court filings on the case where a local male hustler wrote that Aaron McKinney  'really did like having sex with gay guys, that he wasn't unfamiliar with homosexuality and the gay world'. If that claim is true, it would dent the argument that the beating death was based around the attacker's fear of homosexuality. In earlier interviews, Jimenez says that . McKinney and Henderson believed that Shepard was going to trade them . drugs in return for sex and that they decided to rob him. Attackers: Russell Henderson (left) and Aaron McKinney (right) both received to two consecutive life sentences for Shepard's murder and the case prompted the creation of national hate crime legislation . New theory: Now journalist Stephen Jimenez (left), who is gay himself, has written a book claiming that Shepard was killed because the two attackers were high on meth and wanted to rob him . Though he told FoxNews that he maintained 'rigorous journalistic standards' during the investigation, this is not the first time that Jimenez has caused controversy on this topic. Left-leaning site Media Matters said that Jimenez initially prompted outrage when he produced a news segment for 20/20 where he interviewed McKinney who said that the attack was fuelled by his recent meth binge. 'Sometimes when you have that rage going through you, there’s no stopping it,' McKinney said during that interview. 'All I wanted to do was beat him up and rob him … Seemed like a good idea at the time.' The press release accompanying the book painted Jimenez as an unbiased journalist, saying that 'his aim was to write a screenplay on what he, and the rest of the nation, believed to be an open-and-shut case of bigoted violence,' going on to mention that 'as a gay man, he felt an added moral imperative to tell Matthew’s story'. Controversial: The case garnered national attention because of the belief that the murder was caused by homophobia, but now this new book claims to debunk that theory . National action: President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard Act into law in 2009 which made hate crimes a federal issue . One key connection that was left out is that Jimenez is a friend of attacker Russell Henderson's defense attorney, Tim Newcomb. The death of Matthew Shepard- who was found in a coma after being left on the fence for 18 hours and subsequently pronounced dead six days later- was a major turning point for gay rights and hate crimes prosecution across the country. In 2009 President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law, making it a federal crime to attack someone based on their actual or perceived gender or sexual orientation. The Matthew Shepard Foundation has blasted all of the assertions in Jimenez’s book, writing them off as ‘innuendo, rumor or conspiracy theories’. 'Attempts now to rewrite the story of this hate crime appear to be based on untrustworthy sources, factual errors, rumors and innuendo rather than the actual evidence gathered by law enforcement and presented in a court of law,' the group said through a statement.","Murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard in 1998 caused national outrage and led to creation of federal hate crime laws .

BlackBerry has agreed to sell itself for $4.7billion, marking the end of the smartphone giant following years of devastating losses. BlackBerry said Monday that a letter of intent has been signed with its largest shareholder, a Canadian group called Fairfax. As part of the deal, each of the company's shares will be paid $9 in cash for each of their holdings. Scroll down for video . Going private: In spite of Research in Motion CEO Thorsten Heins' efforts to relaunch the smartphone company, they reported losses over $1billion and now have decided to sell to one of their largest shareholders . Losing hold of the market: Research In Motion RIM (which owns BlackBerry) has been controlling a declining portion of the smartphone market as competitors like Apple's iOS and Android phones become more popular . Fairfax head Prem Watsa is a former board member who owns 10 per cent of BlackBerry. 1985- Research in Motion founded as a electronics and technology company in Ontario1999- RIM releases their first handheld phone that uses the email and data network technology that they have been building for over a decade2001- Blackberry phones were extremely popular with business people and many inside the World Trade Center use the Blackberry networks to communicate when cell service failed during the September 11 attacks2004- The company reports having more than one million users2007- Steve Jobs releases the Apple iPhone and it is heralded as the next big thing in technology but RIM still marks milestone months later by reporting 10 million subscribers2008- Blackberry launches their first touch-screen, keyboard-less model (called BlackBerry Storm) and it tanks2010- RIM releases the BlackBerry Torch that has both a touch screen and a keyboard2011- Company shares drop to between $5.25 and $6 2013- RIM CEO Thorsten Heins reveals the latest model- the BlackBerry 10- but it fails to impress as the company reports first quarter losses and later an additional billion-dollar loss . Watsa stepped down when BlackBerry announced it was considering a sale last month. The billionaire is one of Canada's best-known value investors. ‘We can deliver immediate value to shareholders, while we continue the execution of a long-term strategy in a private company with a focus on delivering superior and secure enterprise solutions to BlackBerry customers around the world,’ Watsa said in a statement. Trading of the company's stock was halted ahead of the news. BlackBerry shares plunged after the company announced Friday a loss of nearly $1billion and layoffs of 4,500 workers or 40 per cent of its global workforce, as it tries to slash costs by 50 per cent and shift its focus back to competing mainly for the business customers most loyal to its brand. Blackberry phones, which first hit the tech scene in 1999, were once so addictive it inspired the nickname 'CrackBerry'. President Barack Obama confessed to . being among the millions of devotees who couldn't bear to stop tapping . feverishly away on its tiny keyboard and Madonna once said she slept . with hers under her pillow. Then came the iPhone. This . year's launch of BlackBerry 10, its revamped operating system, and . fancier new devices - the touchscreen Z10 and Q10 for keyboard loyalists . - was supposed to rejuvenate the brand and lure customers. Massive drop: The company stock (seen here from 2006 to present day) has declined dramatically, most notably after 2007 when the iPhone was first released and came in as major competition to BlackBerry smartphones . New leadership: Prem Watsa (pictured), who heads a Canadian investment group called Fairfax, is a former board member who owns 10 per cent of BlackBerry and now he is buying the company . But the much-delayed phones have failed to turn the company around. At their peak in the fall of 2009, BlackBerry's smartphones enjoyed global market share of over 20 per cent, says Mike Walkley, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity. Their piece of the pie has since evaporated to just 1.5 per cent.","Smartphone giant being bought by their biggest shareholder and will payout shares at $9-a-piece .

Jennifer Dempsey pleaded guilty on Friday morning to child molestation, attempted sexual conduct with a minor and sexual conduct with a minor. She is accused of engaging in sex acts with a 14-year-old and 16-year-old in her car at a Phoenix park and at her home between November and January, and police believe she may have many more victims. 'Con artist': Jennifer Dempsey, 35, posed as a 16-year-old girl on Facebook to con young boys into having sex with her . Phoenix police Sgt Trent Crump said the . Dempsey also lied about being pregnant and for the past five years has . convinced her family she is dying of cancer when she is perfectly . healthy. He said she even attempted to use the fake illness to avoid . arrest last week. 'She used her cancer ploy to our detectives to try and stay out of trouble,' Crump told CBS5 News. 'She said this is the reason why she didn't engage in the sexual conduct because she was constantly ill from chemotherapy, all of which we learned in the following days, was not true.' According to Azcentral.com, Dempsey used various names to lure the boys on Facebook. When they came to her home that she shares with her husband, she told the victims the property belonged to her aunt. Cancer hoax: The married woman, pictured left and right in her mug shot, also lied about being pregnant with the teens' children and convinced her family she had cancer for five years . Crump said Dempsey lied to both teens . about being pregnant and even met with one of the boy's parents to . discuss the fake pregnancy, which is how her plan was foiled. After the meeting, the parents raised concerns about her age with police and also said they'd discovered nude photos of Dempsey on their son's cell phone. Crump said incriminating text messages led to her arrest and a search of her home uncovered further evidence. Dempsey has admitted having sex with the older boy but denies sleeping with the 14-year-old though police said statements she made when questioned corroborated claims she did engage in sex acts with him. To keep the intricate five-year-long cancer hoax alive, Dempsey shaved her head, bought wigs and had a fake chemotherapy port taped to her chest to fool her relatives, Crump said. It is not clear what the motive for the fake illness was. Home: Dempsey had sex with the boys at her Phoenix home, pictured, though she told them it belonged to her aunt . Neighbors told CBS5 they regularly saw the woman with a tube in her chest as she came and went from her condominium complex. 'It was my belief that she was very, very ill,' Carolyn Chavez, the office manager at Dempsey's apartment, told the news channel. 'She wore a tube all the time. We've had other residents with cancer and I thought she fit the profile.' Another neighbor Elizabeth Slipek said: 'It really is shocking.' 'I can't believe somebody would go to great lengths to go to something like that. It's ridiculous, especially as an adult.'

A man was Tasered and arrested by police today after he allegedly burst into a bank with a makeshift flamethrower and threatened to burn it to the ground because he was refused an overdraft. Police were called after the man made threats in a Barclays branch in Acle, Norfolk, at 12.20pm. He is thought to have been carrying a blowtorch and a can of petrol. Officers discharged a Taser on the man then arrested him on suspicion of making threats. He is also said to have threatened to set himself on fire, though he did not light the blowtorch at any point. Threat response: Police were seen today outside the bank before leaving with evidence . Gathering: Policemen were seen entering the . bank, then leaving again with bags of evidence.

A police spokesman said: 'A 60-year-old man from the Great Yarmouth area has been arrested and is currently in custody at Great Yarmouth police investigation centre where he will be questioned.' Officers were later seen leaving the bank with bags of evidence, including what appeared to be a green petrol can. There are thought to have been four members of staff in the bank at the time, though most of them were able to escape through the rear door. Jackie Clover, who runs the Clover Tea . Rooms opposite the bank, said: 'We heard that he had got upset as he had been turned down for an overdraft extension. Maybe he was someone in business who had got to the end of his tether. 'Then around 90 minutes after the police first arrived, this grey-haired man was taken out and put in the back of a police car. 'When the police opened the outer door, you could see the glass inner door had been shattered and had cracks all over it like a broken windscreen. It is unclear under what exact circumstances the man had a Taser used on him.

A former Syrian weapons chief has claimed that he was ordered to by President Assad to use chemical weapons on his own people, but that he could not bring himself to do it. Brigadier-General Zaher al-Sakat, who was in charge of chemical weapons in a contested area of southern Syria, said he was given orders directly from Assad to use deadly gases on rebel soldiers, but replaced the payloads with a harmless substitute. The general, who has moved to Jordan, also said he believed that the Syrian government had perpetrated 34 chemical weapons attacks, many more than the 14 previously thought. Orders: General Zaher al-Sakat claims that President Bashar Assad (pictured) ordered him to use chemical weapons against the Syrian people three times . The Assad regime still vigorously denies that it ever ordered chemical weapons attacks – which it blames on rebel forces – but it has nonetheless admitted that it possesses chemical weapons, and has agreed a sensitive deal to hand over its arsenal. But, in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, general Sakat also claimed that Assad is trying to ‘cheat’ the deal, brokered by Russia, by sending a portion of his chemical weapons to allies in Lebanon and Iran. International pressure on Syria came to a head last month after footage emerged of the victims of an attack in the country’s capital city, Damascus. UN inspectors were later allowed to inspect the site, and found evidence that the deadly chemical agent sarin had been used, killing more than 1,400 people. But the general says that chemical attacks had been ordered – and were underway - long before that. Avoided: A Syrian man mourns a dead body after a sarin gas attack.

Weapons: UN inspectors found evidence of deadly sarin gas having been used against Syrian people (file photo) In the interview he said that he had been ordered to attack civilian targets in the rebel districts of Sheikh Masqeen, Herak, and Busra, using a mixture of phosgene and other chlorine-based gases, which are less deadly than sarin. But general Sakat said that before each of the attacks – between October 2012 and January 2013 - he secretly replaced the chemical canisters with a mixture of bleach and water, which would still smell like deadly chemical weapons but not kill anybody. He said: ‘They were completely convinced that this was the same poisonous material. In this way I saved hundreds of lives of children and others.’ Deal: President Assad and President Putin of Russia brokered a deal to surrender Syrain chemical weapons (file photo) He then fled to Jordan after he felt his superiors were suspicious of the lack of deaths caused by his attacks, but claims to have been keeping up with the progress of the attacks using a network of informants. Although Preisdent Assad has agreed to hand over his weapons, and Russian officials have said they are making plans for what to do if Assad ‘cheats’ the system. But General Sakat said that before a deal was even proposed, the Syrian regime had begun sending its weapons to allies in the militant organisation Hezbollah in Lebanon at four different sites. A spokesman for the rebel Free Syrian Army, backed the claims, saying: ‘We, along with many other international sources learned, through documents and other evidence about the transfer of Syrian chemical weapons to Hizbollah in Lebanon nearly three months ago.’","Brigadier-General Zaher al-Sakat was in charge of chemical weapons in contested area of Syria .

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 11:56 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:22 EST, 23 September 2013 . A 500-year-old piece of the battle flag which flew on the field where King Richard III was slain is going up for auction. The red and gold cloth fragment was, auctioneers believe, a standard of the future Henry VII during the pivotal and bloody fight between the houses of Lancaster and York which took place at Bosworth Field in 1485. Hansons Auctioneers say the remnant, measuring six-and-a-half inches by five-and-a-half inches, should make between £3,000 and £5,000 when they auction it this weekend. A piece of history: The battered fragment from the flag has survived more than five centuries . Henry Tudor, left, defeated Richard III, right, at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 to become King Henry VII . The firm's Charles Hanson said the fragment was part of a far larger flag carried by Sir Robert Harcourt who was standard bearer to Henry Tudor during the fight. 'It's difficult to say exactly what the standard would have looked like but it probably measured at least two foot by four foot and was a large flag that was held aloft for army colleagues to see on a hill - it would have been very much a focal point for a military advancement,' he said. 'It is an incredible find from one of the most important battles ever fought on British soil.' Henry's forces killed Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field, ending . the Wars of the Roses and marking the beginning of the Tudor dynasty . which ruled England until 1603. The Derbyshire-based auctioneer said the flag fragment had been one of three decaying parts originally hung above the tomb of Sir Robert Harcourt, who was standard bearer to the then Henry Tudor during the battle. Sir Robert, a Knight Of The Bath, was buried in St Michael's Church in Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, after he died in 1490.  The remnant was then passed to a local family who passed it down through generations before deciding to sell it. The red and gold remnant of the battle standard dates back to the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 . Mr Hanson said the material's provenance was 'very good' as it had been in the keeping of the same family in Northamptonshire since at least 1847, when it had been mounted in a frame for safe-keeping. He said: 'Our vendors are obviously aware of its social value today since the imagination of what happened at the Battle of Bosworth will keep historians debating for years to come. 'I am just delighted such a fundamental accessory to that 1485 battle has been unearthed only months after finding King Richard III in a Leicester car park. 'As an auctioneer, I thrive on the social relevance such bygone artefacts had on society.  If only this fragment could talk it could tell us so much.' The bloody Battle of Bosworth Field ended with the death of Richard III and a decisive Lancastrian victory . The auctioneer told MailOnline he hoped the flag would be bought by someone in the UK, preferably a museum or a collector who would put it on permanent loan in a British museum. International interest in King . Richard has boomed after human remains uncovered in an old friary . beneath a Leicester car park in 2012 were earlier this year confirmed by . experts as being those of the late monarch - the last of the Yorkist . line, who reigned from 1483 until his death in battle. Mr Hanson said that the current interest in the Yorkist king around the world meant that the fragment may fetch 'considerably more' than its estimate when it is auctioned on Saturday. The Battle of Bosworth Field was fought on the morning of August 22, 1485 and marked the end of the War Of The Roses, the 30-year civil war between the houses of York and Lancaster. Standard bearer Sir Robert Harcourt was buried in Stanton Harcourt church in Oxfordshire with the flag . The battle flag hung over the tomb of Henry's standard bearer Sir Robert Harcourt in an Oxfordshire church . One of the most important clashes in English history, it saw the death of Richard III, ushered in the Tudor dynasty and gave Shakespeare one of his best known quotations - 'A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse'. The battle marked the final confrontation between the Yorkist king Richard III and his challenger Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond and leader of the House of Lancaster. Following an unsuccessful attempt to invade England from his base in France, Henry arrived on the coast of Wales on August 1, 1485. Gathering support as he marched inland, Richard hurriedly mustered troops and intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire. After Richard's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned King Henry VII and became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty, which lasted until 1603. The remains of Richard III, who died in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth Field, were discovered by archaeologists under a car park in Leicester last September. Since then where his remains should lie has been the subject of a fierce battle between Leicester Cathedral, the Richard III Society, and a group of the king's distant relatives. Earlier this month the cathedral announced plans for a £1.3m tomb for the king, but the society branded the design 'too modern and stylised' and said it would withdraw £40,000 of funding. Unlikely grave: The warrior king's remains were found during a dig under a car park in Leicester last year . The society's Philippa Langley, who initiated the search for his remains, said the design was too contemporary and did not reflect the fact 'that there is a warrior king beneath the ground'. The cathedral has hit back, saying it will not change the design to secure the funding from the historical group and that it would not be 'held hostage'. Meanwhile the Plantagenet Alliance, a group of distant relatives of the long-dead king, has weighed into the argument, calling for his remains to be buried in York, where Richard had strong links. The alliance last month won a judicial review of the licence that said his remains should go to Leicester.

Accused: Midwife Valerie El Halta has been accused of negligent homicide for the death of a baby . An unlicensed midwife who was sued for a baby's death in Michigan has now been charged with negligent homicide in a second newborn's death after moving to Utah. Valerie El Halta, 71, oversaw a home birth in Moab on August 17 but the baby suffered oxygen deprivation and his mother nearly bled to death after the midwife allegedly administered prescription drugs and procedures - such as a 'vacuum' to pull out the baby - that she was not licensed to carry out. Utah allows lay, unlicensed midwives to practice legally, as long as they are assisting in a low-risk natural birth. This is not El Halta's first brush with the law. Another family sued her for the death of their child in 1993 and other mothers have claimed she was forceful and carried out painful procedures - with one branding the aggressive, involuntary treatment 'rape', the Salt Lake Tribune reported. She began practicing in California in . the 1970s and carried out home births for seven years there - although . lay midwifery is illegal in the state. In . 1983, she was charged in Manteca with two felony counts of practicing . medicine without a license and a charge of illegally possessing a . hypodermic syringe, according to The Modesto Bee. She pleaded guilty but told reporters . that she planned to move to Oregon, where she was allowed to practice . legally. Oregon has since passed restrictions for unlicensed midwives. She worked in the state and then trained interns in Texas before opening a center in Michigan. Scene: The newborn died at Primary Children's . Medical Center in Salt Lake City in August after El Halta allegedly . carried out procedures and administered drugs she was not licensed to use . But . in 1993, her center was smacked with a lawsuit after patient Rebecca . Malloy, from Macomb, lost one of her twins, accusing the midwife of . failing to call 911 quick enough. The . baby, Lia Joy, was taken away by staff just hours after her birth - and . three weeks later she died. Doctors told her they did not know if Lia . would have survived if she'd been born in hospital. 'Valerie wasted, like, a whole hour,' Malloy told the Tribune. 'She played . god. She had this ego: She was the guru of birth. Valerie knew there was . a problem, and she withheld the information from us.' Malloy . sued El Halta and said she received a $1 million default judgment, but . attorneys said El Halta was 'uncollectable,' as non-nurse midwives are . not required to carry malpractice insurance. Another patient, Kya Rose from . Lancing, Michigan, sought El Halta's help with her birth in 1996 but . endured a painful experience, she told the Tribune. The most horrifying part came when the midwife used a 'vacuum' to pull out her child. 'It was the single most painful thing Val . did during my birth,' Rose said. 'She had both of her hands inside me. I . was yelling at her to get them out, but she refused because she was . helping. If someone has two hands in you, and you're telling them no, . and they don't stop - that's why I call it a rape.' El Halta had become a Certified . Professional Midwife in 1996 - but was stripped of her certification in . 2001 when a panel found she had strayed outside her 'scope of practice'. She then moved to Utah and continued practicing as an unlicensed midwife. Problematic: Another mother in Michigan sued El . Halta for the death of her daughter, while others have claimed she . carried out painful procedures and ignored their pained cries (file . picture) In the most recent case in Utah, she participated in the birth after meeting with the mother - who has not been named - four times. The mother was a high-risk pregnancy as . she had previously had three C-sections - but El Halta allegedly told . her that she had substantial experience performing vaginal births with . women who had undergone such procedures. She is not legally allowed to carry out high-risk births. Valerie El Halta has overseen thousands of births across the country and finally settled in Utah, where it is not illegal for her to carry out midwife services without a license. The Salt Lake Tribune noted that Utah allows three types of midwives: . Nurse Midwives who have the equivalent of a master's degree and work alongside doctors . Certified . Professional Midwife - a title given out by the North American Registry . of Midwives, which is the status of home birth midwives in the state. They can use some prescription drugs but may only take low-risk clients . There are also unlicensed, lay midwives in the state. They are not regulated by any professional body but they are allowed to conduct home births that are low risk and natural . Utah code requires them to limit . their practice 'to a normal pregnancy that is low risk at the start of . labor and remains low risk throughout the course of labor and delivery' - a code which the lawsuit claims El Halta broke. Oregon also shared the same attitude towards voluntary licensing until this summer, when it passed restrictions. Thirteen . other states, from Nevada to Maine, neither license nor forbid non-nurse midwives and in 10 . states, non-nurse midwives may not practice legally, the Tribune noted. On August 17, she reportedly administered a prescription drug to the 41-year-old mother, claiming it was from her pharmacist son, yet she was not licensed to do so. The drug, Cytotec, has been known to cause uterine rupture or other complications when administered to pregnant women, court documents noted. The mother received three more doses. El Halta allegedly tried to speed up the birth and gave the mother a painful examination. At one point, she checked the baby's pulse and it slowed down before becoming normal again. The mother began to vomit and have diarrhea, and after about an hour, the baby's heartbeat could no longer be heard. The midwife 'panicked and . grabbed a ... ""vacuum"", attached it to the newborn's head and pulled the . newborn from the mother with one pull', court documents state. The baby came out with its umbilical cord wrapped around its body, which was blue. He was not breathing and El Halta performed CPR on the . baby as 911 was called. The mother hemorrhaged four cups of blood, and El Halta tried to . suture her, which she was not licensed to do, court documents allege. The mother was taken to Moab Regional . Hospital where doctors learned that the vacuum had caused 'profound trauma' to the mother's . vaginal area that would have soon led to her death. She received blood and plasma and was flown to a hospital in Grand . Junction, Colorado, where she received transfusions that saved her life. But her newborn died a week later at hospital from oxygen . deprivation. El Halta has been charged with . unlawful conduct, which carries a penalty of up to . five years in prison, and with negligent homicide and . reckless endangerment, which each carry one year. El Halta, from Eagle Mountain, told the Daily Herald that she was very upset by the allegations, adding that 'most of it is untrue'. In a previous interview with a Michigan newspaper, El Halta said that she was made for midwifery. 'They'll have to cut off my hands to stop me,' she said.","Valerie El Halta is charged with negligent homicide after 'she administered drugs and carried out procedures she was not licensed to use'

In an interview with the Sunday People, Mrs Allwood said she has tried to kill herself twice, and still battles an alcohol addiction, and speaks out against the accusations she 'cashed in' on the tragedy. She said: 'Over three days and nights I miscarried eight times. 'I cradled each of them for two-and-a-half hours as they died in my arms. It was horrible. Truly horrible.' She said she prayed to God when she felt the last of her children being born that at least one of them would live, only for her eighth child to die too. The children are all buried in West Norwood Cemetery, South London. She said her grief was worsened by the media attention her pregnancy attracted.

But, she said, despite going on to have three daughters, she was still unable to recover from her devastating loss. She told the paper she was at her lowest ebb in 2008, when she would drink wine from the minute she woke up, even ordering a taxi to taker to buy more up to four more bottles after she lost her driving licence, . She said she was even given an Asbo after she repeatedly played Sinead O’Connor’s Nothing Compares to You on full volume, 'deafening' her neighbours. Then followed two suicide attempts. The first, in a public toilet in Warwick, saw her swallow 90 paracetamol tablets, washed down with two bottles of white wine, and resulted in her spending five days in a high-dependency unit. She claims there was little help offered to her in the days that followed. Following the death of her children, her story was featured in newspapers around the world, on the Oprah Winfrey show, and she even had a personal message of support from Princess Diana . The eight white coffins of the babies were topped by pink posies for the two girls and blue for the six boys . Mrs Allwood said the second attempt made her realise she needed to completely change her life and start again with new friends. She the spent five months in a residential rehab centre in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, in 2009. Before the tragedy Mrs Allwood had a son Charlie from her failed marriage. But after longing for children with new partner Paul Hudson and suffering repeated miscarriages she took fertility drugs. Claims were made at the time that Mrs Allwood went against medical advice by having the fertility treatment in the first place; and that afterwards she cashed in on the tragedy. Mrs Allwood, who went on to have three daughters, has rejected these accusations and has said she wants to help others who have experienced the horror of a miscarriage. She  said she was 'angry' that some people judged her for her decision not to abort any of the eight foetuses to give the rest a chance of survival. She admits that she still has 'depression days' where she can't speak to anyone, and still takes the 'odd sleeping tablet' but that she draws strength from helping a 'small circle of friends' who also suffer with depression.

Two hurricanes which hit Mexico have so far claimed the lives of 115 people as rescuers continue to search for 68 feared dead following a huge mudslide. The Mexican army's emergency response and rescue team is leading the search for victims of the massive landslide which has wiped out half of the remote coffee-growing village of La Pintada. Five bodies were discovered on Sunday including a man found wedged under the collapsed roof of a dirt-filled home. Devastation: The hurricanes have completely wiped out the remote coffee-growing village of La Pintada . Lieutenant Carlos Alberto Mendoza, commander of the 16-soldier team, said it is the most daunting situation he has seen in 24 years with the army. 'They are doing unbelievable work, hours and hours for just one body,' he told The Associated Press. 'No matter how hard the day is, they never get tired of working.' The twin storms, Manuel and Ingrid, simultaneously pounded both of Mexico's coasts a week ago, leading to huge floods and landslides across a third of the country. The official death toll has grown to 115, the Interior Ministry said Sunday night. Rescue workers walk over mud at the site of a landslide in the village of La Pintada, Mexico . Destruction: Mud covers houses and cars in La Pintada after it was hit by two hurricanes which resulted in a mudslide . President Enrique Pena Nieto toured the devastated village following the landslide which covered at least 40 homes. He said: 'As of today, there is little hope now that we will find anyone alive.' Survivors staying at a shelter in Acapulco recounted how a tidal wave of dirt, rocks and trees exploded through the center of town, burying families in their homes and sweeping wooden houses into the bed of the swollen river that winds past the village on its way to the Pacific. The scene by Sunday was desolate, a ghost town where 50 people still awaited evacuation. One man remained to care for abandoned goats, pigs and chickens that seemed disoriented as they roamed about. When the rains get too hard, the crew has to stop for fear of being buried themselves by another slide, Liuetenant Mendoza said. Ricardo de La Cruz, national director of Civil Protection, said 'The fundamental problem continues to be the rain. Operation: Rescue workers remove debris during the search for bodies in La Pintada . 'It complicates the rescue work not only by putting residents at risk, but the military and support crews as well.' Pena Nieto told storm survivors that La Pintada would be relocated and rebuilt in a safer location as officials responded to a wave of criticism that negligence and corruption were to blame for the vast devastation caused by two relatively weak storm systems. He said: 'I will come to inaugurate a new La Pintada. 'That's a promise I'm making today to this community, which has undergone such a misfortune.' The government has been critisied however, being blamed for making natural disasters worse because of poor planning, lack of a prevention strategy and corruption. A spokesman for Mexico's nonprofit Center of Investigation for Development wrote in an online editorial criticising a federal program to improve infrastructure and relocate communities out of dangerous flood zones.

Villagers on a small boat pass next to a home that was washed away by tropical storm Manuel near Atoyac de Alvarez, Mexico . 'Governments aren't responsible for the occurrence of severe weather, but they are for the prevention of the effects. 'The National Water Program had good intentions but its execution was at best poor.' Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre publicly confirmed that corruption and political dealings allowed housing to be built in dangerous areas where permits should have been rejected. Interior Secretary Miguel Osorio Chong said at a news conference earlier in the week: 'The responsibility falls on authorities. 'In some cases (the building) was in irregular zones, but they still gave the authorization.' Both the federal and Guerrero state administrations are new and cited cases in the past, though . Osorio Chong said that going forward, he is sure that Aguirre and the mayor of Acapulco will not allow flooded-out victims to return to high-risk areas. Rescue workers search for bodies La Pintada where the death toll has so far reached 115 . Villagers are evacuated from flooded areas in the town of Tixtla de Guerrero in Mexico . Pena Nieto promised more aid after touring the damage in the northern state of Sinaloa, where Manuel hit as a hurricane last Thursday, affecting 175,000 people. With record amounts of rain not seen since 1955, Pena Nieto said the national disaster fund would not cover the damage and urged state and local governments to quickly calculate their losses so he could adjust his proposed 2014 federal budget, which he recently submitted to congress. The storms affected 24 of Mexico's 31 states and 371 municipalities, which are the equivalent of counties. More than 58,000 people were evacuated and 43,000 taken to shelters. Nearly 1,000 donation centers have been set up around the country, with nearly 700 tons of aid delivered so far. Nearly 800,000 people lost power across the country, athough the Federal Electricity Commission said 94 per cent of service had been restored as of Saturday morning.","Half of the remote coffee-growing village of La Pintada has been wiped out .

A Dutch artist has fashioned a human skull out of cocaine by moulding the street-sourced class A drug mixed with gelatin. The piece, entitled Ecce Animal, is the work of mysterious artist Diddo who says he was commissioned to make the artwork, although is prohibited from disclosing further details. Diddo says he did not personally test the cocaine but employed a laboratory to analyse the drug bought from a street dealer. They found it was between 15 per cent to 20 per cent pure and had been cut with caffeine, paracetamol and sugar. Heads up: The life-like sculpture is claimed to be moulded using a street-sourced class-A drug . Mystery: The artist who created the unusual sculpture refuses to say who commissioned it . Binding agreement: Gelatin was used to bind the drug powder together . Ecce Animal is a comment on the juxtaposition of man's animal instincts versus the relatively comfortable modern world we live in. Diddo, 36, explains: 'Ecce Animal is not intended to be parable on the self-destructiveness of addiction or substance abuse. Instead, it's the focal point for a thought process. 'I don't want to over-intellectualise, but it's the fusion of two icons (skull and cocaine) that provokes thought and discussion on the nature of man. Specifically, about his creation of, and participation in, a society which echoes his own tendency to lose control. Concept: The artist describes his work as the fusion of two icons - a skull and cocaine . Off his head? Diddo hopes his work becomes a focal point for discussion on the nature of man . Diddo claims his artwork confronts the notion that man has created a society that's out of control . 'We have temporarily outgrown the intended uses for our animal instincts. This leaves us in an uncomfortable conundrum. Where can we safely store them until we need them again?' Diddo studied Media Design at the School of Arts Utrecht, NL and acquired a Masters Degree in European Media Design from the University of Portsmouth, UK in 2001.","The piece - called Ecce Animal - is the work of mysterious artist Diddo .

A suburban Chicago man has been charged with repeatedly burglarizing the home of his recently deceased neighbors. Kenneth Harry, 43, is accused of breaking into the home of Thomas and Jennifer Smith several times between Aug. 28 and Sept. 17. The couple, who lived just four doors down from Harry in Downers Grove, Illinois, died in July in an apparent murder-suicide.

They explore abandoned amusement parks, sewers and 'ghost' tube stations and make it their mission to publicise the hidden corners of their cities. These extraordinary pictures are the work of urban explorer Dr Bradley Garrett, who seeks out secret areas both above and below ground to photograph. He was part of team who made headlines . back in 2012 when he posted a series of snaps from the top of The Shard . skyscraper while it was still under construction. Garrett, now a researcher at the University of Oxford, took these shots during his time with the London Consolidation Crew (LCC), a loose collection of urban explorers based in the English capital. Don't look down: A team of urban explorers on top of a water tower on the roof of an estate in Pimlico in London, UK. Bradley Garrett said the movement is about 'democratising' city spaces . Urban explorers: A member stands on his head inside a vast underground tunnel during the excavation of a new line for the Paris Metro . Forgotten places: A man slides down a water slide at the abandoned Rock A Hoola Water Park in the Mojave Desert, California (left) and an incredible view of the Farwell Building in Detroit (right) Rarely seen: Bradley Garrett poses against a giant statue of a head on the roof of the Palais de Justice in Brussels, Belgium . 'Exploring these places is about democratising those spaces and making them available for more people and that's why we take the photos - to share it,' Garrett said. 'It's not a typical explorer thing, like ""hey, look at me, I made it to the top"". It's saying ""look, here's the view, this is what it looks like, this is what you can expect, we had this amazing experience"" and then people can live vicariously through that, even if they wouldn't do it themselves in real life.' Garrett grew up in California, driving his car into the Mojave desert as a 16-year to explore abandoned gold mining camps and Native American rock engravings. After moving to London, he decided to write his PhD on the access-all-areas subculture, now published by Verso as Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City, a collection of his writings and photographs on the scene. Hidden from sight: Bradley Garrett stands in front of the funnel of The Queen Mary in Los Angeles, U.S. He took the pictures while part of the London Consolidation Crew . Infamous: Garrett hit the headlines when he and his crew climbed London's Shard while it was still under construction (left) and another urban explorer scales a crane tower in Aldgate East over from a mothballed construction site . Grand view: Garrett and his team have explored new sights in the cities as well as more opulent buildings such as the roof of Cambridge University . Precarious: A man stands on a concrete ledge high above the ground at London's disused flour mill, Millennium Mills, and man one dangles upside down as he enters the Embankment Cable Run on the north bank of the River Thames . Urban exploration - known as urbex or UE . for short - is a term used to describe the creative exploration of the . built environment, which Garrett believes should be as natural as a . brisk walk in the countryside. 'If you move in the wilderness, it's totally expected that if you've got a big mountain next to your house, you're going to climb it. Everyone wants to see the view from the top of the mountain,' he said. 'If you live in Southwark, and they're building an 80-storey building, obviously you want to see the view from the top. 'The construction firms appear to make concessions, like putting the viewing platform in The Shard, but it ends up being only for people that have a large disposable income.' Garrett is also keen to dispel some of the myths that have grown up around the urban exploration community. 'A lot of people like to label this whole thing as us being deviant and smashing into places, but it's actually not about that at all, it's about appreciation for these places,' he said. 'It's totally benign. We go out, nothing gets damaged, nothing gets broken, we go in, we feed the adrenaline rush, and we go home.' Scenic: Dr Garrett said he wants to show people secret views of the world. This shot shows Las Vegas at night from the unfinished 68-storey, $2.9billion Fontainebleau Las Vegas hotel . Lost river: A man inside the tunnel carrying the River Tyburn - one of London's many 'lost rivers' and a tunnel carrying another lost river, the River Effra . Unique: Garrett, pictured looking over the streets of Paris from the roof of Saint-Sulpice church, said people should see the secret views even if they do not go there themselves . Freedom: The urban explorer said the movement was about appreciation for the spaces rather than the thrill of breaking in . While some of the group's larger . ventures such as an exploration of Burlington, an underground Cold War . city designed to house the UK government in the event of a nuclear . strike, required intricate planning, sometimes - as with The Shard - . they would just let the city surprise them. 'It's . often those spontaneous explorations that end up being the coolest, . when you're just walking through the city and someone says ""look, . there's scaffolding on that building"" and you climb it and you get . through a window and then all of a sudden you get on a staircase and . then you're on the roof and you've got this incredible view of London at . 2am in the morning. 'You sit up there with your friends and chill out and take in the view, and then you climb down and spot a night bus and you're home and in bed in an hour,' he said. 'And then you wake up in the morning and it feels like a dream, and then you stick the memory card of your camera in the computer and you go ""My God, that was real, that was amazing!"" and you've got these incredible photos to document this experience.' Garrett insists that all the urbexers he met during his PhD were united by two things: a passion for real-life adventure and a love of London. Incredible: Garrett stands hundreds of feet in the air on the edge of the Ritz-Carlton Chicago as lightning strikes in the distance . Hitting the headlines: Garrett and fellow urban explorers posted a series of pictures from the top of the Shard while it was still being built in 2012 (pictured) Exploring the old: A man holds up a tattered bible in the Woodward Avenue Presbyterian Church in Detroit, U.S. (left) Unseen: An urban explorer illuminates a Parisian sewer. Members of the group explore abandoned amusement parks, disused churches and forgotten tube stations . 'If you love the city enough and you've . seen loads of places, you get to a point where you're like 'yeah, but I . know these other places are here, I want to see those places too'.' Although trespass is generally not a criminal offence in the UK, setting foot on the railways is a different matter, and the explorers eventually fell foul of the law during their search for the disused 'ghost stations' of the London Underground. Garrett was marched off a plane by British Transport Police and his bail conditions currently prevent him from communicating with other members of the LCC. Nevertheless, he is adamant that in the long run the group will remain friends. 'You build very particular bonds with people when you risk your lives together and when you spend your nights jumping over fences and running from security guards, it's a very particular type of friendship,' Garrett said. 'That has meant more to me than anything. I've learnt a lot about the history of London, and I've learnt a lot about how different security measures are put together and implemented, but the thing I've really learnt the most about is about community, about what it means to have a real community of people that you care about. These people will be friends for the rest of my life.'","Urban explorer Dr Bradley Garrett part of team that climbed the Shard in London in 2012 when it was still being built .

Melissa Nicole Jones and Matthew Wilson Freethy-Swimm were asked to look after the child while his mother took his brother to hospital. According to the mother, known only as Nancy, her son said Freethy-Swimm held a knife to his throat while Jones had sex with him. Accused: It is alleged that Matthew Wilson Freethy-Swimm put a knife to the boy's throat before the child was raped . It is also claimed she bragged about 'taking the virginity of a minor later on. The alleged attack is believed to have happened in June when Nancy's nine-year-old son, who is also autistic, had to be taken to a doctor. Nancy had no family or friends available in the area to look after her other son so asked if her tenants could help. The couple had moved into an apartment created on the east side of Nancy's condo in Athens, Georgia. Nancy said: 'This was the one and only time I ever left my children alone with them. 'This was an emergency and there was no one else available I could turn to', according to the Athens Banner-Herald. The boy claims that Freethy-Swimm held a knife to his throat while Melissa Nicole Jones had sex with him . Three weeks after the alleged assault, the boy ran out of the house and confronted Freethy-Swimm. He shouted that he had been forced to have sex with 'his wife'. The child was in such a state his mother and her female partner had to pull him away from Freethy-Swimm. It is then claimed that Freethy-Swimm began threatening Nancy and her girlfriend.

It carried hippies through the Sixties before becoming a workhorse across the developing world. But the long journey of the VW camper van is finally coming to an end. Brazil is the last place in the world still producing the vehicle known by aficionados as the ‘bus’, but Volkswagen has said production will end there on December 31. More than 10million of them have been made since the model was introduced in Germany 63 years ago. In Brazil, 1.5 million have been produced since 1957. Last journey: Production of the iconic VW campervan, a restored model from 1984 pictured above, will stop in December this year because of new health and safety regulations . Change: Production of the van, a 1972 model pictured above, will stop in Brazil due to new regulations which state all vehicles produced in the country must have airbags and anti-lock braking systems . Icon: The van, a collection of some from across its 63 years in production above, has somewhat of a cult status with motoring fans . Work of art: Some owners customize their vans, such as Brazilian Marcelo Serpa who hand painted a colourful mural on his 2007 model . The vans were called  the Type 2, . because they were the second type to be offered by car maker Volkswagen, . the first being the Beetle. In Britain and the US during the 60s and 70s, partly because it was cheap, the Type 2 became linked with youth culture. Fans of the machine said its . mechanical failures only reinforced its charm and, because its engine . was so simple, it was easy to fix, imparting a deeper sense of . ownership. Die-hard British enthusiasts still gather every year for the annual VW Festival near Leeds. Fans include actor Martin Clunes  who . owns two campers – a rare black one with a bay windscreen, and a navy . and white split-screen model dating from 1977.  He said: ‘There’s . something so self-contained about a camper. Driving one is like putting . on a comfortable pair of old slippers.’ Formula 1 racing driver Jenson Button . has owned two – a red and white model from 1956 and a gold-coloured 1970 . Volkswagen Kombi. Flower power: The van cemented its status as an icon in the sixties, when it was used by hippies to travel around the country . Peace and love: The camper van became so popular with young people because it was cheap, practical and easy to fix . Beach: Due to their size and practicality, the vans are popular with surfers . The . original vans were called Type 2, following on from Volkswagen’s first . offering the Type 1, which is better known nowadays as the Beetle. VW has produced more than 10 million Volkswagen camper vans globally since the model was introduced 63 years ago in Germany. In . Brazil it’s known as the ‘Kombi’, an abbreviation for the German . ‘Kombinationsfahrzeug’ that loosely translates as ‘cargo-passenger van’. Production . in the UK stopped in 1967 but continued in South America, and Brazil is . the only country in the world still manufacturing Type 2 campervans. The van made an appearance on Bob Dylan and Beach Boys record album covers. Steve Jobs is said to have sold his van in the 1970s to buy a circuit board as he built a computer that helped launch Apple. The vehicle became a must-have on the California surf scene because its cavernous interior was perfect for carrying boards. Volkswagen means ‘people’s car’ in German and is currently the third largest carmaker in the world. The company was founded in 1937 in Germany to provide an affordable new car for the masses. One firm will fit an engine from a Porsche 911 to a van for £127,000 . Vans that cost around £850 in the 1960s can now fetch as much as £13,000 . Jamie Oliver was less impressed. In . 2005, he drove around Europe in a 1959 Samba version of the machine for . the Channel 4 television series Jamie’s Great Escape. He said: ‘To be honest, it was a . complete pain. It was towing a heavy trailer, so perhaps it’s not . surprising that it broke down several times.’ In poorer regions like Latin American . and Africa, the vehicle has continued to be made long after production . ended in the UK in 1967. In Brazil its uses are perhaps not as . romantic– it is used by the postal service to haul mail, by the army to . transport soldiers, and by funeral directors to carry corpses. Brazilians also convert their vans into rolling food carts, setting up on street corners for working-class lunchtime crowds. Nuptials: The vans are even sometimes used as wedding carriages, pictured above . Novel: Some VW owners use their vans for other uses - such as this pasta van in Brazil . Many uses: Jorge Hanashiro and his wife Ana sell meat and pastries from their green 1974 van . Fast food: People dine at the Nakombi restaurant in Sao Paulo, Brazil, which features a VW inspired sushi bar . Production in Germany was halted in 1979 because the van no longer met European safety requirements. Now safety regulations that come in to . force from next year mandating that every vehicle in Brazil must have . air bags and anti-lock braking systems will stop production there. A commemorative special series with a production run of only 600 units will be the last VW camper vans to be made. VW unveiled a new version of the camper van at the 2011 Geneva Motor show, but it never went into production. Damon Ristau, director of the . documentary film ‘The Bus’ about van fanatics, said: ‘The van represents . freedom. It has a magic and charm lacking in other vehicles.

Disgraced former Tyco executives Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz have left a minimum-security prison in New York for clerical jobs and overnights in apartments. Former CEO Mr Kozlowski and ex-chief financial officer Mr Swartz are among 304 inmates in the state's work-release program. They have each served over eight years in prison for one of the most prolific fraud schemes in US history. Mr Kozlowski and Mr Swartz oversaw garnered over $600million through unauthorized loans, bonuses and stock manipulation by treating the firm as a personal ATM. Free men: Former Tyco executives Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz have already left prison . After a period spending nights or weekends back at Lincoln Correctional Facility, they now only have to report in weekly. The two men still face a parole hearing. Defense attorneys say their clients should get paroled after completing the minimums of their 8 1/3-to-25-year sentences for corporate fraud and paying $134 million in restitution to Tyco and $105 million in fines. They were sentenced to 8 1/3-to-25-years in prison for 22 counts of grand larceny, conspiracy, falsifying records and violating business law. Lavishly appointed: A room in Dennis Kozlowski's Manhattan apartment is seen in a video tape shown to jurors during his 2003 fraud trial . It cost how much?: The infamous $6,000 gold shower curtain as seen in a frame grab from a video shown in court during the Tyco trial . Oh my god: Mr Kozlowski bought a large figural carved dog umbrella stand similar to this one with $16,000 of Tyco money . Kozlowski and Swartz were found guilty of giving themselves as much as $150 million in illegal bonuses and forgiving tens of millions of dollars in loans to themselves. There were also found guilty manipulating the price of the security systems company's stock by lying about the state of its finances. Some estimates peg ill-gotten stock gains by Mr Kozlowski at almost $500million. The release programs are for inmates considered nonviolent, with each individual and job approved by a corrections department committee. The panel has authority to reject any work in which the inmate has an opportunity to repeat past crimes. 'Technically you're still an inmate,' Correction spokeswoman Linda Foglia said. 'You're following a strict contract.' Excessive: The ex-Tyco CEO also spent thousands of dollars in Tyco money on a gilt metal wastebasket similar to this one . Sound sleeper: The greedy exec also spent almost $6,000 on two sheet sets similar to this one . Mr Swartz, 53, is a law office assistant . and Mr Kozlowski, 66, is a clerk at a technology company. Their lawyers . and state officials won't say where the men are working or living. The details of their prolific fraud paled in comparison to the outrageous purchases and expenses Mr Kozlowski accrued while at the Tyco helm. The greedy chief exec demanded Tyco pay for his New York apartment - which the firm bought for $17million and spent another $11million decorating, officials said. Firm funds were also used for multiple vacation homes, including a sprawling Nantucket, MA., beachfront estate, said officials. The firm was based in Boca Raton, FL after moving from New Hampshire not long before Mr Kozlowski acquired the apartment. Senior executives also used the move as an excuse to raid company coffers for multiple homes across the Sunshine State and millions of dollars in art purchases, officials said. Aficionado: This is a copy of a photo of ""Still Life with three vases of flowers"" by Osias Beert the Elder, one of several paintings bought by Mr Kozlowski . Art buff: This is a copy of a photo of ""Pres Monte-Carlo ( Le Cap Martin: La Pointe)"" by Claude Monet, one of several paintings bought by Mr Kozlowski . Tyco infamously bought Mr Kozlowski a $6,000 gold-threaded shower curtain, a $15,000 dog-shaped umbrella stand, a $2,200 wastebasket, coat hangers costing almost $3,000, $6,000 sheets, a $1,600 notebook and a $45 pincushion, according to regulators. The firm also footed half the bill for a $2million 40th birthday party Mr Kozlowski threw for his wife in Sardinia. The week-long Roman-themed toga bash included an ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David with vodka flowing from its penis, a Jimmy Buffet performance and a breast-shaped birthday cake with sparklers. 'It's going to be a fun week, sailing on the Endeavor, tennis, golf, eating, drinking. All the things we are best known for,' Mr Kozlowski said on footage from the beginning of the hedonistic party shown to jurors. 'The Tyco Roman Orgy': Mr Kozlowski stands between toga-clad women during a $2million party in Sardinia thrown for his wife, but Tyco paid half the cost . Happy birthday!: Karen Kozlowski, second from left, the now ex-wife of the former Tyco CEO, stands with a guest between two men in Roman centurion costumes . Pristine: A picture of Porto di Torre Canai beach, in Sardinia, Italy - where Mr Kozlowski threw his wife a $2million 40th birthday party using Tyco funds . Though a 20-minute tape of the party was shown to jurors, many scenes were deemed to racy to show - likely why the party became known as the 'Tyco Roman Orgy.' Spreading the grift, Mr Kozlowski ordered a $20million payment to a friend of his as a 'consulting fee,' said investigators. Mr Kozlowski additionally donated millions of Tyco dollars to charities in his name, reaping the tax benefits, authorities claimed. Adding insult to injury, his wife divorced him shortly after he went to prison and soon married a property developer, according to reports at the time. The excess to which Mr Kozlowski led his life likely contributed to an April 2012 parole hearing being denied, with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office saying it would 'undermine' the rule of law.","Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz were found guilty of defrauding Tyco of hundreds of millions of dollars .

Called Video on Instagram, the service adds a video icon to the existing . Instagram app and users can record 15-second video clips and edit them . together for longer videos.

Facebook has officially revealed a new video sharing service. Called Video on Instagram, it will pit the firm against Twitter's hugely popular Vine service by letting users record 15-second video clips . The Video on Instagram service is available on iOS and Android. It lets users record 15-second clips, add 13 filters and comes with a stablisation tool called Cinema that fixes shaky camerawork . Users record 15-second clips using Instagram’s existing app. Clips can be added together for longer videos. They can choose one of 13 video filters. Jerky video can be automatically stabilised. Users can choose a cover picture. Video appears on Facebook profiles and in feeds in the same way pictures do. There are also 13 new filters to give the videos the same retro feel as Instagram's pictures. ‘We need to do to video what we did to photographs,’ said Kevin Systrom, the head of Instagram. ‘It’s the same Instagram we know and love, but it moves,’ said Systrom. ‘130 million people will be using this from today - that’s really powerful. ‘I’m really excited about this, and I think the world will be.’ ‘It’s a tool to remember, and about capturing moments; a way to stay connected.’ Before the announcement Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said: ‘We want to talk about something a . little different. ‘People want to share a lot of different types of content. ‘Today, we’re going to focus on Instagram. In the last year we’ve tripled the team, and the community . has more than 100million members. But we’re really just getting started here.’ The app is available on the iPhone and Android devices. The app can also automatically improve video to remove jitters, using a feature called Cinema - although it is only be available for the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5. This stabilisation feature is turned on by default but users can turn it off by pressing the Cinema icon. Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram last year. It has now added a video icon, left, to the existing app. The service pits Facebook and Instagram against Twitter's hugely popular Vine app, right. When users share an Instagram video on Facebook it will be visible and play within the same window . 16 billion photos shared. 1 billion likes every day. 130 million people use Instagram every month. Commenting on the announcement, Eden . Zoller, a consumer analyst at Ovum said: 'Given the popularity of . Twitter’s Vine service, it is perhaps more surprising that Facebook has . not introduced video for Instagram sooner. ‘But new features aside, Facebook . still needs to come up with a strategy for how to monetize Instagram . which so far it has failed to do.' Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 after an alleged bidding war with Twitter. Freelance journalist Matthew Keys broke the Instagram video story at the end of May. He claimed a source familiar with . the plans had told him Facebook was testing the feature, but didn't . want to give their name because they were not permitted to speak . publicly about the news. Facebook announced earlier this month it was . adding clickable hashtags to the site which make it easier for users to . follow discussions about certain topics. Clickable hashtags are already used widely on Instagram as well as Twitter and Vine. A video produced by Instagram to show off the new service and its features showed users recording clips of various objects and scenarios, including a dog in a hat smoking a pipe, left, and a cat chasing wool, right . Twitter bought Vine in October last year. The app initially launched on iOS devices before being made available for Android phones earlier this month. Vine has previously been used to record surgical operations and at the start of June a 16-year-old claimed he had managed to crash the app by uploading a Rick Astley music video. The video bypassed the app's six-second limit which is thought to have caused the servers to temporarily crash.","Video on Instagram lets users record 15-second clips, add filters and edit them together for longer videos .

Hundreds of demonstrators turned out in a tiny North Dakota town to protest against plans by an American Nazi group to move in and take over the local government. The loud but peaceful demonstrators, many of them Native Americans from nearby reservations, made their disgust clear as Jeff Schoep, commander of the National Socialist Movement, and several followers, visited. The National Socialist Movement is America's largest neo-Nazi organization, founded in 1974 by former members of the American Nazi Party, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Jay Schechter holds a sign while participating in a protest rally outside Craig Cobb's house in Leith . Craig Cobb address supporters inside the Leith Town Hall. Cobb a white supremacist, originally from Canada, has purchased many lots in the tiny town . The group hopes to move enough members into Leith - population 17 - to take over the local government. 'We have to start somewhere,' Schoep said. 'They gotta do something very, very drastic to me to make it unsafe and uncomfortable for me' Bobby Harper, Leith's only black resident . 'So if we start in small towns and spread out from there, it's sort of a test ground in that sense, where if we're able to get off the ground here, then we're able to get off the ground in other places.' But Leith's only black resident is defiant and say's he's staying put. Leaders from across the state joined forces in an effort to show the hate groups that they aren't welcome. 'We are deeply disturbed that one of the residents of our small community has invited hate groups to our town and to the state of North Dakota. 'One of these hate groups, the National Socialist Movement, is planning to hold a meeting in our city hall on Sunday afternoon, and raise neo Nazi flags on property around our town,' the town of Leith said in a statement before the planned visit. 'The values of our town include safety . and acceptance for everyone. We stand firmly against the bigoted views . of this group, and will not be participating in their events.' Defiant: Bobby Harper, the only black resident of Leith, North Dakota, says he isn't leaving - even though white supremacists are moving into his tiny town. He is pictured here with his wife, Sherrill . Supremacist's paradise: Craig Cobb, 61, has invited dozens of neo-Nazi leaders to Leith to start to haven for racist hate groups . Craig Cobb, a self-described white supremacist, had already bought several homes and properties in Leith when he moved to the town 75 miles southwest of Bismark last year. He had bought at least a dozen properties and given several of them to leaders of major neo-Nazi hate groups. Often, he paid just hundreds or a few thousand dollars absentee owners who had long ago fled Leith and left their properties in disrepair. He has grand visions for the town and is determined to revitalize it. He told National Public Radio: 'It would be extraordinarily beautiful when people enter the town, particularly at night because we will have floodlit flags from both the bottom and the top of all the formerly white nations of the earth. 'We will probably have the National Socialist hunting flag with stag horns and a very small swastika in the center, very discreet.' Ramshackle: Leith has just 24 residents. It has been in a slow decline for decades. Cobb bought most of the properties for just hundreds or a few thousand dollars . He plans parks and monuments and a municipal swimming pool, all named after white-power activists. But the Cobb and his white supremacist ilk have one immediate obstacle to their all-white paradise in Leith: Bobby Harper, the town's only black resident. 'I'm not leaving,' Harper told NPR. 'They gotta do something very, very drastic to me to make it unsafe and uncomfortable for me. Right now, I don't see it happening.' The U.S. National Socialist Movement, America's largest white  supremacist group, is joining forces with Cobb and is calling its members to Leith for a meeting on Sunday and Monday. 'We have every intention of legally assuming control of the local government,' Socialist Movement leader Jeff Schoep said in a statement. Video source KXNET.COM . Cobb moved to Leith from Montana and has purchased about a dozen homes and vacant parcels of land . According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Cobb wants to set up a 'Pioneer Little Europe.' In . an interview with WXMB-TV in Bismarck, Cobb said he had gotten a lot of . offers to buy up land from what he termed like-minded people who . believe white people should not be punished for wanting to live near . each other. 'It's fine for all these other minorities, but not us,' he said in the televised interview. 'If you merely speak about it, you're going to be defamed in this country.' Schoep said that the visitors would inspect the new property, raise ceremonial flag poles, and hold a town meeting and a news conference. 'We know that opinion is divided in the town and in the media,' Schoep said in the statement, adding that the trip was 'a symbolic gesture of good will and faith.' Sheriff Bay had his officers, members of the North Dakota Highway Patrol and others come to Leith yesterday to help in crowd control.","U.S. National Socialist Movement, the largest neo-Nazi group in America, is planning Sunday rally in Leith, North Dakota .

Jeff Knight could be accused of straying from home - but things are actually going great with his girlfriend. Knight, the director of connected clients and a 'founding engineer' of Facebook dating service Zoosk, met Google employee Sara Pelosi on rival site OKCupid. As their romance blossomed she detailed their courtship on her blog. Social-network-crossed lovers: Jeff Knight, an executive of dating site Zoosk, started dating his current girlfriend Sara Pelosi, pictured above, after meeting her on competition site OkCupid . Before going steady with Knight, Pelosi wrote a blog about online dating called 'Looking for Love in Online Places'. She ended the blog earlier this month with a post about making it 'Facebook official' with Knight. In the post she recounts how the two met on OKCupid, even though Knight works for Zoosk. When they were first corresponding on OKCupid, she asked him which social network he worked at. When Jeff met Sara: Knight was upfront with Pelosi about where he worked, and assured her he was not using the site to do research on the competition . 'That's actually a very funny story' he wrote before admitting he worked for another dating site. 'He was completely upfront about it so I asked if he was doing research or actually supporting a competitor,' Pelosi said. 'To this he replied, he was actually using OKCupid for its intended purpose.' She says she was skeptical about the story, but agreed to a date anyway figuring she could get a blog post out of it. Meta-dating: Pelosi wrote about how she started dating the Zoosk exec through OKCupid on her blog about online dating . The following eight dates were a success and now the two are officially dating. Zoosk has since issued a statement about their employee policy. Apparently Knight is one of the few employees not allowed to use the site because he has access to user data. This policy was enacted to protect members. According to Gawker's Valleywag blog, the company has raised millions in  venture capitol but still hasn't risen to the 'heights' of OKCupid, Match or eHarmony.

The pair have just been allowed to meet their public - and are bound to be huge hit. Awww-together now: The fluffy brothers were born last month at a zoo in Tasmania . Name of the game: The zoo is letting the public decide what monikers should be given to the pair . Cute alert: The cubs have been relishing all the attention and are a huge hit with zoo staff . Park officials will have to use 'here, kitty' to summon the fluffy brothers because they haven't yet been named. And the job of deciding on their monikers is being left to the public. Zoodoo owner Trevor Cuttriss told the Herald Sun: 'We are so excited here, especially to get . two, because there are less than 300 white lions in the world and the . species is extinct in the wild. Logging their interest: The cubs just love exploring together . Who's the mane man? Every day is play day for the lions . Rare breed: The cubs are two of only about 300 white lions in existence . 'We will have them here for about 12 . months before they will move overseas. So the public are invited in to . play and interact with the cubs while they are here.' Unsurprisingly, the zoo's staff have fallen in love with the animals, who are both relishing all the attention. Mr Cuttriss added: 'They can get a bit feisty, especially when you are cleaning milk off their faces. And they are really starting to love their cat-and-mouse games.' White lion numbers have declined by 80 per cent in the past 20 years, according to the Global White Lion Trust. The charity explains that white lions are not albinos, but a 'genetic rarity unique to one endemic region on the globe - the Timbavati region in South Africa'. The earliest recorded sighting of a white lion, the organisation says, was in 1938.","The pair were born last month at Zoodoo Wildlife Park in Tasmania .

Grand Theft Auto V has crossed the $1 billion sales mark after three days in stores, a rate faster than any other video game, film or other entertainment product has ever managed, its creator Take Two Interactive Inc said on Friday. The latest installment of GTA, a cultural phenomenon that has sparked a national debate on adult content and violence, received strong reviews and racked up $800 million in first-day sales alone. That marked a launch-day record for the Grand Theft Auto franchise which is Take Two's most lucrative and allows players to cruise around a make-believe gameworld based on real-life locations such as Los Angeles. Scroll down for video . Race to the store: There have been record sales of Grand Theft Auto V, seen on sale here at a Game Stop store in Encinitas, California . Take-Two shares were little changed at $17.48 in early afternoon-trading on the Nasdaq. Gamers had eagerly awaited the fifth installment of the 16-year-old game after Grand Theft Auto IV was released in 2008. It took more than five years to be developed by Take-Two's Rockstar Games studio at a cost of between $200 million and $250 million, according to some analysts' estimates. Last year, it took Activision Blizzard Inc's first-person shooter title Call Of Duty: Black Ops II 15 days to hit $1 billion in global sales after its November release. That game took in sales of $500 million on its first day. While GTA V is off to a flying start, industry analysts are keeping a close eye on Take-Two's ability to sustain sales momentum. Grand Theft Auto V is currently only available on Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 consoles, owned by over 160 million gamers. Take-Two is yet to announce a version for the much-awaited next-generation Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles, which will go on sale in November.

This promotional video, 'Dodge Brothers' Wild Ride',  from the car manufacturer, Dodge, shows what rural driving was like back in the 1920s. In short – not very comfortable. The featured car, named the ‘Oilfield Dodge’, drives through roads swimming in deep mud and pools of water. The ride looks bumpy, but surprisingly the sedan does not get stuck. It makes sense why most vehicles in those days were made with SUV features. The car drives carefree over rocky . and mountainous terrain and when it flips over on its side, it takes . nothing more than a few people to roll it back over and, 'vroom', off it . goes. The video ends when . the car reaches an oilfield where a group of drillers have struck an oil . deposit, sending black gold shooting through the air next to the parked . Oilfield Dodge.

Disney has created a ‘magical’ device that allows you to do just that using a simple microphone and the human body. The Ishin-Den-Shin technology, which roughly translates into telepathy in Japanese, turns the body into a human speaker allowing anyone to transmit messages through their fingertips. Scroll down for video... The Ishin-Den-Shin technology, which means telepathy in Japanese, turns the body into a human speaker allowing anyone to transmit messages through their fingertips . When a person whisper’s into the Ishin-Den-Shin microphone, sound energy is converted into electrical energy creating an electrostatic field around the whisper’s body. The whisper can then touch another individual on their earlobe and the electrostatic field will send vibrations through the ear. This causes the person touched, but no one else, to hear the message that was whispered. Ivan Poupyrev, one of the inventors . of the system, explained that the inaudible signal can be transmitted . from body to body, using any type of physical contact. When a person whisper's into the Ishin-Den-Shin microphone, sound energy is converted into electrical energy creating an electrostatic field around the whisper's body. The whisper can then touch another person on their earlobe and the electrostatic field will send vibrations through the ear . ‘The Ishin-Den-Shin system includes a handheld microphone connected to a computer’s sound card.’ He said. ‘When someone speaks into the microphone, the computer turns the sound into a looped recording. ‘The recording is then converted into high-voltage, low-current inaudible signal that flows into a thin wire connected to the exterior of the microphone. ‘This looped, inaudible signal creates a modulated electrostatic field around the body of the person who is holding the microphone and can be transmitted from person to person via any sort of physical contact.’ The inaudible signal creates a modulated electrostatic field around the body of the person who is holding the microphone and can be transmitted from person to person . Ivan Poupyrev, one of the inventors of the system, explained that the inaudible signal can be transmitted using any type of physical contact . Bone conduction technology, which transmits sound through the inner ear, isn't new. Special forces and police departments often use the technology, which allows headphones to operate without 'leaking' sound. It has, however, recently moved into the mainstream with its use in commercial headphones such 'Aftershoks' as well as its use in Google's Glass. It's latest use in the Ishin-Den-Shin system received an honorary mention at this . week's Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria.

The output is connected to the casing of the microphone via an almost . invisible wire wrapped around the audio cable. When holding . the microphone, the whisperer comes in contact with the inaudible, high . voltage, low power version of the recorded sound. This creates a . modulated electrostatic filed around the visitors’ skin. When touching . another person’s ear, this modulated electrostatic field creates a very . small vibration of the ear lobe. As a result, both the finger and the . ear together form a speaker, that makes the signal audible for the . person touched.","'Ishin-Den-Shin' technology converts sound energy into electrical energy .

When Derek Burt’s alarm went off one chilly morning this February, it wasn’t just to rouse him for work. The impeccably timed alarm also saved his partner Angela’s life. She was having a heart attack and were it not for a TV advert he’d seen a few weeks previously, she wouldn’t be alive today. Mr Burt had seen ad starring Vinnie Jones, telling members of the . public how best to resuscitate a cardiac arrest victim. Produced by the British Heart Foundation (BHF), it recommends people hum Stayin’ Alive and pump the patient’s chest to the . beat – around 100 to 120 times a minute. The clip shows Jones, reprising his . Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels gangster persona, demonstrating the . technique on a ‘geezer’ who has collapsed in an empty warehouse, while . the Bee Gees’ 1970s hit plays in the background. The online training film since clocked up 2.4 million views and the charity has been flooded with . amazing stories of survival. Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical . Director at the British Heart Foundation said: ‘The great thing about . Hands-only CPR is you don’t need any special skills or to remember how . to do the kiss of life. 'It’s simple, you can’t do any harm and you may . well save a life.  We know of at least 28 people who are alive today . simply because the person standing next to them when they collapsed did . what Vinnie told them to do in our advert.' The . new guidelines were unveiled at the beginning of the year after experts . found that giving mouth-to-mouth is often ineffective if performed by . an untrained member of the public. It also gets in the way of the . crucial chest compressions need to keep the victim’s heart beating. And according to the charity, the . sheer thought of having to blow into someone’s mouth puts many of us off . from even attempting resuscitation. Scroll down for video . In the British Heart Foundation ad, Vinnie Jones shows how chest compressions should be performed on someone who has stopped breathing . Mr Burt (second on the left) is one of many people (pictured) who have saved a life after seeing the ad . Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), . as it is officially known, is given to patients who have suffered a . cardiac arrest – when their heart stops pumping blood around the body. The new guidelines state that people . should ignore the breaths and give constant chest compressions 5-6cm . deep (2 inches), just between the nipples, at the rate of 100 to 120 a . minute. The breaths of air, or rescue breaths, are meant to fill the patients’ lungs with oxygen – so you effectively breathe for them. The BHF says that patients should have . enough oxygen into their body to survive until help arrives so it is . more essential that helpers concentrate on the compressions to pump . blood round the body. Official figures show that survival . rates for cardiac arrests are very low. Some 30,000 people suffer from . one outside hospital every year and only 10 per cent will recover and be . discharged from hospital. Mrs Burt, 43, had no history of heart problems before the episode in February. And Mr Burt, 49, a joiner, had no idea anything was wrong until he woke and heard her making a strange coughing sound. He told MailOnline: ‘I thought something didn’t sound right so I put the light on. I could see . her eyes were open, her mouth was open but she wasn’t breathing. I got . her off the bed and onto the floor and the first thing I thought of was . the Vinnie Jones ad.’ Mr Burt had seen the advert starring . Vinnie Jones on the TV a few weeks earlier. ‘I remember it being a good . ad and I only watched it and paid attention because it had him in it. Had it been a doctor in a white coat I wouldn’t have paid so much . attention. I certainly never dreamt I’d have to use it a few months . later.' He added: 'What was miraculous – but also . terrifying – was the timing. If she hadn’t coughed at the time my alarm . went off I might never have spotted she was in trouble. 'Normally we . don’t speak in the morning because I get up so early and she’s still . sleeping. If I hadn’t spotted her, then the kids would have found her . when it was too late. The timing was sheer luck.' Mr Jones explains how members of the public should call 999 before checking if the collapsed person in breathing. Then chest compressions should be performed to the beat of Stayin Alive . He got Angela on to the floor and . started chest compressions. ‘I kept doing CPR for five minutes and . phoned for an ambulance. They told me to carry on while they were on . their way. Slowly I could see the colour returning to Angela’s cheeks, . so I knew it must be doing something right.' Angela arrested again after paramedics . arrived and was taken to hospital where she was diagnosed with an . irregular heartbeat and received an implantable pacemaker and . defibrillator. When she was discharged from hospital . two weeks later, on Valentine’s day, Mr Burt proposed.  He said: ‘After . everything that had happened, it seemed like the right thing to do.’ The couple, who live in Edinburgh, married last month. He added:  ‘Angela still can’t believe . it. She went to bed feeling fine and woke up in hospital. She obviously . doesn’t remember anything about what happened that day.' Mrs Burt, who works as a carer, said . the couple had thought about playing the Bee Gees song at their wedding, . but had decided against it. She said: ‘I just feel so incredibly lucky that Derek saw the ad.’ The BHF says if survival rates from cardiac arrest are to improve then more bystanders need to help by doing CPR. The charity is now bringing back the . popular Vinnie Jones advert and releasing a new training film, starring . Mini Vinnie (see below), to help promote hands-only CPR among the next generation of . life-savers. Vinnie Jones added: ‘Dozens of Brits . are alive today because of hands-only CPR – and that’s only the people . we know about. But still not enough of us survive a cardiac arrest and . it’s seriously important that everyone knows hard and fast chest . compressions to the beat of the Stayin’ Alive by the Bee Gees can be the . difference between life and death. 'Whatever you do, tell your family and mates about Hands-only CPR. It could turn out to be a life-saving decision.'","Derek Burt had seen the ad just weeks before his wife Angela, 43, had a heart attack .

"But Cory's mother Ann says her son deserves his memorial tribute . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:47 EST, 22 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:47 EST, 22 September 2013 . The son of Quincy star Jack Klugman is livid that his late father is not receiving a tribute at Sunday's Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. And Adam Klugman feels it's an unfair and odd decision to pay tribute to tragic Glee star Cory Monteith while omitting his Emmy winning father, who died last December aged 90, and other TV icons who passed away this year, like Dallas legend Larry Hagman. 'I think it's criminal,' The Hollywood Reporter quoted Adam Klugman about his father's omission from the memorial tributes. Fallen stars: The Emmy Awards will remember late Glee star Cory Monteith, shown in 2012, but The Odd Couple star and three time Emmy winner Jack Klugman, shown in 2008, did not make the five-person memorial list . His father - who took home three gongs . at the TV Oscars also starred in The Odd Couple, and was hugely beloved . for his canon of work. Tragedy: Adam Klugman doesn't mean to disparage the late Glee star . Adam said: 'My dad was at the inception of television and helped build it in the early days.' He . added: 'It's an insult and it really seems typical of this . youth-centric culture that has an extremely short attention span and . panders to only a very narrow demographic of young adults."" The . Emmy Awards honouring the small screen's finest on Sunday will feature . tributes to five television stars who died in the past year, including one for Cory Monteith of Glee, who overdosed in July. Adam said: 'What about the people who should be introduced to somebody like my father?' 'I don't mean to say anything disparaging about Cory, but he was a kid who had won no Emmys and it was a self-induced tragedy.' Cory's mother Ann defended her son's inclusion to TMZ, she said: 'If he had lived 30 more years he would have accomplished much more.' The . show will also pay tribute to Sopranos star James Gandolfini, All In . The Family matriarch Jean Stapleton, comedy legend Jonathan Winters and . producer Gary David Goldberg who created Family Ties. The awards show's tribute segment will not include iconic television actors such as I Dream of Jeannie and Dallas star Larry Hagman and Jack Klugman, star of The Odd Couple and Quincy, M.E. Emmy Awards show executive producer Ken Ehrlich told the New York Daily News in an article on Wednesday that grumbling was to be expected. 'No matter what we do, there will be people who feel we had other options and could have done other things,' Ehrlich said. Top of the game: Jack starred in The Odd Couple and Quincy, he passed away last December aged 90 . Shock: Many are displeased that Larry Hagman isn't included, especially given his triumphant return in the rebooted Dallas . Made the list: Jean Stapleton, shown bottorm right in 1983 with the cast of All In The Family, will be among those remembered at the Emmy Awards . The decision to honour Monteith, who died in July at age 31 of an alcohol and heroin overdose, has drawn the most second-guessing. 'It was a rather personal choice. Corey’s appeal was to maybe a little different generation than some of the others we were honouring,' he said. The ultimate decision rested with the show's producers and was a judgement call. 'In all candour, this became a producer’s option, and we selected these five individuals knowing that there were certainly others that could have been treated this way,' Ehrlich added. Comedy legend: Jonathan Winters, shown in 2005 in Los Angeles, will be honoured by Robin Williams . Meanwhile, Emmy winning actor Peter MacNicol has defended the award show's choice in honouring Monteith . The . television veteran, who won his gong for his part in Ally McBeal, . believes that the tribute could help dissuade youngsters from abusing . drugs. 'If we are going to get into a merit system based on longevity then we are in trouble.' he told TMZ. Adding: 'The memoriam is not only to honour those who completed a full marathon.' 'Could save lives': Emmy winner Peter MacNicol says that honouring the deceased Glee star could dissuade youth from abusing drugs, pictured in West Hollywood in 2009 . But fellow Glee star Jane Lynch was a bit more fair and balanced in her estimation of the situation. The actress told TMZ: 'Obviously I'm a big fan of Jack Klugman. I don't choose these things. 'He was there in the beginning of television and he had a terrific career. And if I were his son, maybe I'd be upset too.' Adding . of her scheduled appearance on the Emmy's to honour Monteith: 'I'm . really proud to be up there tonight and proud to tell people about him.' Sympathetic: Fellow Glee star Jane Lynch says she can empathise with Adam Klugman, pictured in Los Angeles earlier this month . Close friends of the late actors will remember them during the tribute segment. Edie Falco will talk about Gandolfini who played her mobster husband on The Sopranos and Jane Lynch will pay tribute to her Glee co-star Monteith. Rob Reiner will honour Stapleton, who played his mother-in-law Edith Bunker on All In The Family, while Mork and Mindy star Robin Williams will pay homage to his mentor Winters.

Georgie Brown's two-year-old son, three-year-old daughter, pictured, and five-year-old son were watching a Lilo and Stitch cartoon at home when it cut to an adult movie . She went to the kitchen leaving her two-year-old son, three-year-old daughter and five-year-old son in the lounge to watch the PG -rated movie. A minute into the popular science fiction animation, however, she heard inappropriate noises coming from the lounge and when she returned she saw a man and a woman having sex on the screen. She told Fox News: 'I just heard things that probably shouldn't be on Lilo or Stitch. My first thought was the children have changed the channel.' When she rewound the film and played it back again she saw the cartoon begin to pixilate before an information box appeared which said 'part of the recorded event had been lost due to signal loss'. The final scenes from a pornographic movie then popped up on the screen and it played for nearly six minutes before the closing credits rolled.

Parents would be offered 25 hours a week of free childcare under Labour plans to cut bills for families. Up to 400,000 families would be £1,500 a year better off under the scheme when it is roled out by 2020. But shadow chancellor Ed Balls faced criticism for planning to fund the policy with another raid on banks, having already earmarked the bank levy for 11 other policies. Scroll down for video... Moooo: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls holds a plastic cow and pulls a face as he plays with three year old Connor Felton as shadow treasury secretary Rachel Reeves looks on at the Roundabout Children's Centre in Brighton . Labour has repeatedly pledged to raise more money through the bank levy to fund other policies, including a Youth Jobs Guarantee, reversing the VAT increase, more capital spending and reversing cuts to tax credits and child benefits. It has also been promised for more Regional Growth Fund funding, cutting the deficit, turning empty shops into community centres, spending on public services, more housing and now childcare. But Mr Balls used his speech to the Labour conference to argue that bankers can also pay more to cut childcare costs. Parents of three and four year olds already receive 15 hours a week free childcare, paid for by the taxpayer. Pledge: Mr Balls will promise to increase free childcare from from 15 to 25 hours a week . The coalition has also introduced the help for the poorest families of two-year-olds. Mr Balls suggested a Labour government will go further and increase the help for three and four year olds to 25 hours. He told the conference: . ‘Childcare is a vital part of our economic infrastructure that, . alongside family support and flexible working, should give parents the . choice to stay at home with their children when they are very small and . to balance work and family as they grow older. ‘But . for many families high childcare costs mean that it doesn't even add up . to go to work. So to make work pay for families, we must act. ‘Conference, after the financial crisis, it is right that the banks make a greater contribution. But in the last financial year, the banks paid a staggering £2.7 billion less in overall tax than they did in 2010. Over the last two years the Government's bank levy has raised £1.6 billion less than they said it would. ‘At a time when resources are tight and families are under pressure that cannot be right. So I can announce today the next Labour government will increase the bank levy rate to raise an extra £800 million a year. ‘And we will use the money, for families where all parents are in work, to increase free childcare places for three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 25 hours a week.' Buffers: Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls also signalled that he thought the £50billion earmarked for HS2 could be better spent elsewhere . The ambitious High Speed rail link . between London and the north was dramatically derailed today, as Ed . Balls declared there could be better ways to spend £50billion. The shadow chancellor appeared to withdraw Labour’s full-throated support for the project which it backed at the 2010 election. Mr . Balls said there would be ‘no blank cheque’ for the scheme as he . signalled that other big money projects should jump the queue for . funding. Mr Balls backed more long-term investment . in infrastructure but added: ‘We must also set the right priorities and . get value for money.’ He added:‘David . Cameron and George Osborne have made clear they will go full steam . ahead with this project – no matter how much the costs spiral up and up. They seem willing to put their own pride and vanity above best value . for money for the taxpayer. ‘Labour will not take this . irresponsible approach. So let me be clear, in tough times – when there . is less money around and a big deficit to get down – there will be no . blank cheque from me as a Labour Chancellor for this project or for any . project. ‘Because the . question is - not just whether a new High Speed line is a good idea or a . bad idea, but whether it is the best way to spend £50 billion for the . future of our country.’ HS2 will run from London Euston to Birmingham from 2026, and then form two routes to Manchester and Leeds by 2032. He went on: ‘For the first time, parents will be . able to work part-time without having to worry about the cost of . childcare. 'Making work pay, tackling the cost-of-living crisis, a . radical transformation in the provision of childcare in our country.’ Mr Balls told activists the party must . show how its policies are costed and funded, saying the ‘British people . rightly want to know that the sums add up’. Labour has already announced plans for primary schools to guarantee t offer childcare from 8am to 6pm, to help working parents. Mr . Balls made the announcement in a speech to activists where he will also . attempt to underline the party's ‘iron discipline’ on spending in the . run-up to the 2015 general election. He . today dismissed as ‘nonsense’ Conservative claims of a £27.9 billion . ‘black hole’ in Labour's tax-and-spend plans, telling ITV1's Daybreak: . ‘There are no uncosted spending commitments. There will be no more day-to-day borrowing from Labour in 2015.’ However, a political row erupted over Labour demands for the independent spending watchdog to audit their manifesto. Mr Balls wants the Office for Budget Responsibility to be allowed to check Labour's tax-and-spend promises ahead of the 2015 election to prove their sums add up. 'Mr Balls told Daybreak: 'We think this is something we . can get cross-party support for, to say that the Government and the . opposition should have that independent scrutiny and audit, so when we . say in our manifesto this is our tax promise or our spending commitment, . we can show the sums add up, but also the independent OBR can say they . have certified and scrutinised that. 'It's about rebuilding trust . in politics. There is cross-party support for the OBR and I want this . to be for governments and oppositions. I am confident that when the . Government thinks about this they will give us that cross-party . support.' But Conservative Treasury minister Sajid Javid said: 'Ed . Balls knows this is not allowed under the Budget Responsibilty Act and . the OBR's charter. 'So this is just a stunt to try and distract attention . from the fact that Labour have been found out for making unfunded . commitments that would just mean more borrowing and more debt.'","Labour to promise to increase state-funded care from 15 hours .

Jessica Leng, four, developed a pea-sized lump on the left side of her face shortly after she was born. The mass continued to grow steadily over the next three months until it was almost the same size as her head - prompting her worried parents to fear she had a deadly tumour. Jessica Leng (pictured at her christening) was born with a small lump on her face. It grew rapidly and by the time she was three-months-old, it was the size of a grapefruit . But, following an MRI scan, doctors discovered that the swelling was actually a parotid haemangioma, a large collection of blood vessels which had built up under Jessica’s skin. Her mother, Donna Payne, agreed to allow her daughter to take part in a medical trial in which she was prescribed propranolol, a type of beta blocker which is usually used to treat high blood pressure and heart conditions in adults. Incredibly, Jessica’s birthmark has all but disappeared, leaving just a tiny bit of excess skin around her ear. Miss Payne, 35, said: ‘Propranolol really is a wonder drug. ‘It isn’t usually used to treat birthmarks, but Jessica was part of a trial and it has been a huge success. ‘To look at her, you’d never guess she’d once had a huge lump on the side of her face. Jessica's mother, Donna Payne, 35, initially feared that the growth was a tumour. She also worried that Jessica would be bullied at school and that the growth might be causing her pain . Jessica was treated with propranolol, a beta blocker that is usually used to treat anxiety, high blood pressure and heart disease in adults. After two years of treatment, the growth has completely disappeared . ‘I worried she’d be bullied at school but now you can hardly tell there was ever anything wrong.’ Miss Payne, a nurse from Scarborough, Yorkshire, first noticed a small lump on Jessica’s face when her little girl was just two-weeks-old. Concerned, she consulted her midwife, who reassured her it was a benign birthmark and was nothing to worry about. But soon the lump had swelled alarmingly to the size of a golf ball and had become hot and pulsating. The swelling was a parotid haemangioma - a large collection of blood vessels which had built up under Jessica's skin. Jessica is pictured shortly after her birth . Since her treatment, Jessica has been left with nothing other than a little bit of excess skin around her ear . Miss Payne said: ‘It was like Jessica was growing a second head. The birthmark seemed to be growing overnight. ‘It had made her mouth and eye droop. When we had her christened at three-months-old, it was the size of a grapefruit. ‘It looked agonising. The skin around it had started to split. It was dry, cracked, red and oozing pus. I worried that it would never stop growing. Miss Payne (pictured with Jessica) said: 'It was like Jessica was growing a second head. The birthmark seemed to be growing overnight. It had made her mouth and eye droop. When we had her christened at three-months-old, it was the size of a grapefruit' ‘What’s worse, she was struggling to feed. Sometimes she couldn’t swallow and she’d stop breathing. ‘It was terrifying and I was scared it was all because of the huge lump on her face.’ Jessica was rushed to Scarborough Hospital at four-months-old after she went limp during a feed. She was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary where doctors carried out tests. Miss Payne said: 'Propranolol really is a wonder drug. It isn't usually used to treat birthmarks, but Jessica was part of a trial and it has been a huge success' Here, it was confirmed she had gag reflex problems, explaining her difficulty breathing. However, a consultant reassured Miss Payne and Jessica’s father, Andy Leng, that the lump on her face was unrelated and wasn’t causing Jessica any pain. Miss Payne said: ‘We were relieved when the doctors said it was a birthmark and couldn’t hurt Jessica. Miss Payne said she worried that the lump would never stop growing but a doctor reassured her that it would not cause Jessica serious medical problems . ‘It had been blocking her ear, which had caused some hearing problems, but it wasn’t expected to have any long-term effects. ‘They assured us that it was stop growing eventually, but it seemed to be getting bigger, not smaller.’ Haemangiomas, often known as strawberry birthmarks, are usually treated using steroids, with varying degrees of success. But doctors instead suggested they treat Jessica with a course of propranolol in a bid to stem the blood flow through her birthmark. The drug is usually used to treat patients with thyroid problems and heart disease, but is currently being trialled on children with similar types of birthmark to Jessica. Miss Payne was delighted when she noticed that the birthmark had begun to shrink almost immediately. After two years of medication, Jessica recently stopped taking propranolol when her birthmark disappeared almost completely. Although Miss Payne was warned the lump may reappear, Jessica has shown no signs of a relapse. Miss Payne said: ‘I have told Jessica about her birthmark and shown her photos of her as a little girl, just so she knows what she’s been through. ‘She takes it all in her stride though. Sometimes at dinner, she makes me laugh by pushing her food to one side of her mouth and pretending the lump has returned. The growth was blocking Jessica's ear causing her to have some hearing problems. Now that it has gone, her hearing is expected to return to normal . ‘If she wants to have the excess skin around her ear removed when she’s older, I’ll support her. ‘But she’s been through so much, I’m just happy she’s smiling.’ Propranolol works by blocking the release of noradrenaline in certain parts of the body. When she is older, Jessica (pictured with her mother Donna, left, and grandmother, Daryl, centre) will be able to decide whether or not to have the excess skin around her ear removed . Noradrenaline is a chemical released by nerves when they are stimulated. The noradrenaline passes messages to other parts of the body, such as the muscles, blood vessels and heart. It is thought that propranolol helps narrow the blood vessels, reducing the amount of blood running through them. This reduces the colour and makes them softer. The cells that cause the growth of the haemangioma are also affected so the haemangioma gets smaller. Propranolol works by blocking the release of noradrenaline in certain parts of the body.

Questioned: Police have confiscated the phone of driver Darriean Hess, pictured, and are questioning her to determine what caused her to cross the center line and strike the cyclists . A mother-of-two and her friend were killed on Saturday after they were struck by a 20-year-old female driver during a 100-mile charity cycle ride. Pamela Wells, 60, of South Hamilton, Massachusetts and Elise Bouchard, 52, of Danvers, Massachusetts died and two other riders were injured when Darriean Hess plowed into them at around 8:30 a.m. on Neil R. Underwood Memorial Bridge in Hampton, North Hampshire, police said. The cyclists had been taking part in the 40th annual Granite State Wheelman Tri-State Seacoast Century Ride when Hess crossed over from the southbound lane to the northbound lane. After striking the cyclists, deputy police chief Rich Sawyer said Hess' vehicle 'road along' various structures, curbing and sidewalk on the bridge for a distance' before it 'popped back onto the road' and crossed back over to the southbound lane, hitting several road signs. The vehicle came to a stop after it 'decimated the Welcome to Seabrook Beach sign, Sawyer told the Hampton-Northampton Patch. Bikers who witnessed the deadly crash were terrified. 'It's tragic. Absolutely tragic! This race has been going on for 40 years and this is awful,' biker Chris Bailey told CBS Local. Wells' husband, Tom Rogers, said on Sunday that police had told him they were treating the accident as a criminal investigation. 'They have the bicycles. They confiscated her phone, and they took a blood sample. And they have her car,' Rogers said. Scroll down for video .

A healthy schoolgirl collapsed while she was doing her homework and died, an inquest has heard. Arabella Campbell, 16, who was described as ‘a fit, sporty child’ suffered Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome (SADS). She went into cardiac arrest while she was studying in her bedroom at her home in Beckenham, Kent, on May 11. Arabella Campbell, 16, died after suffering a sudden cardiac arrest at home. Her death has been put down to Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome which caused her heart to stop beating . Arabella, a pupil at Langley Park School in Beckenham, was found by her mother but died at Croydon University Hospital. Coroner Dr Roy Palmer told the inquest into Arabella’s death: ‘She had no significant medical history, she was a fit, sporty child with no history of drink and drugs. ‘She and her family had been out together during the day on a family outing. ‘When they returned home she went to her room to study, but when her mother went up to see her she found her unresponsive on her bed. ‘An ambulance was called at 10.38pm, and arrived at 10.45pm. ‘They found her on the floor unresponsive and started CPR. Arabella was rushed to Croydon University Hospital when her mother found her unresponsive on her bed. Medics tried repeatedly to save her but their efforts were unsuccessful . ‘She was brought in to Croydon University Hospital at 11.38pm, where they worked on her through a number of cycles but sadly couldn’t do anything. ‘She was pronounced dead at 12.20am.’ The hearing at Croydon Coroner’s Court heard a post-mortem examination found Arabella had a normal heart and that her toxicology reports came back negative, leading to the conclusion that her death was a result of SADS. In about one in five cases of sudden cardiac death in young people no definite cause of death can be found. This applies even once drugs have been excluded as a cause and a pathologist has examined the heart for structural abnormalities. These deaths are attributed to SADS. It occurs when a cardiac arrest is brought on by a problem with the electrical functioning of the heart, even though the person has no disease affecting the heart. The syndrome refers to genetic heart conditions that can cause sudden death in young, apparently healthy people. Dr Palmer added: ‘There were no injuries or natural disease processes that could have caused her death. ‘I therefore conclude the cause of death was sudden adult death syndrome and return a conclusion of death by natural causes.’ In about one in five cases of sudden cardiac death in young people no definite cause of death can be found.

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 10:37 EST, 18 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:25 EST, 18 September 2013 . Novelist Sir Terry Pratchett has accused the Government of ‘pussy footing’ around on dementia treatment and withholding vital research funds. In a damning blog, the top-selling author - who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2007 - said care services were left to ‘paper over the cracks’ of a lack of funds. Sir Terry wrote a personal reflection on society’s response to the disease alongside his own experiences in the inaugural article for the Alzheimer’s Research UK. Sir Terry Pratchett, 65, has accused the Government of 'pussy footing' around on dementia treatment and withholding vital research funds. Sir Terry was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2007 . He called for more investment into research and said science needed to deliver on its promises. The 65-year-old said: ‘Technology and a trained and compassionate care system can help paper over the cracks, but, a decade since the last proclaimed development, science needs to deliver on its promises. 'There’s more money floating around the Government for research, but barely enough to buy a middling Premier League striker. ‘If we’re serious about this thing, and want to match the fanfare with the funding, then more money needs to be found down the back of David Cameron’s sofa.’ The author, famous for his Discworld fantasy books, added: ‘If there is indeed an emerging sense - finally - that we’ve stopped pussy footing around dementia and can now bear to utter its name, we nevertheless find a cloud of unknowing persists. ‘People read, watch and hear more about it than ever before. They know it’s out there. Sir Terry said 'If we're serious about this thing, and want to match the fanfare with the funding, then more money needs to be found down the back of David Cameron's sofa' ‘They know it will claim more of us as we continue to age. They fear it. ‘Dementia . vies with cancer in an unsavoury battle of the scariest, but it must be . said that some lucky people will survive cancer. ‘But I suspect many still don’t understand dementia or, at least, understand it only as an insidious memory loss. The fear, perhaps, is a fear of the unknown. ‘There isn’t one kind of dementia. There aren’t a dozen kinds. There are hundreds of thousands. ‘Each person who lives with one of these diseases will be affected in uniquely destructive ways. ‘I, for one, am the only person suffering from Terry Pratchett’s posterior cortical atrophy which, for some unknown reason, still leaves me able to write - with the help of my computer and friend - bestselling novels.’ Sir Terry became a patron of Alzheimer’s Research UK in 2008, shortly after announcing his diagnosis with posterior cortical atrophy, a rare variant of Alzheimer’s disease primarily affecting vision. He went on to make a personal donation of $1 million to the charity, and has subsequently campaigned for greater research funding, including delivering a major petition to Number 10 and countless media appearances. The charity’s blog, www.dementiablog.org, aims to share the ideas and experiences of people living with dementia. It also hopes to bring news on scientists working to improve diagnosis, prevention and treatment, and the fundraisers who support the UK’s leading dementia research charity. In a closing statement Sir Terry, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, said: ‘The funding drum will continue to be beaten no doubt. Sir Terry made a personal donation of $1 million to Alzheimer's Research UK, and has subsequently campaigned for greater research funding, including delivering a major petition to Number 10. Image shows scans of a brain with Alzheimer's . ‘In the meantime, donors to this charity and all of us as tax payers put faith in the scientists working their arcane magic with limited means. ‘We need to know that they are beating the odds, and this should be the place to come to find out. ‘Believe me, I for one, will be looking over their shoulders and taking them to task. Come on, get on with it!’ There are hundreds of thousands of people in the UK living with dementia, and more than 40 per cent of the UK population know someone close with the disease. Alzheimer’s Research UK funds more than £20 million of dementia research across the UK - including more than £1 million in the South West - and is a leading commentator on new dementia research findings. To read the blog visit www.dementiablog.org . A new brain scan which could be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease has been hailed by experts. There are currently no fail-safe methods to test for the illness which affects around 500,000 people in Britain. But researchers in Japan have developed a scan which could eventually help doctors accurately diagnose the disease. The technology allows them to detect a protein called tau which builds up in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'This promising early study highlights a potential new method for detecting tau - a key player in both Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia - in the living brain. 'With new drugs in development designed to target tau, scans capable of visualising the protein inside the brain could be important for assessing whether treatments in clinical trials are hitting their target. 'If this method is shown to be effective, such a scan could also be a useful aid for providing people with an accurate diagnosis, as well as for monitoring disease progression.

If you think the football season is only bad for your marriage, you may need to think again. New research shows that it is also bad for your waistline, your bank balance and your liver. The study has revealed which football fans have the worst habits during the season. Chelsea FC fans are the biggest drinkers of all Premiership football supporters - 48 per cent say they drink during matches and the average consumption is four pints per match . It showed that Arsenal fans are most likely to neglect their partner, with 63 per cent admitting they spend more time with their friends than their loved ones during the season. Manchester United supporters are the biggest lovers of takeaway food with 52 per cent saying they eat takeaways three times a week during the football season. The Diet Chef survey also revealed that Chelsea fans are the biggest drinkers – 48 per cent say they drink during matches and the average consumption is four pints per match. As a result, they consume 1,200 calories from beer alone during a match. West Ham fans have been exposed as the biggest gamblers – they have an average gambling spend of £25 per game. They are also the heaviest smokers – 35 per cent of West Ham supporters smoke on match days. Fans of Manchester United are the biggest lovers of takeaway food with 52 per cent saying they eat takeaways three times a week during the football season. Image shows Man U player Robin van Persie . The poll also revealed that Manchester City fans put on the most weight during the football season – 34 per cent believe they go up by one waist size by the end of the winter. Being married to a Tottenham Hotspur fan is not desirable - 23 per cent of Spurs fans admit to neglecting their sex lives during the football season. The beautiful game is also bad for family life. Some 38 per cent of male fans miss out on family days out so they can watch the game. Finally, 52 per cent of supporters give up trying to eat healthily during the footie season and 40 per cent ditch their exercise regime. Izzy Cameron, Nutrition and Weight Management Specialist at Diet Chef said: ‘It’s been really interesting to see just how much football means to the men of Britain and what compromises they will make for their love of the beautiful game.

They are also the heaviest smokers - 35 per cent of West Ham supporters smoke during matches.

Concern: New figures reveal a one-year-old baby was among more than 5,000 children in Wales to have been swabbed for DNA over the last three years . A one-year-old baby is among thousands of children who have had their DNA taken by police, it was revealed last night. The baby is believed to be among the youngest ever to undergo the procedure as part of a criminal inquiry. New figures revealed he was among more than 5,000 children in Wales to have been swabbed for DNA over the last three years. They mirror the activities of police across the rest of the nation who insist they follow the law on the taking and retention of personal samples. Campaigners are growing increasingly concerned that young people could be traumatised by the experience and left on police databases for life. Helen Wallace, who leads Genewatch, said she fears the taking of a child’s DNA is not always necessary or proportionate. ‘The police do need to be able to take samples from children in cases sometimes to eliminate samples,’ she said. ‘So a one-year-old would have been present in a house where a crime has taken place and they will need that data. 'But our concern is about the large numbers of children who are ending up with records on the DNA database. ‘The process a child can go through can be quite traumatic if a child is arrested for no reason, if it is a false accusation or misunderstanding. ‘It can be traumatic to be photographed and fingerprinted and have your DNA taken.’ The latest figures revealed 5,561 children were swabbed by the four forces in Wales as part of their investigations since 2010. South Wales Police took the most, 2,866 samples, but Dyfed-Powys Police, which took 1,080 samples, swabbed the youngest children. The latest figures revealed a staggering 5,561 children were swabbed by the four forces in Wales as part of their investigations since 2010 . Among them were the one-year-old, a two-year-old in 2010, a seven-year-old in 2011, an eight-year-old in 2012 and a nine-year-old in 2011. A total of 1,132 children have been swabbed by North Wales Police since 2010. The youngest was 10. Since 2010 they have taken 16 samples of kids that age. This year Gwent Police took 120 samples from under 15s. The youngest was ten. Since 2010 they have sampled 483. The Protection of Freedoms Act, due to be introduced soon, will mean the DNA of children can be removed from databases if they are innocent or only convicted of a minor offence. Under current legislation, police retain DNA samples taken with consent if they could be used in court proceedings, including any possible appeal. The Protection of Freedoms Act, due to be introduced soon, will mean the DNA of children can be removed from databases if they are innocent or only convicted of a minor offence . Nick Pickles, of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘I’m stunned that someone thought it was acceptable to take a DNA sample from a one-year-old baby. On what possible grounds is that reasonable or necessary? The UK DNA Database has grown to become the largest in the world and yet there is little evidence to suggest DNA profiling results in a higher sense of public safety.’ Andrew Neilson runs the Howard League for Penal Reform. He said: ‘These figures show the worrying extent to which children are drawn into criminal investigations. ‘It is a cause for concern that more than 5,500 DNA samples have been taken from under-16s in only three and a half years.’ Dyfed-Powys Police said: ‘A total of five DNA samples were taken from children between the ages of zero and nine. ‘These were volunteer DNA elimination samples which were required in order to assist in the investigation of crimes.' Earlier this year, it emerged that police in England Wales collect a DNA sample from a child every ten minutes. Officers took nearly 54,000 swabs of genetic material from under 18s in 2012. On average, 27 primary school children had their DNA taken by the police every week to put on the national database. Figures obtained using the Freedom of Information Act revealed 53,974 DNA samples were taken from children during 2011. Police in England and Wales collected samples from 368 ten-year-olds and 1,030 11-year-olds. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said: ‘DNA may be taken from children in a number of circumstances. The taking and retention of DNA from people of all ages is set out clearly under law.’ Share what you think . The comments below have not been moderated. CazAndJam, .

The body of missing baby boy has been discovered in a container in an upstate New York river. Authorities confirmed on Saturday that remains found near Utica earlier this month belonged to 10-month-old Levon Wameling. In June, Levon's father, Jevon Wameling, told his parents, who then told police, the child was taken from his porch two weeks earlier but he failed to report his son missing at the time. State police divers found the child's body in the Mohawk River on September 6, after a tip off. Following extensive DNA testing, the Onondaga County medical examiner's office in Syracuse verified the baby was Levon, police said on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Grief: Amy Warney, left, asked the public to help find her baby, right, 'dead or alive' The medical examiner, however, hasn't provided a cause of death, CNN reported. Sergeant Steve Hauck said the police were determined to get to the bottom of the baby's death. 'The Utica Police continue to investigate this case, with the hope that the truth will be learned and the person(s) responsible are held accountable,' Hauck said in a statement. Last month, Wameling was arrested on suspicion of breaking into a home in a suburb of Utica to steal jewelry and money. Hauck hasn't said whether the father had anything to do with the tip leading police to the remains. He did however say police had questions about the man's involvement from the start. In June, Levon's mother, Amy Warney, pleaded for help finding her son, who was last seen May 29 by his father. Wameling, 27, waited nearly two weeks to report his son missing, according to the The Utica Observer-Dispatch. 'I would like to ask anybody that's out there if you know where he is, or if he's alive or dead, just please call the Utica police Station so I can just put him to rest,' Warney said through tears at a June news conference. Dead: Police in Utica, New York, discovered the body of missing 9-month-old Levon Wameling, right, on September 6, months after his father Jevon Wameling finally reported him missing . Delayed: Levon Wameling was reported missing two weeks after anyone last saw him . 'Just please, don't be scared. Just if you know anything, just please contact somebody.' Levon's grandparents reported him missing to the Oneida County District Attorney Scott McNamara, who immediately notified police, according to WKTV. After his son was reported missing, Wameling told police Levon disappeared two weeks earlier when Wameling left the baby unattended on the front porch wearing nothing but a diaper. Wameling said he left the baby alone while he was trying to get back into his home after locking himself out. Police said Wameling came forward only after Levon's mother asked where her child was. 'Here's the thing, we have a problem with what he says,' Utica Chief Mark Williams said at the time. 'Here’s a guy that waited two weeks to come forward. He doesn't bring it forward to the police, but brings it forward to his parents. Instead he goes to an attorney's office. I think actions speak louder than words.' A large scale search ensued for the boy with a state police helicopter hovering over the neighborhood where Levon was last seen and K-9 units continued to hunting for him on the ground. Happy: Jevon Wameling, seen here with his son Levon, was the last person to see him before the baby went missing in May . In addition to state and local authorities, the FBI, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Oneida County District Attorney's Office assisted in the search effort. Williams told CNN that the father's delay is only making it harder for them to find the child. 'When you have a missing child, there's all these difficult cases,' he said. 'But when you're two weeks behind, it's nearly impossible.' Despite the father's 'suspicious' behavior, authorities' focus has been to find Levon. 'We obviously have very grave concerns about the child. First and foremost, is where this child?' Hauck told YNN at the time. 'We need to know what happened. Wherever the evidence leads us is where we're going to go. If we find a crime was committed, then we're going to take appropriate steps to bring that person to justice. But right now, our biggest concern is finding this child.' Though he is not a suspect, police said they are are treating Wameling as a 'person of interest'. Manhunt: Along with the public's help, investigators with six agencies have contributed to the search for Levon Wameling . Tragedy: Amy Warney, seen with Levon right, was in drug rehab while her baby was staying with his father . Search: K-9 units and helicopters were used to try to find Levon Wameling but divers finally located the body after a tip . Levon was staying with his father while Warney was at a drug rehabilitation facility, police said. 'As far as she knew, the child was being cared for by Jevon and was doing fine,' Hauck told The Observer-Dispatch. Levon's father has a criminal history. Wameling . was charged with resisting arrest, escaping police custody and . harassment in May 2010 after being arrested for allegedly possessing . metal knuckles, according to WKTV. In 2009, he was convicted of marijuana possession.

Bunny 'boiler': Tina Sandlin, 36, was strung out on meth when she was arrested for killing the family pet rabbit . A Florida woman who decapitated a pet bunny rabbit in front of her two children while strung out on meth will not go to prison. Tina Sandlin, 36, pleaded no contest to animal cruelty and child abuse on Friday and has been sentenced to one year in an inpatient drug rehabilitation centre. Bay County Sheriff's deputies arrested Sandlin last year after they found her holed up under a mobile home in Southport, Florida. She went into hiding after she brought her children into her bedroom in mid-July so they could see her cut off the rabbit's head with a knife, according to NY Daily News. The children later told police that their mother held the rabbit by the ears as it kicked its legs in a failed effort to free itself. The kids did not immediately tell anyone about their pet's bloody death but eventually alerted their father. Her husband told officers that Sandlin merely shrugged her shoulders and said she slaughtered the pet because she was bored, when he confronted her. Decapitated: Sandlin killed the bunny rabbit, not pictured, by cutting off its head with a knife in front of her two young children . He added that their children, now 7 and 4, had nightmares about the incident. Sandlin left the house and did not contact her family for about a month. Officers say she admitted to the killing after they took her into custody. Judge Elijah Smiley sentenced her to five years' probation, including 18 months on drug offender probation. Her probation may be terminated after 30 months if she meets a set of requirements. Sandlin is forbidden from contacting her husband or children while in the facility. She may be able to have contact with the kids again after being leaving rehab and remaining sober for 90 days, said the Daily News.

But Downton Abbey has failed to impress Simon Schama, who has launched a scathing attack on the programme, claiming it’s a ‘steaming, silvered tureen of snobbery’. According to Professor Schama, one of the country’s leading historians, Downton is guilty of ‘cultural necrophilia’ and is littered with inaccuracies and cliched storylines. Clash: Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, . left, collects a Golden Globe award for the costume drama, that . historian Simon Schama, right, has deemed 'cultural necrophilia' The 66-year-old, a professor at Columbia University in New York, said: ‘It is a servile soap opera that an American public desperate for something, anything, to take its mind off the perplexities of the present, seems only too happy to down in great, grateful gulps.’ Writing in Newsweek, he added: ‘Nothing beats British television drama for servicing the instincts of cultural necrophilia. ‘So the series is fabulously frocked, and acted, and overacted, and hyper-overacted by all the Usual Suspects in keeping with their allotted roles … .

In the U.S. it is broadcast on Sunday nights on state-funded channel PBS, and attracts more than four million viewers – double the usual audience in that time slot. But Professor Schama suggested this was simply down to the ‘unassuageable American craving for the British country house’. The historian said that Fellowes had sacrificed historical accuracy for a 'bromide of romance'. 'If . Fellowes were really interested in the true drama attending the port . and partridge classes... the story on our TV would be quite different,' he added.

Producer Gareth Neame defended the show, saying: ‘Downton is a fictional drama, not a history programme.’ The stinging attack from the respected historian comes just days after the show's creator Julian Fellowes collected a Golden Globe for the series. He was joined by Bonneville, who plays Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham and actress McGovern, who plays his wife Cora, Countess of Grantham.

The future of the new high speed rail line was in turmoil last night after Labour threatened to pull the plug on the £50billion project. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls shattered the cross-party consensus on the HS2 line, signalling that there would be ‘no blank cheque’ from a future Labour government and that the money could be better spent on housing. Mr Balls sparked deep divisions in Labour, which originally devised the project, by warning that his party would kill the project unless it proves to be value for money. Scroll down for video . Buffers: Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls signaled that he thought the £50billion earmarked for HS2 could be better spent elsewhere . His intervention will embolden Tory critics of HS2 – the biggest infrastructure project in British history – who are set to demand an end to the project at their party conference next week. In his conference speech, Mr Balls said: ‘The question is – not just whether a new high speed line is a good idea or a bad idea, but whether it is the best way to spend £50billion for the future of our country.’ The official cost of the project, including contingency funds, has recently climbed from £33billion to £42.6billion. The cost of new rolling stock will bring that to £50billion but independent experts have warned that the cost could spiral to £70billion or more. Mr Balls said Labour still backs a new ‘North-South rail link’ but at a fringe meeting last night Mr Balls said: ‘What I’m not going to do is write a blank cheque politically. Every billion pounds you spend on HS2 is a billion pounds you won’t spend on roads or cross-county train links or building new homes or new schools or new hospitals or other parts of the infrastructure. He adds: ‘I think it’s about time to inject some hard thinking.’ His deputy Rachel Reeves added: ‘We would cancel if it we did not think it was good value for money.’ Mr Balls’ speech thrilled opponents of . the project. Joe Rukin of Stop HS2   said: ‘Ed Balls is dead right to . question whether HS2 is worth it.’ But frontbenchers openly suggested he . had gone further than Ed Miliband would like. A member of the shadow . cabinet said: ‘Ed Balls is much more sceptical about it that Ed . Miliband.’ Sources close to the Labour leader said he had read and . approved Mr Balls’ speech and claimed the ‘policy hasn’t changed’. Former Labour transport secretary Lord .

Two reckless teenagers have been pictured dicing with death as they tried their hand at the dangerous urban sport of free-running over. A friend videoed the pair's stunt as they dashed across the arches of the Foryd Bridge in Rhyl, in Wales, 30ft above a fast flowing, frigid River Clwyd. Cars thundered beneath the two teens as stunned passers-by watched on in horror. Reckless: A friend videos the two teens are they dare each other to run over the top of the Foryd Bridge in Rhyl . A single slip or a gust of wind would have sent them hurtling towards the busy carriageway 30ft beneath or 50ft into the water. They were spotted at about 3.15pm on Sunday making three passes over the arches. Photographer Geoff Abbott, who spotted the youths, told the Daily Post newspaper: . 'If they had fallen, it would have been over for them. If they’d landed . on the road, they would have been killed. It’s totally irresponsible. 'The younger of the two was a very young lad and, as a parent, I was very worried about him in particular. Danger: One of the youngsters, wearing only trainers and jogging bottoms, led his friend down the slippery arch towards a set of steel railings meant to keep them off . Security issue: The dangerous stunt has led to calls to tighten security around the bridge which has a set of spiked railings at the foot of each arch to prevent people climbing them . Mr . Abbott then watched as they group checked the mobile phone footage of . the stunt, then decided to run across the 20meter arch for a third . time. The incident has provoked calls to tighten security on the steel crossing which is known locally as the blue bridge. The . area’s councillor has called for security features at the bridge to be . examined in light of the incident, which she described as 'frightening'. Inches from disaster: A sudden gust of wind or a slip could have sent the youngsters tumbling into the river below . Police have seen the photographs, but decided not to investigate. Inspector Jason Devonport said: 'We won't be investigating this matter but we will be putting out safety advice.' Joan . Butterfield, county councillor for Rhyl West, said called for safety at the bridge to be . examined. She said any slip from the duo could have caused a serious accident. She added that she would be contacting police to discuss measures needed to prevent a repeat of this dangerous incident. Share what you think . The comments below have been moderated in advance.

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 09:32 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:52 EST, 23 September 2013 . A man who was driving while disqualified killed a motorcyclist when he smashed into him before jumping into the passenger seat so his girlfriend could take the blame. Father-of-one Alan Hellyer, 55, died instantly when his motorbike was hit by a car driven by Trevor Barnard, 33, on the A3 near Waterlooville in Hampshire. Barnard and his lover Cassie Fagan, 24, told police she had been at the wheel and kept up their lives for eight months until Fagan finally cracked and confessed to police. Trevor Barnard, 33, and girlfriend Cassie Fagan, 24, from Havant, lied to police about who had been driving . Today both were jailed after Fagan admitted perverting the course of justice and Barnard admitted driving while disqualified, perverting the course of justice, causing death by careless driving and driving without insurance. Winchester Crown Court heard how Mr Hellyer, a keen golfer and fisherman from Havant, Hampshire, was returning home from visiting his mother in hospital when he was hit by the hired Vauxhall Astra, suffering severe head injuries. Barnard, who was driving, swapped seats with Fagan at the scene because she had a clean licence and both claimed the rear light on Mr Hellyer’s motorbike was faulty. Fagan told police she was behind the . wheel and said the pair, who were also both from Havant, had been out shoplifting when the crash . happened in September 2011, near Queen Elizabeth Country Park. She was arrested and later charged with causing death by careless driving.  But Fagan contacted police in May last year and changed her story, admitting Barnard was in fact the driver. Father-of-one Alan Hellyer, 55, died instantly when the Astra driven by Barnard hit him on the A3 near Waterlooville in Hampshire . He was charged after police investigated the claim and discovered that he had been driving while disqualified and without insurance. He has now been jailed for four years and given a three-year driving ban, while Fagan was sentenced to a year in jail for her role in the deception. Prosecutor Katherine Lumsdon described Mr Hellyer as 'an experienced and careful motorcyclist'. Mr Hellyer’s brother Adrian, 54, said: 'We all think the sentences should have been a lot more. 'It’s not enough but at least it’s something. 'We didn’t get a chance even to say goodbye to him. We got nearly a year into the case to be told Barnard wasn’t the driver. 'Every day I pass over the spot where he was killed going to work and I think of him.' He added: 'I feel at last we have got closure. We know who is responsible and they are paying the penalty.' Mr Hellyer’s ex-wife, Linda Knipe, said: 'Alan was an extremely careful and considerate driver. 'I don’t feel we have been able to put Alan to rest until now. 'Two years is a long time. It’s because of them, because they lied.  Alan was wonderful and would do anything for anyone. He was an amazing dad.' The web of lies told by Barnard and Fagan meant their cases were dragged out for more than two years following Mr Hellyer’s death. Scene: The fatal accident happened on the A3 near Waterlooville in Hampshire in September 2011 . In a statement read out in court, Fagan apologised to Mr Hellyer’s family for her actions. Speaking after the case, investigating officer PC Karen Stevenson said: 'What Barnard and Fagan have put the family through is appalling. 'Hopefully now they can have some sort of closure. 'To have had the investigation go on that long because of the defendants’ action has had a terrible effect on the family.' Share what you think .

A child of three was found wandering the streets alone after walking out of his nursery school. Tamimul Islam is believed to have been by himself for up to an hour before a woman driving past found him and returned him to his family. The toddler . told the woman he wanted to go home rather than back to St Hilda's Primary in Oldham, Greater Manchester, which he had only attended for a few days. His shocked father, Khairul Islam, said: 'A lady who was driving saw my son . walking by himself. She followed him and asked him where he was going. The family is still shocked. 'When I saw him at 1.45pm in my house, I didn¹t know what to say. Investigation: Gillian Pursey, head of St Hilda's in Oldham, pictured, said disciplinary action may be taken . ‘Anything could have happened to him and the school couldn’t explain what happened.’ Tamimul’s aunt, who did not want to be named, said: ‘People should have been watching him and guarding the main entrance to make sure that no child could get out. 'We cannot be sure how long he was outside the school on his own but it could have been over an hour. 'If he had walked for a few minutes more he could have walked into a main road by himself and been seriously hurt.' The school has apologised to the family and launched an investigation to determine how he was allowed to leave. According to Gillian Pursey, head teacher at St . Hilda's, disciplinary action may be taken ‘if appropriate’. She said: 'We were extremely concerned for the welfare of the boy . and we unreservedly apologise for the obvious distress this caused to . him and his family. 'We are taking this incident extremely seriously . and are conducting an internal investigation to find out exactly what . happened. 'If appropriate, this could lead to disciplinary action to . ensure it never happens again. Scandal: It is the second uproar at the school after teachers allegedly went to a wedding in January but claimed they were at a training day. The incident was reported by a parent . 'The welfare of each and every child . here is our top priority and we will not hesitate to act if we find that . this situation could have been prevented.' St Hilda's most recent Ofsted inspection . in July rated it as good in all categories, including the behaviour and . safety of pupils and leadership and management. Inspectors said 'pupils say they feel safe at school and have confidence in adults to take care of them'. This is the second scandal surrounding St Hilda's this year. In January, a parent complained that teachers attended a colleague's wedding when they claimed to be on a staff training day. Tamimul's case is also the second time a child has gone missing from a primary school this month. Louise Hilton, two, walked all the way home from Windmill Nursery in Runcorn. Arriving at the house, half a mile away, she knocked on the door and announced: 'Mummy, mummy, I'm home.'","Tamimul Islam is said to have been missing from his Oldham nursery for more than an hour .

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 11:22 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:33 EST, 23 September 2013 . Jailed: Karl Clay, 39, from Wood End, Coventry, has been jailed for life for committing sexual offences against 10 victims . A serial paedophile who poured petrol over his young victims and threatened to set them on fire during a 20 year campaign of abuse was today jailed for life. Karl Clay, 39, sexually assaulted 10 different victims - the youngest being just six-years-old - in a string of horrific attacks. A court heard 20-stone Clay systematically targeted both adults and children during a two decade reign of terror - using various threats to make them comply with his demands. It was only after two of his youngest victims - now in their teens - broke their silence in 2011 that police launched a major probe and uncovered a catalogue of crimes dating back into the early 1990s. Warwick Crown Court heard Clay threatened his victims with weapons while subjecting them to prolonged and degrading sexual acts. In 2005 the 'bullying monster' poured petrol over three of his victims, including two children, and threatened to set them alight while repeatedly flicking a lighter next to them. Clay was convicted of two counts of rape, two counts of actual bodily harm, attempted rape, indecency with a child, indecent assault, putting a person in fear of violence, threats to kill, two counts of rape of a child under 13, causing a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity and putting a person in fear of violence by harassment in July. Clay, from Wood End, Coventry, was told he must serve at least 15 years behind bars after he was found guilty of the 'terrible catalogue' of offences. Sentencing, Judge Sylvia De Bertobano said many of Clay’s vulnerable victims had been left scarred for life by his actions. 'Monster': Karl Clay, 39, pictured, denied the allegations but was found guilty after a jury heard he used 'manipulation and fear' to get away with repeated attacks . Jailing Clay for life, she said: 'It was a terrible catalogue of offending against women and children. 'It’s a tale of terrible abuse targeted at those who are vulnerable. There’s nothing that you or I can do to give these victims back their lost childhood. 'By pleading not guilty you put them through the further ordeal of giving evidence. 'I have no doubt whatsoever that you are . a significant risk to the public and it’s abundantly clear that you . will continue to be a danger. 'This sentence reflects the public horror of these offences.' Guilty: Clay even threatened to set three of his victim on fire after dousing them with petrol . The court was told Clay’s victims were often abused more than once as he used 'manipulation and fear' to get away with repeated attacks. These varied from threats, to punches and kicks, right through to the most serious sexual assaults, jurors were told. One woman told police Clay had rammed a pillow on her face to suffocate her while another recalled how he attempted to drown her in a bath full of water. He also forced his child victims to watch hardcore pornography - and in another incident he stabbed a boy’s foot with a fork. Speaking after the case, DCI Chris Hanson, of West Midlands Police, said he believed Clay may have preyed on other victims and urged them to come forward. He said: 'Karl Clay is easily the vilest offender I have ever dealt with in the 21 years that I have been a police officer and his victims have been terribly brave in giving the evidence that was crucial in convicting him. 'While our enquiry uncovered 10 of Clay’s victims, I would be surprised if there aren’t others out there. 'We know that Clay is a violent predator who exerted power and control over his victims. 'But he’s now safely behind bars and I would urge anyone else who has suffered because of him to contact the police.' Share what you think . The comments below have been moderated in advance.

A 60-year-old woman was arrested Wednesday in Northern Missouri for abducting her infant grandson 13 years ago. Sandy Hatte is charged with kidnapping the boy while she was keeping an eye on him in his Florida home in 2000. When the boy’s father arrived home from work, he was gone. The boy was with Hatte for all those years until her arrest last week, at which point he was seized by police at a Livingston school. Nabbed: Sandy Hatte was arrested Wednesday after living on the run with the grandson she kidnapped from his father--her son--13 years ago in Florida . Hatte is behind bars at the Daviess/Dekalb County Regional Jail under $25,000 bond. According to WDAF, it was the unnamed boy’s presence at that school that set his rescue in motion. A school principal reportedly became suspicious when Hatte, who claimed to be his mother, tried to enroll him in the school. The principal contacted local police, who began an investigation. P.I.: Larry Jones helped track Hatte's past on the lam after the boy's aunt enlisted him, reportedly after authorities wrote off the kidnapping as a civil matter . But that was months before the eventual arrest and police failed to look too deeply into the situation, calling it a civil matter. ‘I don’t think anyone was pursuing it because it was grandma who had the kid,’ said Larry Jones, of Black Hawk Investigations. Jones was brought onto the case when the boy’s aunt, frustrated with the alleged police inaction,  decided to hire a private investigator. ‘I’ve always been a team player and so I considered myself a part of the team, and I was going to do everything I could to have it resolved the way it’s been,’ Jones told WDAF. Finally: The unnamed boy was taken by authorities at this Missouri school Wednesday after Hatte's arrest. He's now in Alabama with his biological father . Along with Jones, local police detective Eric Menconi and Captain Sindy Fitzpatrick conducted background investigations, reports the St. Joseph Post, which led them to the boy’s biological father in Alabama. Livingston County Sheriff Steve Cox told the St. Joseph Post that Hatte and the boy had only been living in Livingston County for around thirty days. He said they’d more than likely spent over a decade in ‘other cities, counties, and/or states.’ And at least one during that time, Hatte and her grandson were homeless. WDAF reports that Hatte and the boy were taken in by a Chillicothe, Missouri man when he learned they had no place to live. He learned they were on the run only when police showed up at his door to arrest Hatte. The boy was since reunited with his biological father at a Days Inn in Chillicothe, and they had a reunion dinner at a nearby Golden Corral. ‘It was a good reunion,’ Menconi said. ‘You could tell within the first three minutes they hit it off pretty well. Since then I’ve been on the phone with the dad and from what I’m understanding it’s going very well. He’s adjusting.’ Homeless: The boy was living in this Missouri house, where a man reportedly took in him and Hatte after learning they were homeless . Share what you think .

Justine Miliband has promised to take to the ‘barricades’ in the general election battle as she vowed not to just stand silently next to husband Ed in a nice dress. Party strategists plan to put Mrs Miliband on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election. But she has vowed to break with convention and speak out publicly about why she thinks Mr Miliband should be Prime Minister. Life's a beach: In the latest photo opportunity Ed and Justine Miliband were pictured on Brighton beach apparently reading his leader's speech . Side-by-side: Justine and Ed Miliband walk through Brighton city centre in one of several photo opportunities during the Labour conference . The child actress-turned-barrister has begun making a public appearances and speeches at the Labour party conference to ‘humanise’ her husband. Mr Miliband repeatedly said he would not copy David Cameron’s habit of eye-catching photo opportunities while opposition leader, and would instead focus on policies. But the party conference in Brighton has seen a string of family photo opportunities, walking through the city centre and strolling on the beach with sons Daniel, four and Samuel, two. The decision to use Mrs Miliband into the political fray has drawn comparisons with failed attempts by Gordon Brown and Iain Duncan Smith to use their other halves to rescue their leadership. Stepping out: Mrs Miliband toured the conference exhibition stands at the Brighton Centre . But she signalled that she will do more than wear a stylish dress for the traditional posed snaps at the end of the leader’s speech. Speaking at a Young Labour event in Brighton, she said: ‘I wanted to come along to say a few words because I thought, “If I don't say anything to you guys tonight probably all you'll know about me this year is the make of the dress I wear for Ed's speech on Tuesday”. ‘That's a side of me the media tend to focus on and I thought it was quite important to reassure you that I am in fact more than a dress.’ The couple met in 2005 and got married in 2011. They have two sons. The environmental lawyer revealed the moment she realised she had fallen for Mr Miliband – while rearranging chairs in a hall in Doncaster. She told delegates: ‘In May 2005, Ed was the prospective parliamentary candidate for Doncaster North. I was his friend. ‘So I went to Doncaster to help him campaign and I was moving chairs around in a hall getting ready for a campaign meeting and I became aware there were three long-standing party members watching me. ‘After a while one of them said to me who was I, so I explained that I was a friend of Ed's and I had come from London to help him campaign. ‘There was a pause and then the lady said to me, “That's a very long way to come to move chairs, are you sure you're just friends?”. ‘She was clearly very astute and realised before we did I think.’ The mother-of-two also told Young Labour members she is willing to help them in the run-up to the 2015 general election before joking: ‘After all you now know I can door-knock, I can move chairs although I guess falling in love at the same time probably gave it a bit of a different dimension. Nonetheless I am ready and willing.’ In 2010, Mr Miliband emerged victorious in the election for Labour Party leader ahead of his brother David. Mrs .

She explained she understood the reasons why he wanted to hold the position after visiting a working men's club in Plymouth for a question-and-answer session. Mrs Miliband said: ‘As I listened to Ed's answers I realised firstly he knew and understood about the lives of the people in that room and secondly that he cared about creating a society that wouldn't feel like it felt to me that day, which was the people there and the bankers and the lawyers around me in London were living in two separate countries. ‘That was it for me. That was the day when I understood why Ed had decided to stand to be leader of the Labour Party, difficult a decision though that was for many reasons, and it was the day when psychologically the day I threw my lot in with Ed and the Labour Party. ‘So, there it is, that's why I'll be on the barricades in 2015 wearing whatever dress the media deem necessary to get us through.’ A Labour party source said this was just the first stage of what will be an increasing effort to raise the profile of the leader’s wife. ‘She is a huge asset to Ed, she is a huge asset to the Labour but she is her own person. She is a career woman with two young children.' ‘She comes across better than him, frankly,’ said another source. Share what you think . The comments below have not been moderated. Englishman, .

Former employee: Scott Kilday, 35, told the Glasgow Employment Tribunal that he found 'bugging' devices hidden in artificial flowers . A senior employee of bra tycoon Michelle Mone walked out after discovering his office had been bugged, an employment tribunal heard. Former director Scott Kilday, 35, said he was 'horrified' after he found a listening device hidden between artificial flowers. It came shortly after he was asked to resign from his post as Operations Director at Miss Mone’s, company, MJM International. Mr Kilday was allegedly told the bug had been planted for 'business strategic reasons'. The former employee made the accusations on the first day of his employment tribunal in which he is claiming unfair dismissal against MJM. The hearing in Glasgow was told how matters became 'difficult' within the lingerie company after Miss Mone split with her husband and business partner Michael in December 2011. Mr Kilday said: 'It all became a bit disjointed and basically there came a time Michelle and Michael could not sit in the room together. 'With both being majority shareholders it was very difficult to get an any decision made, which ultimately was the fall of the business.' Mr Mone eventually left MJM days before another company, MAS Holdings, bought into the business in February this year. Mr Kilday said it was around the same time Miss Mone asked him to resign as a director. He told the tribunal: 'She said that MAS had asked for me to resign as director for the sale of the company to go through. Mr Kilday’s lawyer John McMillan asked: 'What was your reaction?' He replied: 'Obviously I was not particularly pleased, but I acknowledged it with Michelle and afterwards I sought legal advice on my position.' He considered resigning because he did not feel he could trust Miss Mone and set up a meeting with the chairman Eliaz Poleg. Chief Executive: Michelle Mone OBE, pictured, allegedly asked Mr Kidlay to resign as a director at around the same time another company, MAS, had bought shares in the business . But, just days before this meeting, he claimed to have discovered a bug in his office by chance. He said: 'We actually had a tanning product (at the time) and just in front of the plant pot I had samples of this product. 'They were sitting there not in a particularly tidy state. This day when I looked over there were in a tidy state to which I found very unusual. 'I went over, had a look in the pot and saw a cable coming out, which was wrapped around the articifial flowers.' Mr Kilday told his lawyer he was 'horrified' after the discovery and said the only information he could unearth afterwards was that Miss Mone had been signing in late at night to the offices using her husband’s 'swipe in' card. Court: Mr Kidlay told an employment tribunal in Glasgow (pictured) he found the device by chance when items in his office had been tidied without his knowledge . Mr Kilday later confronted an official from MAS, Kanishke Manakkara who denied any knowledge of the bug's existence. But, the tribunal heard it had been accepted  the bug had been set up for 'business strategic reasons' and that it was Mr Poleg who authorised it. Mr MacMillan asked what Mr Kilday did after the discovery and he said: 'I left.' It emerged that Mr Kilday now works for Mr Mone’s company Pendulum Apparel.

The council has struggled to pay for its maintenance for decades - and was planning to knock it down. But according to the government, this 1960s bus garage is a national treasure. In a move that has shocked most of Preston, the building, built in 1969, was today given listed status. Saved: Preston Bus Station has today been made a Grade II listed building by Culture Minister Ed Vaizey . The station, believed to be the second biggest in Europe, can accommodate 80 double decker cars and included 1,100 car parking spaces. Despite its ugly appearance, residents have been petitioning to save the long-standing depo after a survey showed 80 per cent of the Lancashire town feel attached to it. A campaign was launched by English Heritage and the 20th Century Society and after a consultation period, Culture Minister Ed Vaizey announced today that it will be made a Grade II listed building. Listed buildings are protected from demolition as they are categorised as being 'nationally important and of special interest'. Preston City Council, which announced plans to demolish the building to make way for a shopping centre in December 2012, said it was disappointed at the ruling. 'Monster': Council bosses wanted to demolish it last year. It is believed to be Europe's second biggest station . Councillor Peter Rankin, leader of Preston City Council said: 'Obviously it's not the outcome we were hoping for. 'We've always said the bus station is too big, provides relatively poor facilities for bus passengers and costs Preston taxpayers over £300,000 a year to maintain. 'We will have to take some time now to consider the listing decision and the options for moving forward. 'In particular, we need to look at costs and the impact on budgets and how it affects Preston taxpayers. We will work closely with Lancashire County Council as transport authority to consider the next steps.' The council said it took the decision to demolish the building because they estimated it would cost between £17m and £23m to refurbish it and bring it up to modern day standards. The building was first threatened with demolition more than 10 years ago. In 2000, opposition to the demolition led to a failed application for listed building status by English Heritage. National treasure: Despite multiple attempts from the council, the building can never be demolished . Putting forward the case for a smaller station, a report, commissioned by the council and Grosvenor in 2000, stated that 'buses arriving and leaving the bus station have very low bus occupancy rates indicating that passengers alight and board elsewhere in the town centre. The bus station car park similarly suffers from the poor pedestrian linkages.' But a survey conducted by the Lancashire Evening Post in May 2010 found that Preston Bus Station was Preston people's favourite building. Despite further rejected application to list the bus station in 2010 - and a review of the decision was turned down in 2011 - the bus station featured on the 2012 World Monument Fund's list of sites at risk. In 2012, John Wilson of Fulwood in Preston and a member of the Save Preston Bus Station campaign presented a petition of 1,435 signatures to Preston City Council calling for a referendum on the future of the bus station and argued that 80 per cent of Preston people surveyed supported keeping the bus station and investing in it. Campaigner Michael Moulding said: 'If Preston City Council had got its way, Preston Bus Station would be no more. 'It . would have been demolished at vast public expense destroying a building . with clear and distinctive architectural merit which I know the . majority of Prestonians cherish.'

Rolf Harris wore a dark suit and patterned tie at the brief hearing depicted in this court artist sketch by Elizabeth Cook . The TV personality, artist and musician, who has been on screens for more than 50 years, was silent as he faced a barrage of cameras outside court. Harris had to clutch the reinforced glass screen of the dock for support as he made his way into the courtroom. Wearing a dark suit and . patterned tie at the brief hearing, he spoke only to confirm his name, . address and date of birth. In the dock, he appeared bewildered, sitting motionless and ignoring deputy chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot, who twice had to order him to stand. When asked to confirm his name, address and date of birth, he muttered: ‘Rolf Harris’ before hesitating, asking: ‘What was the next one?’ The Australian is accused of groping a 15-year-old girl between April 5, 1980 and April 4, 1981, and indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl in 1986. He is also charged with four offences of making indecent images of a child between March and July 2012. After the law was changed to increased the punishment for offences committed after 1985, he could face up to ten years in jail if convicted. Prosecutor Christine Athanasius said the sentencing powers of the court were ‘insufficient’. She was briefly interrupted when the lights were mistakenly switched off, plunging the courtroom into darkness for a split second, before a security guard switched the power back on. District judge Arbuthnot then referred the case to the crown court for trial, saying: ‘Clearly my powers are insufficient in this case.’ In the meantime, the entertainer and broadcaster has been banned from having unsupervised contact with any children. Throughout the five-minute hearing, . Harris stared straight ahead, glancing only once at the packed public . gallery where his wife, Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen Hughes, sat . quietly with her daughter’s arm around her. As he left court the painter, dressed in a dark suit, remained tight lipped as he fought his way through a media scrum.

Ever been irritated by the music your council plays when you are put on hold waiting to speak to one of its officials? Prepare to be more irritated still – you may be paying for the music through your council tax. Some local authorities are paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for the right to use pop tunes as ‘hold music’. Classic: Tunes by Swedish pop group ABBA were among most played by council phone lines to callers left on hold . They have found that artists such as . Fleetwood Mac, Lionel Richie or the Lighthouse Family are more likely to . keep callers on the line, while classical music encourages more to hang . up. Classical music is much cheaper to use as royalties do not have to be paid to long-dead composers. Freedom of Information requests to 120 town halls revealed that the bill . for contemporary hold tunes runs to hundreds of thousands of pounds. Twelve of the authorities that use pop music spent £300,000 over the . past three years. Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will be appalled that councils are wasting their hard-earned money to pay for hold music when there are plenty of free options available. 'People expect their cash to be spent on essential frontline services, not on this kind of frivolity. Local authorities would do better to ensure that calls get answered rather than wondering how to entertain the residents they leave hanging on the telephone. 'As for the wider issue of the cost of music licences, the rules need to be reviewed as it’s deeply unfair that employers, both in the public and private sector, have to pay huge sums of money just for staff to tune into the radio.' High price: Councils have spent tens of thousands of pounds on royalty fees for music from artists, such as Christina Perri, pictured, to be played on phone lines to callers on hold . Doncaster Council - which was one of the . 120 authorities to respond to the request for information - admitted . spending about £1,000 . a year on hold music, where customers were greeted with ditties by . American popstar Christina Perri and swinger Michael Buble’s I Just . Haven’t Met You Yet. Mayor . Ros Jones said: 'We have only just started using more varied and . up-to-date music for customers to listen to when on hold or waiting for a . response on the phone. 'This . has been done to respond to feedback from customers. We regularly use . feedback to improve the experience of our customers while ensuring a . value-for-money approach.' Most . authorities either use a royalty-free track built into their telephone . service or simply leave their customers waiting in silence. Tragedy: While councils across the country face spending cuts, many still found money to spend on pop music, from bands including the Bee Gees, to pipe down phone lines . Among . them Antonio Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss, . and various pieces by Mozart were played down the telephone to users. Councils . in Haringey, Hertfordshire and Sunderland also used royalty-free . original pieces by playing music from local children and musicians. Councils' favourite: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's music is chosen by the majority of local authorities as an on hold telephone tune . Royalty-free . pieces by classical composers were also popular with councils - with . Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart the most frequently heard artist. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has also been heralded as the king of council hold music, a survey found. The Austrian composer's work was favoured as a means of keeping callers on the line by the majority of 150 councils questioned, according to a Freedom of Information request. Some local authorities discovered more modern easy-listening chart songs - such as Abba and Billy Ocean - dramatically reduced the number of people hanging up. The findings came as no surprise to Mozart expert professor Colin Lawson, director of the Royal College of Music. He . said: 'I think the real reason is Mozart can be listened to at so many . different levels. He is at the top of the classical charts regularly. 'The Mozart phenomenon is an extraordinary thing. 'You . can have Mozart-themed chocolate, ski holidays, tours - he seems to . have a particular resonance for the troubled 21st century.' Selections . from Debussy, Handel and Strauss featured in the data, provided by . around 120 of the authorities contacted under FoI laws by the Press . Association. But it was . Mozart - and his Symphony No 40 and his Eine Kleine Nachtmusik pieces - . which were deemed most suitable by council bosses. The fact that the work is out of copyright, and therefore does not command a fee, may have something to do with the selection. Everywhere - Fleetwood MacPenny Lover - Lionel RichieEasy - Lionel RichieDock Of The Bay - Otis ReddingStars - Simply RedHigh - Lighthouse FamilyOcean Drive - Lighthouse FamilyOne Of Us - AbbaThe Winner Takes It All - AbbaI Say A Little Prayer - Aretha FranklinDon’t Know Why - Norah JonesSay What You Want - TexasI’ll Stand By You - PretendersSuddenly - Billy OceanTime After Time - Cyndi LauperWaiting For A Star To Fall - Boy Meets GirlDreams - Fleetwood MacWhat A Wonderful World - Louis ArmstrongNine Million Bicycles - Katie Melua . But Prof Lawson there were other reasons the popular composer was hand-picked over his contemporaries. 'Symphony No 40 has got a certain passion to it,' he said. 'There is a lot to it and a lot of angst. 'But it is not the whole piece that people recognise, or that it is famous for. It is just the introduction. 'It is very popular with ringtones, another way younger people are able to enjoy his music.' Chart-toppers such as the Lighthouse . Family, Abba and Billy Ocean have been credited with improving customer . satisfaction levels at a local authority - after bosses decided to swap . hold music for taxpayer-funded pop tunes. Lincolnshire County Council said the . number of people who hang up while on hold has more than halved since . piping commercial tracks down the telephone to those in the queue. While most councils opt for . rights-free jingles, classical music or just silence, taxpayers in . Lincolnshire have had tracks by the likes of Cyndi Lauper, Katie Melua . and Simply Red unleashed upon them. Lincolnshire . is one of a handful of authorities to have ditched traditional hold . music in favour of easy-listening chart songs, which require royalty . payments to the Performing Rights Society (PRS). Councillor . Richard Davies, executive member for highways at Lincolnshire County . Council, said: 'People can be kept waiting for a few minutes at peak . times so we use commercial songs for our on-hold music. Quite frankly, . our callers love it. 'It costs just £175 per year and since we introduced it, we have reduced our abandoned call rate by half - from 4,000 calls per month to just 1,600. 'I would, however, like to take this opportunity to apologise for our use of the Lighthouse Family’s Ocean Drive. I accept this was a deplorable lapse in judgement and we deserve all the criticism we get. 'In our defence, it was either that or M People’s Moving On Up.' Stockport . Metropolitan Borough Council pays just over £2,000 annually for playing . all sorts of music, with its telephone system using tracks including .

Samantha Cameron tried to gain access to Sarah Brown's records to copy how to be the perfect Prime Minister's wife, it has emerged. Former No.10 spin doctor Damian McBride said David Cameron's wife wanted to use Mrs Brown's emails, diary and contacts when setting up her private office. But the request was refused, and Gordon Brown's wife's strategy for handling her public profile remained secret. Samantha Cameron (left) has modeled herself on the deeply intelligent, private Sarah Brown (right) Mr McBride writes in his explosive memoir Power Trip about his admiration for Mrs Brown, and the way she stood by Gordon when the pressure of being Prime Minister mounted. 'Over the years, I came to realise that Sarah Brown was a deeply intelligent, private person with a ferocious passion for causes and people close to her heart,' he said. 'To her, Gordon was always the star and, whatever she did to support him, it was always to enhance the story of the day — not become the story herself.' Mr McBride went on: 'When she was . sworn at by the PR supremo Matthew Freud for failing to deliver Gordon . for a photo-stunt with Blair and Rupert Murdoch at Davos, she just . shrugged — because what really mattered to her was what was best for . Gordon and her boys. 'It was . little wonder that when the Tories came into No  10, they asked for . access to her emails, diary and contacts book to study ‘best practice’ for setting up  Samantha Cameron’s private office. 'They . were refused permission. Sarah, however, will always be a tough act to . follow, because — like Michelle Obama — with her, it was never an act.' Class act: Damian McBride paid tribute to Sarah Brown's quiet loyalty to husband Gordon . He has also contrasted Mrs Brown's private loyalty to her husband to Cheri Blair's love of the limelight during the long feud between Mr Brown and Tony Blair. Recalling an incident at a party conference when just as Mr Brown was saying in a speech how great Mr Blair was, Mrs Blair shouted back: ‘Well, that’s a bloody lie.’ Mr McBride added: 'You could argue, of course, that Cherie was only showing loyalty to her husband. 'But unlike Sarah Brown — who was no less fiercely loyal to Gordon — Cherie was never happy unless her loyalty was expressed publicly, with her face all over the papers.'","Samantha Cameron requested access to diary and emails for 'best practice'

"By . Rupert Steiner . PUBLISHED: . 17:56 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:21 EST, 24 September 2013 . Critical: British Airways boss Willie Walsh attacked the prime minister and chancellor at a launch in China . British Airways boss Willie Walsh has launched a highly personal attack on David Cameron and George Osborne, saying they lack vision on the economy and only ‘respond to whatever is topical’. Mr Walsh, who is angered by the delays in making a decision over the future of Heathrow, also accused the Prime Minister and his Chancellor of fostering the image that the lucrative Chinese tourism market isn’t welcome here. The chief executive of International Airline Group, owner of both British Airways and Spain’s Iberia, has previously sparred with the Government over its aviation policy but went a step further yesterday. At the opening of BA’s new route to Chengdu in south central China, he said: ‘I am not a fan of Cameron or Osborne. 'I have no political affiliation. 'I haven’t seen much evidence of visionary leadership there and to me they respond to whatever is topical rather than setting out a long term plan or vision for growth in the UK economy.’ He said he is pleased that there is more optimism about the economy but warned there is a long way to go. ‘If I was Osborne I wouldn’t be popping the champagne corks at this stage,’ he said. ‘There’s little evidence steps  are being taken that are going  to be more conducive to growth, and... We need to see greater optimism, greater visibility and  a bit of vision for the future  and I think that’s lacking.’ The Government has asked Sir Howard Davies to spearhead the Airport Commission to examine capacity in the UK, but Mr Walsh said he believes it is futile. ‘I’ve said all along and I have met Davies twice now that I think he will produce a fantastic report – it has got to be the best report on airports ever seen,’ he said. ‘But nothing is going to happen with it because it will be handed over to politicians who won’t act on it. I still don’t see any prospect of any political party taking hold of the report and actually doing something with it. ‘So I have no criticisms of Davies or what they are doing. But I still don’t see any prospect of any political party taking hold of the report and actually doing something with it.’ He also claimed the Government’s ‘bureaucratic’ approach to issuing visas to Chinese tourists is harming tourism. Trade between the UK and China has been steadily increasing and China is now the UK’s eighth biggest export market. No vision?: David Cameron and George Osborne have just been celebrating what looks like economic success . Mr Walsh wants answers from the government on when a decision will be made on Heathrow's future . He also predicted there will be a raft of European airlines going out of business in the next 12 months . However, Chinese people travelling here – even in transit – need a visa, which is not required if they land in continental Europe. ‘We need a visa regime that it less bureaucratic,’ he said. ‘It is getting better but people need to feel that the UK is actually welcoming them. ‘I think there is a perception in China that the UK does not want to see Chinese tourists and Chinese business and I think we have got to put a bit of effort into changing that image. He said the UK is missing out on a ‘huge opportunity’. He added: ‘We are losing out to organised tour groups in Europe who bypass the UK as it is too much trouble to get two visas. 'I think if we are to be attractive to the high end tourists particularly, in the UK we will have to have more people who can speak Mandarin, speak Chinese and make them feel welcome. ‘Not just at the airports but at major tourists venues as well.’ Mr Walsh has previously said he thinks it is ‘tragic’ that Heathrow will never succeed in getting a third runway because of political failure and that the airport will be left behind by faster growing hubs. He said he believes politicians are not brave enough to grasp this and that Heathrow missed the opportunity of expansion many years ago. He also predicted that there will be a raft of European airlines going out of business over the next 12 months and said he is interested in making some acquisitions but has nothing currently in his sights.

Today Mrs Philpott's mother Vera Duffy stood outside the house where builders were erecting scaffolding before demolition work begins on the house and the one next to it. Mrs Duffy, 55, said: 'I'm just here to see it.  The children will be resting in peace now.' The three-bedroom house, which has been boarded up since firefighters put out the flames of the deadly fire in May 2011, still has withered floral tributes to the children who died pinned to the front door. Mick Philpott was jailed for life with a minimum term of 15 years after being convicted of six counts of manslaughter following a trial at Nottingham Crown Court earlier this year.

Local councillor Baggy Shanker said: 'I think we all welcome the demolition of these properties. 'Whilst the tragic deaths of the six Philpott children will never be forgotten, local people continue to move on and this is symbolic of the end of a very difficult time for the community.' The deadly blaze in May 2012 was started by Philpott with the help of wife Mairead and friend Paul Mosley while their six children were sleeping upstairs. They had hatched an elaborate plot in which Mick would save the children and the fire would be blamed on his estranged partner Lisa Willis, with whom Philpott was locked in a legal battle for custody of the four children they had together. But the idiotic plan went disastrously wrong. Too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of control – leaving Philpott unable to reach the children in temperatures approaching 1,000F.

Tesco has been ordered to pay £57,000 after a 'super mouse' - which had grown twice the size of a normal rodent after feasting on high protein meat- was found gnawing on raw chicken in one if its flagship stores. Health inspectors found the creature at the Covent Garden branch of Tesco in central London. The store had already failed three inspections. In one photo taken by health chiefs the brazen mouse is pictured sitting happily on top of a packet of raw meat. Tesco has been fined £45,000 after a 'super mouse' - which had grown twice the size of a normal rodent after feasting on high protein meat- was found gnawing on raw chicken in one if its flagship stores . It is thought the mouse got so big after gorging on protein such as Hot and Spicy chicken wings, ribs, sausages and chicken legs. And when a crate was removed from the kitchen three live mice jumped onto the floor, a court heard. Inspectors were also 'overcome' by the stench of rotting mice in the store's warehouse when they carried out an inspection in March 2012. And the shop was littered with mouse droppings- with up to 70 found inside the in-store bakery alone. The alarm was first raised on March 21st last year by customers who complained mice were scurrying around the aisles. In the three months prior to that Southwark Crown Court heard pest controllers Rentokil had made 31 visits. However, despite this the store did not hire proper pest control. The store failed a first inspection on March 23rd. And no cleaning had taken place before a second inspection on March 26 following a further complaint by a member of the public. Paul Sharkey, for Westminster City Council which carried out the inspection, said: 'There was extensive evidence of mouse droppings, extensive quantities of raw chicken found in a walk-in fridge which had been gnawed by mice and live mice were seen running from crate to crate of raw meat products. 'There was also evidence of nesting in the insulation of pipe work.' Mr Sharkey said mouse droppings were also found near pastry, on food packaging and at a pick 'n' mix counter. He continued: 'Upon entering a dairy walk-in fridge one of the environmental officers was overcome by a terrible smell which turned out to be a dead mouse. 'Alarmingly bags of chicken were found which were well past their sell by date with no indication that the chicken would not be used for sale.' Tesco claimed that particular chicken was for waste only and never intended for human consumption. However, Mr Sharkey said out of date chicken was stored next to in date meat which still presented a high contamination risk. Rodent droppings were found on the shop floor and on bakery packaging at Tesco Metro in Covent Garden, central London . Food waste was also discovered across the store's warehouse and storage areas, while the floors were covered in grease and dirt . As well as droppings, rodent hairs were also discovered on bags of chicken. As staff had not fixed loose tiles, pipes and doors, mice had access to food crates throughout the Bedford Street store. And poor pest proofing meant the suspended ceiling was often used by mice in the building as 'runways'. After repeated failures to deal with the pest problem, officers forced the branch, which was used by 55,000 shoppers weekly, to close as an emergency measure. It remained shut for 13 days. Tesco later admitted six food hygiene breaches at Westminster Magistrates Court where the maximum fine they could have received was £30,000. But magistrates ruled the offence was so serious it should be sent to the crown court for sentencing as it was 'clear the company had not placed its customers first.' Sentencing the supermarket, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said: 'On March 21 last year a member of the public noticed a mouse in Tesco Metro and reported it to Westminster City Council. 'Two days later two environmental officers visited the store and found a number of unsatisfactory features. 'One might have expected the company to react vigorously but it did not. 'Nothing was done over the weekend when the manager was away and when officers returned on the Monday following a further complaint by a member of the public the situation was the same, if not worse than it had been. 'It is remarkable that something like this could occur within an organisation such as Tesco which has to be so careful with its reputation. 'But I am satisfied it is a local and specified failure of management and one that has been dealt with.' He also ordered the company to pay £11, 822 court costs. As well as droppings, rodent hairs were also discovered on bags of chicken. As staff had not fixed loose tiles, pipes and doors, mice had access to food crates throughout the Bedford Street store . It is thought the mouse got so big after gorging on protein such as Hot and Spicy chicken wings, ribs, sausages and chicken legs . Inspectors were also 'overcome' by the stench of rotting mice in the store's warehouse when they carried out an inspection in March 2012 . The supermarket chain, which was also caught up in the horsemeat scandal, has been fined three times for breaching hygiene standards in the last five years. In October 2008 they were fined £8,000 plus £8,000 in costs after pleading guilty to selling a chocolate caterpillar cake that was unfit for human consumption at a Cardiff store as it had been gnawed by mice. Ipswich Magistrates Court fined the supermarket £17,000 plus £57,000 in February 2010 after it was convicted of eight further food hygiene breaches relating to pest control at its Anson Road branch in Martlesham, Suffolk. And in October 2010 the chain was fined a further £30,000 plus £9,500 costs for selling various items which had been nibbled by rodents at a store in Old Tiffield Road, Northamptonshire. Mark Watson, representing Tesco, said the Covent Garden store's manager had since been replaced and staff retrained. He added: 'I make an unreserved apology on behalf of the company. 'As can be seen from the photos the conditions in the store were unacceptable. 'Its 3,000 stores generally maintain very high standards.' Share what you think .

Cornell University has suspended its entire lacrosse team following allegations of hazing. The alleged hazing happened on September 13 and involved older team members who coerced underage freshman to drink alcohol, according to John Carberry, a spokesman for the school. 'On Sept. 13, the Cornell men's lacrosse team was placed on temporary suspension pending appropriate sanctions for a team hazing incident,' Cornell Athletics director Andy Noel said in a statement released Thursday afternoon. Cornell University has suspended its entire lacrosse team following allegations of hazing. In this May 18, 2013 photo Cornell player Rob Pannell is congratulated by teammates. He is no longer on the team . 'Following investigation into the . incident, Coach (Ben) DeLuca and his team were notified that all fall . competitions are canceled,' he added. 'Effective today, the team will resume training and practice in accordance with sanction guidelines.' The lacrosse team, which went 14-4 last season, was scheduled to play the Iroqois National Team on September 28 in Cortland, New York. Cornell plans to post details on the reported incidents on a website that is devoted to exposing hazing at the school. 'Hazing practices are harmful and antithetical to our values as a university and our commitment to student-athletes,' Noel said. 'They have no place in Cornell athletics.' The lacrosse team, which went 14-4 last season, was scheduled to play the Iroqois National Team on September 28 in Cortland, New York . He said the school plans to work with the team 'intensely in the next days, weeks and months to educate them on the problematic actions and to help them identify appropriate, healthy activities in which they can bond.' 'We need our upperclassmen to model the high level behavior we demand from our student-athletes at Cornell.' Other recent hazing incidents at Cornell, according to the university's hazing website, are detailed below: . Chi Psi Fraternity Interfraternity Council chapter . The school received reports that new members of Chi Psi Fraternity, during the Spring 2013 semester, were hazed by the members of the fraternity. Activities included menial tasks, including chores and other duties and favors for members, such as driving services. They were expected to spend a large amount of time in the basement of the house, where they sometimes ate meals, slept on hard surfaces, and were subjected to repeated loud music and they were required to walk backward when going up stairs. The new members were required to travel to Chi Psi chapters on other campuses where they were demeaned and exposed to mentally/emotionally abusive treatment, including being pressured to consume a concoction of beer and pickle juice meant to mislead them to believe it was urine. Delta Phi Interfraternity Council chapter . The Delta Phi fraternity forced new members and a few current members to take part in what was called a 'safari,' in which the participants ran around the exterior of the fraternity house looking for characters placed in the yard while being sprayed periodically with a garden hose and yelled at by the organizers. This activity took place under winter weather-like conditions. Lambda Theta Phi Multicultural Greek Letter Council chapter . The school received an anonymous report on Feb. 6, 2013, regarding Lambda Theta Phi fraternity events that occurred on Nov. 4, 2012. The allegations of hazing involved 'line-ups', not allowing new members to use public transportation, requiring uniforms to be worn at all times, forcing new members to shave their heads, and limiting the contact new members were allowed to have with people outside of the fraternity. Sigma Lambda Upsilon Multicultural Greek Letter Council chapter . The school received a report from an anonymous person on February 6, 2013, regarding Sigma Lambda Upsilon and activities taking place during the fall 2012 semester.

Guilty: Steven Topham, 36, was sentenced to three years in jail at Teesside Crown Court . A council IT boss who tricked Vodafone into giving him £724,000 - and used the cash to buy a hot tub and a caravan - has been jailed for three years. Steven Topham, 36, manipulated the mobile phone giant's customer credit offer, which rewards you for making purchases. The data network team leader realised he could make orders for Redcar and Cleveland Council, quickly cancel them, and still retain his bonus. Topham, from Middlesborough, then bought more than 1,700 high value phones, which he sold for a mark-up on eBay through an associate in Oldham. He bought a hot tub, sauna, holiday caravan and electrical goods with his earnings - but kept some handsets for himself or to give as presents. The boss also paid off substantial debts and bought theatrical lights which he rented to local productions. The fraud was exposed when Vodafone’s courier company grew suspicious about making a delivery of 32 Samsung Galaxies and an internal inquiry was launched. Police found £15,500 in cash in the boot of his car when they arrested him. Topham pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position at Teesside Crown Court earlier this year. Judge Howard Crowson blasted Topham for breaching the trust of many. He said: 'You set out on what was clearly a professional fraud.' The court heard Topham and his eBay seller would contact each other over the internet and meet in a Teesside lay by to exchange cash. Caught: A Vodafone courier got suspicious delivering 34 Samsung Galaxies to the council worker's home . Breach of position: Topham was a voice and data network team leader at the council in North Yorkshire . He told the hudge he did mot know how many phones he had sold or how much money he had made. Rachel Masters, prosecuting, said after his arrest: 'He regretted what he had done and put it down to his stupidity and greed.' Uzma Khan, defending, said: 'Mr Topham is an utterly remorseful man full of shame. 'Not only because he find himself before the court today, but also for the shame he feels he has brought upon his family, his friends, his colleagues and the effects upon the council and Vodafone.' A proceeds of crime hearing will take place next year. Share what you think . The comments below have been moderated in advance. Geordie1892, . Ryton, Gateshead, . 17 hours ago .

A judge hit out yesterday after discovering that a woman who falsely claimed £94,000 in benefits will clear the debt by using her welfare payments. ‘The taxpayer just ends up paying itself back,’ stormed Beverley Lunt after being told Cleo Embley would draw on her £237-a-week handouts. The judge jailed 37-year-old Embley for 22 weeks, saying the money was not going to be repaid in any meaningful way. Anger: Cleo Embley, left, falsely claimed £43,000 in benefits - but as judge Beverley Lunt, right, pointed out, she will receive State funds to help her pay back her debt . The mother of seven had pocketed extra benefits by claiming she lived alone. But . undercover investigators spotted her handyman partner Paul Harwood . taking their children to school and returning to the home they shared. Between . 2008 and 2012, Embley illegally obtained £94,064 in income support, . housing benefit and council tax benefit. Had she told the truth about . her partner she would instead have been paid £50,955 in tax credits. This means she needs to return around £43,000. When . her lawyer Mark Stuart said his client ‘knows she is going to have to . pay the money back’, Judge Lunt interrupted to say: ‘But she isn’t – the . taxpayer is going to have to pay it back! Trapped by surveillance: Embley, 37, did not tell officials that her boyfriend was living with her when she claimed benefits . ‘She . has defrauded all this money but is entitled, from the state, to more . money! So the state will receive the money, from the money the state is . giving her!’ Embley . started making legitimate claims in 2001, but failed to inform the . benefits system when she moved in with Mr Harwood, who is father of six . of her seven children. Gerald Jones, prosecuting, said: ‘Random . surveillance showed Mr Harwood taking the children to school, returning . with the shopping – effectively living as man and wife.’ Mr . Stuart told Burnley Crown Court that jailing Embley, from Rishton, . Lancashire, would stop her partner working. ‘He would have to look after . the seven children and would have to give up his employment and be in . receipt of benefits,’ said the barrister. Sentence: The fraudster was handed a 22-week prison sentence at Burnley Crown Court, pictured . Embley . broke down in tears in the dock as Judge Lunt rejected this argument, . telling her: ‘Over a period of four years you obtained over £94,000 of . taxpayers’ money you were not entitled to.‘You were not driven by debt or financial need but greed. ‘You took away that which should be given to people who are genuinely in need. ‘These frauds are becoming a very real and common problem. ‘It . is realistically not going to be paid back – and if it is it will come . back from the taxpayer as you are getting benefits still.’ Embley admitted three counts of dishonestly failing to notify a change of circumstances. After . the hearing Joan Smith, deputy leader of Hyndburn Council, said: ‘We . actively pursue people for benefit fraud and we want to give the message . that you are not going to get away with it. 'We . are very good at pursuing information about benefit fraud, which we get . from various sources including members of the public.’ Lord . Freud, who is the minister for welfare reform, said: ‘We are taking on . benefit fraud, with greater resources going to our investigation teams . to stop those people who try to pocket support meant for the most . vulnerable. ‘We have also ramped up our use of powers to claw back money from these cynical criminals.’ In . 2011, Judge Lunt hit out at rules that stopped her jailing salesman . Daniel Blagboro for falsely claiming £12,000 in benefits, saying of the . resulting suspended sentence: ‘Some may think it’s pathetic, and that . includes me.’ In 2008 she refused to spare a Nigerian illegal immigrant’s bogus bride from a jail term even though she was having a baby.

The son of the Cleveland kidnapper has spoken out for the first time since his father's death, saying society should learn from Ariel Castro to better deal with sexual predators, mental illness and domestic abuse. In a letter published in the Cleveland Plain Dealer today, Anthony Castro said his father deserved to serve 'every day' of the 1,000-year sentence that he received for the kidnapping and decade-long rape, torture and beatings of Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus. However, he cautioned that 'justice truly will have been served' only if the country examines and learns from the horrific ordeal. Anthony Castro, right, circa 2001, is seen with his father standing in front of a pad-locked basement door in the Cleveland House of Horrors where Ariel Castro, left, kept his three victims . Behind bars: Ariel Castro, 53, admitted to his crimes and accepted a prison sentence of 1,000 years. He is hanged himself one month later . Anthony Castro, a banker in Columbus and a former journalist, said he has been in hiding since news broke that his father had been arrested for keeping the three young women captive for more than 10 years in May. 'I was horrified and disgusted and angered when I got the news of the unthinkable crimes my father committed. I still am. He deserved to pay for his actions, every day of those 1,000 years he could possibly serve,' he wrote. 'My anger with him kept me from visiting him in prison, even when he was moved to a facility just 20 minutes away from my doorstep.' Ariel Castro hanged himself in his Ohio prison cell September 3 - after just one month after he admitted to his heinous crimes and accepted a sentence that guaranteed he would spend the rest of his life in prison. Recovering: Michelle Knight, left, Amanda Berry, center, and Gina DeJesus, right, have all appeared in public since they were freed - though experts say all will likely bear lasting scars from their ordeal . He was taken to a hospital in Columbus, Ohio, just a few miles from his son's home, where he was pronounced dead. Since Anthony Castro first spoke out to MailOnline, days after news of the heinous crimes came to light, he has denied have any knowledge of his father's double-life and worked to distance the himself and his three sisters from his father. He reiterated those assertions in his letter Sunday, saying he wanted to scream from the rooftops that he was 'not his father.' 'I am not my father, and I can't explain his actions or be held accountable for something I never knew he was doing,' he wrote. Gone: Even the House of Horros on Seymour Avenue have been demolished - leaving little trace of the pain and terror that was inflicted there for a decade . He added, 'I was horrified and disgusted and angered when I got the news of the unthinkable crimes my father committed. I still am.' Anthony Castro described being hounded by the news media and how thieves broke into his apartment and vandalized it after his name surfaced publicly. Still, he says, the demolition of his father's house on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland and Ariel Castro's death should not be cause to 'bid goodbye and good riddance' to his crimes. 'If my father's life and death can lead to changes in how we deal with sexual predators, domestic violence, mental illness and, yes, prison safety, then we should have those discussions,' he wrote. 'If we can prevent a repeat here or anywhere, then justice truly will have been served amid all the broken pieces my father left behind.' Share what you think .

'Missed opportunity': Private Jason Smith died in 2003 from heatstroke following a period of high temperatures in Iraq . Army chiefs missed an opportunity to step in after a Territorial Army soldier died from heatstroke when temperatures rose to above 50C in Iraq, a coroner has said. Private Jason Smith, 32, from Hawick in the Scottish Borders was deployed in June 2003. He collapsed on August 13 that year with a fatally-high body temperature of 41.4C, having repeatedly told medical staff he was feeling unwell. He was taken to hospital but suffered a cardiac arrest and could not be saved. Pte Smith, who serving with the 52nd Lowland Regiment and was assigned to the First Battalion King’s Own Scottish Borderers, was stationed at the Al Marab athletics stadium on the western side of the city of Al Alamarah. The inquest at Oxford Coroner’s Court, the second to be held into Pte Smith’s death, heard conditions were tough in the disused stadium, described as a 'an unbearable, hot, dusty hell hole'. A number of soldiers said they felt unwell because of the conditions, the inquest heard. Assistant coroner for Oxfordshire Alison Thompson, recording her findings at the end of the five-day hearing, said: 'When climatic conditions deteriorated in August and the number of heat casualties increased, there was a missed opportunity to intervene.' She added that those in charge of the soldiers could have 'become more rigorous in monitoring individuals' when temperatures soared, making sure they were treated for their symptoms and had enough rest. In her narrative conclusion, she described the circumstances as: 'Death on active service overseas, involving a high tempo of operations in extreme temperatures, the risk of which would have been reduced by adherence to the then policy on heat illness, in terms of climatic monitoring, hydration, medical treatment and casualty reporting, and by the availability of air-conditioned accommodation and vehicles.' However, she added that it was not . possible to prove that those factors 'specifically caused, or there was a . direct causal link, between them and Private Smith’s sad death.' Loss: 'Grafter' Private Smith, pictured, and his fellow troops did not have air conditioning and were given 'inconsistent' information on hydration, the inquest heard . Temperatures were at their seasonal maximum, and it became hot enough to fry eggs on a Land Rover in the days before Pte Smith collapsed, his commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Cattermull, who was a Major at the time, told the hearing. Soldiers also faced a 'punishing regime' of working long hours, he added, with the inquest told there was only one medic to take care of 100 men. Their accommodation was not air conditioned at the time of Pte Smith’s collapse. Air conditioning units arrived there two days after his death. Mrs Thompson found that advice and information on hydration given to the soldiers serving in such arduous conditions was 'inconsistent' and 'inadequate', but noted it had been stressed to them that drinking enough water was of utmost importance. She also said that medics had not been given forms to record reports of heat illness, and that not all medical consultations were recorded. The day before he died, Pte Smith reported to the Army medic with heat exhaustion and was advised to rest. That evening, he was deployed to a power station where he spent six hours in air-conditioned premises. The coroner said: 'The following day, he deployed twice to a petrol station but, before he was stood down at about 3pm, had spent some time in intense heat inside a Saxon vehicle in full sun.' She added that the time inside the vehicle was most likely the 'tipping point' that led to Pte Smith’s deterioration. Temperatures: The inquest, heard at Oxford Coroner's Court, pictured, heard how it was hot enough to fry eggs on a Land Rover at the time of the soldier's death . The . inquest had also been told Pte Smith had been deemed fit for his role . in Iraq and that the fact he had a relatively high body mass index of 34 . would not have played a role in his death. He had also acclimatised to conditions in Iraq by spending 10 days in Kuwait ahead of deployment, and his body had 'adapted reasonably well', Mrs Thompson said. Pte Smith was described by Army colleagues as a 'grafter' who never shirked his duties. Mrs Thompson told his mother: 'It is important to realise what an important job he was doing, in these near-to-impossible conditions.' She also noted that heat illness is now dealt with in a different way by the Army, adding that it was a 'changed world in terms of soldiering in heat in the last 10 years'. At the original inquest in 2006, assistant deputy coroner for Oxfordshire Andrew Walker recorded that Pte Smith’s death was caused 'by a serious failure to recognise and take appropriate steps to address the difficulty that he had in adjusting to the climate'. Verdict: Coroner Alison Thompson, pictured, said that those in charge of the soldiers could have 'become more rigorous in monitoring individuals' in the extreme heat . A second inquest was ordered by the . Supreme Court in 2010 after Pte Smith’s mother Catherine successfully . applied for a new public hearing, complying with the European Convention . on Human Rights. Mrs . Smith, a grandmother-of-three, said she was glad to have fought for a . second inquest on the grounds that the Human Rights Act should apply to . troops serving abroad, but now it was over she could finally grieve the . loss of her son. Speaking after the inquest, Mrs Smith said: 'I can live again, basically. I can now grieve, actually, and let it go. 'When it’s been ongoing, you just can’t do that. It’s always on your mind. 'And I’ve heard things that have actually made me even more proud of my son from people, that I didn’t know before.' Mrs Smith said she was pleased with the conclusion given by the coroner, adding that risks could have been avoided and that there had been 'a lack of following their own protocol'. Mrs Smith said there had been failures . ahead of her son’s death in terms of the approach to heat-related . illness, saying: 'In the situation they went into, it’s something they . didn’t predict, which possibly should have been predicted because of the . time of year they were going in.' While the struggle to get all the answers has been long, Mrs Smith said it had been worth it. She said: 'I feel I can now say I’ve done what I can to prevent it happening to other families. Describing her son, who had been in the Territorial Army for 10 years and had completed a mechanics course shortly before his death, she said: 'Jason wanted to do what he wanted to do. He went out there to help people, which he did. 'I never had anything against him doing what he wanted. It just so happened he was the one that didn’t come back with the group.' The coroner, who praised Mrs Smith for her 'forbearance', also told her at the end of the hearing: 'It’s been a long journey for you. I know nothing I say will replace the loss of Jason. 'I just hope it’s been of some help in this hearing to hear from his mates, who weren’t there at the first inquest, and to realise, hearing from them, how Jason was so, so valuable to the team.'

The family of a pensioner with . Alzheimer's, who was handcuffed by police at a care home and treated . like a 'common criminal', have described the officers responsible as 'brutish'. Frail Keith Hyrons, 76, had been checked in to Howbury House care home in Malvern, Worcestershire, to give his full-time carer wife, Val, a break. But less than 12 hours later, both Mrs Hyrons and her and son Leighton had to rush back to the home, where they found their loved-one with his arms behind his back, wearing handcuffs and in agony. The retired BT worker was left with red sores on his wrists following the distressing ordeal and they say his condition has deteriorated since the incident on September 4. Earlier today, Mrs Hyrons, who has been married to her husband for 55 years, fumed: 'It’s disgusting. 'The police treated him like a common criminal, handcuffing his hands behind his back. 'My husband has had childish tantrums in the past, but I’ve always been able to calm him down. 'We had left him in the care of professionals who are trained and paid to care for dementia patients. 'It’s terrible that he was treated like this, he must have been really frightened. 'It was just awful. There were two of them as well and just one of him - he had no family with him at the time.' Mrs Hyrons, said when her son spoke to one of the officers involved on the telephone after the incident, he was told the police were within their rights. She claims they then fobbed him off saying 'we have got better things to do'. Mrs Hyrons added: 'Their approach was unnecessarily brutish and completely uncalled for. 'Since the incident my husband has got worse. If you move towards him now he becomes agitated, as if he thinks you are going to do it again. 'That is what makes me so angry. I want him to come home, and hopefully I’ll be able to look after him as long as I can.' Mrs Hyrons has now called for police to receive better training for dealing with people with dementia or mental health issues. She . added: 'I haven’t got a lot of faith in the police any more. If they . see a common criminal they run a mile but a 76-year-old man with . Alzheimer’s they go and handcuff. 'I think they aren’t trained well enough to deal with people with dementia and similar issues. Furious: Mr Hyrons's wife Val (pictured here on the left alongside her daughter, Lara Waldon) has accused West Mercia Police of 'brutish' behaviour . 'I don’t think I should have to demand an apology from the police but I haven’t had one or spoke to them since and I don’t expect to get one. 'I want to speak out to make people with family members in similar situations aware what can happen.' Fitness instructor Leighton, 40, added: 'Dad had been assessed by social workers in the run up to this respite, to make sure he was taken somewhere that could deal with his needs. 'When we dropped him off the place seemed nice and friendly. But just a few hours later I got a call from his social worker saying he was upsetting some of the residents. 'She assured us that she would deal with it. But then at 5am I received a call from the care home telling me that they had called the police to restrain my father. 'They obviously got the assessment completely wrong when it came to my father.' Mr Hyrons was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s five years ago. Assessment: Mr Hyrons was considered suitable for Howbury House, but just 12 hours after being admitted staff called the police when the pensioner became agitated . Alzheimer’s Society area manager David Ash also criticised the police’s approach and accused them of 'abusing' the pensioner. He said: 'Any case of abuse against a person with dementia is absolutely appalling. The most vulnerable people in our society should be treated with respect and dignity. 'Our care system in the UK is broken and underfunded. We need to have a debate on how to ensure appropriate care is in place for people with conditions such as dementia. 'We also need a regulatory system in place focused on supporting care homes to actively improve standards. 'People with dementia can sometimes exhibit extreme agitation, particularly in times of stress. 'It is vital that all staff who come into contact with people with dementia are given the skills and training to be able to spot the reasons behind these behaviours, so they can address them and hopefully reduce them.' Yesterday West Mercia Police defended the use of handcuffs on the pensioner, who was sectioned for 28 days after the incident. Insp Steph Brighton said: 'Officers were called to a care home in Malvern in the early hours of September 4, due to concerns about the behaviour of a 76-year-old man who was there for respite. 'Officers were aware he had dementia and other health problems but he was being extremely aggressive and it was necessary to handcuff him to prevent him from harming himself, other residents, and staff. 'He was subsequently sectioned under the Mental Health Act and moved from the home. The family has not raised any issues with us.' A spokesperson for Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust said 'If someone with Alzheimer’s is detained under the act then we will always ensure they are taken to the most appropriate setting where they can access the expert care and treatment they need.' Worcestershire County Council, which runs the care home, declined to comment.","The family of a dementia sufferer have slammed police for 'brutish' actions .

Amanda Knox has revealed she still wants to meet the parents of murdered Meredith Kercher and visit her grave - just days before a fresh trial against her begins. Knox, 26, spoke out in an interview with Italian glossy weekly Oggi in which she again stressed her innocence and insisted that refusing to show up at the hearing was not a 'admission of guilt'.' The American was initially convicted of murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29, in 2009. 'Abyss of pain': Amanda Knox said an 'abyss of pain' stands between her and Meredith Kercher's family but she one day wants to visit the grave of her murdered friend with Meredith's parents . Two years later they were sensationally cleared but last Mach Italy's Supreme Court ordered a fresh trial which is due to begin in less than two weeks. In her interview with Oggi, Knox spoke in front of a camera on the side of a hill overlooking her home town of Seattle, dressed in a blue T shirt, ear rings and wearing little make up she appeared tense as she answered questions under a steel grey sky. She said: 'Contact the Kerchers? I haven't yet tried. There is this abyss of pain that separates us, that has grown during the trial, I haven't had the courage to cross it. Millions of times I've thought about it and millions of times in my own way I haven't done it because I am scared that they will think it a legal strategy or a media one. 'I don't want them to think of me like that. I read what they said about the trial, about Meredith. I've read John Kercher's (Meredith's father) book. I was absorbed and annihilated by the trial, by prison. 'I still don't have the strength to cry, to digest the loss of Meredith. I would like to meet them, one day I would like to go with them to the grave of my friend. Hitting back: Raffaele Sollecito, who was accused of murdering Meredith Kercher, says the police's handling of his case was 'incompetent'. He claims he was blackmailed into framing Amanda Knox for the crime . Accused: Sollecito says he refused to comply with what police were suggesting because of his 'fondness' for Knox, pictured, and he wrote a letter from his prison cell to his family insisting he would stand by her . Close: Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito can be seen kissing in Italy shortly after they had been named as suspects in the murder of Miss Kercher . 'I don't want to impose myself on their pain, I hope that I can meet them halfway, even if for now it is too early, they still think I am guilty and that is something that hurts me a great deal.' Meredith was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house that she shared with Knox and two Italian woman, in Perugia in November 2007. Knox and her then boyfriend Sollecito were arrested just days later and charged with murdering and sexually assaulting the student from Coulsdon, Surrey,who had only been in Italy for two months when she died. Tragic: Meredith, 21, was killed in 2007. Sollecito and Knox were both convicted of her murder in 2009 and then cleared . Their first trial ended in 2009 with Knox being given 26 years jail, while Sollecito, got 25 years - however in 2011 an appeal court overturned the verdict after it emerged that forensic police had bungled in gathering the evidence against them and as a result it was considered flawed and unreliable. In March Italy's Supreme Court rejected that ruling and ordered a fresh trial which will begin in Florence and Knox explained why she would not be going. 'I am trying to rebuild my life. I have only one, I cannot risk exposing it to danger and another injustice. I don't have the money to go back to Italy. 'Not going back is an admission of my innocence, it is not an admission of guilt. There is always the fear of another unjust verdict. 'I still have faith in Italian justice. That's why I am still here fighting. There is no trace of me in that room, in the room where my friend was killed. It is impossosble that I could have taken part in such a situation and not exist in that room, that is the proof of my innocence which has been ignored. 'The proof of innocence is the fact that there is no trace of me in that room, I would ask anyone to answer logically, to prove how you can take part in a murder, an orgy, where I supposedly have the murder weapon in my hand and not leave a trace. 'This is proof of my innocence and it is being ignored but I have faith that if people look at this logically without any prejudice they will see I had nothing to do with this. 'They have robbed me of four years of my life, everything that I could say I said in a hundred court hearings, everything that I possessed, happiness, ingenuity, faith in others, was taken away. I was a little girl when they threw me in jail - now I feel as if I am 40 years older than I am.' Victim: The pair were found guilty in December 2009 of murdering Meredith Kercher but after an 11-month appeal both convictions were thrown out in October 2011 . Knox insisted: 'I did not kill Meredith. I did not kill my friend and I even thought about going to Florence because it drives me mad to think that someone can puff out their chest and point their finger at my empty chair and stain me with a crime that I didn't commit. 'I can understand that you can try and build up an allegation, a conviction, even if there is no damning proof and no motive but they have really exaggerated against me.' Knox also revealed how she had been to see a psychologist and said: 'I've been twice, my mother insisted on it. I didn't want to go because I had been seen by the psychologists in jail and I can't say they helped much, they just wanted to fill me with anti depressants. 'The first time I went I couldn't say a word. The second time I spoke for 15 minutes solid and at the end I had a panic attack. I couldn't and I still can't, get rid of all the sadness and of the sensation of feeling trapped. Fear: Sollecito, left, said his former girlfriend Amanda Knox, right, was 'out of contol' after their arrest . 'I feel like one of those animals that is hunted by a bigger animal. After I was cleared I thought everything would be OK, that things would have returned to what they were like before, happy, carefree. I tried to convince myself that everything was going well, that it was just a question of time and that the sadness would pass. 'But it didn't pass, the sadness went on, the months slipped past and I was still freaked out, exhausted. Now I have accepted this limbo, even if perhaps I will go back to the psychologist - not even writing my book cured me.' November,  2007  - Meredith Kercher is found dead in Perugia, ItalyOctober, 2008 - Rudy Guede convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering KercherDecember 2009 . - Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito found guilty of murdering Miss . Kercher. Miss Knox sentenced to 26 years in prison and Mr Sollecito to . 25. October 2011  -  After an 11-month appeal both convictions were thrown outMarch 2013 - Italy’s highest criminal court ruled that an appeals court must re-hear the case against Miss Knox and Mr Sollecito . She added: 'I can understand the investigators. They were under pressure, they had to find the guilty ones quickly. On my part they got a rapid and wrong idea from my behaviour, my presumed coldness and they decided that I had something to do with the murder, they didn't know exactly what but in some way I was involved, I was guilty and I deserved jail. 'I'm very angry with the prosecutor Giuliano Mignini and the investigators but I will forgive them instantly if they admit their mistake. 'They don't have to say sorry, just that they regret it. I don't want revenge. I would feel such a relief if Mignini admitted he made a mistake. To say that I was innocent would signify that not only had a mistake been made but a mistake had been made on top of another and another to cover up a whole bunch of mistakes. 'The investigators, the judges, don't want to admit this to themselves and to the public...it's all a question of reputation but justice is made up of human beings and human beings can make mistakes.' Knox also spoke of Sollecito in her interview and confirmed what he had told the magazine last week that she was inexperienced in bed and said: 'Certainly I would have preferred him to protect my privacy. I do all I can to be close to him, we speak all the time, I encourage him, I tell th whole world that he is innocent. 'He knows that we have lived through a nightmare. He knows that I can count on him and he can count on me. How can going back help him? He is suffering more than me in all this - the unjustified conviction, they media and the prosecution it's all being carried out by his country, his people but I have no power. I am simply his friend, a proud friend.' The Kercher family lawyer has slammed Knox and Sollecito's decision not to attend the fresh trial which is expected to last until November with a verdict due by the end of the year. Drifter Rudy Guede, 26, was convicted of murdering and sexual assaulting Meredith in 2008 after a fast track trial and originally sentenced to 30 years, this was later reduced to sixteen and he could be freed on parole by 2016.

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 19:08 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:08 EST, 23 September 2013 . Four senior doctors who presided over the deaths of hundreds of patients from neglect at Mid Staffordshire hospitals have been let off without punishment. The General Medical Council said last night it was closing the cases because there was not enough evidence that they had done anything wrong. The decision means not a single doctor involved in the scandal has been struck off or suspended. Four senior doctors who presided over the deaths of hundreds of patients from neglect at Mid Staffordshire hospitals have been let off without punishment . So far only three nurses have been struck off, and only one manager, Kate Levy, head of legal services, sacked. She was then awarded £100,000 for unfair dismissal. ‘It is appalling and frightening – it confirms what many members of the public have always feared,’ said Ken Lownds, who has campaigned on behalf of Mid Staffordshire victims. ‘What sort of message does this send to doctors? “Don’t worry, whatever you do or don’t do in a management role, you have nothing to fear.” ’ Up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at the trust between 2005 and 2009 in one of the worst NHS care scandals. The GMC initially investigated 43 doctors over poor care at Mid Staffordshire, but just two have been given warnings and the rest have escaped without punishment. Julie Bailey, 53, set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother Bella died at the trust in 2007. She said it was dreadful news . One is still having his case considered by the GMC, but relatives fear he, too, will be let off. Yesterday’s decision involved the most senior doctors from Mid Staffordshire – two former medical directors, Dr Valerie Suarez and Dr John Gibson, their deputy, Dr David Durrans, and the medic in charge of the trust’s disastrous A&E unit, Dr Diarmuid Mulherin. Julie Bailey, 53, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother Bella died at the trust in 2007, said: ‘It’s dreadful news. I’m so disappointed that no one is being held to account. This decision just exposes the failure of the GMC’s processes and it’s further evidence that it isn’t fit for purpose. It sends a huge signal to anyone in the NHS that it doesn’t matter what they do – they will escape without punishment.’ The GMC said it had been advised by one of the senior barristers involved in the public inquiry into the scandal, Tom Kark QC, that there is ‘no realistic prospect’ of securing a finding against the four doctors whose cases were dropped yesterday. Niall Dickson, the watchdog’s chief executive, said: ‘There is not the evidence to establish either misconduct or impairment against any of the doctors. 'We know many of those who saw and experienced the appalling care at the trust feel badly let down and frustrated that no one is taking responsibility for what happened. ‘However, the law is clear: we can only prosecute a doctor if there is sufficient evidence of that individual’s wrongdoing.’ In July, the Nursing and Midwifery Council barred Mid Staffordshire nurses Sharon Turner and Tracey White from practising for undermining the public’s faith in the profession. Another nurse, Ann King, was struck off last week. The NMC is still deciding on the fate of Jan Harry, who was director of nursing from 1998 to 2006. Share what you think .
