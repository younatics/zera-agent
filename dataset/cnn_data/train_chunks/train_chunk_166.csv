"(CNN) -- Over the past weekend, Gov. Jerry Brown of California took to the safety of YouTube to reveal that the Golden State's budget deficit is now $15.7 billion, far greater than the original $9.2 billion estimate in January. California state taxes, already some of the highest in the nation, brought in an anemic 20% less revenue than expected in April, causing California's deficit to nearly double in only four months. On Monday, Brown released a revised budget plan. California Dreamin' it may be better known as. Brown's budget calls for new spending cuts, to which state workers have yet to agree; even higher taxes, at which voters may balk; and rosy revenue assumptions, which already came up massively short in April. The new deficit strategy relies heavily on higher taxes: Raising the state sales tax from 7.25% to 7.5% and hiking income taxes on those making more than $1 million from 10.3% to 13.3%, the highest rate of any state. Although he calls his plan a ""millionaire's tax,"" it would also boost rates on incomes starting at $250,000. Brown's now famous explanation -- ""Anybody who makes $250,000 becomes a millionaire very quickly, if you save"" -- illustrates well the calamity that is California economics today. If Brown's plan fails, again, he would institute an automatic $5.5 billion cut to public and higher education. California's children shouldn't be punished for the mistakes of adults, nor should its residents be forced to choose between tax hikes and education cuts to try and solve their budget problems. California should look to Wisconsin. Gov. Scott Walker closed a large budget hole without raising taxes or cutting education but by going straight to one of the roots of the problem -- public employee unions. Last summer, Walker required union members to contribute 5.8% of their pay toward pensions and 12.6% of their health insurance premiums, while also reforming collective bargaining agreements for government workers. At first glance, Walker's reforms appeared to be political suicide. But as the returns come in, and schools aren't closing, draconian cuts aren't being made and taxes aren't getting higher. Walker's success leaves his opponents with little ammunition. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, Walker's Democratic opponent in the June recall election, hardly mentions Walker's union reforms anymore. With Walker opening a lead in recent polls, top Wisconsin Democrats are angry that the Democratic National Committee is unwilling to invest heavily to recall him. Wisconsin recently reported that property tax bills for the median homes fell by 0.4% in 2011, the first drop in more 13 years. In January, Baldwin-Woodville School District reported a $100,000 budget surplus thanks to Walker's reforms. And in Kaukauna School District, school officials say the pension and health care reforms will transform their $400,000 budget deficit into a $1.5 million surplus. In Chief Executive's annual survey of the Best and Worst States for Business, Wisconsin jumped from 41st place in 2010 to 24th place in 2011 and bumped up to 20th place in 2012. California, once again ranked dead last, is begging for similar public pension and health reforms. California state teachers are the highest paid teachers in the country, with an average salary of $68,000. The typical pension plan allows them to retire after 30 years with 75% of their salary intact. It's no coincidence that the California State Teachers Retirement System has a $65 billion unfunded liability. Brown has introduced pension reform, but it's been shelved for the past six months. Senate leader Darrell Steinberg and Democratic leaders have yet to commit to any increase in retirement age or pension contributions. Until California addresses comprehensive pension reform, the state will continue to sink deeper into debt. Even Democrats in Rhode Island, New Jersey and Illinois are pushing through pension reform. There may eventually be hope for California. But, in the words of Winston Churchill, only after they've tried everything else. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","Gov. Jerry Brown of California faces a budget deficit of nearly $16 billion .

"(CNN) -- You've heard of snakes on a plane, now here come bugs on a plane. A North Carolina couple is suing AirTran Airways, alleging that cockroaches crawled out of air vents and overhead carry-on bins during a flight from Charlotte to Houston in September. Attorney Harry Marsh and his fiancÃ© Kaitlin Rush say the insects appeared soon after takeoff, and when Marsh pointed them out to flight attendants, they did nothing to help. ""These roaches and other pests caused great distress to a number of passengers throughout the flight,"" the complaint states. All paying guests of the airline are entitled to ""clean, pest-free"" accommodations, it goes to to say. The couple accuses AirTran of negligence and recklessness, infliction of emotional distress, nuisance, false imprisonment and unfair and deceptive trade practices, and is suing for more than $100,000 plus the price of their tickets. In a response to the complaint filed with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, AirTran denies most of the allegations. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin predicted the case would never go to trial. ""This is a case that's going to settle. Bottom line, I foresee a lot of free flights for this couple if they want to get back on AirTran,"" Hostin said. ""It's certainly not a pretty picture. The roaches were out long enough for them to take video and photographs, so that's exhibit A.""","Couple alleges cockroaches crawled out of air vents and overhead bins during flight .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's government has evidence Russia was involved in the mysterious poisoning death of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who was at that time working for British and Spanish intelligence services, a lawyer has said. The allegation emerged at a hearing Thursday in London ahead of an inquest into Litvinenko's 2006 death that is due to start in May. In Britain, an inquest is an inquiry held where a death is sudden or unexplained to establish the facts around it. Read more: Russian magnate wins libel case over poisoning report . Litvinenko, a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle-blower on the FSB, the KGB's successor. He died at a London hospital November 23, 2006, after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium-210. In a deathbed statement, he blamed Putin, an accusation the Kremlin has strongly denied. The counsel to the inquest, Hugh Davies, said evidence provided by the UK government ""does establish a prima facie case as to the culpability of the Russian state in the death of Alexander Litvinenko."" Read more: FBI releases Russian spy trove . The confidential government material does not, however, support the idea that the British government itself killed Litvinenko, he said. Nor does it suggest that fellow Kremlin critic Boris Berezovsky, the Spanish mafia or other organized crime groups are to blame, Davies added. Prosecutors in London want Russia to extradite Andrei Lugovoi, suspected in the killing, but Russia has repeatedly refused to do so. Lawyer Ben Emmerson, acting for Litvinenko's widow Marina, told the hearing that Litvinenko was working for the British intelligence service MI6 and had been tasked by MI6 with working also for the Spanish intelligence service as it investigated Russian mafia activities in Spain. Litvinenko had an MI6 handler known only as ""Martin,"" whom he would meet in central London, he said. Payments, both from MI6 and from the Spanish intelligence services, were made directly into the joint bank account held by Litvinenko and his wife, Emmerson said. Read more: Washington and Russia agree to swap intelligence gatherers . While ill in hospital Litvinenko called Lugovoi about a planned trip together to Spain, a phone call that was witnessed by his wife, Emmerson said. The men were both to provide intelligence to the Spanish prosecutor investigating Russian mafia links to the Kremlin and to Putin, he said. Emmerson also questioned whether the British government did enough to protect Litvinenko from threats to his safety in light of his relationship with MI6. Russia's Investigative Committee has confirmed that it wants to be involved in the process as an ""interested party,"" the state-run RIA Novosti news agency said Friday. If Russia becomes an interested party, its representatives will be allowed to cross-examine witnesses and study the evidence, it said. A statement on the website of the Russian Embassy in London said the Investigative Committee's involvement would help the inquest ""in securing the all-sided, comprehensive and objective consideration of the case."" The committee, a federal agency, is carrying out its own investigation into the circumstances of Litvinenko's death in Russia, the statement said. Read more: Putin: UK spy row is 'mini-crisis' Emmerson told the hearing, held before high court judge Sir Robert Owen, that he and Litvinenko's widow were keen for Russia to have interested party status.

"Chicago (CNN) -- A day after 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton was laid to rest -- and 11 days after she was shot to death on the streets of Chicago -- police are questioning two people in relation to her slaying, a police spokeswoman said. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called Hadiya's family on Sunday morning to tell them about the development in the investigation, said Chicago police spokeswoman Melissa Stratton. No one has been arrested or charged yet in Hadiya's death, which occurred a week after she performed at President Barack Obama's second inauguration. She was an honor student and band majorette at King College Prep School when a man shot her at a park in what her godfather, Damon Stuart, described as an ""ideal community"" on Chicago's South Side. Police have told CNN affiliates that the teenager had no gang affiliation and likely was not the intended target. Hadiya's performance at last month's inauguration and her death coming as the gun control debate brewed in Washington made her slaying a national story. She also was a standout student who urged friends to stay away from gangs. The killing -- which occurred in the city's Hyde Park neighborhood near the Obamas' Chicago home -- drew the first couple's attention. First lady Michelle Obama attended Hadiya's funeral Saturday, and her husband wrote a note to Hadiya's family that was printed on the funeral program: ""We know that no words from us can soothe the pain, but rest assured that we are praying for you, and that we will continue to work as hard as we can to end this senseless violence."" Her slaying -- the 42nd in the city this year -- also highlighted the problem of gun violence in Chicago. More than 500 people were fatally shot in 2012. CNN's Katherine Wojtecki reported this story from Chicago, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote it from Atlanta.","Chicago's mayor told Hadiya Pendleton's family about two being questioned, police say .

"(CNN) -- When Thurgood Marshall retired from the U.S. Supreme Court in June 1991, a reporter asked him what were the medical reasons that contributed to his leaving the bench -- and its lifetime appointment -- after serving for nearly 25 years. He was his usual blunt self. ""What's wrong with me?"" Marshall said at the packed news conference. ""I'm old. I'm getting old and falling apart."" When the news broke this week that Pope Benedict XVI was stepping down as the spiritual leader of 1.2 billion Roman Catholics because of his concerns about being able to do the job, many began to speculate that there were other reasons for the decision. We have become accustomed to a pope dying in office. That's not a surprise. It has been nearly 600 years since the last pope, Gregory XII, quit in 1415. Even though the job of pope is a lifetime appointment, frankly, it is selfish of any individual to hold on to the job for dear life, knowing full well they don't have the capacity to do the job. ""Strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me,"" according to a statement from Pope Benedict released by the Vatican. Whether we want to be honest or not, it was sad to watch the decline of Pope John Paul II. He was a vibrant figure when he became pope in 1978, traveling the world and spreading the gospel to anyone who would listen. But toward the end of his life in 2005, he was barely able to move or talk, clearly worn down by significant health challenges. Any leader who respects the organization they serve should have the common sense to know when it's time to say goodbye. We've seen countless examples of CEOs, pastors, politicians and others hang on and on to a position of power, hurting the very people they were elected or chosen to serve. It takes considerable courage for anyone to step away from the power bestowed upon them by a position, as well as the trappings that come with it. I'll leave it to others to try to figure out other reasons behind the resignation. But we should at least acknowledge the value of an ego-less decision that reflects humility and concern about the very institution the pope pledged his life to. All leaders should be concerned about their institution continuing to grow and thrive once their days are no more. That's why a proper succession plan is vitally important. Too often we have assessed great leaders by what they did in their positions. But their final legacy really is defined by how they left a place. Pope Benedict XVI knows full well the Catholic Church cannot grow and prosper if its leader is limited in traveling and attending to his flock. There comes a time when one chapter must end and another begins. He has more days behind him than in front of him. He should enjoy his last years in peace and tranquility, without having to worry about trying to do the work designed for a younger man. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Pope Benedict stuns world by announcing he will resign .

"(EW.com) -- When an album reaches the top of the Billboard 200 in its first week, there's only One Direction it can go. After making history as the first artists to have their debut album bow at No.1, the British boy band One Direction ceded the top spot this week to the star-packed ""Hunger Games"" soundtrack. Dubbed as a ""companion"" to the Jennifer Lawrence-led cinematic juggernaut (most of the songs don't actually appear in the film), the album sold a whopping 175,000 copies, becoming the first theatrical soundtrack to debut atop the chart since Michael Jackson's ""This Is It"" back in 2009. Of course, the ""Hunger Games"" soundtrack was certainly bolstered by its enviable roster of artists, which includes Taylor Swift, the Arcade Fire, and Maroon 5 -- just to name a few. The movie itself grossed $155 million in its first weekend. So how steeply did One Direction's ""Up All Night"" fall? The album clocked in at No. 4 with 55,000 units moved (a 69 percent drop from last week's 175,000) -- bested by, yep, Adele's ""21"" (No. 2, with 130,000) and the Shins' ""Port of Morrow"" (which debuted at No. 3, with 75,000). Rounding out the top five is Odd Future's major-label debut ""The OF Tape Vol. 2,"" selling a hearty 40,000 in its first week. As for the rest of the list: Bruce Springsteen's ""Wrecking Ball"" fell to No. 6 with 37,000; Melanie Fiona's ""The MF Life"" posted a respectable 34,000 in its first week, placing it at No. 7; and ""Now 41"" (No. 8, with 31,000), Whitney Houston's ""Greatest Hits"" (No. 9, with 29,000), and Esperanza Spalding's ""Radio Music Society"" (No. 10, with 25,000 in its debut week) round out the rest of this week's top 10.

"(CNN) -- The images of seals being harassed on a California beach are perplexing and disturbing. In the middle of the night, two women sit on harbor seals, kick them or pull their flippers, all the while snapping flash pictures. The animals eventually flee into the water. A newly installed video camera captures that attack and others on the seals, who have been using the beach at Children's Pool in La Jolla for decades. Sara Wan of the Western Alliance for Nature said her organization installed the camera after years of people who are opposed to the seals' presence on the beach being cruel to the animals, trying to scare them off the sand. ""One of the things we found with the camera is it shows what we knew was going on before,"" she says. ""Now people are seeing what is going on and saying, 'You're right, that's wrong.'"" San Diego Mayor Bob Filner placed a sunset to sunrise curfew on the beach, saying people can disagree about how a beach should be used, but they cannot abuse animals, CNN affilate KGTV reported. The restrictions end May 15 after pupping season is over. The beach was a popular spot for parents to take their children for a safe place to swim, but harbor seals took over the beach in the early 1990s, KGTV said. Beach-access advocates want the area returned to its original use, the station reported. Because most cases of animal abuse or neglect are never reported, it is difficult to say whether the number of incidents are increasing. But with enhanced technology and social media, some of the most egregious cases have recently caught the attention of the media. There were cases where people apparently were ignorant of the law, such as the woman in Florida who rode a manatee, and other more serious ones where people showed wanton disregard for wildlife, as in the case of two sea birds found struggling to breathe after someone forced beer cans over their heads. In December, at least 10 dead dolphins washed up on beaches in the Gulf Coast. Some were shot, while others were stabbed. It makes you wonder, what is wrong with people? ""I really don't understand how someone can be deliberately cruel to an animal like that. It's really baffling,"" says Sharon Young, marine issues field director with the Humane Society of the United States. ""They know it's illegal, they know it's wrong."" Studies have shown that people who have little or no empathy for animals often have none for other humans, activists say. Animal cruelty is a crime that mostly goes unreported. A 1997 report from the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals says that only 40% of people who witness abuse ever report it. The same study found people who committed violent crimes against animals were five times more likely to commit violent crimes against humans than were other people who lived in the same neighborhoods. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, there are three reasons people abuse animals. Most people, the ASPCA says on its website devoted to children, ""don't think about or realize what they are doing."" Take, for instance, the pet owner who doesn't understand how cruel it is to tie a pet up all day on a chain that is too short. Another type of abuser is the person who is bowing to peer pressure. In those cases, the person, usually someone young, doesn't hurt or harass animals but a few times. Eventually, they learn to feel for the animal, the organization says. The third category is people who enjoy hurting animals. These people are often looking to demonstrate their power, the ASPCA says. Sometimes, people feel they are at odds with the wildlife, Young says. It's a clash, where a growing human population wants the same space as the animal population, Wan says. The pressure is growing. ""And more and more we are taking it out on wildlife,"" she says. Both Wan and Young agree that there isn't a problem with the legal penalties for animal cruelty, but with catching and convicting the bad guys. ""We don't need stronger laws, but clearly there is a need for stronger enforcement,"" Young says. ""We need to make proverbial examples of some people."" Her organization works with groups to educate the public. In the case of the seals, the cruelty has ""accelerated so rapidly"" that activists are scrambling to do something, she said. They hope to create a video that draws attention to the problem. For now, she and Wan hope the beach closure will help give the seals a respite from the types of incidents caught on camera.","Video camera captures instances of abuse against seals on a California beach .

"(CNN) -- When India's aviation sector began liberalizing in 2003, a regional powerhouse was unleashed. The country's state-owned airline Air India was soon competing for passengers with six private airline groups in a market that has grown steadily in the past decade. In 2009-10 Indian airlines carried 45 million domestic passenger and 11 million international passengers, according to figures from the CAPA Centre for Aviation. Fueled by India's stellar GDP growth and a growing middle class, passenger numbers handled at Indian airports exceeded 120 million, making it one of the ten largest markets globally, according to CAPA. But by 2008, the sector was in trouble. Debts mounted for billionaire Vijay Mallya -- the flamboyant owner of Kingfisher Airlines -- whose fleet of 66 planes, with a further 130 on order - faces losses of $US1.62 billion. Can Kingfisher survive? Last week, Mallya said he was on the cusp of some airline-saving deals, but investors have not been convinced and the stock has continued to slide. Even though Mallya says the airline does not need a government bailout -- and India's civil aviation authority has categorically ruled out any kind of lifeline for the industry -- the markets, and some industry analysts, say the sector will need a magic wand to reverse the descent. How did the tiger of the world's aviation industry go into such a steep decline? According to Tom Ballantyne, the chief correspondent with Oriental Aviation, where once Indian aviation suffered from too little competition, now it suffers from too much. ""There were just too many low-cost carriers and this created a situation where there are simply too many seats flying through air,"" he told CNN. ""It's a problem of over-capacity. ""Air India has debts of more than $8 billion and Kingfisher has debts of more than $2 billion. All of them are losing money with the possible exception IndiGo,"" Ballantyne said. India's aviation industry leaders lay much of the blame at the feet of Air India which they accuse of unfairly competing with India's newer airlines, slashing fares while at the same time enjoying the luxury of government subsidies. The airline has been unprofitable since 1997 and has received government bailouts of $625 million and is requesting more before the end of the fiscal year that ends in March 2012, according to company figures. Air India agrees restructuring deal . The national carrier employs between 50,000 and 60,000 people and analysts say the bailouts are likely to continue. ""When the main state-owned carrier is in such dire shape then it tends to affect the whole of the industry,"" says Ballantyne. ""The carrier has been one of the main culprits in terms of discounting."" M Shivkumar, the head of finance at Jet Airways, India's biggest carrier, recently identified Air India's price war as a key factor for the problems in Indian aviation. ""Ideally, fares should go up when oil-import costs go up. That's not happening and that's why airlines are in this situation,"" he said. Have rising oil prices contributed to steep losses? Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) costs have soared this year as oil import costs everywhere skyrocket. But on average, fuel costs are around 60% higher in India than in other countries. This is because of a mosaic of state taxes, some as high as 35%, making India one of the costliest places in the world to run a fleet of planes. ""The states are unwilling to give up a good source of revenue,"" said Ballantyne. ""Combing that with rising fuel costs and this further cuts into the slim margins and yields on which these airlines already operate."" He said India's central government may soon be forced to address this problem if the country is to have a functioning aviation industry. ""The government has already had to step in to back credit for Air India whose suppliers were demanding that it pay upfront before they would make deliveries of aviation fuel,"" Ballantyne said. With an Indian rupee last week dropping to its lowest level in history, recently hitting 52.50 against the U.S. dollar, the pain is set to increase of Indian airlines. ""When you add to that costs associated with catering, maintenance and landing fees, as well as low yields per seat, then the airlines are really struggling."" How competitive is the Indian domestic industry? ""With many airlines bringing prices down to below the cost of producing the airline seat, the government is looking at issues of predatory pricing,"" Ballantyne said. ""Yields are very tight anyway and pricing is seriously affecting the airlines. The government is looking at setting up a regulatory body to make sure that Indian airlines are operating on a proper basis."" Is opening the sector to investment by foreign airlines a solution? ""No foreign airlines are permitted to invest in Indian carriers and three government ministries are now looking into ways to change that,"" Ballantyne said. ""This would be an important change because investment by foreign airlines brings with it all kinds of advantages, not least expertise in airline management and other synergies. ""At the moment, however, in this sort of economic climate, the airlines are having trouble attracting any sort of investment at all,"" he said. ""It really is an awful situation."" Do Indian airlines suffer from a shortage of qualified manpower? ""The growth has been so rapid in the Indian aviation space, that airlines have had difficulties keeping up with the staffing needed in terms of pilots, maintenance workers and engineers,"" Ballantyne said. ""Not only are the Indian airlines pirating staff from each other, but India is very close to the Gulf where airlines have no problem with money and no problem with pirating staff from just about everywhere."" What's the solution? ""Many of the government's solutions will take a long time to enact,"" he said. ""India is still a very chaotic country and nothing happens quickly. ""If Air India, for example, needs action from the government then it that has to go from ministry to ministry, from committee to committee. ""It's forced into a situation where it is not very quick or very agile in a market where speed and agility are everything.""","Analysts believe too many low-cost carriers are to blame for India's aviation woes .

"(CNN) -- The Philippine economy grew 7.1% last quarter -- the fastest growth in two years and the fastest pace in Asia next to China -- a strong sign that the Southeast Asian economy is building domestic-growth rather than relying on exports. Manila is bucking the global pressures of the eurozone debt crisis and the slowdown in China. The Philippines is the only nation whose expected growth has been raised by the International Monetary Fund, rather than revised down, IMF Chief Christine Lagarde noted while visiting Manila earlier this month. ""There is no denying it, the Philippines is having a fantastic year despite strong global headwinds,"" HSBC said in a research note Wednesday. ""This is largely due to the fact that policy makers took timely measures to counterbalance an anticipated slowdown of demand from China and the eurozone as well as the resilient nature of the services-oriented economy."" The stronger-than-expected growth brings more good news for the administration of President Benigno Aquino III, who last month signed a landmark peace deal with Muslim rebel leaders that moves to end the long-running insurgency in the nation's troubled south. A strong service sector, accelerated growth of the industry sector and better than expected agricultural output led grow, Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan told reporters Wednesday. Household spending contributed more than half of the growth on the demand side, he added. The 7.1% year-on-year growth in the third quarter was up from 6% growth in the second quarter. ""Overall, we now expect the economy to expand by 6.3% this year, up from our previous forecast of 5.0%,""wrote Gareth Leather of Capital Economics in a research note.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Four months after hushed deal-broking produced a new leadership lineup for China, Xi Jinping is to set to formally take charge of the country he'll rule for the next 10 years. Xi, along with new premier Li Keqiang, has inherited a supercharged economy that's created vast riches for some, a growing middle class, and many poorer migrant workers who are becoming increasingly frustrated with their lot in life. But the deepening wealth divide isn't the only challenge facing the country's population of 1.3 billion people. In November, as China was convening its 18th National Communist Party Congress, CNN asked a number of China experts to define what they believe to be the country's most pressing challenges. We revisit their thoughts four months on, as delegates attend the 12th National People's Congress in Beijing. Wen opens China's People's Congress with call to unite . 1. Closing the wealth gap . In February, the Chinese government announced plan to raise spending on social welfare by two percentage points within the next five years. Economist Li Gan says that's nowhere near enough to narrow the wealth gap and argues that the country needs to work on a ""much larger scale."" ""If the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens, Chinese workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies, unemployment and retirement, and more likely to buy goods and services -- and create a mature consumer-driven economy,"" he says. Gan explains his views here. 2. Too many men . Faced with a surging population, China attempted to put the brakes on procreation in the late 1970s by implementing a controversial policy limiting couples in some areas to just one child. Since then, a cultural bias towards male children has led to a skewed child sex ratio where millions of men, or ""bare branches"" face an uncertain future due to the lack of potential female partners, writes evolutionary biologist Rob Brooks. ""It would be difficult to overstate the urgent need for China to emulate South Korea in eliminating sex-biased abortion and neglect,"" Brooks writes. Studies show, he says, what can happen if it doesn't. 3. Securing China's food, water and air . The legacy of China's powerhouse of cheap, labor-intensive exports is a natural environment tainted by the pollutants of economic growth. Author Geoff Hiscock says securing the food, water and air security of China's 1.35 billion people is one of the leadership's biggest challenges. ""Beijing and other parts of northeastern China are already water-stressed, the air quality in inland mega-cities such as Chongqing and Chengdu is abysmal, farming land is being poisoned by toxic runoff from mining and industrial activities, acid rain blights large parts of south China, contagious disease is an ever-present risk among its livestock, and unscrupulous makers sell tainted foodstuffs,"" Hiscock writes. So what can China do about it? More from Hiscock. CNN's Paul Armstrong and Kevin Voigt contributed to this story.","CNN asked experts to explain biggest challenges facing China .

"London (CNN) -- They were four completely unknown men living in Liverpool in 1962. Ordinary 20-something-year-olds who had formed what seemed to be a very ordinary rock band. Their names were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Pete Best -- they called themselves ""The Beatles."" On New Year's Day in 1962, with the help of their manager Brian Epstein, the band recorded an audition tape at London's Decca Studios. They included a collection of cover songs with titles such as ""Money,"" ""Crying, Waiting, Hoping,"" and ""Searchin'."" CNN has not been able to verify the authenticity of the audiotape. The band hoped this audition tape would propel them into a record deal and give them the fame they so desperately wanted. Unfortunately for them, they were rejected by the record label. It turned out to be one of the worst decisions in music history. The Beatles were quickly snatched up by EMI Records and -- after drummer Ringo Starr replaced Best -- the rest, as they say, is history. Fifty years later, that very audition tape is being put up for auction in London. ""The tape is pretty unique because it captures a moment in history,"" Ted Owen of auctioneers Fame Bureau told CNN. ""The quality is like sitting in a cinema with headphones on. It's absolutely brilliant. That's the most amazing part, the quality,"" he said. This is the first time the audition tape has come out in public. Since early 2002, the tape was in the possession of an American, but now it could be yours if you're willing to pay. The tape has a starting bid of $32,000, but Owen expects it to go for much more at the auction on Tuesday. ""Anyone who spends over Â£20,000 (more than $32,000) on it will be telling everyone on the planet that they own,"" he said. ""It's a trophy.""","The Beatles recorded an audition tape for Decca on New Year's Day 1962 .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egyptian blogger Aliaa Magda Elmahdy has become a household name in the Middle East and sparked a global uproar after a friend posted a photo of her naked on Twitter. The photo, which the 20-year-old former student first posted on her blog, shows her naked apart from a pair of thigh-high stockings and some red patent leather shoes. It was later posted on Twitter with the hashtag #nudephotorevolutionary. The tweet was viewed over a million times, while Elmahdy's followers jumped from a few hundred to more than 14,000. Her actions have received global media coverage and provoked outrage in Egypt, a conservative Muslim country where most women wear the veil. Many liberals fear that Elmahdy's actions will hurt their prospects in the parliamentary election next week. Elmahdy describes herself as an atheist. She has been living for the past five months with her boyfriend, blogger Kareem Amer, who, in 2006 was sentenced to four years in a maximum security prison for criticizing Islam and defaming former president Hosni Mubarak. Here she talks exclusively to CNN in Cairo about why she posed nude. CNN: Why did you post a photo of yourself nude photo on Twitter, and why the red high heels and black stockings? Elmahdy: After my photo was removed from Facebook, a male friend of mine asked me if he may post it on Twitter. I accepted because I am not shy of being a woman in a society where women are nothing but sex objects harassed on a daily basis by men who know nothing about sex or the importance of a woman. The photo is an expression of my being and I see the human body as the best artistic representation of that. I took the photo myself using a timer on my personal camera. The powerful colors black and red inspire me. CNN: Who is Aliaa Elmahdy inside the body portrayed in the nude photo? Elmahdy: I like being different. I love life, art, photography and expressing my thoughts through writing more than anything. That is why I studied media and hope to take it further to the TV world too so I can expose the truth behind the lies we endure everyday in this world. I don't believe that we must have children only through marriage. It's all about love. CNN: How have your Egyptian Muslim parents reacted? How do they feel about you living with your boyfriend unmarried? Elmahdy: I last spoke to them 24 days back. They want to support me and get closer, especially after the photo was released, but they accuse Kareem of manipulating me. He has been my support system and has passed along their text messages to me. I dropped out of AUC (The American University in Cairo where she was a media student) months back after (my parents) attempted to control my life by threatening not to pay the fees. CNN: The press has labeled you a revolutionary but you were not in Tahrir Square during the 18 days of the revolution in February this year. Is there a political element to you posing nude? Elmahdy: I was never into politics. I first joined the protests on May 27th because I felt the need to participate and decided I might be able to change the future of Egypt and refused to remain silent. I made it clear that I was not part of April 6th Movement (an Egyptian political group that came to prominence during the revolution) after the rumors were spread by remnants of Mubarak's National Democratic Party who wanted to capitalize on the reaction to the photo. What shocked me is April 6th's statement clarifying that Aliaa Magda Elmahdy is not part of their organization and how they don't accept ""atheism."" Where is the democracy and liberalism they preach to the world? They only feed what the public wants to hear for their political ambitions. CNN: What do you think about the forced virginity tests performed by the Egyptian military on more than a dozen girls arrested in Tahrir Square? Elmahdy: I consider this rape. Those men in the military who conducted these tests should be punished for allowing this to happen without the consent of the girls in the first place. Instead, the girls walk around feeling the shame and most of them are forced to remain silent. CNN: Do you practice safe sex in your sexual revolution? Elmahdy: Most Egyptians are secretive about sex because they are brought up thinking sex is something bad and dirty and there is no mention of it in schools. Sex to the majority is simply a man using a woman with no communication between them and children are just part of an equation. To me, sex is an expression of respect, a passion for love that culminates into sex to please both sides. I do practice safe sex but I don't take pills because I am against abortion. I enjoyed losing my virginity at the age of 18 with a man I loved who was 40 years older than me. Kareem Amer is the second man and the love of my life. The saying suits us: ""Birds of the same feather flock together"" CNN: How do you see women in the ""New Egypt"" and will you leave the country if the ongoing revolution fails? Elmahdy: I am not positive at all unless a social revolution erupts. Women under Islam will always be objects to use at home. The (sexism) against women in Egypt is unreal, but I am not going anywhere and will battle it 'til the end. Many women wear the veil just to escape the harassment and be able to walk the streets. I hate how society labels gays and lesbians as abnormal people. Different is not abnormal! CNN: What are your future plans with Kareem and will you find it hard to deal with your new notoriety? Elmahdy: I have discovered who my real friends are, and I have Kareem who loves me passionately. He works as a media monitor and I am currently looking for a job. I embrace the simple things in life and I am a vegetarian ... I am a believer of every word I say and I am willing to live in danger under the many threats I receive in order to obtain the real freedom all Egyptian are fighting and dying for daily.","CNN Exclusive: Egyptian blogger Aliaa Magda Elmahdy tells CNN why she posed naked .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday tried to draw a distinction between himself and GOP challenger Mitt Romney on contraceptives. He boasted that Obama's Affordable Care Act gives insured women free contraception coverage, and said Romney thinks employers should decide whether women can get contraception through insurance. Obama made the statements at Tuesday's presidential debate in Hempstead, New York. Romney, who has said he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and also takes issue with part of the contraceptive coverage rule, countered that Obama misrepresented his stance. The statements: . Obama: . ""A major difference in this campaign is that Gov. Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making. I think that's a mistake. In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured. ... Gov. Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage."" Fact Check: Romney, women and jobs . Romney: . ""I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care or not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives, and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong."" The facts: . To make sense of the statements, we should examine what the Affordable Care Act's contraceptives rule does, and what Romney has said he objects to. The rule initially required most insurance plans to provide free contraception coverage to women. By August 2011, the rule was amended to exempt certain religious employers, such as churches, synagogues and other houses of worship, from offering such coverage. But other religiously affiliated organizations, including colleges and hospitals, were not exempt, and religious groups objected. So, in February, the Obama administration announced what it called a compromise in which free contraception coverage still must be offered to employees of religiously affiliated colleges and hospitals, but health insurers -- rather than the employers -- would have to cover the cost. Churches and other houses of worship retained the full exemption, meaning women who worked there had no guarantee of full contraception coverage. The requirement went into effect August 1, though the non-exempt religiously affiliated institutions such as colleges and hospitals can have up to August 1, 2013, to comply. Some conservatives and religious groups, including some affiliated with the Catholic Church, continued to object, saying the rule still infringed on religious liberty and set a dangerous precedent by distinguishing between church and church-affiliated groups for conscience clauses. Romney has said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, which includes the contraceptives rule. He also opposes the contraceptives rule specifically. In August, his campaign released a TV ad accusing Obama of mounting a ""war on religion,"" saying that the health care law forces religious institutions to ""go against their faith."" On February 10, the day the Obama administration announced the compromise, Romney said the rule still was ""an assault on religious conviction,"" and suggesting that the insurance companies that would be forced to pay for contraception for employees of religiously affiliated colleges and hospitals could try to pass the cost on to the employers. Around the same time, Romney said he supported a proposed amendment that would have allowed employers to opt out of providing health care coverage they disagreed with on moral grounds. The proposal, which was killed in the Senate in March, was Senate Republicans' response to the controversy over contraception and religious employers, though it didn't specifically mention contraception. The proposal stated that the health care act imposes requirements that infringe on the rights and conscience of insurers and plan sponsors, and it would have established that an entity refusing coverage on religious or moral grounds is not in violation of the law. Conclusion: . Obama's health care act does require most insurers to provide free contraception coverage to women, as described above. Romney, while not opposing the availability of contraception, opposes the contraception rule, arguing it forces some religious institutions to go against their faith.

"(CNN) -- It seems as if we are in a time of unprecedented struggle over the meaning of women's bodies and sexuality. Controversy is swirling about an American University professor who breast-fed a baby in class; topless photos of Kate Middleton have been released; and a Time magazine cover showing a mother breast-feeding her toddler sparked even more tittering in May. It is not just the breast that is contested: Pussy Riot, the punk band, was sentenced to two years in a Russian prison after a staged performance in which they did high kicks that showed too much of their bodies. They tried, from prison, to explain ""what pussy meant"" and ""what riot meant."" Michigan representative Lisa Brown got into hot water -- and fought back -- for using the words 'my vagina' in the Michigan statehouse. Michigan women supported her by standing in front of the statehouse with a giant ""V"" symbol and spelling out the words 'VAGINA' in pink letters. Young women in Tahrir Square protesting in the Arab Spring were punished by imprisonment -- and vaginal exams by armed strangers for ""virginity tests."" This is not so surprising when you understand the delicate brain-vagina connection that my new book documents -- female sexuality around the world is targeted because through traumatizing the vagina, you can intimidate women on multiple other levels. What is going on? We are at an important crossroads in which it is becoming clearer to women around the world that, as one feminist artist put it, ""your body is a battleground."" Vagina enters stage left -- or is it right? In a hypersexualized culture, in which porn is available 24-7, it is not female nudity -- or discussion about vaginas or breasts or ""pussy riots"" -- that is scandalous. Indeed, the female body has never been so commodified before, and female sexuality has never been so readily consumable in sanitized, corporatized formats such as pornography. Rather, what is still scandalous to our culture is when women take ownership of their own bodies. Staging a strip performance is not disruptive to social order in Moscow, but three punk poets using their sexuality to make a satirical comment about Russian leader Vladimir Putin is destabilizing and must be punished. Legislating the most intimate aspects of women's reproductive lives, all the way to imposing transvaginal probes on them -- as states are doing across the country -- isn't shocking or obscene, because it is about taking away sexual control from women of their own bodies. What is shocking and obscene is when a serious person -- a legislator -- dares to take back ownership of her own self, with the scandalous words ""my vagina."" The issue is not the vagina, but who gets to say what becomes of it and who owns it. Porn 24-7 doesn't threaten social control. Indeed, its addictive effects, in terms of new neuroscientific discoveries, actually turns out to be a kind of drug or sedative. This turns a potentially liberating sexual revolution into yet another marketable consumer product that hypnotizes people and is creating new health and sexual problems around libido, rather than setting them free. In the struggle over sex, these choices are where the struggle lies: Who decides reproductive rights; who decides when and how breasts might be exposed; who decides who can say vagina and where; who decides who is a slut; and who must be punished with hard labor for asserting their right to define their own sexual and artistic identities. The sexual revolution came and went, and yet women are still not as truly sexually free as they deserve to be -- here or around the world. They are not yet, as these struggles show, fully free to define the meanings of their bodies and their desire, to assert their sexual wishes without punishment -- including punishment by the state. And they are not yet fully free to claim the right to sexual pleasure and autonomy without enduring public shaming. Until that real freedom arrives, we can honor the pioneers such as Lisa Brown, Pussy Riot and the young women of Tahrir Square -- and keep up the fight to be free to name our bodies and ourselves. As gender and representation expert Dr. Emma Rees notes of the struggle over how one may speak about female sexuality: ""For until we have a language and a platform for talking honestly about women's bodies and sexual drives, we're doomed into a cycle of objectification and silence."" The views in this article are solely those of Naomi Wolf.","Author Naomi Wolf says recent controversies reveal biased views toward women's bodies .
The Pussy Riot trial and Arab Spring protests showed women stripped of autonomy .
Women's bodies are battlegrounds used to wage culture wars, Wolf says .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Xi Jinping was named China's president Thursday by the country's parliament, one of the final steps in China's once-in-a-decade leadership change. Four months after taking over as General Secretary of the Communist Party, Xi replaces outgoing leader Hu Jintao after a formal vote of about 3,000 deputies at the National People's Congress (NPC). The vote, largely a rubber stamp that completes the highly choreographed leadership transition, was unanimous. Li Keqiang will become premier, replacing Wen Jiabao who stands aside as part of the leadership overhaul, which will see the traditionally nine-member Politburo Standing Committee shrink to seven. Xi was also named chairman of the state Central Military Commission. ""He has had a stronger military relationship than either of his two predecessors -- Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao -- when they began, so Xi comes in with a really strong position and he needs it,"" Robert Lawrence Kuhn, author of ""How China's Leaders Think,"" told CNN. ""We could go through a whole list of problems from the structure of the economy as well as the social issues: Health care, housing, education and pollution and retirement and food safety,"" Kuhn added. ""All of these things are all bubbling up together -- and with a billion cell phones in China, everybody knows it, so he's on the spot."" Opening the NPC last week, Wen urged delegates to ""unite as one and work hard to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,"" according to state-run news agency Xinhua. PROFILES: China's new leaders . Since the congress convened March 5, thousands of Chinese officials have held a series of meetings to discuss the structure of state departments and future targets. The NPC concludes Sunday. On the first day, Wen announced the country was aiming for an annual growth rate this year of 7.5%. Efforts would be made to keep consumer price inflation at around 3.5%. And, nine million new jobs would be created with the intention of keeping urban unemployment at no more than 4.6%. During the NPC, it was announced Beijing would strengthen the powers of the State Food and Drug Administration in the wake of widespread health concerns over food safety, such as tainted milk and baby formula scandals, according to Xinhua. The issue of water quality also became clear during the congress, with the discovery of nearly 6,000 pigs in a Shanghai river, raising local concerns about the safety of the city's drinking water. This winter has seen its worst pollution in living memory, angering a population already jaded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals -- including the downfall of the once high-flying politician Bo Xilai -- that have tainted the reputation of the party. In a speech published by the People's Daily earlier this month, Xi warned that China faced many risks and challenges, saying that the party's future was at stake. The NPC also approved the restructuring of several ministries under the State Council. The two agencies that regulate and censor media -- the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television and the General Administration of Press and Publication -- will be merged, as will the Health Ministry and the National Population and Family Planning Commission, Xinhua reported.","NEW: Xi Jinping formally takes role of Chinese president .

"(CNN) -- For a country of just 2.1 million people in an area more than twice the size of Germany, Namibia has seen more than its share of conflict over the past 120 years. Dragged into the 20th century as a German imperial protectorate, German South-West Africa, as it was known then, was the scene of violent insurrections by indigenous people and brutal crackdowns by colonial administrators. In 2004, Germany offered its first formal apology for the massacre of an estimated 65,000 members of the Herero tribe who sustained a rebellion between 1904 and 1907 before they were forced into the desert where many perished. Descendants of the few survivors are still seeking $4 billion compensation from the German government for what they claim was an orchestrated campaign of extermination that pre-figured Germany's genocidal policies of the Second World War. Namibia's troubled history continued deep into the 20th century: in 1920 the League of Nations mandated the country to South Africa, which imposed its apartheid laws on the region after 1948. In 1966, the Marxist South-West Africa People's Organization (Swapo) launched a war of independence for the area that became Namibia. The simmering guerilla campaign continued for 22 years, when South Africa agreed to end administration of the region under a U.N. peace plan. Swapo has governed since Namibia won independence in 1990 in a functioning democracy that saw Hifikepunye Pohamba take his second five-year term as president following elections in 2009. Test your knowledge of Namibia . Even with independence, Namibia's problems continued. In the 1990s, a secessionist movement in the Caprivi Strip, in eastern Namibia, caused thousands to flee to Botswana. The government has since calmed the restive region, declaring it safe for tourism. Today Namibia struggles with huge unemployment (around 50% of the population, according to the CIA World Factbook). HIV/AIDs affects 15% of the population, according to data compiled by the World Health Organization and more than half the population lives below the international poverty line of $1.25 a day, according to data from the UN. With one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world, the result, in large part, of a rural, cashless subsistence economy, land reform is one of Namibia's most hotly contested issues. There are believed to be 4,000 commercial farms - mostly white-owned - that occupy up to half of Namibia's arable land. The government's aim is to resettle landless Namibians on this land on a ""willing buyer, willing seller"" arrangement. However, expropriations have taken place because too few farmers have been willing to sell. In a bid to speed up the land reform process, the government has moved to loosen up restrictive terms that heavily favored the government in negotiations with farmers over land sales. Just 1,000 of these commercial farms have been purchased by the government as part of its land reform program, and white farmers must offer the government first refusal on any sale of land. Continuing wrangling has acted as a serious disincentive to further investment in the country's valuable arable land. Currently, mining -- particularly diamonds, copper, gold, zinc, lead, uranium -- constitutes more than 12% of Namibia's GDP, according to government figures. Its other largest sectors are tourism, agriculture at more than 9% and manufacturing at more than 15%. The latter, however, struggles as it competes with a highly subsidized manufacturing sector in neighboring South Africa. Ultimately, however, Namibia's most precious resource is likely to be water. Sandwiched between two of the world's most famous deserts - the Namib and the Kalahari - Namibia is the driest country in sub-Saharan Africa, with less than 370mm of rainfall on average each year. Send in your photos of Namibia . However, this year the Namibian department of water affairs announced the discovery of a significant body of underground water - an aquifer dubbed Ohangwena II - that scientists say could supply the north of the country with enough water for centuries. Situated on the border with Angola, Namibia's side of the 10,000-year-old aquifer covers an area about 70km by 40km (43 miles by 25 miles). Project manager Martin Quinger, from the German Federal Institute for Geoscience and Natural Resources (BGR), told the Namibia Sun that it was a substantial body of water and could supply 40% of the nation's population for as long as 400 years. ""Old water can be, unlike old beer, very fresh and clean, as it was infiltrated before environmental pollution was an issue,"" Quinger told the newspaper.

"Washington (CNN) -- If you're expecting last minute action from Congress to avoid the March 1 spending cut deadline, think again. Congress isn't even in session this week, and lawmakers and aides from both parties say they don't expect anything to pass anytime soon. Why the lack of urgency? The cuts can be phased in over time, and leaders on both sides of the aisle know they can act after March 1 to undo any reductions in the months to come. Also, some Democrats and Republicans aren't totally unhappy with many of the cuts, $85 billion of which will be split between Pentagon and non-defense programs this year. Many of the most popular domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid benefits, are off the table. Obama, GOP clash on forced spending cuts . With no sharp, irreversible deadline in the offing, all you're likely to get over the next 10 days is an extended version of the partisan blame game. True to form, President Barack Obama and GOP leaders ratcheted up their rhetoric on Tuesday. ""Republicans in Congress face a simple choice,"" Obama said at a White House event with first responders. ""Are they willing to compromise, to protect vital investments in education and healthcare and national security and all the jobs that depend on them? Or would they rather put hundreds of thousands of jobs and our entire economy at risk just to protect a few special interest tax loopholes that benefit only the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations?"" Obama more emotional on spending cuts . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, urged Republicans to ""listen to the overwhelming majority of Americans and work with Democrats to forge a balanced approach"" to deficit reduction that includes new tax hikes on the wealthy. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, responded to barbs from Democrats with a written statement placing the blame squarely on the president. Blind budget cuts, explained . ""The House has twice passed legislation to replace it with commonsense cuts and reforms that won't threaten public safety, national security, or our economy,"" the speaker said, referring to measures passed by the GOP-controlled chamber last year. ""But once again, the president (has) offered no credible plan that can pass Congress -- only more calls for higher taxes,"" Boehner said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Obama ""prefers campaign events to common sense, bipartisan action."" By the Numbers: Automatic spending cuts . Republicans argue they've already ceded on higher taxes by allowing Bush-era tax cuts to expire on the wealthiest Americans as part of the New Year's Eve ""fiscal cliff"" deal. GOP leaders insist that any package replacing this year's planned $85 billion in cuts -- part of $1.2 trillion in savings over 10 years -- must be comprised entirely of alternative spending reductions, including entitlement reform. Republicans are particularly concerned about the looming defense cuts. ""Even though defense accounts for 17 (or) 18% of our spending, they've taken half of the savings out of the military,"" House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, R-California, told CNN. ""The troops that are over there fighting to protect our freedoms around the world are being cut. The things that they need are being cut."" Senate Democrats and Republicans are expected to propose alternative bills next week to replace the automatic cuts. Neither plan is likely to get the 60 votes necessary for approval in the 100-member chamber -- thereby setting the stage for more serious talks after March 1. The real impact of automatic spending cuts . ""There won't be any easy off-ramps on this one,"" McConnell said last week. ""The days of 11th hour negotiations are over."" Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller, who studies presidential and congressional politics, noted that March 27 -- the date when the current government funding authority expires -- is an ideal point for Congress to alter its current spending plans. ""The upside to the (current package of planned cuts) is that it gives both parties political cover to make a dent in federal spending,"" Schiller told CNN. ""The downside is that the cuts themselves are not directly targeted at inefficiency, fraud or waste, and will ultimately affect voters' daily lives in some way."" Ultimately, she predicted, Congress will be ""the big loser. ... If history tells us anything about showdowns between Congress and the president, it tells us the president wins. And only one branch will face the voters again -- Congress."" Borger: Obama can't kick his legacy down the road .","Congress is unlikely to act before automatic spending cuts kick in March 1 .
The cuts will be phased in over time and can be changed later on .
Democrats and Republicans are blaming each other instead of working on alternatives ."
"(CNN) -- Just hours before the first full-scale concert of her current tour, Bonnie Raitt stood high above the stage and reflected on the job she's held for more than four decades. ""I think it's as important to enjoy recording and being on the road as much as we do or otherwise I'd be crazy after 42 years to still be schlepping around in a bus,"" she said. While Raitt has performed on and off since 2005, she put her recording career on hold for seven years to deal with the deaths of her parents and her older brother as well as other issues. ""The time that I really was off I wanted to literally be off, not thinking of what my next project was going to be,"" Raitt recalled. But after a while, the passion Raitt displays in her music began to fill her again. ""I got my appetite back for it, and I started going to gigs and really missing it,"" she said, later elaborating, ""I wanted to take that break so I would miss it enough."" As much as Raitt missed her time off from work, her fans missed her. They've been letting the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer know it, packing concerts and propelling ""Slipstream,"" her first album in seven years, into Billboard's top 10. As Raitt's albums typically do, ""Slipstream"" contains mostly cover songs. Not that she is averse to original material. Dating back to her eponymous 1971 debut, Raitt has written her fair share of music. But the woman who Rolling Stone named as one of the 100 best guitarists and 100 best singers ever is better known as an interpreter of other songwriters' output. Raitt said when she's looking for the perfect tunes to record, she relies on a lot of research, hard work and luck. ""[I] ask my friends -- other musicians I respect -- who they're listening to that's kind of under the radar in their town, in their area,"" she said. ""I call people in Ireland and Australia, and go back and listen to my old CDs, and vinyl. It's really hunt and peck. Some of the ones I've had for a while, and I'm thinking about waiting for which record will work."" The first single off of ""Slipstream"" is a cover of the late Gerry Rafferty's 1978 hit ""Right Down the Line."" Raitt attributed that selection to ""one of those magical moments."" ""[I was] walking around in a mall or you know, in a restaurant, and that's how I found the Gerry Rafferty song again. I remembered how much I loved it,"" she said. Raitt said she chose to recast ""Right Down the Line"" as ""a kind of tougher reggae song."" It's not the first time she's put a definitive spin on someone else's hit. Raitt redefined Del Shannon's signature hit ""Runaway,"" and some fans have noted that John Prine's beloved ""Angel From Montgomery,"" which Raitt still plays during her concerts, seems like it was written for her. Despite nine Grammys and several other accolades, Raitt's remains humble onstage and off. Before her show, Raitt joked about her age, noting she needs two pairs of glasses -- one for distance and one for reading. She added that when it comes to the latter, she gets cheap ones from the drugstore: ""They're just as good."" On stage, she good-naturedly brushed off a marriage proposal from the crowd (""If you only knew! Thanks for offering""), consistently shined the spotlight on her longtime touring band and even played the sideman, letting new keyboardist Mike Finnegan sing a song toward the end of the main set. Raitt protested that she hasn't had that many hits (""That would be daunting if you had like 30 and you had to do most of them all the time. It would get kind of old,"") but she knows certain songs of hers are classics. "" 'I Can't Make You Love Me,' 'Angel From Montgomery,' 'Something to Talk About,' you know, people who haven't seen me in a long time, they love those songs, and they're the ones who paid for the tour bus,"" she said. While in some respects Raitt is a pragmatist, her dreams for a better and safer world have spawned a passion for political activism. Last summer, 32 years after Raitt helped organize a famous ""No Nukes"" concert, she and her partners in Musicians United for Safe Energy (MUSE) -- Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, David Crosby and others -- put together a follow-up benefit to raise awareness about nuclear power concerns. ""With Fukashima and what's been going on with the accidents, and the terrorism threats, and the lack of security and solutions for waste storage, the nuclear issue is ... first and foremost on my mind,"" she said. But that's far from the only cause on her mind. Raitt's website lists more than 100 nonprofit partners she encourages fans to learn more about, many having to do with music education. While she does spread the love for other charities, she is a huge proponent of such education. Raitt noted that learning about music benefits children in several ways. ""Especially girls, but any kids exposed to music programs and arts programs, do much better on their tests. They have a better chance of going to college. They can focus better. You know, we're not just automatons learning how to work machines and do engineering and math and science. All of that's great, but you've got to build a whole person,"" she said. Raitt added that she finds it ""thrilling"" to learn about the roots of music and culture she loves, often with the aid of the Internet. ""You get a chance to see field recordings of blues artists that I never even got to meet, and Louis Armstrong as a young man, all these recordings, you can just pretty much get an education without even going to school, even from the middle of -- you know, in the middle of some Iowa cornfield or in Africa."" To many musicologists, Raitt is a crucial link in the chain of great blues artists and she's even in the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame. She ""apprenticed"" with Sippie Wallace, Mississippi Fred McDowell and Muddy Waters when those storied performers were about the same age she is now. Raitt's said she's grateful that her elders didn't just teach her about music. ""They didn't really seem to care whether their fans were 500 people or you know, 50,000 at some festival,"" Raitt recalled. ""They just seemed pretty cool and copacetic, grateful to be there, had a great sense of humor, and a wry sense of perspective."" ""I'm happy to say that at 62, I think I've reached that point where stuff doesn't bother me as much, and my gratitude level has gone way up, especially having gone through the loss that I've had, and losing so many of the great artists that I was close to. They taught me how to see it with a grain of salt and a lot of humor and perspective.""","Bonnie Raitt's ""Slipstream"" is her first album in seven years .

"London (CNN) -- A bold project to explore an ancient lake trapped beneath an Antarctic glacier for up to half a million years may reveal the limits at which life can exist. The British project, run by a consortium of two environmental research centers and eight universities, will involve drilling through 3 km (1.86 miles) of ice in one of the world's most hostile locations to extract water and sediment samples from Lake Ellsworth, situated deep beneath a glacier on the West Antarctic Ice Shelf. Ellsworth, about 10 km (6.2 miles) long and 2-3 km wide, is one of about 400 subglacial lakes on the frozen continent, which maintain their liquid form due to pressure from above and heat from the Earth below. Read: Sci-fi writers to help scientists imagine the future . Scientists believe some of these isolated lakes could be home to micro-organisms unknown to science, potentially holding secrets to the origins and limits of life on Earth. This knowledge could in turn hold clues about the possible conditions for extraterrestrial life, in locations such as the bodies of water thought to exist beneath the surfaces of icy moons of Saturn and Jupiter. ""It will help us define where things can live, and that could guide or inform our investigations for life on other planets,"" said David Pearce, a microbiologist for the British Antarctic Survey. Read: $1B mission to reach the Earth's mantle . Scientists do not know what they will discover, but believe they may find bacteria, viruses, single-celled microorganisms and complex cell organisms called eukaryotes. A less likely, but more scientifically intriguing scenario is that the ancient lake is completely lifeless, going against the prevailing rule that wherever there is water, there is life. ""That in some ways would be more exciting, because it would give us the limits for life as we know if on the earth,"" said Pearce. ""There are even active organisms in clouds."" The project has been 16 years in the making for the University of Bristol's Martin Siegert, the project's principal investigator. Read: Scientists to simulate human brain inside supercomputer . ""What we're doing is testing that relationship between life and water in probably the most extreme place that we can,"" he said. ""These are isolated pockets of water that have been removed from the atmosphere for some time, under complete darkness and quite high pressures, without that common communication with fluid transport or atmospheric transport with the rest of the planet. The buffer is the ice sheet above it."" Siegert said sediment samples from the lake floor should also contain information about the planet's changing climate, including the age of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and the approximate timing and conditions of any previous collapse. Opinion: How the search for aliens can help sustain life on Earth . ""If we can determine sediments that were deposited before the ice sheet was in place, then we can date that sediment and that can give us an estimation,"" he said. Siegert, who named the lake in 2004 after the American polar explorer Lincoln Ellsworth, has wanted to explore Antarctica's subglacial frontier since 1996. But it has taken until now to develop the specialized technology the team of engineers and scientists believe will allow them to penetrate the ice sheet without contaminating the pristine waters beneath. Using space age ""clean technology"" -- claimed to be as sterile as surgical equipment -- the team will blast through the ice with a hot water drill at a temperature of 90 degrees Celsius. Using the heat and pressure of the water, the drill will operate for three days to create a 360 mm borehole, which will shrink in diameter by 6 mm an hour as it refreezes. Ice and water from the site will be recycled as drilling fluid, to reduce the potential for contamination. The team will be left with 24 hours to complete the sampling before the borehole -- at 3 km, the deepest ever made using this method -- refreezes. A titanium probe, which took three years to develop, will be lowered into the borehole, and a small coring device at its tip will be inserted a few centimeters into the lake floor sediment at the bottom. The probe will then collect 50 ml samples at intervals as it rises, with sensors feeding data back to the team to determine the optimal locations to collect samples. The first stage of the project took place at the start of the year, when an advance party of engineers braved temperatures of -35 degrees Celsius to tow nearly 70 tonnes of equipment and supplies more than 250 km (155 miles) over deep snow and crevasses through the Ellsworth mountain range to the drilling site. The equipment was ""winterized,"" and fitted with GPS transmitters so it could be relocated later beneath flurries of windblown snow. The team hopes to begin drilling on December 14 with the first samples brought to the surface by December 18. But treacherous conditions on the ice mean their schedule is at the mercy of the elements. Nevertheless, Siegert is confident of success. ""It's taken us a long time of planning but we are in a wonderful place,"" he said. The team's progress can be followed on its website, on Facebook and Twitter.","A British scientific expedition plans to probe a lake beneath a glacier in Antarctica .

"(CNN) -- As a young competitive gymnast, Melissa Stockwell's heart would fill with pride as she looked at the American flag and sang the national anthem before every meet. When anyone would ask her what she wanted to be when she grew up, she would say she wanted to join the Army. Stockwell's parents thought she was going through a phase, but she joined the ROTC program while at the University of Colorado in Boulder. After graduating with a communications degree in 2002, she was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army's Transportation Corps. At 23 years old, Stockwell was deployed to Iraq in March 2004. Less than a month later, her life changed forever. She was part of a routine convoy going through central Baghdad when a big explosion went off. ""Think of the loudest noise you can imagine and our vehicle starts to swerve,"" she recalls. ""The woman in the front yells IED, IED, we've hit an IED!"" Stockwell's left leg was gone. ""It sounds strange, but as soon as I was told I didn't have my leg, I knew it was going to be OK,"" the veteran says. ""I just kind of had this almost peaceful feeling that, alright, it's going to be alright. Life isn't over."" While recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, Stockwell says she was inspired by other patients. ""You see these other soldiers and these other veterans that are missing two limbs, three limbs, sometimes four limbs ... and I looked at myself and I just really thought I'm one of the lucky ones and I kind of made a decision then that I was going to live my life for those who couldn't."" Stockwell learned to walk with her new leg and become independent, but she knew she wouldn't feel like herself until she got back into sports. Opinion: Every day should be Veterans Day . ""Luckily there are organizations out there that really grab the wounded veterans from their hospital rooms and get them out doing things that they may not have ever done with two legs,"" she says. Four months after her injury, she went skiing in Colorado. The experience gave her an incredible feeling of freedom and opened up a world of new possibilities. After spending a year at Walter Reed, the Purple Heart and Bronze Star recipient medically retired from the Army. Stockwell went back to school for a new career in prosthetics at Century College in Minnesota. ""Basically you fit amputees with artificial limbs,"" she says. ""I didn't know the field existed until I needed a leg, but then I thought, 'Well that's pretty cool.' "" After moving to Minnesota, she joined her first competitive swim team. A presentation about the Paralympics inspired her to fight for her country on a new battlefield. ""I dreamed of going to the Olympics when I was younger,"" she says. ""And now it was almost like I had a second chance. So I decided to try in the sport of swimming. It was easy for me to swim. I didn't have to wear a prosthetic leg."" In 2008, Stockwell became the first Iraq war veteran to be chosen for the U.S. Paralympic Team. She felt like her life had come full circle: ""It made me feel so, so alive."" Today the 32-year-old veteran works as a certified prosthetist at Scheck and Siress in Chicago and runs a triathlon club she started with friends Keri Schindler and Dan Tun two years ago. Dare2Tri provides adaptive equipment and coaches for athletes with disabilities. Cancer survivor and amputee Hailey Danisewicz says Dare2Tri has taught her that, ""my possibilities as a person are endless and that I can do anything that I put my mind to."" In October Danisewicz placed second at the Paratriathlon World Championships in New Zealand.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's oldest son disputed Dr. Conrad Murray's claim, given in his police interview, that the doctor comforted him and his siblings in the emergency room after they learned their father was dead, according to a Jackson family member who was with the children that day. Prince Jackson told his family that Murray's account played in his involuntary manslaughter trial this week was not true, Trent Jackson, the nephew of Katherine and Joe Jackson, said Thursday. ""Perfect storm"" of drugs killed Jackson, sleep expert says . Jackson family members were upset that jurors may sympathize with Murray because of perceived compassion for the children that day, Jackson told CNN. ""I hugged them all, gave comfort to Paris, comfort to Prince, comfort to Blanket, which is the last little guy, because whenever they were sick, they would always ask for Dr. Conrad,"" Murray told detectives two days after Jackson's death in 2009. Trent Jackson, who drove Katherine Jackson to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where doctors were trying to revive her son, said Murray did not have a conversation with Paris Jackson, the 12-year-old daughter, as he told police. ""She asked me, 'Dr. Murray, you said you save a lot of patients. You know, you save people with heart attacks, and you couldn't save my dad,"" Murray told detectives. ""I said, 'I tried my best.' And she said, 'I know that, Dr. Murray. At least I know. I know you tried your best. I know you tried your best, but I'm really sad. You know, I will wake up in the morning, and I won't be able to see my daddy.'"" Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson were initially kept in an SUV outside of the emergency room after they followed the ambulance carrying their father to the hospital, Trent Jackson said. Frank Dileo, who was Michael Jackson's manager, later escorted them inside after their grandmother arrived, according to Trent Jackson. Murray never spoke to Michael Jackson's mother at the emergency room, contrary to his statement to police, Trent Jackson said. While the truthfulness of Murray's interview is a major issue in the trial, it is not expected that Michael Jackson's 14-year-old son Prince will be called to testify, the relative said. Katherine Jackson, who has custody of the children, is opposed to any of them being called as witnesses, he said. Prosecutors are near a conclusion to their direct presentation in Murray's trial, but rebuttal witnesses could be called next week after the defense rests its case.","Prince Jackson disputes doctor's account of events, family member says .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- A new barter market in Mexico City is helping residents trade their trash for food in an effort to reduce the mountain of waste produced by the mega city. Mexico City's huge, infamous Bordo Poniente landfill site was receiving 12,600 tons of waste a day -- one and a quarter times the weight of the Eiffel Tower -- before it was shut down in December last year. But although the landfill is is no longer in operation, the city keeps churning out trash. That's why the local government has launched several measures to reduce the waste created by the 20 million people who call the city home. The Mercado de Trueque began in March this year and has proved an instant hit with residents. Jose Luis Aranda is one of thousands of locals who are now making regular visits to the market held once a month in the city's Chapultepec Park. Along with his housemates, Aranda brings along glass, plastic and cardboard waste, which is separated and weighed. He is then given vouchers, which can be exchanged at a nearby farmers' market. The vendors at the market hail from local farms, adding the benefit of attracting shoppers to locally produced food. For Aranda, it's not just about buying vegetables to eat. He also picks up baby lettuce plants, which he plans to grow at home and sell at the market when he visits again. If he does, it would bring the city's plan full circle, essentially turning trash into food.

"New York (CNN) -- Police say a Long Island man accused of faking his own death to collect on an insurance policy was arrested early Wednesday. Raymond Roth, 47, was arraigned later in the day on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy, and falsely reporting an incident, the Nassau County district attorney's office said in a news release. Bail was set at $100,000 bond or cash, said the office's spokesman, Chris Munzing . He was first reported missing off Jones Beach, New York, on July 28 by his 22-year-old son, Jonathan. After an extensive search lasting several days, New York State Park Police said, authorities learned that Roth was not ""drowned and dead,"" but had instead been pulled over for a speeding violation while driving in South Carolina. Roth's wife, Evana, said she believes her husband and son conspired to fake his death in order to receive life insurance payments after Roth was fired from his job last month. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the alleged ruse until she uncovered an e-mail correspondence between the two men days after her husband disappeared. ""There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort,"" Roth said in an e-mail to his son on July 27, remarking on his plans to travel to Florida. Evana Roth revealed the e-mail during a news conference last week, and police later confirmed it. Jonathan Roth was arrested by state police last week and faces charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, and filing a false report, the district attorney's office said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client, saying, ""There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here"" from the father. Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, said his client denies that allegation ""completely ... They were not working together. My client wanted to disappear. He was under a tremendous amount of pressure and he was under medication that was exacerbating his condition."" Davis added that Raymond Roth was treated at a hospital for two weeks after he reappeared for ""acting erratically"" and for potential self-endangerment . Evana Roth said during the news conference last week that she was ""disgusted ... angry."" ""There's no way to describe that he could even have possibly thought of being able to get away with this,"" she added. More from CNN Justice: . JFK plotter accused of planning attacks on attorneys .

"(CNN) -- Mike Cianciullo hated the stares. Whenever his family went out to eat, strangers' eyes would follow -- gawking at the sizes of father and son, judging the food on their plates. At 5 feet 7 inches, Cianciullo weighed 321 pounds. His son, Matt, was 5 feet 3 inches and weighed 333 pounds. ""It's like they'd never seen a fat person before,"" Cianciullo recalls. For Mike, the decision to go through with weight loss surgery was about stopping those stares, getting in shape and, most importantly, saving his son's life. In denial . When his dad first approached him about going to a weight loss clinic, 17-year-old Matt Cianciullo was hesitant. Unlike many children who are bullied because of their weight, Matt had a lot of friends and didn't really see his size as an issue. Matt was more concerned about his dad's health. Mike was on medication for acid reflux disease, hypertension and high cholesterol. ""To think that, that young, I might lose him before I was 20 -- it's not something you want,"" Matt says. ""And I always thought if I kept going down the same path, I would be like him or worse."" Still, Matt was nervous. Surgery seemed dangerous. Maybe, he thought, I'll just try dieting again. Fear stops many people from getting weight loss procedures done, says Dr. Carson Liu, the Cianciullo's doctor and a bariatric surgeon in Los Angeles. But often the biggest obstacle is denial -- they don't want to admit they can't do it on their own. ""The hardest thing for patients to do is pick up the phone and go see a doctor,"" Liu says. ""They see it as a kind of defeat."" Bariatric surgery doesn't help obese live longer, study finds . There are several types of bariatric surgery. Most cost between $18,000 and $30,000. Gastric bypass has been the ""gold standard,"" Liu says, since the 1990s. With gastric bypass, a new stomach about the size of a golf ball is created laparoscopically by cutting across the top of the stomach and connecting the smaller pouch with the intestines. Mike knew about gastric bypass but didn't like how invasive it was; he didn't know if he wanted to restructure his internal organs that way. Then he started seeing commercials for Lap-Band. The Food and Drug Administration approved Allergan Inc.'s Lap-Band Adjustable Gastric Banding System in February 2011. (Liu sits on Allergan's doctor approval board.) The first adjustable gastric band, Ethicon Edno-Surgery Inc.'s REALIZE, was approved in 2007. Both bands are placed laparoscopically around the upper portion of the stomach in an outpatient procedure that generally takes 45 minutes to an hour. The devices can be tightened or loosened at subsequent doctor's visits, helping patients ""feel full faster, eat less and lose weight."" And unlike gastric bypass, adjustable gastric band procedures can be easily reversed. The FDA has approved the Lap-Band for patients over 18 with a BMI over 40, or patients with a BMI over 30 who also have a serious obesity-related condition like high-blood pressure or sleep apnea. Surgery no quick fix for obese teens . Mike had a BMI of 50. His son's was 59. ""With all the excess weight on him, it was putting so much stress on his heart,"" Mike says. ""For me this would be a good thing. My son needed it."" Two years, 200 pounds . Shortly after Father's Day 2009, Mike and Matt were ready for surgery. Mike was ready to give up the Italian food he loved as a child; Matt was determined to no longer constantly eat just because he was bored. They had completed all the prerequisites. Liu asks patients to lose 5 to 10 pounds before undergoing anesthesia, to ensure they're willing to make the serious commitment that's forthcoming. He stresses that the Lap-Band is just a tool to help patients lose weight. ""The main thing we talk about is motivation,"" Liu says. ""If they can't change their lifestyle, they aren't going to lose more than 30 to 40 pounds."" That might seem like a lot to some, but most who undergo the surgery have 80 to 100 pounds to lose. And if they don't eat right and exercise, they'll most likely gain it all back. The Cianciullos also knew about the risks. The FDA lists possible complications from the Lap-Band procedure: vomiting, difficulty swallowing, gastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal pain, pulmonary embolism or leaking that could lead to death. Weight-loss surgery may raise risk of alcohol abuse . Fortunately, their dual procedures went smoothly. Mike and Matt were on a liquid diet for two weeks after surgery, and then ate only soft foods for another two weeks. It would be several more weeks before they learned what they could eat and how much. ""You have to chew your food really well, 20 to 25 times before you swallow,"" Mike says. ""The more fibrous vegetables, they don't digest as well. The skin of peaches, apples, don't digest well."" Carbohydrates are pretty much off-limits as well, Matt says. Before the surgery, he would usually have a sandwich, chips and soda or a few pieces of pizza for lunch. Now he eats maybe half a chicken breast and half a cucumber. Dinners used to be double servings. Now he orders off the kids' menu at restaurants and can barely eat half. ""When food gets stuck, it's painful. It feels like you're having a heart attack or something,"" Matt says. The results, though, have been phenomenal. Matt has dropped 160 pounds; his dad has lost more than 100. ""It's been fun and exciting to watch them,"" says his mom, Martha. ""They're happy. Matt is always out now, compared to what he used to be. And my husband ... he likes to share his story with everybody. Even with people he doesn't even know."" Matt was named Liu's patient of the month. ""He was so shy and introverted, never looked people in the eye,"" Liu says. ""When he lost 100 pounds he opened up and came out of his shell. Plus the guy ate chicken all day long."" Liu likes when family members tackle weight loss together. They motivate each other to stick with the diet, keep junk food out of the house and keep moving. Matt and Mike had a sense of competition -- when his dad was losing weight more quickly, Matt took up basketball to catch up. At 170 pounds, Matt is almost to his goal weight of 150. He plans to swim more and try other activities that he couldn't do when he was bigger. He also hopes to help other obese teens by sharing his story. Mike is working on reaching his goal weight as well. He knows as an adult it's more difficult to lose the weight, but he keeps pushing forward. ""I really want to be as healthy as possible for my family.""","Mike Cianciullo and his son Matt were extremely obese, with BMIs over 50 .

"Riverside, California (CNN) -- Authorities said Wednesday they are reasonably sure that the body found inside the burned cabin near Big Bear Lake, California, is that of Christopher Dorner, the rogue ex-cop who had been pursuing a vendetta against his fellow officers. ""We believe that this investigation is over, at this point, and we'll just need to move on from here,"" San Bernardino Sheriff John McMahon told reporters. Although the description and behavior of the man who was killed are consistent with Dorner, officials ""cannot absolutely, positively confirm it was him,"" McMahon said. ""We're not currently involved in a manhunt,"" he said. ""Our coroner's division is trying to confirm the identity through forensics."" Authorities say Dorner launched a guerrilla war against the Los Angeles Police Department over what he considered his unfair dismissal in 2009. Ex-LAPD cop gains sympathizers on social media . McMahon identified a sheriff's detective who was fatally shot Tuesday by the man presumed to have been Dorner as Jeremiah MacKay. MacKay, 35, was a 15-year veteran who was married with two children, a 7-year-old daughter and a 4-month-old son. Another officer has undergone ""a couple of different surgeries"" after being wounded in the shootout. ""He's in good spirits and should make a full recovery after a number of additional surgeries,"" McMahon said. The two men were ambushed Tuesday when they responded to a report of a vehicle stolen by a suspect matching Dorner's description, McMahon said. ""It was like a war zone, and our deputies continued to go into that area and tried to neutralize and stop the threat,"" McMahon said. ""The rounds kept coming, but our deputies didn't give up."" The suspect then fled into a nearby vacant cabin, which caught fire after police shot tear gas canisters into it, McMahon said. Although the canisters included pyrotechnic tear gas, which generates heat, ""We did not intentionally burn down that cabin to get Mr. Dorner out,"" McMahon said. It wasn't clear when a formal identification could be made of the charred remains found in the cabin about 100 miles east of Los Angeles after Tuesday's shootout with police. Until then, ""a lot of apprehension"" remains in the ranks of the LAPD, Lt. Andy Neiman said. Opinion: Don't focus on Chris Dorner's politics . 'A very trying time' for the LAPD . ""It's been a very trying time over the last couple of weeks for all of those involved and all those families, friends and everybody that has been touched by this incident,"" he said. On Wednesday, police from around the Los Angeles area and beyond gathered to bury Michael Crain, who was among the four people fatally shot, allegedly by the 33-year-old former Navy officer. Dorner also killed the daughter of a former LAPD captain and her fiance and shot three other officers, including Crain's partner, police say. A squad of bagpipers led Crain's flag-draped casket through a cordon of blue uniforms into a church in Riverside, the Los Angeles suburb where the 34-year-old police officer had served 11 years on the force. The mourners inside the church included California Gov. Jerry Brown, his Highway Patrol chief and law enforcement from a number of other agencies around the region. ""I knew that communities would reach out, and I knew a lot of people loved Mike,"" Regina Crain, the slain officer's widow, told them. ""And I knew that I would have support no matter what. But I really did not realize the sheer scale of this, and how many people are touched by his life. It gives me really great comfort to see that, and I want to thank you all."" Timeline in manhunt . Investigators began scouring the mountains February 7, when investigators found Dorner's scorched pickup. Police, sheriff's deputies and federal agents swarmed into the area, working through a weekend blizzard, but the trail was cold for days. On Sunday, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said it had scaled back the search. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced a $1 million reward for information leading to Dorner's arrest and conviction, spurring hundreds of tips. The trail picked up again on Tuesday, when Karen and Jim Reynolds came upon a man who looked like Dorner in their house across the street from the sheriff's command center in the Big Bear area. He tied them up and took off in their purple Nissan, according to police. The unit had been unoccupied since January 29 and they had last done some work on it on February 6, Karen Reynolds told reporters. They returned on Tuesday to continue working on the apartment, she said. ""We had come into the living room and he opened the door and came out at us,"" she said. ""He yelled, 'Stay calm,'"" Jim Reynolds said. ""When he jumped out and hollered, 'Stay calm!' Karen screamed and turned and started running and he ran after her and he caught her on the staircase and brought her back."" Dorner tried to calm them, the couple said. ""He had his gun drawn the whole time,"" Karen Reynolds said. He ordered them to lie down and bound their hands behind their backs with plastic ties, telling them he would not kill them, but needed transportation out of Big Bear, they said. He then gagged them, put pillowcases on their heads and left, they said. Throughout, he was calm, they said. ""He said I don't have a problem with you, I just want to clear my name,"" Jim Reynolds said. The man then took their 2011 Nissan Rogue, they said. It was not clear how long he had been there, a bag of carrots and milk were in the refrigerator, they said. At around 12:20 p.m., some 15 minutes after he left, they freed themselves and called 911 to report the incident, they said. ""We're very happy to be alive,"" Karen Reynolds said. ""I didn't wish him dead though ... I prayed for him a lot and I'm praying for his family now."" A 'guy with a big gun' At 12:45 p.m., Fish and Wildlife wardens spotted the SUV and began pursuing it. Dorner tried to evade them by swerving around a pair of empty school buses and ducking down a side road, but crashed the Nissan. Rick Heltebrake, a camp ranger, said he was driving when he saw the crashed purple vehicle -- and then something terrifying. How authorities identify a burned body . ""Here comes this guy with a big gun, and I knew who it was right away,"" Heltebrake told CNN affiliate KTLA. ""He just came out of the snow at me with his gun at my head. He said, 'I don't want to hurt you. Just get out of the car and start walking.' "" Heltebrake said the man let him take his dog and walk away with his hands up. Dorner took off -- but was soon spotted by the wildlife wardens again, and a shootout ensued. ""Not more than 10 seconds later, I heard a loud round of gunfire,"" Heltebrake said. ""Ten to 20 rounds, maybe. I found out later what that was all about."" Dorner shot up one of the wardens' trucks; the warden returned fire with a rifle, firing 20 shots, the Deparment of Fish and Wildlife said. Dorner fled to a nearby cabin and got into another shootout, this time with the San Bernardino County deputies, killing one and wounded another. Some of the firefight between police and the suspect was captured live on the telephone of a reporter for CNN affiliates KCBS and KCAL. Police in Los Angeles listened live over police scanners broadcast on the Internet, LAPD Lt. Andy Neiman said. ""It was horrifying to listen to that firefight,"" he said. ""To hear those words, 'officer down,' is the most gut-wrenching experience you can have as a police officer, because you know what that means."" Audio from a Los Angeles television station captured the sound of someone early in the standoff shouting, ""Burn it down ... burn that goddamn house down. Burn it down."" It's not clear who used those words. But the order to use smoke canisters -- ""burners"" -- didn't come for another two hours, according to San Bernardino County sheriff's radio traffic. ""Seven burners deployed, and we have a fire,"" one officer reported at 4:16 p.m. (7:16 p.m. ET). Five minutes later, a single gunshot was reported from inside the house. A senior officer ordered units around the cabin, ""Stand by. Maintain your discipline."" About a minute after that, officers reported ammunition exploding inside. Sheriff's investigators confirmed overnight that they had found charred human remains among the ashes. Dorner cheered in some quarters . Dorner had vowed to kill police officers to avenge what he called his unfair termination. He was fired after accusing his training officer of kicking a suspect during a July 2007 arrest, a complaint the LAPD concluded was unfounded. The department accused him of lying to superiors and to internal affairs investigators and forced him out in January 2009. Dorner challenged his dismissal in court but was unsuccessful. Dorner was first named a suspect in two shooting deaths on February 3: Monica Quan, the daughter of his police union representative, and her fiance, Keith Lawrence. Police say he killed Crain and wounded Crain's partner in an ambush on their patrol car February 7. They say he also wounded an LAPD officer who chased him in the suburban city of Corona, California. In a manifesto announcing his planned rampage, Dorner said nothing had changed in the LAPD since its scandals of the 1990s, the Rodney King beating and the Rampart police corruption case. Those allegations have struck a chord with some who say that, despite the four killings, Dorner was seeking justice. Shadowed by that history, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck announced Saturday that the department would re-examine its proceedings against Dorner. The review is ""not to appease a murderer,"" but ""to reassure the public that their police department is transparent and fair in all things we do,"" he said. CNN's Miguel Marquez, Paul Vercammen, Stan Wilson, Casey Wian, Kathleen Johnston, Alan Duke, Lateef Mungin, Chelsea J. Carter, Michael Martinez, Holly Yan and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","Slain officer's widow thanks mourners: ""A lot of people loved Mike""

"(CNN) -- The Beach Boys were all smiles this week when they unveiled their exhibit at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles. Earlier this year, they put aside their differences to reunite in a very public way: on-stage at ""The 54th Annual Grammy Awards."" That was followed by the release of their first album of new material in 20 years, and an extensive worldwide tour to celebrate their 50th anniversary. All five members -- Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston and David Marks -- seemed genuinely excited when talking about their reunion. ""The value of the music is so good,"" Love said. ""Good vibrations, you might say."" But good vibrations may now be a thing of the past. Just before the Grammy Museum celebration, Love and Johnston issued a press release announcing they would be hitting the road with their own incarnation of the Beach Boys. According to the tersely worded statement, ""The post-50th anniversary configuration will not include Brian Wilson, Al Jardine and David Marks. The 50th Reunion Tour was designed to be a set tour with a beginning and an end to mark a special 50-year milestone for the band."" A blindsided Wilson said, ""I'm disappointed and can't understand why he (Love) doesn't want to tour with Al, David and me. We are out here having so much fun. After all, we are the real Beach Boys."" The Brian Wilson-Mike Love version of the Beach Boys has just arrived in London for the final two dates of their reunion tour. If the splintered Beach Boy factions can't come to an agreement about their future, the September 28 concert at Wembley Stadium may be the last we see of this particular lineup. Wilson has said he'd like his next project to be a rock 'n' roll album. Right now, he doesn't know who he'll be working with on the record, but adds that he'd like it to be the Beach Boys. 50 years of teen bliss: Serenaded by the Beach Boys .","Beach Boys near end of 50th anniversary tour .

"(CNN) -- American contractor Alan P. Gross has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for crimes against the Cuban state. Gross, 61, was found guilty of working on a ""subversive"" U.S. project intended to undermine the Cuban government by distributing illegal satellite communications equipment, according to Cubadebate, a state-run website in Cuba. The United States has said that Gross was helping the island's small Jewish community connect to the internet. The verdict comes on the heels of last week's two-day trial in Havana. The Cuban prosecution had been asking for a 20-year sentence. ""The Gross family is devastated by the verdict and harsh sentence announced today by the Cuban authorities,"" defense attorney Peter J. Kahn said in a written statement. ""Having already served a 15-month sentence in a Cuban prison, Alan and his family have paid an enormous personal price in the long-standing political feud between Cuba and the United States."" Kahn pledged to ""continue to work with Alan's Cuban attorney in exploring any and all options available to him, including the possibility of an appeal."" He has called for the contractor's immediate release on humanitarian grounds. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor quickly responded to Saturday's ruling, saying that it ""adds another injustice to Alan Gross's ordeal."" ""He has already spent too many days in detention and should not spend one more,"" Vietor said. ""We urge the immediate release of Mr. Gross so that he can return home to his wife and family."" Gross' wife, Judy, attended the trial with her attorney. Three U.S. officials also attended as observers. His mother has recently been diagnosed with lung cancer and their daughter is recovering from a double mastectomy. Gross has been held at the high-security Villa Marista prison after being detained at Havana's international airport in December 2009. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters Friday that Gross had been ""unjustly jailed for far too long."" ""He needs to be able to leave Cuba and return home,"" Clinton said. ""This is a matter of great personal pain to his family and concern to the U.S. government."" His detention and subsequent sentencing have brought an apparent standstill to tentative efforts by both countries to overcome years of hostility. Gross had been working for Development Alternatives Incorporated, a Maryland-based subcontractor that received a multimillion-dollar U.S. contract for democracy-building efforts on the island nation. He had repeatedly traveled to Cuba using a tourist visa. ""We are profoundly disappointed by today's verdict and sentence,"" said DAI President and Chief Executive James Boomgard. ""Alan Gross has been accused of doing nothing more than giving peaceful people access to the internet,"" Boomgard said, adding that his detention has been ""without the benefit of due process and in violation of international law."" Boomgard has asked Cuba ""in light of the critical medical situation confronting Alan and his family"" to release Gross on humanitarian grounds. Last year, the topic of Gross' imprisonment prompted one of the highest-level diplomatic exchanges between the two countries in recent years. During the U.N. General Assembly in New York, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Arturo Valenzuela spoke with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez in a meeting intended to ""encourage the release"" of Gross. Cuba is one of a handful of places -- including Iran and Myanmar -- where the U.S. funds what it calls democracy-building initiatives without the host country's permission.","Alan P.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray's delay in calling 911 for help as soon as he realized Michael Jackson was not breathing may have cost the pop icon his life, according to a cardiologist who testified Wednesday in Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial. Dr. Alon Steinberg, a cardiologist called as an expert witness by the prosecution, listed Murray's failure to immediately call for paramedics as one of six examples of gross negligence that contributed to Jackson's death. ""If these deviations would not have happened, Mr. Jackson would be alive,"" Steinberg testified. Earlier Wednesday, Murray's defense team dropped its theory that Jackson may have orally ingested the surgical anesthetic propofol that the coroner says killed him. Lawyers for Murray will instead focus on the theory that Jackson used a syringe to inject the fatal overdose through a catheter on his left leg while Murray was away from his bedside. Murray's defense also contends that Jackson swallowed eight tablets of lorazepam, a sedative, in a desperate search for sleep the day he died. Murray's deviations from medical standards of care include the doctor leaving his patient alone with propofol and lorazepam nearby, which could have led to Jackson self-administering the fatal drugs, Steinberg testified. ""It's like leaving a baby that's sleeping on your kitchen countertop,"" Steinberg said. ""There's a very small chance the baby could fall over, or wake up and grab a knife or something."" The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson's June 25, 2009, death was from ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with several sedatives, including lorazepam. Prosecutors argue that Murray is criminally responsible for Jackson's death because his use of propofol to treat the singer's insomnia was grossly negligent and an extreme deviation from the standard of care required of physicians. Murray should be found guilty even if jurors accept the theory that Jackson self-administered the fatal dose because the doctor was reckless for leaving the drugs near his patient when he was not around, Steinberg testified. The possibility that Jackson drank propofol arose during Murray's preliminary hearing in January, when a prosecution expert agreed with the defense that a higher level of propofol in his stomach compared to his blood suggested it could have happened. Both prosecution and defense experts conducted tests on animals since January's preliminary hearing on the ""bio-availability"" of propofol if consumed orally. Defense attorney Michael Flanagan agreed Wednesday that the studies showed ""propofol, when orally ingested, is not bio-available."" Another study, conducted over the summer on university students in Chile, concluded ""if you drink propofol, it will have trivial effects on the person,"" Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said. ""Oral propofol did not kill Michael Jackson,"" he said. The defense, in a rare moment in the trial, agreed. ""We are not going to assert at any point in time that Michael Jackson orally ingested propofol,"" Flanagan said. With about three days of defense testimony expected, closing arguments could be just a week away. Steinberg is the first of three experts who will wrap up the prosecution's case. Steinberg said he based his conclusions on Murray's own words to detectives in an interview two days after Jackson's death. That interview was played for jurors in the previous two days of the trial. Jackson would be alive today if Murray had called 911 for help within two minutes of realizing Jackson was not breathing, instead of waiting about 20 minutes before asking a security guard to call, Steinberg said. Earlier testimony revealed Murray did ask Jackson's chef to send a security guard upstairs to help him about five minutes after the time prosecutors suggest he realized there was a problem with Jackson. The chef, however, testified that she sent Jackson's 12-year-old son upstairs instead of security. Steinberg said the use of propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia was another extreme deviation from standards that contributed to Jackson's death. He later acknowledged a recent report from China that the anesthetic had been successfully used to treat chronic insomnia, but he suggested it needed more study to be accepted. Sleep expert Dr. Nader Kamangar testified later Wednesday that propofol has no therapeutic value in treating insomnia, and to use it is unethical and an extreme deviation from the standards of care. ""It is beyond comprehension,"" Kamangar said. ""It is frankly disturbing,"" Steinberg said he based his conclusions on his belief that Murray had connected Jackson to an IV drip of propofol after he gave him an injection of propofol. That assumption, he said, was made because Murray told police he had used such a drip on most previous nights. When Flanagan challenged him to show where in Murray's police interview he said he used a drip the day Jackson died, he eventually said ""I will agree with you, it's not completely clear."" Steinberg also said it was gross negligence that Murray was not prepared for an emergency, such as having a generator in case there was a power failure. A sleep expert and an anesthesiologist are expected to follow Steinberg on the witness stand Wednesday and Thursday. The pathologist who conducted the autopsy on Jackson testified Tuesday that while it was physically possible that Jackson could have given himself the overdose that killed him, Murray is still guilty of causing his death because he gave him access to the dangerous drugs. Dr. Christopher Rogers said Murray's admission in a police interview that he used propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia was a factor in his conclusion that it was a homicide, not an accidental death. He said Murray's use of propofol in Jackson's home without proper monitoring and resuscitation equipment or a ""precision dosing device"" contributed to the singer's propofol overdose and subsequent death. ""Essentially, the doctor would be estimating how much propofol he would be giving,"" Rogers testified. ""I think it would be easy under those circumstances for the doctor to estimate wrong and give too much propofol."" Murray, in the interview played for the jury over the past two days of testimony, told detectives he gave Jackson a series of three sedatives -- Valium, lorazepam and midazolam -- over a 10-hour period before finally giving in to Jackson's plea for propofol. ""I've got to sleep, Dr. Conrad,"" Murray said Jackson pleaded to him. ""I have these rehearsals to perform. I must be ready for the show in England. Tomorrow I will have to cancel my performance, because you know I cannot function if I don't get to sleep."" Murray said he injected a small dose of propofol using a syringe, but the prosecution contends he also used a makeshift IV setup to keep Jackson medicated and asleep. That drip may have malfunctioned while the doctor was not monitoring his patient, they contend. The propofol bottle that prosecutors say Murray used for the IV drip had a slit in the rubber top, which Rogers said is evidence it was part of the drip system. On the recording, Murray insisted he kept a close watch on Jackson after he finally fell asleep. The physician never mentioned the long list of e-mails and calls that cell phone records later revealed. Rogers testified it was unlikely that Jackson self-administered the deadly dose of propofol in the two minutes Murray said he was away from him, but he conceded under defense questioning that it was physically possible. Jackson could have reached the IV port near his left knee to self-inject propofol, he said. If Jackson pushed the drug in quickly, it could have made his heart stop immediately, Rogers said. Rogers later added, under questioning by the prosecutor, that he would still consider it a homicide even if Jackson administered the fatal overdose to himself since the doctor would have been negligent in leaving the drugs nearby. His testimony also gave some support to the defense theory that Jackson orally ingested an overdose of lorazepam from a pill bottle next to his bed. A toxicology study of Jackson's stomach contents, conducted in recent months, showed a level of lorazepam four times higher in the stomach that in his blood. ""There would have to be some oral lorazepam taken somewhere along the line,"" Rogers testified, after taking a moment to do some quick math while on the witness stand. Murray was hired as Jackson's personal physician while the singer prepared for his ""This Is It"" comeback concerts in London, planned to start in July 2009. If convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Murray could spend four years in a California prison and lose his medical license.","NEW: Sleep expert says using propofol to treat insomnia is ""beyond comprehension""

"(CNN) -- My parents always told me I could do anything I wanted. They told me I could be anything I wanted if I studied hard, got good grades and treated people well. They were right. They never said to me, however, that I could have it all. The notion that women can have it all, in the way society defines ""all,"" is a ridiculous myth. That's OK. What matters is I have my version of ""all."" What is easy to forget at the core of it is: What do we actually want? Not what does society expect from us. And not what do our mothers and fathers expect from us, though the latter helps shape our fundamental views on this subject. The real question is: What will make us happy? It sounds simple. But it is not simple precisely because there has been so much buildup of expectations from society as to what a good mother and a successful career woman should be. And none of it is based in reality. As a Latina mother of two young children, I have chosen to follow a tough, grueling, demanding, sometimes discriminating, yet very rewarding career in communications, politics, community advocacy and the private sector, beating back cultural pressure to marry and have children in my 20s and early 30s. Sandberg: Speak up, believe in yourself, take risks . To the chagrin of my mother, my own motherhood choices came later in life. I had my first child at age 38, after I was able to carve out quite a bit of career success. This gave me the ability to find an executive position with flexibility and autonomy, which helped ease the burden of guilt and pain when I first left my baby boy -- and later my baby girl -- to go back to work full time. I could not have done any of this without an amazing husband and partner who sacrificed some of his own professional ambitions to partly stay home with our children during their infant years. (What would my old-fashoined machista Colombian father think about that?) But no matter how nurturing and caring husbands are and how much we trust them to fulfill our children's every need, the pangs of a working mother never subside. Guilt pangs, pangs of wanting to be there to not miss a single thing, pangs of letting your children down because you are not at their side every waking minute. For those of us who have chosen to be working moms, the flip side is also true. When you do have the fulfillment of being at home with the kids, there is a slight pang of guilt nudging you to work on that memo, that proposal, read those news stories, think through that new client pitch. Just this week, I left an important annual dinner, full of rich networking opportunities, to be home for my son so he could finish a school project. The concept of ""having it all"" is individual. Maybe it means being all you can be in the choices you have made and ensuring you are doing your best in the role or roles you are carrying out. Maybe it means trying to have one piece at a time. I chose to focus on my career first, to establish myself and then have some flexibility to have a more fulfilling family life. But many women don't want to wait that long to have children, or worse, have waited only to find heartbreak when they try and cannot get pregnant. Some of my childhood friends chose the opposite timing. They had children early and now that their children are grown, they are focusing on fulfilling their professional dreams. Confessions of a busy mom: 5 lessons . Some of my friends have chosen -- gasp! -- to either not have children and focus 100% on their careers or to give up their successful and lucrative professions to dedicate themselves entirely to their families. Both are perfectly fine choices to make. Instead of judging the choices women make, we should rejoice in the fact that we have the ability to make these choices at all. I believe that true feminism does not lie in having to prove that we can be both doting mothers and high-powered career professionals at the same time and do both 100% well 100% of the time. We can't. No one can. Anyone who says differently is lying or not facing reality. The beauty of what the feminist movement has brought today's women is that these choices are available to us. My mother did not have the luxury to choose. She married my father and took care of us. She worked early on as a secretary, and enjoyed it greatly. Then my father demanded she quit to focus on the family. She did. When I found out this family lore, I was outraged, having been brought up by this same mother and father to be an outspoken, independent-minded woman. But then I had to take a step back and realize it was a different time, a different era and a different country. For me and my husband, it is important that in our choices we are setting examples for our kids that it is natural for girls to be strong leaders and for mothers and women to work in demanding careers, and for boys to be nurturers and for dads and men to be the primary care-givers, and vice versa. My hope is that this ""dilemma"" will not even be an afterthought for my daughter. That she will choose what makes her happy. And that will be the definition of ""having it all."" Work, family and 'leaning in': Seven families trying to make it work . We must acknowledge that many women, because of differing circumstances, may not have the luxury to make choices. We are fortunate to live in a country that allows many of us to pave our own way and to make the choices that are best for us, our families, and if we decide to have them, our children. We can embrace our choice, or change it along the way, in the pursuit of happiness. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maria Cardona.","Maria Cardona: The notion that women can have it all is a myth .

"(EW.com) -- On Sunday, Lifetime premieres ""Liz & Dick,"" its Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton biopic starring Lindsay Lohan and Grant Bowler. Exec producer Larry Thompson openly admits Lohan brought with her a younger demographic (and headlines) but also risk. He first met with Lohan about the project last December but cameras didn't roll until June. ""When we first met with her, she had two probations, and when we finally closed the deal with her, there was only one probation,"" Thompson says. ""If we couldn't have gotten insurance, there would have been no movie. We wound up having to go to Lloyd's of London to get what we called incarceration insurance.... We had to protect ourselves that if she were to have violated her probation during production, we wouldn't have had to close down and lose our movie."" ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: How did you approach Grant Bowler after having cast Lindsay? LARRY THOMPSON: It wasn't until I had Grant that I slept. It wasn't until I saw Grant Bowler and Lindsay meet in that room and I saw the chemistry that I knew I could make Liz and Dick live again. EW: Was it difficult to cast someone opposite Lindsay knowing he might have concerns? EW Daily Poll: What will you do on Black Friday? Thompson: It was. I looked at every actor from Wales there was. I looked at every actor from the U.K. there was. And I wound up hiring a guy from New Zealand to play the most famous Welsh actor of all time. So it's the magic of Hollywood. I think Grant Bowler is just fantastic in the movie. EW: You were on the set every day. Is there a moment in the movie when you think Lohan most related to Taylor? Thompson: It was in the ethereal soundstage in black that she most related to Elizabeth Taylor. It was when they're speaking to camera and breaking the fourth wall. Liz and Dick were the first Brangelina, the most famous hunted couple in the world, the first paparazzi couple that's given birth to the celebrity-crazed world that we now live in. That's what fame's about. Fame is the accumulation of all the good, bad, true, untrue, flattering, and non-flattering things said and written about someone when you become iconic. We respect Liz and Dick so much that we wanted to give them the last word, meaning that fourth-wall interview of them speaking to camera [throughout the film] is the two of them speaking from the grave. We decided to dress them in the ultimate thespian outfit. They're sitting in a director's chair, in all black. It's almost like Hollywood heaven. And what they're saying is, ""Listen, we were this, we were that. The paparazzi said this, the paparazzi said that. All these things written about us â€” let us tell you what they said about us, what was really going on, and how we really felt about each other."" That device, which was my homage to Elizabeth and Richard, has allowed them the last word on themselves as icons and on what the media and the celebrity-crazed world can do with a couple. Maybe if we hadn't had all this attention paid to us, we could have kept it together, but there were too many balls we were trying to keep in the air. That's what Elizabeth's saying. That's what makes it tragic. Liz Taylor 'love nest' trailer trashed during filming . EW: Is there a scene in the movie that you're sure people will assume is totally made up that you want to assure them isn't? Thompson: I believe that the scene in which Eddie Fisher comes home to that party, and Richard in front of everybody forces her to confess her love for him in front of Eddie, seems so outrageous, but it is so absolutely true, having been reported many, many times over the years as happening just like that. As is every scene in the movie, by the way. The fact that they were denounced by the Pope, that's pretty strong. It's one thing to get a DUI, it's another thing for the Pope to denounce you... I know that when I was a kid, I used to go to the movies and when I would watch a true story about someone who was famous, I believed that to be THE movie. People who make movies have to understand the responsibility you have when you make a biopic. You have to be accurate. It takes a lot of effort and painstaking details to make these movies right, down to the wigs that take place over four decades, even after they're dead. [Laughs] That's hard. EW: Now that you have worked with Lindsay, are you hoping other producers give her a chance? Thompson: I want the best for Lindsay Lohan and anybody who ever hires her. But they have to know that making a movie with Lindsay Lohan is like jumping out of an airplane at 10,000 feet with a bolt of white nylon, a string, and a sewing machine. You're building a parachute as fast as you can. Lohan: Keep me on set, it's safer that way . EW: Your next planned biopic is on Oprah Winfrey. Thompson: I've optioned Kitty Kelley's book [Oprah: A Biography]. We have a fantastic take on her life, and we're talking to networks now, as we speak, and we're interviewing writers right now, too. I am from Mississippi, as is Oprah Winfrey, and I believe that her start on a rural country road in Mississippi to the world stage that she lives is a journey that is nothing less than miraculous. I think it will be the most fascinating biopic I've ever done. I've made the Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz movie [Lucy & Desi: Before the Laughter]. I've made the Sonny and Cher movie [And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher Story]. I've made the Duke and Duchess of Windsor movie [The Woman He Loved].

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray, found guilty Monday of causing Michael Jackson's death, begins his new life as an inmate in a section of the Los Angeles County jail where high-profile prisoners are kept, a jail official said. While it is the ""medical area"" that houses inmates on suicide watch, Murray is only there because it has a higher ratio of guards, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Harry Drucker said. Murray's defense team has vowed to appeal his involuntary manslaughter conviction, but first they must deal with his sentencing set for November 29. While Murray was ""devastated"" by the guilty verdict, he is ""confident"" he will win an appeal, defense lawyer Nareg Gourjian said. ""What matters most right now is trying to keep Dr. Murray from taking up a prison cell in this community,"" lead defense lawyer Ed Chernoff said. ""That's what we're focusing on right now and we'll deal with an appeal after that."" Murray served as Jackson's personal physician as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts, with Murray giving him the surgical anesthetic propofol to help him sleep nearly every night for the last two months of his life, according to testimony. Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, was caused by ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with two sedatives, the Los Angeles County coroner ruled. The verdict followed about nine hours of jury deliberations, which began Friday morning in the downtown Los Angeles County courthouse. Murray could be sentenced to as much as four years in a state prison, but his lawyers will ask for probation and ""maybe a little bit"" of time in the county jail, Gourjian said. A new California law aimed at reducing state prison overcrowding and a federal court order addressing county jail overcrowding could combine to significantly reduce Murray's time behind bars. If Murray's conviction is treated as a non-violent felony he could be kept in the county jail, where he could be eligible to serve some of his time at home under monitored house arrest. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor, who will decide Murray's sentence, made it clear when he denied bail Monday that he considered the doctor a threat to public safety. ""This is not a crime involving a mistake of judgment,"" Pastor said. ""This was a crime where the end result was the death of a human being."" Both Chernoff and Gourjian said the defense was not surprised by the guilty verdict. ""I think what went wrong was a lot of the pretrial rulings that were made by the court in reference to some of the evidence that we planned to offer for the jury to consider,"" Gourjian told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""I think that's essentially what denied Dr. Murray a fair trial in this case."" The outcome may have been different had the defense been able to introduce additional evidence -- like on Jackson's past drug use and ""financial condition,"" Gourjian said. Pastor's rulings to limit the defense case could be the basis for an appeal, he said. Murray appeared to show no emotion as the verdict was read by court clerk Sammi Benson Monday afternoon or even as deputies handcuffed him and led him away. A loud celebration erupted among Jackson fans outside of the courthouse, where emotions ran so high at least one woman fainted. Passing cars honked their horns, as people nearby hugged, cried and yelled out in joy. Jackson's family, including by his parents and several of his brothers and sisters, smiled as they left the courthouse. An emotional La Toya Jackson on Monday thanked all those involved in the trial, calling the decision a ""victory."" ""Everybody was wonderful,"" La Toya Jackson told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell as she left the Los Angeles courthouse. A statement released by Jackson's estate Monday said that ""justice has been served."" Deputy District Attorney David Walgren personally expressed his sympathies to the Jackson family who he said lost ""not a pop icon, but a son and brother."" Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley thanked jurors ""for their hard work and thoughtful deliberation,"" and expressed gratitude that they recognized the ""overwhelming"" evidence against Murray in finding him guilty. The seven men and five women on the jury heard 49 witnesses over 23 days, including Murray's girlfriends and patients, Jackson's former employees, investigators and medical experts for each side. Defense lawyers contended the matter was a negligence case that should instead be heard by the state medical board. ""If it were anybody else but Michael Jackson, would this doctor be here today?"" Chernoff asked in his closing. Jurors were left to decide if the propofol overdose was infused into Jackson's blood by a steady intravenous drip, as the prosecution contended, or if Jackson injected himself using a syringe left nearby by Murray, as the defense argued. ""He was just a little fish in a big, dirty pond,"" Chernoff said, pointing the finger at other doctors who treated Jackson, and Jackson himself. Prosecutor Walgren attacked the defense for trying to blame ""everybody but Conrad Murray, poor Conrad Murray."" Walgren painted Murray as a selfish doctor who agreed to take $150,000 a month to give Jackson nightly infusions of propofol in his home, something prosecutors argued an ethical doctor would never do because of the dangers. ""It was a very strong and powerful message that this sort of conduct does rise to the level of criminal negligence, and to the extent someone dies as a result of them playing the role of Dr. Feel Good, they will be held accountable,"" Cooley said after the verdict. Murray's license to practice medicine is now suspended, according to the Medical Board of California, which decides if a doctor can legally work in the state. In the light of the conviction, the board now will open an investigation to determine whether or not to fully revoke Murray's right to practice medicine in the state, spokeswoman Jennifer Simoes said. The main criteria in deciding whether to revoke, suspend or take other action against any doctor is assessing how substantial a crime is related to the practice of medicine. There is no timeline as to when the board might act regarding Murray, said Simoes. CNN's Ted Rowlands and Adam Blaker contributed to this report.","Rulings limiting the defense case could be a basis for appeal, defense says .

"(CNN) -- Russia's child rights ombudsman slammed Texas prosecutors for deciding not to charge the adoptive parents of a Russian boy who died suddenly, Russia's RIA Novosti news agency reported Tuesday. On Monday, the Ector County district attorney said a grand jury declined to indict Laura and Alan Shatto, the adoptive parents of 3-year-old Max Shatto. A Texas coroner had declared Max's death in January accidental, but Moscow demanded a complete report from U.S. officials. Russian Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov claimed the district attorney's office has not done enough in investigating the case of Max, also known as Maxim Kuzmin. ""The Texas prosecutors' position in the case of Maxim Kuzmin is upsetting, because they refused to scrutinize the circumstances of his death,"" Astakhov tweeted, according to RIA Novosti. But District Attorney Bobby Bland said the grand jury found no evidence to charge the Shattos. ""This death was the result of a tragic accident occurring most likely on playground equipment,"" Bland's office said, according to CNN affiliate KOSA. ""When a child dies so young and tragically, it is natural to want to hold someone accountable. However, in this case, there is no evidence to support holding anybody criminally responsible."" Investigating the death . This month, Bland told CNN that said four pathologists and the Ector County medical examiner attributed the death to a laceration of a small bowel mesentery artery because of blunt trauma to the abdominal area. The bruising was consistent with a ""self-inflicted"" injury, Bland said. A statement from the Ector County Sheriff's Office said the boy ""had previously been seen for a behavioral disorder that manifested itself in self-injury and these bruises were consistent with that diagnosis."" Astakhov had accused the adoptive mother of killing the boy and giving him ""psychotropic substances,"" RIA Novosti reported. But toxicology reports were negative, and there were no substances found that could have contributed to the child's death. International strain on adoptions . The death drew international attention after Astakhov said that the boy was ""killed"" or ""murdered."" In February, Astakhov said he tweeted those words based on the initial reports he received about the death but acknowledged he may have spoken too soon. Russia concerned over adopted boy's cause of death . Still, he said he wanted his country to ban all international adoptions of Russian children. Moscow passed a law in December banning adoptions of Russian children by Americans. That pending law was set ostensibly because of documented cases of abuse by adoptive parents. But some say the Russian move was retaliation for a U.S. law that places restrictions on Russian human rights abusers. Max's death aggravated U.S. State Department efforts to push through more than 500 adoption cases in which American families have already begun the process of adopting a Russian child. Americans adopted nearly 1,000 Russian children last year, according to State Department figures. Though the number has been dropping in recent years, Russia remains the third most popular foreign country -- after China and Ethiopia -- for U.S. foreign adoptions.","3-year-old Max Shatto died suddenly in January .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich fired a red-hot warning towards Champions League rivals Arsenal Friday by storming 18 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. Bayern, which faces Arsenal in London in the last-16 Tuesday, claimed a 2-0 win at Vfl Wolfsburg to move ever closer to the title. Jupp Heynckes' side has won 18 of its 22 league matches so far this season, conceding just seven goals in that time. After losing out at its own stadium to Chelsea in last year's Champions League final, Bayern is hoping to go one better this time around. 'Pep will make Bayern's team better' With former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola taking over in time for the 2013/14 season, the German side are looking in great shape as it showed once more with its latest victory. Mario Mandzukic and substitute Arjen Robben scored the goals for Bayern and coach Heynckes was delighted with his side's showing. ""We played against a team who certainly produced their best game of the season. They gave their all,"" he told reporters. ""Wolfsburg were aggressive, ran hard and disturbed our game early on. These are the games we must win, but we showed we have a great team."" The win was Munich's 10th away victory in 11 league matches this season and its fifth consecutive clean sheet away from home. If Bayern can maintain its streak, it could be crowned champion by the middle of April and break the club's own record of 30 matches for the earliest title win, which was set back in the 1972/3 season. 'Super Mario' returns to Italy with Milan . Elsewhere, a late strike from Mario Balotelli gave Milan a 2-1 win over Parma ahead of its Champions League tussle with Barcelona. Milan moved ahead six minutes before the break when Argentine defender Gabriel Paletta put the ball in his own net. Balotelli added a second with 12 minutes remaining, firing home a free-kick, before Parma pulled a goal back through Nicola Sansone. Milan's 13th win of the season moves it up to fourth in the league, leapfrogging rivals Inter, which plays Fiorentina Saturday. In Spain, Deportivo La Coruna remains rooted to the bottom of the Serie A table following a 3-1 defeat at Sevilla. Two goals from Gary Medel and an Ivan Rakitic strike was enough for the home side to prevail with Riki scoring a consolation for Deportivo. Galatasaray agree deal forr Drogba . In Turkey, Didier Drogba came off the bench to score on his Galatasaray debut as his new team defeated Akhisar 2-1. The former Chelsea star replaced Umut Bulut in the 63rd minute before heading in his team's opening goal just five minutes later. Buruk Yilmaz made it 2-0 in the 70th minute with Sertan Vardar cutting the deficit with five minutes remaining. Galatasaray now have an eight point lead over Besiktas at the top of the Turkish first division.","Bayern Munich moves 18 points clear at top of Bundesliga .

"(CNN) -- The top ski destinations know that pleasing the downhill crowd is only part of the snow-filled picture. After all, in the United States alone winter at ski resorts is a $6 billion a year industry, according to the National Ski Areas Association. Mountain biking, Frisbee, golf and zip line adventures are a few activities popular at ski resorts during the ""green"" season, but what's a non-skier to do when the landscape is white? If you've had your fill of snowmobiling, sleigh riding and tubing, here's a smattering of extraordinary pastimes for non-skiers at some of the premier U.S. ski meccas. 7 swanky hotels on the U.S. slopes . ALTERNATE ADVENTURES . Snowkiting in Dillon: If you prefer waterskiing to snow skiing, don't shy away from Colorado's triple-threat of Breckenridge, Keystone and Arapahoe Basin ski resorts â€” even if it's the middle of winter. In a location centrally located to the three ski areas, Colorado KiteForce is replacing downhill thrills with a new winter sport sure to get your adrenaline pumping. It involves a frozen lake, but no ice skates. Instead, strap skis or a snowboard on your feet and let kite power pull you across the frozen tundra of the Dillon Reservoir. It's like windsurfing on the ocean, but with a frosty twist. A two-hour beginner lesson is $175 per person; group rates are available. 7 stunning European ski lodges . Snow biking in Telluride: Mountain bikers flock to Telluride, Colorado, from spring to fall, but there's no reason to stop riding when the snow falls. Local outfitter BootDoctors offers tours on ""fat bikes""-- mountain bikes with oversized wide tires that can be ridden on traditional bike trails but excel in the snow. Rentals are $39 per day, including a helmet. Guided Big Tire Bike and Brew trips, which end with a tour and tasting at Telluride Brewing Co., are $99 for a half-day and $149 for a full day. Newfangled snowshoeing at Lake Tahoe: The option of snowshoeing is nothing new to non-skiers, but at California's Northstar resort, the normally low-key concept is evolving into a competitive sport. Along with tours tailored to families, stargazers and those who want to snowshoe by moonlight, the resort also hosts snowshoe skills and running clinics, a.k.a. intense workouts for the athletes among us. Once you're up to speed in your snowshoes, take part in the Snowshoe Social & Race Series, with upcoming competitions January 27 and March 23. Winter safaris in Yellowstone: Guests at the Four Seasons Resort in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, may opt for enhanced access to the wildlife of Yellowstone National Park on small-group winter safaris. Five guests at a time can join a wildlife biologist and a naturalist on a four-hour journey tailored to the group's wishes. Gourmet snacks are served inside the Mercedes SUV, and safari riders enjoy the use of Swarovski spotting scopes and binoculars. Included in the price, but not guaranteed: appearances by elk, moose, bears, eagles and bighorn sheep. Cost depends on size of group, starting at $125 per person. FOOD & BEVERAGE BUZZ . Go gourmet in the Green Mountains: Adventure dining may not be an Olympic sport, but you'll wish it were after you indulge in a five-course feast inside the Killington Ledgewood Yurt in Vermont. It's a unique wilderness retreat accessible only by sleigh and may be the closest you'll come to dining in a Hobbit hole. The yurt's executive chef can cater to special diets upon request, but the regular menu includes signature prime cuts of meat and local New England produce. Alcohol is additional and there are set ""family nights"" with a different menu and lower rates. Make advance reservations for this Friday or Saturday night adventure; regular Friday night rates start at $109. Revel in the Rockies: You won't needs skis, snowboards or skates to enjoy the scenery at 10,700 feet, but you will need to take the Zephyr Express chairlift up the mountain to be wowed at Winter Park. The moon lights the way as you rise above the Continental Divide and the spectacular Fraser Valley, en route to an award-winning parade of Colorado culinary delights in the dining room of The Lodge at Sunspot. A three-course Easter brunch is also an option this year on March 31. Rates vary. Brewing up fun in Breckenridge: If your taste leans more toward choosing small batch bourbon or bitters over green trails or blue, you have reason to head for Breckenridge well beyond the action on the slopes. The awards keep piling up for the spirits made at the Breckenridge Distillery, which bills itself as ""the world's highest."" A tasting room and tours make this a destination worth checking out -- and here's why it's unique: The bourbon whiskey is made from Rocky Mountain snowmelt, and hand-harvested alpine herbs go into creating the bitters. COOL CLASSES . All about Alta: Give your brain a break and sit down for a fireside chat with historians, musicians, documentary filmmakers and ski experts brimming with local lore about Utah's Alta Ski Area, celebrating its 75th birthday in 2013. Area ski resorts and the Salt Lake City REI store take turns hosting this popular lecture series run by the Alta Historical Society throughout the winter months. The chats are free and run 45 minutes to an hour. Check out the schedule at www.altahistory.org. Trade texting for chopping: That's the goal at the Park Hyatt in Beaver Creek, Colorado, where complimentary teen-focused cooking classes are held weekly at the 8100 Mountainside Bar & Grill. Creations include cold weather ""mocktails,"" gourmet pizzas and sushi rolls. Move over Starbucks, here's another perk for parents: There's a class that teaches teenagers the art of making barista-style coffee at home. School at St. Regis: You may yearn for detention once you enroll in these educational sessions held at the elite St. Regis Deer Valley resort in Park City, Utah. Three clinics are open to resort guests and the public, with instruction on champagne sabering, chocolate infusion and how to create the perfect Bloody Mary. Champagne Sabering 101 is held every night at twilight and this ritual -- where a sword is used to slice off the top of a champagne bottle -- must be seen to be believed. Attend the clinic and bring home a skill sure to impress friends and family at your next gathering. The nightly sabering demonstration and tasting is free, but a private lesson with a sommelier can be had for $250, including a bottle of Charles de Fere champagne. The Bloody Mary and chocolate clinics are held regularly and cost $16 per person. SNOW SEASON SMARTS . Check with your travel agent, tour operator or hotel if you're on a trip and suddenly decide you've had enough of the slopes. Rules vary by location, and you should always investigate your options. For example, at Sun Valley ski area in Idaho, there's an official lift ticket exchange program that lets you trade in a ""downhill"" day for a long list of options including a massage, ice skating and lunch or a shopping credit. AprÃ¨s ski is always an option for skiers and non-skiers alike. One spot to try: Tamarack Lodge atop Heavenly Mountain in Lake Tahoe, California -- where December saw a record-breaking 12 feet of snowfall -- and they're celebrating this lofty designation: Forbes named Unbuckle at Tamarack the No. 1 aprÃ¨s ski party in North America. Do your pre-trip homework beginning with regional tourism board websites for recommendations on museums and music venues. They are generally open year-round and offer constant cultural respite from the chill of the great outdoors. Aspen, Colorado, is one example of a ski spot that doubles as a cultural destination. It's home to museums, concert halls and music venues such as the intimate Belly Up where shows often sell out faster than an expert skier can speed down a bunny slope.","Non-skiers will find plenty to keep them entertained at U.S. ski resorts .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's new lawyer has a white rabbit's foot hanging from the handle of his Louis Vuitton briefcase. ""That's for good luck,"" Mark Heller said. ""Lindsay Lohan is a great beauty with tremendous talent and I believe that all she really needs in life is a little bit of luck."" A receptive judge, cooperative prosecutors and a good lawyer might help. But after six drama-filled years through the Los Angeles criminal court system, starting with two drunken driving convictions in 2007, Lohan may have exhausted her supply of those. She has appeared in court at least 20 times before four Los Angeles judges who found her in violation of probation five times and sentenced her to a total of six months in jail. Photos: Celebrity mug shots . The actress faces a March 18 trial that includes charges of lying to a police officer about a car crash, reckless driving and violating her probation for a shoplifting conviction. Lohan did face a receptive judge at a pretrial hearing Wednesday. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner is the same one who found her guilty of stealing a necklace from a jewelry store and violating probation two years ago. She praised Lohan for completing the terms of her sentence a year ago when she lifted her supervised probation. Sautner retires next month, so another judge -- yet to be determined -- will preside over her trial. There are two prosecutors, including one from Santa Monica, where the car crash happened last June, and another from the Los Angeles city attorney's office, which is overseeing the shoplifting probation. While they've not taken a public position, several media reports -- not confirmed by CNN -- have said they want Lohan to spend at least six months in confinement. SXSW passes on Lindsay Lohan's 'Canyons'? Heller, who met with the prosecutors for the first time Wednesday, said they seemed to be ""very much interested in serving justice."" What would justice be in this case? Past justice for Lohan has included less than two weeks behind bars in her six trips to the Los Angeles County jail. Measures to relieve jail overcrowding led to her release after just hours in all but one of those visits. Lohan did spend 35 days confined to her Venice, California, home. She also served about 67 days of community service, mostly working at the L.A. County morgue. ""Justice always has to be tempered with mercy and jail is not always the answer,"" Heller said. ""When people find themselves coming before the court, there's usually a very serious underlying reason and cause."" In fact, Lohan acknowledged her drug and alcohol addiction in past court appearances. She's spent 250 days in five rehab facilities since January 2007, including one long court-ordered rehab stint after a failed drug test. Her father has been urging Lohan to enter rehab voluntarily ahead of her trial, hoping that would satisfy the judge and prosecutors. Lindsay Lohan: The reality show we don't want to watch . Heller said it was premature for him to talk about a plea deal with the prosecutors since he just got the case file Wednesday. While her previous lawyer, Shawn Holley, entered a not guilty plea on Lohan's behalf two weeks ago, Heller did not go as far as to suggest to reporters that she did not lie to police or violate her probation. Lohan took the bold move of firing Holley, who steered her through her many legal troubles over the past few years. She appeared reluctant, however, in court Wednesday when Judge Sautner asked her if she wanted to replace Holley. ""Today, yes,"" Lohan answered. Sautner approved the switch to Heller, a New York lawyer for 44 years, with the exception of a five-year suspension from practicing law for bar rules violations. Pitbull: LiLo doesn't even live here anymore . ""This is not the most complex case we've ever seen,"" Sautner said. But it could send Lohan to jail again. Sautner warned her a year ago that any violation of the law could mean she would have to serve 245 days in jail -- the remainder of her suspended sentence from a shoplifting conviction. While critics have panned Lohan's recent dramatic appearances as an actress -- her recent portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor is exhibit A -- defendant Lohan has consistently delivered drama. She caught a late flight from New York Tuesday night to be in Los Angeles for court Wednesday morning despite sending a doctor's note that said she was too sick to travel. ""Glad to see you're feeling better,"" Sautner told Lohan. ""Thank you,"" Lohan replied. Heller told the judge that her doctor diagnosed an upper respiratory condition. ""In New York, it's the flu,"" he said. ""No, it isn't,"" said Sautner, who was an NYPD detective in a previous career. ""The flu is the flu."" Still, the judge overlooked the issue, even saying that Lohan does not have to attend future hearings or even the trial, since it is misdemeanor case. Lohan proved she can still draw a crowd of paparazzi to court. Dozens of photographers captured her walk from the limo into the courthouse. And she was dressed appropriately for a media event, wearing a Chanel dress and her traditional red-soled Louboutin stilettos. ""She will rise to the occasion and I think she'll be fine,"" Heller told reporters.

"(CNN) -- A small group of salt-and-pepper haired women who live outside Jackson, Mississippi, meet every other Tuesday at the local antique store for their M.E.N.S.A. gathering. The Most Exclusive National Shopping Association has met consistently for the past three years, but some of its members have been close for more than 50. Margaret Collins Jenkins, 58, is president. Nita Gilmore is treasurer. Ouida Muffuletto is secretary. It's her job to read the minutes of the meeting and take notes. The women came up with the M.E.N.S.A. acronym years ago by throwing around words until something fit. After shopping, when the meeting ends, the 10-15 member group goes to dinner. Though Jenkins says the group laughs and carries on, this is more than just a club. These women work to preserve the friendships they've cultivated over a lifetime. ""Having friends that extend over decades, they more or less know your history. They know your ins and outs and ups and downs of your life,"" Jenkins said. ""That just makes us be able to build each other up. Those friends that know your history, they can't be replaced."" The group's shared experiences are what sustain them through life changes like child rearing, divorce and death. And they're key elements to building a sense of community and a healthy lifestyle, experts say. Dr. James House, from the University of Michigan, has researched the health benefits of meaningful relationships. He says a lack of social interactions is predictive of poor health and earlier death for most people. House contends that keeping in contact with others is likely to regulate a person's own behaviors so that it becomes harder to slip into poor health habits. The M.E.N.S.A. ladies strive to stay active and connected. One snapshot can convey decades of camaraderie: That weekend trip to New Orleans. Those painting sessions, loosely referred to as art lessons. Christmas spent dressed as elves. This particular set of Southern belles didn't meet on Facebook. Their connections to each other happened over time. Some of the women work together as teachers; others go to the same church. A few are neighbors. Sherry Downs, 57, says she relies on her closest friends to carry her through life's twists and turns, big and small. ""We confide in each other about everything and we value each others' opinions,"" Downs says. ""I just about won't take a step without asking one of them, 'Which way do I go?'"" Jenkins, a school teacher who moved into the community nearly 40 years ago, says she's been able to rely on her longtime confidants during the darkest periods of her life. ""I went through a divorce. They were there, so sturdy and so dependable in every way,"" she says. ""Did they stop including me in the group? No. They included me and made a special effort to make me not feel like the third wheel. I never was left out. They supported me not only in words but in their actions."" As we age, we begin to feel liberated from past patterns and habits, says Rebecca G. Adams, a sociology and gerontology professor and expert on friendship at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Markers of aging, such as retirement or widowhood, trigger a period of transition, change and redirection. After raising children and devoting time to building careers, Adams says, there is a reinvestment in what one feels is important, such as dear friendships. ""Like anything you do in life, it requires work,"" Jenkins says. ""A lot of people I think wonder why they don't have those kinds of friends, and it's because it takes work.""

"New York (CNN) -- For more than two decades, David Ranta has been behind bars for the killing of a Brooklyn rabbi during a botched diamond heist. In the years since his 1991 conviction, another man's widow has identified her husband as the killer; a onetime jail inmate has said he made up statements about Ranta to boost his own fortunes; and a now-grown boy who once picked him out of a lineup has come forward to say he was coached by a detective. Now, Brooklyn prosecutors have recommended that Ranta go free -- and if a judge agrees, he could walk out of court as early as Thursday. ""There was never a doubt in my mind that he was innocent,"" said Michael Baum, the lawyer who represented Ranta at his 1991 trial. The rabbi, Chaskel Werzberger, died four days after being shot, a victim of the attempted holdup of a diamond courier. The courier escaped, but the would-be robber shot Werzberger through the window of his parked car, hauled him out of the vehicle and drove off, according to the Brooklyn district attorney's office. Louis Scarcella, one of the detectives who investigated the case, told CNN that Ranta admitted his involvement in the heist attempt and that he stands by the arrest. As for claims that police coached a witness, he said, ""No way that happened."" But the now-retired Scarcella added, ""If they release him tomorrow, I say, God bless him. I have nothing personal involved in this, and I was just doing my job. "" Ranta, now 58, was arrested six months after Werzberger's February 1990 killing. He was picked up after two men facing trial on their own robbery charges gave his name to police, prosecutors recounted in asking that his second-degree murder conviction be tossed out and the charges dismissed. One of them, Alan Bloom, identified Ranta as the gunman. Another acquaintance -- a woman who had brought charges against Ranta in a ""prior altercation"" -- told police that Ranta had confided in her about the planned jewelry robbery and the murder of the rabbi, prosecutors wrote. In an initial lineup, only one witness recognized Ranta, and that was after a lengthy conversation with a Yiddish interpreter, they noted. In the second lineup, three youths identified him and repeated that identification in court. One witness who didn't identify him was the courier, the intended target of the holdup. When questioned by detectives, Ranta initially denied any involvement in the killing. Then he acknowledged knowing Bloom, according to prosecutors. Then he admitted he had been near the scene and knowing his friends had planned a holdup. Then he admitted he had been involved in planning the diamond heist, acted as the lookout and had seen Bloom and the second jailed witness, Dmitry Drikman, with a gun. ""Two witnesses testified implicating him,"" Baum told CNN. ""The police had an alleged confession from him, but there was no physical evidence. The jewelry courier, he testified for the defense, saying that Ranta wasn't the guy. A woman came forward saying Ranta was innocent, that her husband was the one who did it,"" said Baum. Despite that testimony for the defense, the jury found Ranta guilty. He was sentenced to 37 Â½ years to life in prison. Four years later, Theresa Astin came forward to say that her husband, Joseph -- who died in a 1990 car accident -- had been the killer. He'd been named as a possible suspect before, and Scarcella had brought the courier to the morgue in hopes that he would identify Astin's body as the gunman. He didn't. Baum sought a new trial for his client based on Astin's testimony, but a judge refused to grant one. Then in 2011, he said, one of the kids who picked Ranta out of a lineup got in touch with him. ""I got a call saying, 'I've lived with this for 20 years. The detective told me who to pick out,' "" Baum said. The call was from Menachem Lieberman, who later told investigators he identified Ranta after being told by a detective to ""Pick the guy with the big nose."" ""It was on his conscience for all these years,"" Baum said. ""He was 13 years old at the time. He was just a kid. He was just doing what they told him to do."" The Brooklyn district attorney's office had recently started a Conviction Integrity Unit to look into claims like Ranta's. Baum told them about Lieberman's call, and the unit began to dig into Ranta's case. Bloom is now dead. But Drikman admitted he had fabricated earlier statements he made about Ranta, hoping that his cooperation would help his own criminal case. Drikman's girlfriend at the time confessed that her account was manufactured to assist him. Astin reiterated her previous testimony. Scarcella said the case against Ranta was ""very simple."" ""We had eyewitnesses who said they saw him shoot him,"" he said. ""We had statements that he made to other people, implicating himself, who have since died. We have the confession he gave to me."" And he sharply disputes Lieberman's account of being coached, telling CNN, ""As far as I'm concerned, it's fiction."" ""No way that happened,"" he said, noting that dozens of prosecutors and police were watching the lineup. ""They're saying that I framed it,"" Scarcella said. ""I want to go on record saying this: I never framed anyone in my life, and you would have to be a low, low devil to do something like that. I slept very good for the last 22 years."" But eventually, Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes recommended that the case be thrown out. Sandy Silverstein, a spokesman for Hynes, told CNN that Ranta will be brought back to Brooklyn from a prison upstate on Thursday. There, he'll await the judge's decision on his fate. CNN's calls to Pierre Sussman, Ranta's current lawyer, were not immediately returned. Although Baum had been working with district attorney's investigators for months, he wasn't sure of what Hynes had decided until he read about it. ""I actually didn't know the end result. I prayed and prayed when I read it in the paper this morning. There were tears coming out of my eyes,"" he said.","David Ranta has served nearly 22 years for a Brooklyn rabbi's killing .

"(CNN) -- At least 60 people have died in the Libyan capital after drinking locally made alcohol, the Ministry of Health says, and the National Security Directorate of Tripoli said Tuesday it is launching an investigation. According to the Libyan News Agency, there were 709 other cases of alcohol poisoning. Alcohol sale and consumption is prohibited in Libya, a conservative Muslim nation, but smuggled alcoholic drinks can be found, in addition to homemade alcohol locally known as ""bokha."" The National Security Directorate said this large-scale poisoning was caused by such locally made alcohol. A medical source in Tripoli who has seen some of the patients told CNN their symptoms indicated methanol poisoning. Methanol overdose symptoms include breathing problems, blindness, comas, seizures and death. Officials say the first case was reported in the capital on Thursday, and over the following days Tripoli Central Hospital received a large number of people showing signs of alcohol poisoning. Some cases had to be transferred to other hospitals. Those affected ranged in age from 16 to 55, the head of the internal medicine department at the hospital, Dr. Massoud al-Azzabi, told the state news agency on Monday. Some lost their eyesight, and some of the others were put on dialysis machines or respirators, he said. In a statement released Tuesday, the Tripoli National Security Directorate announced the formation of a committee of five officers to oversee the investigation into the alcohol poisoning, which some reports call the worst ever in Libya. The directorate said police stations in the city have started to record the cases and the Criminal Investigations unit is investigating. A security task force that includes a number of security and revolutionary forces has been formed and is ready to raid suspected bootlegger hideouts upon orders from the government, according to the state news agency.","More than 700 cases of alcohol poisoning have been reported, Libyan News Agency reports .

"(CNN) -- In the last decade of the 20th century, the Turkish lira fell in value 1,000 times against the U.S. dollar, meaning that tourists returning to that country after several years found that any old money they still possessed since their last visit had become almost worthless. Now as fears grow about whether Greece will stay in the euro, and the possible domino effect this could cause, many prospective holidaymakers appear to be having second thoughts about visiting that country and other economically troubled members of the 17-nation eurozone, such as Spain or Portugal. And while tourists may be bulking up their cash reserves in the case of a euro exit, others may be concerned about safety if violent street protests resume against austerity cuts. What is the financial situation now? Political deadlock is leading to fears that Greece will not have a government in place when it needs to make critical debt payments, which could in turn jeopardize its place in the eurozone. On Monday, Greeks withdrew up to €800 million from Greek banks, and the threat of a banking panic heightened concern of a default. Fears of contagion spilled over into bond markets in Spain and Italy. The idea that has investors around the globe worried is the so-called ""Grexit"" -- or Greek exit from the eurozone -- a tricky scenario that is now looking like a real possibility. English bookmakers Ladbrokes stopped taking bets after gamblers lined up to put money on it last week. Other betting companies are giving odds on Greece leaving the euro as low as 1/10, while the odds on Spain leaving are about 6/1. What effect is uncertainty having on tourism within the eurozone? Many in the travel industry admit bookings to Greece are lower than in previous years, with other countries benefiting. Hotel reservations on popular holiday destinations such as Corfu and Crete are down by up to 50% compared to the same period before last month's indecisive election, according to the Hellenic Hotel Federation. Sean Tipton of the Association of British Travel Agents blames some inaccurate coverage of concerns about Greece's financial problems as a factor. ""This is having a positive effect on Spanish travel, for example, with bookings higher than normal,"" he told CNN. ""Travelers are advised to take spending money in cash, as in the event of Greece leaving the euro there may be questions about whether you could still pay by credit or debit cards."" Despite tourism contributing about $10,5 billion, or about 16% of Greece's gross domestic product, officials brushed off concerns. ""There was also a financial crisis in Greece last year as well and we had a record year with a 10% increase in the number of visitors,"" said Konstantinos Zikos, president of the Greek National Tourism Organization. ""Because of the crisis, early booking are down around Europe at the moment. However, Greece is a beautiful and safe country so we are optimistic that tourism won't be strongly affected."" In the longer term, if Greece does leave the euro, it could mean it becomes a much cheaper country to visit, as Britain's biggest travel company Thomas Cook pointed out. ""We believe there are positives and negatives for the travel industry in the event that Greece were to leave the euro,"" the firm said. Should tourists be worried about buying euros for foreign travel? On the face of it, tourists haven't had it so good for a long time: The euro is at a three-year low against the British pound and is as weak against the U.S. dollar as it has been since 2010. This should mean the cost of hotels and restaurants is lower than it has been for a few years. Travel experts say that whatever happens with Greece and the euro this summer, tourists visiting economically troubled European countries, such as Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal -- all major tourist destinations -- are unlikely to lose out. If Greek does leave the euro this could lead to contagion, and other countries joining them, but few analysts believe the whole euro project is likely to collapse in the next year or so. In other words, it's safe to buy euros, but keep an eye on the exchange rate, which is continuing to strengthen in favor of world currencies. How can travelers ensure they don't lose out? Travel writer Simon Calder said he planned to visit Greece this summer, and was taking two precautions. ""The first was to add an extra €100 to my estimated spending,"" Calder wrote on his blog. ""Normally I rely on plastic for emergencies, but were Greece to leave the euro, electronic banking could freeze for up to a week and prevent debit and credit card transactions. ""Next, I insisted on €5, €10 and €20 notes. If Greece leaves the euro, the most likely interim currency is the existing euro overprinted with a Greek delta symbol (for ""drachma""), or possibly with a corner clipped. ""The value of the Greek euro would fall by perhaps 40 per cent. While traders sort themselves out, and before a market in the Greek currency begins, tourists are likely to pay in euros but be given change in new money. Pay for a €15 round of drinks with a €50 note, and you could get back change in Greek currency worth only €20. That is why low-denomination notes are so useful."" Do street protests against austerity cuts mean Greece or another country is unsafe? No. There have been occasional protests in big cities, such as Athens and Thessaloniki, but most say Greece remains safe. Posts on online forums were scathing about what they said was the media blowing the unrest out of proportion, although there are some warnings that strikes could disrupt travel into and around the country. ABTA's Sean Tipton said ""There's an element of concern about personal safety with sporadic unrest in Athens, but most places where tourists visit are safe. ""In reality this is one of the best times to visit Greece, as prices should come down, thanks to supply and demand."" UK travel firm Thomas Cook said it was ""closely monitoring the evolving situation in Athens. Most of our holidaymakers are on the country's islands where you'd never know anything was going on.""","Some holidaymakers appear to be having second thoughts about visiting Greece .

"(CNN) -- Opening in select U.S. theaters next week, the documentary ""Putin's Kiss"" tells the story of a Russian teenager who became famous in the mid-2000s when she was shown on TV giving President Vladimir Putin a kiss on the cheek. Danish filmmaker Lise Birk Pedersen's movie is well-timed. Putin won his third term as Russia's president last month and will officially take power in May. He is finishing up a stint as prime minister, as he was limited to two consecutive terms as president. While not well-known in the West, Masha Drokova will always be a symbol of Putin's power and of the first generation to come of age in post-Soviet Russia, after her tumultuous tenure as the spokeswoman for Nashi, a nationalist youth movement that Putin officials created in 2005. Nashi organized mass marches in support of the Russian president, proactively heading off opposition to Putin at every turn. As Nashi gained thousands of members, the provincial but ambitious teen from the Moscow suburbs was rewarded for being its mouthpiece. She got a car, an apartment and even a television show. The film shows Masha as she begins to question it all after befriending independent journalists who criticize Putin. Audiences watch Masha's disillusionment with Nashi turn to anguish when one of those reporters is savagely beaten by attackers he suspects are Nashi members. ""Putin's Kiss"" took the world cinematography award at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Watch the trailer . CNN spoke with Pedersen by phone from her home in Denmark. CNN: Why did you want to make this movie? Pedersen: I wanted to make a contemporary portrait of the first generation to come of age in the new Russia. For research, I spoke to a lot of young people Masha's age. ... I traveled to Russia for three or four weeks and I spoke only with young people, 18 to 20, in big cities and the countryside, who were born exactly at the time the Soviet Union was collapsing. CNN: Why focus on Masha? Pedersen: When Masha was very young, and Russia was changing to a capitalist society, the middle class gained more money, more possibilities to send their young people to good schools and to take vacations abroad. It had changed the attitudes among the young people and the population all in all. So people were much more optimistic and they really looked up to Putin and (were) feeling proud about Russia. I wanted to portray that side as well, and that's also one of the reasons I chose to portray a person who was a spokesperson for Putin's youth movement, Nashi. CNN: Masha was someone who certainly believed in Nashi, which describes itself as this kind of democratic anti-Fascist movement that Putin and the presidential administration was very much for. Things were going well for her. Suddenly she had this great fame. Then she meets journalists and starts spending time with journalists. What does that cause to happen in her life? What happens? What goes wrong? Pedersen: Nashi actually means ""ours."" In Nashi they believe very much in Russia and that Russia should be the leader of 21st century, and to make (the country) the leader of the 21st century we need to support the ruling power. And if you don't support the ruling power, if you're critical towards Putin, you're basically labeled an enemy. A lot of these young liberal journalists that Masha started to hang out with, they were very critical about Putin and his ruling. So Masha gets into this crowd and she's warned by the leadership of Nashi that she should not mix with these people, that she could not in daytime believe in Putin and then in nighttime be friends with people who would criticize him. CNN: Can you give our audience some perspective on why Nashi was so important to both Putin and why their voice was so important on the national political scene? If there are a lot of young people (in the U.S.) who band together and decide they want to support President Obama or some other politician, it's not as if that group is going to make headlines every single day and their voice is going to be the top. Pedersen: Nashi was formed from above. It's not like a grass-roots organization. It's not like a young person would wake up in the suburb and then think ""Oh, I have to go out and support Putin and then form Nashi."" ... Nashi was formed by the political top. Its former leader is now a kind of youth minister. Nashi had a very specific mission. (Nashi, the filmmaker adds, was Putin's way of heading off anything like 2005's ""Orange Revolution"" in the Ukraine. Protesters took to the streets claiming that the re-election of the country's president had been rigged. Demonstrators successfully demanded a recount that revealed the leader of the opposition party had actually won.) Putin was very much afraid that young people would take to the streets and make revolution as well as what happened in the Ukraine. Nashi was formed to counteract something like that. During parliamentary elections four years ago, Nashi has this role to go in and occupy squares in major cities, mainly in Moscow and St. Petersburg. They would apply for (permits) to stay on the square and use the whole day for their action to prevent others from using the space. We see in the film the different methods they used to fight any opposition. CNN: How, logistically, did you go about making the film, considering your characters were in jeopardy all the time? (The independent journalist who was beaten, Oleg Kashin, wrote a New York Times op-ed from his hospital room saying he suspected Nashi members were behind the attack. He wrote that one of his fingers needed to be amputated, his jaw and leg were broken and he had head injuries.) Pedersen: What was difficult was that in the beginning, Masha wanted to draw a very positive picture of Nashi. I kept telling her I wanted to tell (both sides). She most of the time, especially in the beginning, would make this picture of Nashi almost like a Boy Scout movement. As filming progressed, and she started to meet people who were criticizing Nashi, she actually still tried to keep away from meeting some of her new friends who had been critical toward Nashi. She was in a difficult process herself. Even to talk about it and let me see would have made it real to her. CNN: What is Masha up to now and what does she think of the film? Pedersen: She is PR manager for a foreign investment firm. She is quite successful, but she has withdrawn from politics and from liberal journalists. She felt like she was very manipulated by both sides. When she saw the film, she told me she felt ""50/50."" She liked the film, and thought it was a good portrait of her, but that it took the side of the journalists too much. CNN: What role is Nashi playing right now in Russian politics? We saw an unprecedented number of anti-Putin protesters take to the streets just before the March election. Pederson: During the presidential election, Nashi were saying that there would be 20,000 (members) on the streets of Moscow fighting the opposition. There has been activity, (but) it's a little difficult to say what. The thing with Nashi is that they grow every time there is an election. They tend to shrink during nonelection periods. People are saying that Nashi will disappear, but I'm not sure about that. It's a fantastic tool for the ruling power.

"(CNN) -- A terrorist explosion in Bulgaria. Tourist kidnappings in Egypt. Sometimes violent demonstrations in Greece. A coup in Mali. Deadly drug wars in Mexico. Olympic security failures in England. Who wants to be a tourist these days? The deadly bombing of a bus carrying Israeli tourists Wednesday in Bulgaria is the latest bit of bad news in a summer plagued by global instability. Traveling hardly sounds relaxing. The U.S. State Department's latest worldwide safety caution issued Wednesday warns that terrorist groups ""continue to plan terrorist attacks against U.S. interests in multiple regions, including Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East."" Targets might include public transportation systems and ""sporting events, residential areas, business offices, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, public areas and other tourist destinations"" in the United States and abroad where large numbers of U.S. citizens gather, according to the State Department. Despite ongoing advisories and worldwide economic uncertainty, the numbers suggest travelers are nevertheless determined to see the world. International tourist arrivals grew 5% in the first four months of 2012, according to the United Nations' World Tourism Organization. The agency estimates that 415 million tourists will travel worldwide during this year's May-August peak travel season, and international tourism is expected to increase by 3% to 4% for the full year. ""In the case of acts of violence or any other risk/crisis situation such as natural disasters, it is important that countries are prepared and have built crisis management structures and preparedness plans to deal with such unforeseen events in order to minimize their impact on tourism,"" wrote Sandra Carvao, a WTO spokeswoman, in an e-mail. ""Yet in many cases, these are isolated events that if well-managed will have a limited impact on tourism demand."" The number of U.S. travelers going abroad last year dropped 3% from 2010 to nearly 59 million, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of Travel and Tourism Industries, but 2012 is looking strong for U.S. travel abroad. ""So far, in 2012, we are seeing increases in U.S. outbound air traffic to all world regions. It is too early to tell if any of the events that have just occurred will impact travel,"" a Commerce Department official said via e-mail. This year's outbound air traffic is up 5% through April 2012, according to department figures. While most of their travelers aren't heading into political hot spots, U.S. travel agents say their clients understand terrorist threats and political unrest are part of what they have to consider in a post-9/11 world, along with the price of a plane ticket. ""We've had little to no cause for concern from our travelers, many of whom are on extensive European vacations traveling with family for up to three weeks in Europe,"" wrote Pattie Fanta, owner of Travel Leaders in Bay Village, Ohio, in an e-mail. ""I advise my clients to remain vigilant and alert while on the road (even in the U.S.), know they have good trip insurance and call us should any problems arise."" Perspective is key, says veteran travel writer Zora O'Neill, who was boarding a Thursday red-eye flight to Greece. ""Sure, I'm going to Greece, and even Athens -- but I know where the demonstrations usually are in Athens and the scale of them -- so I know just to avoid that part of the city,"" says O'Neill, author of more than a dozen travel guides, plus an upcoming book on Arabic language and the Middle East. ""The key to perspective is a map! 'Demonstrations in Greece' typically boils down to one major square in Athens. 'Drug war violence in Mexico' affects only a tiny portion of the country. And for terrorist attacks, it's stone-cold to say it, but the safest time to go somewhere is after an attack, when the security is the most vigilant."" CNN's Marnie Hunter contributed to this report.","Despite economic uncertainty and terror threats, international travel is up globally .

"(CNN) -- When I learned about the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, I wept and mourned like many other Americans. I was also reminded of my own daughter's death 32 years ago. For those parents, families or friends of victims who want to see less guns fall into the hands of potential shooters, my personal journey may help serve as a path for change. My daughter, Cari, was killed by a multiple repeat offender drunk driver on May 3, 1980. Four days later, I started Mothers Against Drunk Driving. I was shocked to learn that over the past decade, approximately 250,000 people were killed in alcohol-related fatal crashes. At that time, public health professionals considered drunk driving to be the No. 1 killer of Americans between the ages of 15 and 24. Drunk driving seemed like the only socially acceptable form of homicide in this country and the attitude toward perpetrators was benign, if not passive. I also learned that probably nothing would happen to the man who killed my daughter. So I became a grass roots activist. As I found out, grass roots means, ""working outside the system to change the inequities within"" and activist means, ""getting the job done."" I started MADD because I was angry over the injustice of the status quo. Over time, my efforts helped incite others to action. You kick a few pebbles, you turn a few stones, and eventually you have an avalanche. My ""kicking a few pebbles"" began in my home with the help of my father and a few friends. Within three years, MADD developed into an international organization with almost 400 chapters worldwide, a staff of 50 employees, 2 million members, thousands of volunteers and an annual budget of more than $12 million. Initially, we were mothers who lost children, but soon our membership included everyone who believed in our cause. Before long, voices from long forgotten victims who lost loved ones to drunk driving became loud and clear. It was gratifying to realize that many people, given a chance, wanted the same things I did. Our small grass-roots movement grew into a groundswell that radically changed society's views on drunk driving. Early on, it became clear that I must seek broad and strategic alliances for MADD to be successful. I turned to law enforcement officials, restaurateurs, legislators and civic organizations. It was only by building broad coalitions of such highly influential constituents that MADD, during my tenure, was able to initiate a sweeping change in public attitudes and laws against drunk driving. There is another very important factor that helped our cause: the power of media attention. From 1980 to 1983, when MADD was very active, some of the biggest reductions in motor vehicle deaths occurred in large part because of the media attention we were able to generate. Jay Winsten, director of the Frank Stanton Center for Health Communication at the Harvard School of Public Health, said in a New York Times article, ""During each high media period, alcohol related fatalities ... fell twice as rapidly as low media periods."" Before MADD, there was little education in the schools about alcohol or impaired driving. The press rarely mentioned alcohol involvement when reporting a crash. Drinking and driving was still legal in many states. Victims of drunk driving had almost no recourse in an apathetic court system more concerned about the rights of the accused. Involvement in the judicial process was discouraged. Victims had no movement to join, little or no legislation to endorse, and no emotional support system where they could share their grief. The advent of MADD changed all that: . • Governor's task forces on drunk driving were formed in almost every state. • At our urging, President Ronald Reagan initiated a Presidential Commission on Drunk Driving, and I was a member. • MADD was the catalyst for SADD, Students Against Drunk Driving, started by my daughter, Serena. • We aggressively lobbied for state and federal legislation that would raise the legal drinking age to 21, and we pushed for laws that would hold drunk drivers accountable for their crimes. • Between 1981 and 1986, 729 state laws pertaining to drunk driving were enacted to help reduce alcohol-related traffic fatalities . • Most importantly, hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved because of the grass-roots efforts . Society no longer considers drunk driving socially acceptable. At long last, in many cases, drunk drivers are being forced to accept responsibility for their heinous acts because a fed up public has had enough. MADD is a good example of how to change society. We didn't give up and neither should those who wish to see a safer world. You can have an impact and you can save lives. That was the least I could do for my daughter. I feel the pain for families of those who died at Sandy Hook. For those who want to do something about gun violence, change isn't easy. What is needed is a grass-roots movement similar to MADD that encompasses all aspects of society. To be effective, it must include all the stakeholders involved and reach a consensus that will make implementation -- whether in laws, increased education or other policy changes -- a given. Ask for a Presidential Commission while the White House is focused on this issue. Don't take no for an answer. Accept each obstacle as a challenge to be overcome. Engage the media and harness the outpouring and support that is pouring in. People need direction. Leadership is key and MADD had that at the local, state and national level. Develop a strategy that people can follow and provide directions and concrete steps that will guarantee successes and keep people motivated. Don't lose the momentum, anger and rage. Now is the time to take action. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Candace Lightner.","Candace Lightner: After my daughter was killed by a drunk driver, I started MADD .
Lightner: MADD radically changed our society's view toward drunk driving .

"(CNN) -- Saturday was Groundhog Day-- the unofficial American holiday where we wait for a fuzzy rodent to tell us whether spring will arrive early or if we'll have to endure another six weeks of winter. Relying on the weather predictions of a groundhog may seem like a strange tradition, but the practice dates back to medieval times. The superstitious believed that hibernating animals would emerge from their long winter slumber to check on the weather on Candlemas, which is halfway between the winter solstice in December and the vernal equinox in March. They believed that if the animals saw their shadows, winter would continue, and so they went back to sleep. But if they didn't see their shadow, an early spring was on its way. Famed groundhog Punxsutawney Phil did not see his shadow Saturday morning in Pennsylvania. Neither did his fellow foreteller Staten Island Chuck. In honor of this quirky American tradition, CNN iReport invited people to take a snapshot of their own shadows for a one-day photo challenge and then share their personal weather predictions. Lia Ocampo says she is tired of the frigid weather in Queens, New York, and hopes for an early spring. ""Unfortunately, my shadow predicts a longer winter weather,"" she said. ""That means we have to be patient, bundle up more and wait for the spring to come in time."" But Michael Goodling predicts the exact opposite. ""Actually, I believe that temperatures will warm up a bit early this year because of the brutal sub-zero temps all across the country,"" he said. Gooding, who recently returned to Springfield, Missouri, from Swaziland, says he has not seen snow in a long time. ""I love snow. I would like to see a good, deep snow where I live. On the other hand, I love spring and how the flowers pop up, trees begin to leaf out,"" he said. ""There is such a freshness to spring."" Kathi Cordsen, a long-time resident of Fullerton, California, predicts a shorter winter, too. ""We don't really have a true winter here,"" she said. ""Spring is going to come early as usual. Buds should be on the trees very soon."" Anika Chin contributed to this story.","iReporters capture their shadows for a one-day photo challenge .

"Washington (CNN) -- Bipartisanship is usually seen as a good thing. It's about opposing sides working together to reach a middle-ground, crafting legislation that gets things done. In times when neither political party is able to compromise on issues like forced spending cuts, gun control or even saving the Postal Service, bipartisanship -- like what was seen in the passage of funding legislation to avoid a government shutdown in late March -- has rarely been more important. But what about times when both parties worked together and things went wrong? Politicians from both sides supported throwing Japanese-Americans in internment camps in the early days of World War II. In the 19th and 20th centuries, state legislatures across the South locked arms to pass laws restricting the right to vote of millions of people. And a nearly unanimous vote by Congress in 1964 led to a virtual blank check for President Lyndon Johnson to escalate America's involvement in Vietnam. ""You can go through history and there has been bipartisan support for bad things,"" said Curtis Gans, director of the Center for the Study of the American Electorate at American University. The Japanese interment camps resulted from an executive order, but neither side in Congress spoke out against it. ""In wartime, you know, that was clearly unjustified and clearly a basic violation of everything we stand for in terms of human rights,"" Gans said. ""What you had was a very, very fearful American public, which influenced what happened."" Kevin M. Kruse, a history professor at Princeton, pointed out the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on Vietnam in 1964. It passed the House unanimously and the Senate with only two votes in opposition. ""A lot of unfortunate things have been passed because both parties can get swept up in the fear and urgency of the moment and nobody's willing to or brave enough to stand up and say this is wrong,"" said James N. Gregory, a history professor at the University of Washington. Gregory pointed to the Patriot Act in 2001 and the resolution to go to war with Iraq as his examples of bad pieces of bipartisan action. The Patriot Act was passed little over a month after the 9/11 terror attacks, but questions were subsequently raised about expanded law enforcement surveillance powers in terrorism investigations. Allowing detainment of non-U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism without specific charges also drew scrutiny. Congress voted overwhelmingly in favor of going to war in Iraq in 2003, citing imminent fears that Saddam Hussein was hiding weapons of mass destruction. But none were ever found and the war went on for nearly a decade. There have been other cases not involving war or national crisis. ""Chinese exclusion was pretty popular by Democrats and Republicans,"" said Gregory about the Chinese-Exclusion Act passed by Congress at the height of anti-Chinese sentiment in the U.S in 1882. The law imposed severe restrictions on Chinese immigration -- which originally focused on ""skilled and unskilled laborers employed in mining"" but later was extended to all Chinese wishing to immigrate to or remain in America. Another example of bipartisan acquiesce was in civil rights. ""Republicans in the early 20th century allowed Democrats to control the South and the disenfranchisement of African-Americans in the South,"" said Robin Einhorn, a history professor at the University of California-Berkeley. Led by Democrats, state legislatures throughout the deep South passed several laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to discourage or prevent blacks from voting. Einhorn said with Jim Crow laws, immorality was condoned because neither side wanted to do the right thing and fight. ""The partisan response would have been to support African-American voting rights,"" he said. Those laws were largely curtailed by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But enforcement of the landmark measure is under review now by the U.S. Supreme Court. Justices are considering an appeal that federal government intervention is no longer necessary to ensure that African-Americans can go to the polls. When asked about good pieces of partisan legislation, Gregory looks at events right after the Civil War. ""If you go back to the 1800s, Republicans jammed through all of the civil rights legislation -- including the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments -- that were crucial to our framework of rights,"" said Gregory, ""And that was done in a highly partisan manner."" Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University, pointed to Social Security, Medicare and key pieces of civil rights legislation that were opposed by many, including conservatives, but passed anyway because of support from members of both parties. ""It took strong partisan majorities in Congress to get those things,"" said Abramowitz, ""It wouldn't have happened without that.""","The ability of both sides to come together has long been valued in Washington .
There are several instances where questionable action is bipartisan .
In most cases, decisions are driven by conflict or national crisis .
In other cases, inaction by both parties leads to immoral policy, experts say ."
"(CNN) -- China's thirst for fine wines is buoying European producers as domestic consumption dries up. As the eurozone debt crisis squeezes household spending, Europeans have less to splurge on life's little pleasures, and wine producers have felt the pinch. Exporters are now looking to new markets like China -- home to 1.3 billion people -- to boost sales. Richard Halstead, co-founder of Wine Intelligence, a consultancy on wine branding, says that China is a huge growth market for producers and there is a scramble for quality European brands. ""China represents effectively the biggest growth prospect that the wine industry has had probably for a generation,"" said Halstead. For Greek wine producers China represents a ray of hope. Greece is suffering under a harsh government austerity program and businesses are being crippled by a lack of competitiveness. But Greek-wine importer Mary Paternas believes it could play a big role in the future of Greek exports. ""Their (Greek) wines have got better and better and are doing really well,"" she said. ""They managed to get into China, doing well in America and Canada and exporting to Australia."" European exports to non-EU countries rose 12.7% in 2011, with exports to China seeing the biggest increase, up 49%, according to Eurostat, the statistics division for the European Union. Exports to Hong Kong were up 28%. Halstead says the European crisis might even provide a boost in exports for wine producers as they seek new markets. He said: ""If the Euro weakens significantly, if there is loss of confidence, actually that is something that wine producers might find positive because they'll be instantly more competitive in third party markets like the U.S. and Asia."" CNN's Oliver Joy contributed to this report .","European exporters looking to new markets like China to boost sales .

"(CNN) -- The backslapping and congratulations over the Cyprus bailout deal is still underway, and I realize it is not good form to criticize a deal when the ink has yet to dry on the agreement. Perhaps we should be delighted that it only took a disgraceful bank levy to be thrown out by a nation's parliament, a week of bank closures with the chaos that brought, and the inevitable Sunday midnight meeting with everyone beaten into bleary-eyed exhaustion. And come to think of it, why can't the EU ever agree something during the day, without everyone having to lose a night's sleep? The radical and immediate crises have been averted by the closure of one of Cyprus' two largest banks and ""haircuts"" on large bank deposits. The Cypriot bank system will survive minus one shoddy institution that is best gone and a restructuring of the rest -- if that ever happens. The date of 2018 has been set for the banking sector to be shrunk to the EU average, so don't hold your breath! I have no doubt this was the best the leaders could do, in the time they had, to avoid Cyprus' economic collapse and exit from the euro. But I'm afraid this agreement is nothing more than the usual euro nonsense, beautifully coined in the Eurogroup statement after the deal was announced: ""The Cypriot authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to step up efforts in the areas of fiscal consolidation, structural reforms and privatisation."" CNN Money: Cyprus faces tough road ahead . Hang on. Where have we heard that before? Oh yes. Greece after its first bailout. And Greece after various troika reviews which found, time and again, that few companies had been privatized, that structural reform was bogged down and that fiscal consolidation means all austerity and no growth. The unpalatable truth is that Cyprus, even after taking â‚¬4 billion of depositors' money as part of the bailout, will still be left with an unsustainable debt load at a national level. The Eurogroup has lent the country more than 50% of its GDP. Worse, as EU Commissioner Ollie Rehn admitted, is that Cyprus is heading into an even deeper recession. The country has shrunk for the past two years and has probably two more to go. All the woes that have been visited on Greece are now about to be experienced by Cyprus too, and it was all agreed in the middle of the night, in a hurry. Cyprus was the victim of being the fourth sovereign to be bailed out. Even though the Eurogroup is making this up as they go along, there are now some common threads which can be seen in the way crises are being handled . Bondholders and shareholders in banks can no longer expect to be left alone. They tried that with Greece and Ireland and failed (although in the Irish case the banks eventually did have to be merged and closed). Now the new normal is that investors should expect to be bailed in to agreements. Large depositors will also bear their share. No longer should European banks be regarded as ""safe"" beyond their deposit insurance limits. Anyone with â‚¬100,000 in a bank account should be on guard. Don't think it is unusual to have such large sums in bank account -- I know of several organizations and businesses who keep such sums as part of cash flow in the bank. Northern countries like Germany, Finland, Denmark and company are now determined to take a hardline approach, and they do so because of bailout fatigue from their voters. But let's see if that line crumbles when a really big European country, like Italy or Spain, gets into trouble. In each bailout we have seen the bark of an agreement, but we have yet to see the bite of the eurozone's determination to force countries into change. European leaders are so terrified their political project will fail that they cobble together these deals in the middle of the night, and then wonder why the whole thing fails to materialize 18 months later. Take December's eurozone banking union deal, for instance, which was agreed to with an unrealistic timescale and is still some way off from actually happening. Despite the deal being agreed to four months ago, there remains the very real problem of civil unrest as a result of high unemployment in a number of euro countries, and there is mounting disquiet within the union. Forgive me, I suppose I should be celebrating the Cyprus deal. But it's hard to be thrilled when all I see are crises avoided, not problems solved.","Quest: Cyprus bailout deal is crisis averted, not problem solved .
Cyprus will still be left with an unsustainable debt load at a national level .

"(CNN) -- The tiger is one of wildlife's most endangered species, but there's one big cat which refuses to be tamed.

From making his professional debut at just 13 to running top-class defenders ragged, this is one Tiger who hasn't changed his stripes since bursting onto the scene in Europe with Porto and Atletico Madrid. ""I think that every person specializes in what they know best and as a young kid, I liked scoring goals,"" he told CNN. ""Later, I realized that's what I was best at and I went perfecting that aspect to give the best of myself to my team in the position I played, which was striker."" Constantly on the prowl for goals, the 26-year-old is one of football's most wanted transfer targets, with several top European clubs waiting to poach him from Atletico. He moved to Spain in a â‚¬40 million ($53 million) deal from Porto in 2011, and scored 36 goals in his debut season in La Liga including two in the Europa League final against Athletic Bilbao. His stunning hat-trick in the demolition of European champions Chelsea at the 2012 Super Cup Final underlined to those not au fait with Spanish football just how deadly he can be. Atletico thrash Chelsea in Super Cup . Falcao then went on a streak which saw him score in 11 consecutive games for club and country between August and late October. With 18 goals in La Liga this season, the vultures are circling the Vicente Calderon once again, with Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester City all hovering. But Falcao insists he is happy with life at Atletico and says he has no thoughts of moving on -- at least not yet. ""I have three years left on my contract with the club and my reality is that this contract ties me down for a few more seasons,"" Falcao said. ""Afterwards though, I don't know what's going to happen in the future as it's in the hands of the people responsible for deciding the future of the players on Atletico. ""I simply give the best of myself for the team, for this really good season that we're having. We have a lot of objectives/goals in our sight and I hope that we can achieve them."" Falcao has emerged as one of the world's top goalscorers since making the move to Porto from Argentina's River Plate in July 2009. It was in Portugal that he came to prominence, scoring 34 goals including the winner in the final of the 2011 Europa League to help the club pull off a quadruple haul of trophies. His goalscoring feats in the continent's second-tier competition, in which he scored a record 17 goals, earned him a move to Spain where he has led the line for Atletico with his predatory instincts causing havoc for defenses across Europe. Can Falcao help Atletico Madrid reign in Spain? It is a skill which he honed as a youngster, spending many hours on the practice fields in a bid to perfect the art of one of football's hardest arts -- scoring goals. Ever since he ran around the streets barefoot, covered with scratches and blood, Falcao's desire has been to reach the very top. His father played club football in Colombia, and there was never a doubt in Falcao's mind what he wanted to achieve in life. Incredibly, he made his professional debut for Deportivo Pereira at the age of just 13, making him the youngest player to ever appear professionally in Colombian football. At the age of 14 he moved to Argentina to pursue his dream of becoming a professional footballer. It was there that he flourished, establishing himself as one of the most exciting players at River Plate. After overcoming a serious knee injury in 2006, he returned to lead River Plate to the Clausura title and earn a move to Europe with Porto. It was the realization of a dream for a player which had begun life with one simple dream -- to become one of the best striker's on the planet. Fantasy football: Pedro Pinto's team of 2012 . ""Thanks to lots of training and hard work, I was able to succeed and be able to shine above other players of my age,"" Falcao said. ""This is work that took a long time, many years in terms of knowing the position, the development of my abilities and also the talent and potential that I was born with. ""Through lots of training, I went along perfecting it, along with knowing the team that I play with, both Atletico Madrid and my national team, which allowed my good development as a striker."" While league and cup success with Atletico remains his priority, the opportunity to lead Colombia into battle at the 2014 World Cup is high up on the agenda. Falcao on fire as Atletico Madrid win Europa League . Colombia has not appeared at the World Cup finals since 1998, but is third in the South American qualifying section. The top four of the nine competing nations will automatically qualify for Brazil, while the fifth-placed team goes into a playoff against an Asia confederation side. Falcao who has scored five goals in six qualifying games, wants the latest generation of Colombian talent to write their own records and emerge from the shadow of former great players such as Carlos Valderrama and Faustino Asprilla. ""We're forming quite a strong team and hopefully we can manage to qualify for the World Cup and for the next few World Cups and bring lots of other triumphs and victories home,"" he said. ""I don't like comparisons too much -- we simply want to write our own history and hope that it's important for our country.""","Radamel Falcao, known as ""El Tigre,"" is one of the world's most lethal strikers .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The 24-year-old son of the late Benazir Bhutto, groomed to take the reins of power in Pakistan, came of age politically Thursday, exactly five years after the assassination of his mother. Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari flexed his tender political muscles at a rally with his father, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, near the family home in Sindh province ahead of next year's elections. He delivered a political stump speech acknowledging problems in Pakistan, such as the devastation caused by floods. He also slammed the terror that led to his mother's killing and asked why there have been no convictions for the crime. He also backed Malala Yousafzai, the young Pakistani blogger who became an international cause celebre after she was shot by the Taliban in October this year for supporting the education of girls -- a practice much reviled and feared by Islamic militants. Bhutto-Zardari said that the government has adopted law that protects women in property disputes and from domestic abuse. He tied the assault on Malala to the killing of his mother, condemning and confidently rejecting threats. ""To those who attack Malala, I say, if you attack one Malala, thousands of Malalas will be born,"" he said. ""We are the followers of Bhutto. If you kill one Bhutto, a Bhutto will emerge from each household."" For every Benazir Bhutto slain, or martyred, he said, ""every woman will become a Benazir."" ""You will stamp out one lantern, then millions of lights will burn bright."" Bhutto, the first woman elected prime minister in a Muslim nation, led Pakistan twice, from 1988 to 1990 and then again from 1993 to 1996. Both times she was prime minister, she was dismissed from office amid allegations of corruption. She was killed in 2007, shortly after returning to Pakistan from a self-imposed, eight-year exile to run in the country's general elections. Bhutto-Zardari lived most of his life in Dubai and London during his family's exile. After his mother's death, he was picked to serve as chairman of the Pakistan People's Party, the ruling political party. ""Our party will never fear any terrorist,"" he told the crowd Thursday in Urdu, the Pakistani language that isn't his native tongue. ""Our road is the road to democracy."" His speech had a populist tinge and a warning to his party's enemies. ""Bhuttoism is an ideology for the poor,"" he said. ""You will cut our hands, but we will raise our flags. They will sew our lips, but we will chant, 'Long live Bhutto.' "" After the speech, President Zardari, who also has been accused of corruption, took the podium after his son spoke, beaming with pride. ""He has to learn with you. He has to learn about Pakistan, learn how to work with you, learn your thinking. And God willing, his elders and your elders are with him,"" he said. He told the crowd that Bhutto-Zardari's ""education is finished, and his training has begun."" ""The nation is yours, it is with you, we are all with you, congratulations to Bilawal and the coming generations,"" he said. One Pakistani journalist was quick to praise Bhutto-Zardari for his command of Urdu -- seen as a political feat of sorts. Hamid Mir, speaking on GEO TV, said that Bhutto-Zardari ""cannot speak Urdu clearly, and this speech was very impressive because he worked very hard to spontaneously deliver the speech in perfect Urdu."" Five years on though, the Bhutto murder case remains unresolved. A Pakistani special prosecutor accused a court of dragging out the case against five men accused in connection with the December 27, 2007, killing of Bhutto. ""Several times, the court has rejected our request"" for hearings in the case, Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali, a special prosecutor with the Federal Investigation Agency, told CNN on Wednesday. Read more: 7 indicted in connection with Bhutto assassination . The five men, who were indicted by an anti-terror court, are accused of having links to Beitullah Mehsud, the late leader of the Pakistani Taliban believed to be the mastermind behind the attack on Bhutto. The men are due back in court on January 5, Ali said. Read more: Who are the Pakistan Taliban? The special prosecutor has sent two letters to Interpol asking for the arrest of former President Pervez Musharraf, who has been accused of failing to protect Bhutto despite threats to her life. Watch: Video is of escapee who tried to kill Pakistan's former president, say police . Musharraf has been in self-imposed exile in London and Dubai after leaving Pakistan in 2008. In August 2012, Pakistani authorities confiscated his property and froze his bank account. The former military ruler has denied having anything to do with Bhutto's killing. Bhutto survived an assassination attempt in October 2007 in Karachi during her homecoming that killed 139 people. The following December, she was killed in a gun-suicide bomb attack as she was wrapping up a campaign rally in Rawalpindi ahead of parliamentary elections. Mehsud, the alleged architect of the attack, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in August 2009 in Pakistan's volatile Waziristan province, according to authorities. He denied being behind the attack on Bhutto, according to statements released by his spokesman shortly after the former prime minister's killing. But authorities said Mehsud chose a teenager from his own tribe to act as the as the suicide bomber in the attack on Bhutto. The suicide bomber was taken to Rawalpindi by three members of the Taliban, who handed him over to two others who provided him temporary housing and gave him information on when and where Bhutto could be targeted, according to Ali, the special prosecutor.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In the latest Bond movie ""Skyfall,"" Daniel Craig's 007 pursues an assassin up a glass skyscraper in the dead of night and meets a glamorous casino host with a troubled past. The action could plausibly have taken place in any of the world's major metropolises but the film makers chose Shanghai and Macau, two of China's most dynamic cities. It reflects the growing importance of China as a market for Hollywood movies and Chinese backdrops, themes and actors are likely to become only more commonplace. But appealing to Chinese audiences is fraught with difficulty as the makers of ""Skyfall,"" which has fallen foul of Chinese censors, have discovered. Censors cut a key scene and altered subtitled dialogue in the movie, which opened in China on Monday. Its release was also reportedly delayed to help boost the box office takings of rival homegrown movies. Read more: Opinion: Censorship row reveals tolerant side of China's new leadership . According to The Hollywood Reporter, the offending scene showed the shooting of a security guard in the lobby of a Shanghai skyscraper by the French assassin being chased by Bond. Later in the movie, at a casino in Macau, 007 asks Severine (Berenice Marlohe) about her tattoo. The Chinese subtitles hint at mob connections, removing a reference to her becoming a prostitute at a young age as per the original. Read more: Chinese newspaper in eye of censorship storm back on sale . And references to the backstory of Javier Bardem's rogue MI6 agent were culled to avoid giving attention his role in stalling Hong Kong's handover to China, the Yangzi Evening News reported. Such censorship is not uncommon for Hollywood films released in China, says Rance Pow, founder of Artisan Gateway, a Shanghai-based film and cinema consultancy, and every film released in China is subject to the censorship bureau's approval. Read more: Censorship protest a test for China . Scenes deemed offensive were also removed from ""Men in Black 3"" and the ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" Movies featuring social unrest, religion, political matters, sex and violence are likely to face extra scrutiny, said Pow. ""Part of this is rooted in the fact that China still does not have a movie rating system and so the burden of determining what is appropriate for the general public to see falls on the (censor),"" he said. Read more: Chinese censors block news on blind activist's escape . Domestic film producers, like Li Peisen, the chairman of Orange Sky Entertainment, say pleasing censors is common sense and part of doing business in China. ""I think foreign movies have to use Chinese elements carefully. There has to be a mix of positive and negative portrayal,"" Li told CNN. It's understandable (why censors want to remove certain scenes) if a movie contains only a few China scenes and the Chinese characters either get killed or appear in negative roles like prostitutes."" Other challenges Hollywood faces as it vies for its share of the Chinese box office -- now the world's second largest -- include rampant piracy and efforts by authorities to protect homegrown films. China relaxed its quota system for U.S. films last year but still only allows 34 movies a year -- up from 20 previously. To circumvent the quota, many U.S. studios are launching tie-ups with their Chinese counterparts to get preferential access but these co-productions, as they are known, have mixed results. There is also widespread industry speculation that China rigs release dates to favor domestic movies. Pow says that ""Skyfall"" and ""The Hobbit,"" scheduled to be released later this year, may have fallen prey to this: ""December is traditionally a month where Chinese films enjoy a period where no imported...titles are released in China."" Illegal downloading too takes its toll on the film industry. Chinese audiences can easily access a copy of the original ""Skyfall"" should they wish to see the uncut version, but this does not necessarily hurt box office takings, said Pow. ""The publicity surrounding heavy censorship creates greater awareness so while illegal downloading will go up, ticket sales at cinemas will also go up,"" he said. ""It can spin both ways.""

"(CNN) -- A collection of rare ancient Greek coins which has been hidden away for two decades is expected to sell for millions of dollars when it goes up for auction in New York on Wednesday. The Prospero Collection features coins of historical and artistic importance, including one described by an expert as ""a masterpiece of ancient Greek art."" Assembled by a private collector over three decades, from 1960 to 1991, the treasure trove has remained untouched for the past 20 years. After so long out of the spotlight, the coins have attracted serious interest from potential buyers around the world and at recent viewings in the U.S. and the UK. Paul Hill, ancient Greek coin specialist at dealers A. H. Baldwin & Sons, the company behind the sale, said many of the coins were ""miniature works of art."" The most valuable item in the collection is a gold stater featuring the head of a bearded satyr and the figure of a winged griffin, which the auction catalog describes as ""without doubt the greatest ancient Greek gold coin."" Hill said the lot, ""a masterpiece of ancient Greek art,"" had a pre-sale estimate of $650,000 and may eventually go under the hammer for as much as $1 million. He said that while most of the lots were likely to sell to collectors, coins were increasingly being seen as an attractive investment, given the global financial crisis. ""They are of great artistic beauty and historical significance, which makes them more interesting than stocks or shares, and they are tangible and portable, compared to a big estate."" ""Such passion has gone into the collection, and it has been an important part of somebody's life for so long, that there is an element of sadness to see it split up,"" Hill told CNN. ""But it is lovely to see it published together now, for posterity, before it is 'recycled' and finds new homes with new collectors all over the world."" The Prospero Collection will be sold at auction at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York on January 4, 2012.","Prospero Collection of ancient Greek coins to be sold at auction .

""Over 250 girls read for the part, but it wasn't until Shailene stepped in front of the camera that I truly saw Hazel for the first time. It was like lightning striking. I can't wait for the rest of the world to see what I have.""

"(CNN) -- A Seattle man was sentenced to 18 years in prison on Monday for plotting to attack a military processing center using grenades and machine guns, the Justice Department said. Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif, also known as Anthony Davis, pleaded guilty in December to conspiracy to murder U.S. military members and to conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, namely explosives. According to U.S. District Judge James Robart, the 2011 plot to attack recruits at the Military Entrance Processing Center in Seattle ""could have done incredible harm if it had gone forward."" The plot was thwarted when Abdul-Latif, 34, approached an individual about participating in the attack and supplying guns, prosecutors said. That person then began working with law enforcement. Authorities began monitoring Abdul-Latif and co-conspirator Walli Mujahidh, 33, and recorded them in June 2011 discussing a plan to go after the processing center. Abdul-Latif wanted to use grenades and machine guns and took steps to buy those arms. The person who was secretly cooperating with law enforcement brought three machine guns to a meeting with the pair. As soon as the men accepted the guns, which had been rendered harmless, they were arrested. ""This defendant planned to attack a military center when there would be the largest possible gathering of new recruits and their families,"" said Jenny Durkan, the U.S. Attorney in Seattle. ""He targeted young men and women solely because they wanted to serve our country. His goal: to inspire others with a message of hate."" Prosecutors recommended a lengthy prison term and said Abdul-Latif had not expressed any remorse or disavowed the radical ideology that led him to undertake the plot. Mujahidh is scheduled to be sentenced on April 8.","Plan was to attack a military processing center using grenades and machine guns .

"(WIRED) -- Microsoft Office has been a desktop computer staple for decades, and now it looks like it might finally migrate to modern touchscreen tablets. But does Microsoft's mouse- and keyboard-dependent productivity software even belong on a tablet? And if it does make the transition to touch, how will we actually use it? Yesterday, a report by staff of The Daily claimed that Microsoft Office for iPad apps are definitely in the works, and could be released ""in the coming weeks."" The story included photos and descriptions of a purported hands-on demo. Microsoft representatives were quick to shoot back both on Twitter and in an official statement stating The Daily had its facts wrong and that its reporters had not, in fact, seen an actual Microsoft product on the tablet. Nonetheless, The Daily's Peter Ha later insisted that a working version of the app was demoed to the digital publication by a Microsoft employee. It's a he-said-she-said situation, but at least one key industry watcher feels Office for iPad makes sense. ""I can say that based on the products Microsoft currently has in the market, launching additional Office apps for Apple devices would be a logical extension of their existing strategy,"" Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps told Wired in an e-mail. Microsoft already has Mac and iOS products like Office for Mac, a note-taking app called OneNote, SkyDrive for cloud storage, and Lync, points out Rotman Epps. Rumors that Microsoft would be bringing Office to the iPad have been circulating for a while, particularly since The Daily reported in late November that the suite would arrive in early 2012 at a $10 price point. If what The Daily reported Tuesday is true, it's possible that Microsoft Office for iPad could land concurrent to -- or even onstage with -- Apple's first public iPad 3 demo, which is expected to be held the first week of March. It would certainly make for an interesting presentation, as Apple doesn't actively evangelize its Microsoft synergy. Microsoft will be demoing its Windows 8 OS consumer preview on Feb. 29 so the timing of an early March Office for iPad unveiling would seem to work: Microsoft's big platform-wide announcement wouldn't be upstaged by its smaller Apple announcement. So let's assume Office is coming to the iPad. How precisely will you use it? ""You'll use it for content curation. And it's very unlikely you'll be using the iPad in native tablet touch mode,"" Sachin Dev Duggal, CEO of Nivio, told Wired. Nivio is a cloud platform that lets you access your desktop and its files -- including Windows and Microsoft Office -- with a touch-controlled mouse pointer as input. ""In most cases, you'll have it docked into a screen or a keyboard,"" Dev Duggal said of the rumored Office app. However, a second use case -- passively browsing through documents -- definitely lends itself to the iPad's simple touch-controlled data input. And don't underestimate the value of full document support. By loading native Office docs directly into Office, you ensure files render with proper formatting, a talent not always manifest in competitors like Documents to Go Premium. In this case, ""The pure gesture-based control works great,"" Dev Duggal said. ""It translates to a tablet experience."" OK, so Dev Duggal paints an interesting picture of how the app will be used, but, again, is there a desperate need for Office on the iPad? Many of us have been getting by just fine without it. Well, according to Resolve Market Research, 18% of those who decided not to purchase an iPad 2 did so strictly because it didn't come with Microsoft Office programs. That's not a number to balk at. Dev Duggal thinks students and small businesses will be interested in Office for iPad. And there's also another prime user group: people who don't want to spend money on multiple devices. ""If they can cross-utilize devices to also do productivity, thats a huge cost savings,"" Dev Duggal said. Elaine Coleman of Resolve Market Research concurs with Dev Duggal. ""Tablets are a critical dual-purpose device,"" Coleman told Wired, adding that close to 70% of personal tablet users also use their devices for business. Indeed, the iPad has a growing role in the world of enterprise computing, with a large percent of Fortune 500 companies adopting the tablet (this was a touch point in Apple CEO Tim Cook's recent first-quarter earnings call). So, no doubt, the addition of Microsoft Office to the enterprise mix would be welcome. But Microsoft has waited a long time to deliver this product -- perhaps too long. ""Every day that Microsoft does not have Office apps for iPad, they lose potential sales to competitors,"" Rotman Epps said. Such competitors include: Apple's own iWork office suite; Quickoffice, an iPhone alternative for viewing, sharing and editing Microsoft Office documents; and SlideShark, an iPad-based PowerPoint platform. Rotman Epps pointed out that these and a host of other productivity apps are all top performers in Apple's App Store. Indeed, Apple's Pages, Keynote and Numbers (in other words, the iWork suite) make up three of the top five spots in the Top Charts for paid Productivity apps in the App Store. And with OS X Mountain Lion's heavy iCloud integration, using Apple's iWork suite will make even more sense for users who own multiple Apple products. Whether people who already use Office alternatives would switch to Microsoft-brand products is ""hard to say for sure,"" says Coleman. ""I think in the enterprise many still believe 'Office is King' and will come back."" Regardless, if Microsoft Office for iPad did make its debut onstage for the iPad 3 in a few weeks, it would be the first time the two tech giants teamed up at an Apple event in 15 years. Considering what happened last time, it would be a landmark occasion. For both companies. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- U.S. gasoline prices broke a nearly three-month upward spiral in early March, and motorists can expect a bit more relief in the coming weeks, according to the latest Lundberg Survey. The average price of regular across the continental United States stood at $3.74 on Friday, a 5Â½-cent drop from the last Lundberg report on February 22, survey publisher Trilby Lundberg said. That comes after an increase of nearly 54 cents since late December, she said. Crude oil, which makes up about 70% of the price at the pump, went down slightly in the past two weeks, Lundberg said. Most refineries have finished their seasonal maintenance and are gearing up for spring and summer driving demand, meaning fuel supplies are ""more than adequate."" ""More pump-price declines seem to be on their way, maybe more than a dime,"" she said. The Lundberg Survey canvasses about 2,500 filling stations every two weeks. The most expensive gasoline in the latest survey was in Los Angeles, where fuel averaged $4.23 per gallon; the cheapest was in Billings, Montana, at $3.31. Average per-gallon prices in other cities: . Atlanta: $3.71 . Boston: $3.78 . Chicago: $4.00 . Denver: $3.52 . Houston: $3.56 . Long Island, New York: $3.97 . Miami: $3.83 . Minneapolis: $3.68 .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Caroline Pla has been playing football since kindergarten, and for the past two years, the 11-year-old has been knocking opposing players on their butts. It never occurred to her that someone might need to protect her from the sport she adores. Her playing time with the Catholic Youth Organization ended after last season when the Archdiocese of Philadelphia enforced its ""boys only"" policy for football, sidelining the All-Star guard and defensive end. Inspired by her older brother, George, 14, Caroline started playing Pop Warner flag football at age 5 and was hooked. Once she got too big to play Pop Warner, she signed up to play tackle football with the CYO in the fifth grade. Two games into Caroline's second season, head coach Chip Ross received an unexpected call from Jason Budd, deputy secretary for Catholic education for the archdiocese, who oversees the football program. The 5-foot-3, 110-pound sixth-grader, Budd explained to Ross, could no longer play for the Romans because, according to the CYO handbook, football is a full-contact sport -- no girls allowed. Unaware such a rule existed, Ross was shocked, he said. ""She should be allowed to play,"" said Ross, who also coaches football at a nearby high school. ""Football is a sport that culls out the folks that can hang or not hang, and certainly, Caroline has been more than able to hold her own."" League of their own . Not wanting to disrupt the season or ostracize Caroline, Ross and her parents kept the news under wraps and pleaded with the archdiocese to let her finish the season. After a week of corresponding with Budd, including sending a letter of support from the family's church pastor, an extension was granted. There are 46 football programs, each with junior varsity and varsity teams, under the Archdiocese of Philadelphia CYO. Of the nearly 2,500 participants, Caroline is the only female player. The coaches waited until the end of the season to tell Caroline and her teammates that she was off the team because of the archdiocese's ""boys only"" rule. ""I was mad,"" Caroline said after learning she wasn't allowed to play, ""just really mad that we don't get the same opportunity as boys just because we're not a boy. ""Not only am I not going to be able to play, but girls all over aren't going to be able to sign up,"" she said. ""And I don't think that's fair."" Though Caroline says she's never been hurt -- and has laid her share of licks on the boys -- the archdiocese said in a statement that the decision to give Caroline the boot was for her and other girls' safety. ""The Archdiocese of Philadelphia's Catholic Youth Organization currently designates football as a full-contact sport for boys only. It is important to note that most CYO sports are designated by gender, with some sports offering separate leagues for boys and girls. These measures are taken in an effort to ensure a safe and appropriate playing environment for all participants,"" Archdiocese of Philadelphia spokesman Kenneth A. Gavin said in a statement. ""Traditionally, football is a boys only sport due to its full contact nature. Most parents and players have preferred this; some now disagree. An archdiocesan panel of coaches, parents, pastors and experts in the sports medicine and pediatrics fields will evaluate the current rule. Calls for an immediate change in the policy are premature and unwise without adequate consultation, especially given the potential safety issues involved,"" the statement continued. According to the archdiocese, budget cuts and personnel changes allowed Caroline to slip through the cracks, but she actually should've been denied the opportunity to play when she initially applied in fifth grade. She'll 'knock you on your butt' When she first stepped on the field, the boys on Caroline's first CYO team were uncomfortable lining up against a girl, said her former coach, Jim Reichwein. Those concerns dissipated once Caroline showed she was tough enough to pop a lineman in the mouth just like the rest of her teammates. ""We didn't make a big deal about it,"" said Reichwein. ""Anyone who went head-to-head with her ended up on the ground. After a week, (her gender) was laid to lest."" Reichwein, who is also Caroline's basketball coach and her best friend's father, said she embodies the character and sportsmanship that football coaches so often strive to instill in their players. ""This whole fight is for other people more than it is for her,"" he said. ""She's such a caring, kind, well-rounded young lady who's able to put a helmet on, throw a switch and knock you on your butt."" Caroline's father proudly stands with his daughter. He said the ruling is outdated. ""Girls playing football is not something new. They're not going through uncharted water or pioneering something that hasn't been addressed before,"" George Pla said. ""The sport will determine where's she's best able to play, if she is at all."" All four Pla children are encouraged to pursue their passions, whether it's theater or football, George Pla said. Caroline's twin sister, Alexandra, uninterested in playing football, would prefer to remain on the sidelines as a cheerleader. Tackling the boys-only rule is bigger than just letting her twin back on the gridiron, Alexandra said. ""She's trying really hard to let girls play football,"" she said. ""I really like to watch her play, and the rule should be changed so anyone can play."" Rally 'round the girl . After calls and e-mails to the archdiocese were unsuccessful, Caroline, no longer welcome to play football for the CYO, decided to call an audible. With the full support of her team, Caroline's mom, Seal Pla, started an online petition at change.org to encourage the archdiocese to allow girls to play football. Her original goal was to get 100 signatures. There are now more than 100,000. One signer is 9-year-old peewee football sensation Samantha ""Sweet Feet"" Gordon from Utah. She was recently featured on a Wheaties box and made a November appearance on ""NFL Gameday Morning,"" where she showed off her moves to Hall of Famers Marshall Faulk and Warren Sapp. She also was invited to this year's Super Bowl in New Orleans, where she blogged for four days for espnW.com, which focuses on female athletes. Even Philadelphia Councilman and devout Catholic Jim Kenney fired off an official letter to the archdiocese, saying the issue ""hits close to home."" ""The archdiocese is one of the last remaining defenders of gender discriminating in sports, so let us proudly take a giant leap forward in Catholic education today by purging this archaic rule from the CYO handbook,"" he wrote. Caroline also caught the attention of talk show host Ellen DeGeneres. Sporting her navy and gold football jersey on set, Caroline won over the crowd during her appearance last month. When asked whether she's gotten hurt, the crowd erupted when she quipped with a made-for-TV smile, ""I've never really gotten hurt, but I have hurt people."" Could archdiocese cut back? Caroline's fight to get back on the field hasn't swayed the archdiocese yet, but the panel selected by the archdiocese is expected to issue a decision on the boys-only rule by mid-March. In a final appeal, Caroline, who also competes on CYO track and basketball teams, wrote to Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput after recently learning he would have the final say after the panel makes their recommendation. In an e-mail provided to CNN by the Pla family, Chaput told Caroline he was ""perplexed"" that she wrote to him only after going to the media. ""I admire your love of the game, Caroline, and I'm impressed by your zeal in pursuing the opportunity to play it,"" he wrote. ""At the same time, it's important to understand that pressure is not a good way of showing respect for dedicated people who are simply fulfilling their duty to protect young people in sports."" The chiding seems to ignore that Caroline's parents wrote the archdiocese, to no avail, before taking their daughter's cause public, the Plas said. Though it's now basketball season for Caroline, she isn't giving up her fight. She's not being disrespectful when she says the archbishop's claim that he's just trying to protect her doesn't ring true. ""I was just really surprised that we're not allowed to play because we're girls,"" Caroline said. ""They say it's a safety issue, but I don't get that because it's not just a safety issue for us; it's a safety issue for anybody that goes on to the field.""","Girl played two season of tackle football before archdiocese enforced boys-only rule .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Washington-based imam told CNN on Monday that alleged Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan approached him for help finding a wife. Imam Yahya Hendi, the Muslim chaplain at Georgetown University, said Hasan came to him at least two years ago as the cleric conducted services at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. ""He said he wanted someone to help him serve, deploy and be understandable and understanding of his own military career,"" Hendi said. ""He saw himself as someone ... continuing his service with the U.S. military till the end of his career."" The imam said he spoke with Hasan on at least two occasions about his search for a spouse. ""It's not easy to find, in general, someone who will be willing to travel with you and deploy with you every two years,"" Hendi said. ""But he did want a wife who would stand by him, is [a] loyal American, who will help him do his work and his service for the U.S. military."" The imam's comments about Hasan's search for someone who would remain with him throughout his military career were at odds with some statements by Hasan's family. Relatives have said Hasan tried unsuccessfully to leave the military early -- requests that may have come after Hasan contacted Hendi. The cleric said he did try to help Hasan in his search, thinking of women he knew to whom he could introduce the Army psychiatrist, but he never heard from Hasan again. Authorities say Hasan opened fire at a military processing center at Fort Hood Army Post on November 5, killing 13 people. Hasan, who was seriously wounded in the incident, was charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder -- charges that make him eligible for the death penalty. Two other imams have told CNN similar stories about Hasan's search for a wife, and about his conservatism and apparent devotion to Islam -- but those accounts seem to be inconsistent with behavior Hasan exhibited in the last few months. The manager of a strip club near Fort Hood has told reporters that Hasan visited the club a handful of times, staying for several hours each time. ""You know, for me, everything that he did is against the teachings of Islam. Killing fellow soldiers, fellow citizen men and women, the shooting, the bloodshed, speaks of someone who did not understand his faith very well. Islam is against going to strip clubs, but it's also against killing fellow citizens,"" Hendi told CNN. When taken as a whole, Hasan's actions in the weeks before the attack at Fort Hood -- the giving away of his possessions, his sometimes conservative dress in white Muslim clothing, and his previous defense of suicide bombings during presentations to classmates -- seem to be those of someone who was preparing for his own death, said CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen. ""I think what he was doing was sort of a jihadist 'death-by-cop,'"" said Bergen, who based his observations on news reports about Hasan. ""Here's a guy who obviously had personal problems. He's a loner, he avoids women basically, has few friends, and then grafted onto that, he finds sort of a jihadist ideology as a way of making sense of everything, and he decides to martyr himself."" Bergen and other experts say Hasan could be someone who engaged in what they call ""self-radicalization"": the idea that militant religion might provide an answer to psychological problems that someone already has. Hasan remained hospitalized in Texas, paralyzed from the waist down, his lawyer said. He was shot by a civilian police officer, who was also wounded in the attack.","Imam:  Nidal Malik Hasan wanted wife who could deal with his military career .

"(CNN) -- ""A perfect storm"" hit Mindy McCready in the days before the country singer killed herself in the same spot where her boyfriend had died five weeks earlier, a close friend said. McCready, who burst onto the music scene in 1996 with the chart-topping country hit ""Guys Do It All the Time,"" suffered from addiction that stalled her career. Her biggest notoriety in recent years came from her participation in the 2009 season of the reality TV show ""Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew."" Dr. Drew Pinsky also hosts a program on CNN sister network HLN, ""Dr. Drew on Call."" Private investigator Danno Hanks, who knew McCready for several years and frequently advised her, said she called him Saturday, a day before she died from what investigators concluded was a self-inflicted gunshot. ""Saturday was a very bad day for her,"" Hanks said. McCready, 37, told him about an e-mail she received on Friday from the Arkansas' Division of Children and Family Services that included a proposed court order that would send her two children to live with her mother in Florida. ""The proposed court order was the nail in her coffin, the thing that sent her over the edge,"" Hanks said. The Arkansas agency declined to comment on the case, citing confidentiality laws. ""When we take children into our care, reunification with the biological parents is always our goal,"" spokeswoman Amy Webb told CNN. ""Sometimes it's not safe and we cannot."" McCready's world unraveled in the 35 days after David Wilson, the father of her younger son, was found fatally wounded on the porch of the Heber Springs, Arkansas, home where the couple lived, Hanks said. ""After (his) suicide, she essentially fell apart,"" Hanks said. McCready couldn't go to the hospital to spend Wilson's dying hours with him because investigators held her to test her hands for gunshot residue, he said. The test eliminated her as a suspect in the shooting, he said, but the Cleburne County Sheriff's Office withheld a conclusion that Wilson had committed suicide until the autopsy report was completed. McCready prepped suicide prevention video . Tabloids reported that McCready was a suspect in his death. ""There was no murder investigation,"" Hanks said. ""All the police ever said was, 'We have not finished our investigation.'"" Cleburne County Sheriff Marty Moss did not return CNN's calls for comment Tuesday. McCready told an NBC interviewer two weeks after Wilson's death that the speculation was painful. ""I was hurting so bad, and then they just did whatever they could to make it hurt even more,"" she said. The long, tortured journey of Mindy McCready . It wasn't long before a children's services worker knocked on her door in response to a request from the father of her oldest son, country singer Billy McKnight, Hanks said. ""The father felt that she was a danger to her kids and a danger to herself and she had gone into this deep depression and needed to go and get some mental evaluation,"" he explained said. The agent placed both children into foster care after McCready tested positive for alcohol, which McCready blamed on mouthwash, Hanks said. McCready, who was also taken into custody for a mental exam, told Hanks she was given a urine and blood test, which showed no drugs or alcohol in her system, he recounted. A doctor released her after several days, he said. ""What he was doing was sending home someone who is now made even more distraught by having her children taken away and sending her home to a house that just had lots of guns because David was a gun nut,"" he said. Her hopes of getting her children back were dashed by that proposed court order from the state agency on Friday, he said. The order would send the boys to their maternal grandmother, with whom McCready had fought for custody of her older son for five years, he said. ""In Mindy's mind, a proposed order might as well be written in stone because every proposed order that had been presented in the past down in Florida courts, the judge would just rubber-stamp it,"" he said. The combined toll of 35 days of bad news, starting with Wilson's death, took a heavy toll on her, Hanks said . ""You have this perfect storm of several things that happened to her in succession,"" he said. ""His suicide, her kids being taken away from her, the feeling that the media was out to get her, because they were putting out these reports that she was under suspicion in his murder."" McCready's last day was focused on getting the world to hear a song, he said. ""I'll See You Yesterday"" was the last thing she recorded with Wilson, who was a music producer. ""It's such a beautiful song. It must be heard,"" she told NBC. Mindy McCready: A playlist . She sang: . ""I was your sunlight, but now I'm just a shade . ""I was your blue sky, now I'm just the rain . ""I was your favorite song, but now I'm overplayed . ""If tomorrow's gonna be the same, I'll see you yesterday."" McCready asked Hanks to help her get it played on the radio. She also asked him to upload it to YouTube along with photos of her and Wilson. ""She was anxious to get this video posted,"" he said. ""I didn't realize it at the time, I didn't realize what the urgency (was about)."" She told him she wanted it to be a suicide prevention public service announcement, he said. ""In retrospect, I realize what she was not revealing was that her true reason was that this was her suicide video,"" he said. ""She wanted it out there because she knew that the video would get more play after she committed her suicide. She wanted the world at the end to know how she had been treated and mistreated and all the stuff that she had gone through."" Her last wish came true. The video has gone viral, getting hundreds of thousands of views since her death. Country radio stations are playing her song. ""If these people had reached out to her in life as they have in death, maybe it would be a different outcome,"" Hanks said. ""If she had known how many fans that she had out there and how many supporters she truly did have, she might have had the courage to go on. But I think she just felt she was alone, that nobody cared about what was happening to her."" In the NBC interview aired on the ""Today"" show last month, McCready summed it up: ""My life hasn't ever really made sense to me, because I do know what kind of person I am and I do know that I try to be as good a person as I can possibly be every day.""

"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- In an audio statement made while he sits in a jail cell awaiting sentence, convicted pedophile Jerry Sandusky says that while others make him out to be a monster, he is a falsely accused man who will continue to protest his innocence. ""They could take away my life, they could make me out as a monster, they could treat me as a monster, but they can't take away my heart,"" the former coach at Penn State says. ""In my heart, I know I did not do these alleged disgusting acts."" Sandusky co-counsel Karl Rominger confirmed the audio statement is legitimate. ""If he wants to say that, God bless the First Amendment,"" Rominger said. Penn State University's ComRadio first aired the audio clip on its website Monday evening. Sandusky, a 68-year-old former defensive coordinator who ran a charity after he retired from coaching, faces up to life in prison. He is scheduled to be the final speaker at a sentencing hearing Tuesday. ""We will continue to fight,"" he said in the audio statement. ""We didn't lose the proven facts, evidence, accurate locations and times. Anything can be said. We lost to speculation and stories that were influenced by people who wanted to convict me."" McQueary files whistleblower suit . Sandusky needs to confess his guilt, said an attorney for the person identified in court as Victim No. 4. ""One thing that's critical for victims' healing is an acknowledgment of guilt. (Sandusky) is stunting that healing,"" attorney Ben Andreozzi. ""He is either delusional, or the victim of one of the most comprehensive conspiracies of mankind."" Another victim's attorney, Tom Kline, said the lack of contrition was to be expected. He called the statement ""sad and unfortunate."" The attorney for a man who claims he was repeatedly sexually abused by Sandusky while a child said the statement is a reminder that child predators justify their actions. ""Pedophiles often believe they did not do anything wrong. In their twisted universe, they helped their victims and loved them,"" said Marci Hamilton, an attorney for Travis Weaver, now 30. Weaver did not testify in Sandusky's trial, but did file a civil action against the former coach. It has been nearly a year since the Penn State scandal erupted, leading to the firing of iconic head football coach Joe Paterno and the ouster of the university's longtime president. Jurors determined in June that Sandusky used his access to university facilities and a foundation he founded for under-privileged youth to sexually abuse 10 boys over a 15-year period. His attorney, Joe Amendola, said Monday that his client, who is being held in the Centre County, Pennsylvania, jail, plans to read a statement before the court. Sandusky's statement should take five to 10 minutes, he said, but likely will steer clear of the argument he failed to receive a fair trial. On Monday the judge made it clear sentencing wouldn't be the place for such legal arguments, Amendola said. On June 22, Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less-than-two-week trial. His attorneys will have 10 days after the sentencing to appeal the decision. At least of three of Sandusky's victims are expected to be in attendance on Tuesday, according to their attorneys. Two of them plan to address the former coach directly, while the third is expected to have a statement read by prosecutors. The statement from Victim No.4 ""will convey anger,"" said Andreozzi said. ""He is nowhere near forgiving Sandusky."" Members of Sandusky's family, including his wife, Dottie, will submit letters of support to the court as will some of the former participants in the Second Mile foundation, Amendola said. Penn State fans vow to support team . During the trial, which garnered national attention and cast a shadow on Penn State's heralded football program, the 23-year-old victim testified that he was only 13 when Sandusky sexually abused him in a university shower. That account is separate from a 2001 incident about which graduate assistant Mike McQueary testified, saying that he saw the former coach pressed up against the back of a boy in the shower room of the Lasch Football Building. Prosecutors described during the trial how Sandusky showered with the boy, using locker room ""soap fights"" as a pretext for abuse. Sandusky's attorneys say they plan to appeal the guilty verdict, and will argue that the jury's opinions had been tainted by a prosecution reference to a disturbing interview their client did with NBC's Bob Costas prior to the trial. Members of the defense team have also maintained that they were denied sufficient time to prepare. Less than a month after Sandusky's conviction, former FBI Director Louis Freeh released his university-funded report that blamed Paterno, President Graham Spanier, suspended Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-Vice President Gary Schultz for taking part in a cover-up to avoid bad publicity. When a hero falls off a pedestal . Freeh also said Paterno could have stopped the attacks had he done more, though neither McQueary, Sandusky nor Paterno -- who died in January -- were interviewed by his investigators. Attorneys for Spanier blasted the review, calling it a ""blundering, indefensible indictment"" and ""a flat-out distortion of facts"" that was ""infused with bias and innuendo."" In July, the NCAA imposed sanctions against Penn State, including a $60 million fine, scholarship reductions, the vacating of 112 wins, five years' probation and a bowl ban for four years.

"New Orleans (CNN) -- When I first met the wiry-looking fellow, I had no idea he was a musical genius. Nor did I know his instrument of choice. Nor that I was about to witness the last breaths of a generation. I had strolled into New Orleans simply looking for some good photos. That is all. Just some good photos and some good times. It was Mardi Gras, of course, and it was 1975. By strict calendar standards, the 1960s were long over, but few generations pay heed to the calendar, nor did my new friend, who called himself ""the Broom Strummer of Bourbon Street."" The Broom Strummer was probably 10 years my senior, and he was instantly likeable. He walked with a slight tilt, told remarkable stories about his childhood and accomplishments, and had something slung over his shoulder. I didn't pay much attention to it. But when we walked onto Bourbon Street, others took note. Best bites in the Big Easy . ""Hey Broom Strummer! Broom Strummer!"" revelers shouted. ""Play me some broom!"" He appeared annoyed, but it was an act. He removed a leather guitar case shaped like a broom from his back. He placed it on the street, unclasped the lid, and ceremoniously pulled out a standard kitchen broom. I expected him to start noisily ""sweeping"" the street -- perhaps to the beat of a familiar song. ""I knew a man, Bojangles, and he danced for you... ""Thwappity, thwap. ""In worn out shoes... ""Thwappity, thwap, thwap."" But instead, he clutched the broom as if it was a rare Les Paul. He raised his right hand aloft like a rock god. And he unleashed his fury. ""DAH DAH DAH DAH, dah dah dah dah!"" he screamed. ""DAH DAH DAH DAH, dah dah dah dah!"" Yes, the Broom Strummer had aced the opening licks to ""Jumpin' Jack Flash."" Bourbon Street was transformed. From seemingly nowhere, a hundred Keith Richardses materialized, strumming a thousand air guitars, . ""DAH DAH DAH DAH, dah dah dah dah!"" A thousand Mick Jaggers started prancing. ""But it's all-right now, 'n fact it's a gas!"" And the Broom Strummer led his tribe down Bourbon Street, singing and strumming a rock anthem. ""It's alllll right! Jumpin' Jack Flash, It's a Gas, Gas, Gaaaaaaaas!"" What to do in New Orleans between meals . Every photographer, like every fisherman, has a story about the one that got away. My ""missed it"" moment involved the Broom Strummer. I had spent the previous two days lugging around too damn many cameras, shooting the Canal Street parades and French Quarter insanity. On both days, I weighed the benefits of continuing to shoot the event, or ditching the cameras and joining the party. On day three, the party won. That was the day I bumped into the Broom Strummer. Even in the Big Easy, which has the highest character-per-square-mile ratio that God allows, the Broom Strummer was a standout. He clearly lived on the fringes of normal society, but clearly sought its endorsement -- it's official government endorsement. He said he had invented ""mismatched boots"" (which could have explained his lopsided walk) and said he held a patent -- an official government patent! -- for them. He said he had written a song with very dirty lyrics, and had gotten a copyright -- an official government copyright! -- for it. That, he enthused, meant those dirty lyrics were enshrined forever at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. -- right under the unsuspecting eyes of Congress! I hadn't the heart to tell him the government would copyright nearly anything. For the better part of the day, we walked around the Quarter, the Broom Strummer strumming for his appreciative fans, honoring their requests, but looking at them cross-eyed when they asked him to play the little brush clipped to his belt. You can't play a brush, he'd say, disdainfully. Toward evening, we retired from the Bourbon Street mayhem to the calm of Jackson Square. There, away from the relentless demands of fame, the Broom Strummer hooked up with some old friends -- Dave Banjo-Legs and a few other troubadours. Banjo-Legs and the others were softly plucking at their instruments when a burly cop strode over. In height and heft, he was straight out of Hollywood. And in lieu of stripes, he wore his attitude on his sleeves. Now, the role of the police officer at the height of Mardi Gras has been little explored -- but it should be. Sworn to uphold the law, they are nonetheless expected to restrain their instincts when dealing with the organized disorderly conduct known as Fat Tuesday. So who can blame an officer who, amid the Mardi Gras madness, happily discovers a law that can be enforced? The officer's countenance stiffened as he approached the small group of musicians, as if he had stumbled upon a meeting of mass murderers. ""Hey,"" he barked, with unimpeachable authority. ""No...music...in the...park!"" The guitars fell silent. The banjo, too. Satisfied, the cop turned and started to walk away. It was of little account, I know. But even then, I had a feeling that I was seeing an era slip away. The writing was on the wall. Already, the cool and cruel winds of disco were blowing across the land. Soon, Bourbon Street would be filled with polyester suits, blow-dried hair and Donna Summer hits. And encounters like these, between cops and felonious musicians, would be a thing of the past. Maybe the cop felt that way, too. Because he stopped. He stood there, facing away, as if he had left some business unfinished. He turned around and pointed his beefy finger at the band. And he sealed the deal. ""That goes for BROOMS, TOO!"" he said. That moment was made in photo heaven -- a gift from the photo gods. It was official. The '60s were finally over. Kaput. Done. All wrapped up in a perfect Kodak moment. And me, without my camera.","CNN's Mike Ahlers recalls a photo opportunity that got away .

"(CNN) -- The Caribbean's tropical weather, beautiful beaches and clear blue waters attract travelers seeking a place to kick back and relax. Add a cocktail and you have a true recipe for repose. Try these five drinking establishments with very different vibes: . Go bananas at Bananas . A husband and wife team quit their jobs in Philadelphia and sold virtually everything they owned to open a tropical bar and guesthouse in Puerto Rico. ""It was one of the smartest things we ever did,"" said Glenn Curry, owner of Bananas Guesthouse, Beach Bar & Grill in Vieques, Puerto Rico. The 63-year-old former journalist and his wife, Wynne, a mortgage representative, bought Bananas in 2002 and enjoy their lives hosting locals and guests from around the world at their remote tropical corner of the world. Since Vieques can only be reached by boat or plane, their establishment caters to a more adventurous crowd, Curry said. Vieques is an island municipality of Puerto Rico that lies 8 miles east of the mainland. ""Vieques is special because it is not very developed and contains unspoiled land and pristine beaches, which is attractive to many tourists,"" he said. Bananas has views of the Caribbean Sea and is a short distance from Sun Bay, a large public beach. The bar specializes in frozen drinks like piÃ±a coladas and dirty bananas. ""The atmosphere in our establishment is very relaxed,"" said Curry. ""The clock in our bar landed on happy hour and it never gains a minute,"" he said with a chuckle. Jamaican tropical oasis . The owner of Floyde's Pelican Bar in Jamaica said he doesn't keep regular hours and works on the honor system. ""If you pass by and I'm not in, then take a beer and leave cash,"" said Floyde Forbes. This remote bar can only be accessed by boat and is about six-tenths of a mile from Treasure Beach on the southern coast of Jamaica. It was built with driftwood and coconut trees. This tropical oasis, which specializes in fresh seafood and Red Stripe beer, was named after the large flock of pelicans that rest on a sandbar nearby. Forbes said the atmosphere at Floyde's is ""calm and serene with a very accepting international flavor that doesn't compare to anything else."" The original bar was built in 2001, but in 2004 Hurricane Ivan destroyed it. Local residents helped rebuild. Drink to infinity at the Infiniti Bar . You may feel like a movie star at this hot spot. Jane Fonda, Cindy Crawford and Shaquille O'Neal are among the many celebrities who have spent time relaxing at the glamorous Infiniti Bar in Turks and Caicos. The Infiniti Bar is the marquee attraction at the upscale Grace Bay Club resort and is the Caribbean's longest bar at 90 feet, according to the resort. It is surrounded by a white sand beach and lush vegetation and attracts its largest crowds at sunset. The ""longest bar in the Caribbean"" is the pride and joy of internationally renowned designer Keith Hobbs. His creation has been celebrated by guests, travel magazines and other publications since its opening in 2007. During your visit, be sure to order the bar's signature drink, the Infiniti Martini. Still standing after multiple hurricanes . Music lovers will be drawn to The Dune Preserve. Since 1994, reggae singer and songwriter Bankie Banx has owned the beach bar along Rendezvous Bay in Anguilla. Banx often performs at his bar, and he has attracted big name performers over the years, such as Jimmy Buffet and John Mayer. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton has visited, too. ""Banx formed the Moonsplash Music Festival back in 1991 and it has become one of the premier music festivals in the Caribbean,"" said his manager, Olaide Banks. The event will be March 8 to 11 this year on the grounds of The Dune Preserve. In addition to live music, the beach bar is known for its signature ""Duneshine,"" a fermented ginger cocktail. ""The two-acre complex has changed quite a bit since 1994 due to four major hurricanes, but the charm lives on,"" Banks said. The Dune Preserve is primarily built from driftwood, pieces of shipwrecked boats and harvested wood from Dominica and Guyana. Pack a swimsuit at Rick's . You'll dive into more than just a drink at Rick's Cafe in Jamaica. Since 1974, countless guests have jumped into the waters off this 45-foot cliffside bar in Negril, so be sure to pack a swimsuit and a sense of adventure. Boaters like to pull their vessels up to this seaside establishment, too. Aside from aquatic adventure, this drinking spot is known for its sunset views of the Caribbean over the naturally formed cliffs. Bring your camera! ""From the minute we entered Rick's it was evident that it was one of the most beautiful spots that we had seen in Jamaica, if not the world,"" said Sonya Matalon of Columbus, Ohio. ""I felt like I was standing in a picture postcard with an absolutely amazing view."" Rick's takes pride in calling itself ""the premier gathering spot"" in Negril and has maintained much of its original seaside ambiance despite damage from Hurricanes Gilbert and Ivan.","Cocktail seekers are in good shape in the Caribbean .

"(CNN) -- Fashion lovers crowded into a limestone townhouse on the prestigious Upper East Side of New York City on Wednesday night for an exclusive designer showcase. The house didn't belong to posh members of the high fashion elite, but to the Consulate General of the Russian Federation. The Russian Fashion Industry Showcase and Reception is one of several nationally-driven shows at New York Fashion Week promoting textile and apparel production unique to the countries. Upcoming shows will highlight the best in material and design from Korea, Japan, France and Scandinavia, but Wednesday night was all about the Russians. The evening embodied the Imperial Russia zeitgeist; chandeliers dripped with crystal, women glided about draped in fur, well-tailored men straightened their pocket squares as they passed gilded mirrors. The crowd sipped vodka and ogled designs from a conglomerate of modern Russian designers, including Serguei Teplov, Dmitry Loginov, Tegin, Irina Shaposhnikova, Sergey Polyakov and Aleksandr Khrisanfov. American figure skater Johnny Weir, who has his eyes on a third Olympic Games, in the Russian city of Sochi, stopped in and posed for photos. Russia's storied history was on display: A model's hair was mussed into a babushka headpiece; another stood with the rigid posture of a ballerina in laser-cut leather; all of them wore black outfits reflective of the country's harsh climate and lack of sunshine. ""New York City itself and, by default, Fashion Week is an avowedly international forum where everyone is welcomed and, for the most part, accepted,"" said Stephan Rabimov, the founder and editor in chief of DEPESHA magazine, which co-sponsored the event. ""It's a new type of communication channel to promote national interests: fashion, culture, tourism."" Rabimov said the U.S. fashion consumer is the perfect client for any ambitious designer. High-style buyers are, on average, well-educated professionals with lots of disposable income. Not only is the U.S. consumer a draw to international outlets, but New York is a global fashion capital on par with Paris, Milan and London. ""The American market is, simply, among the biggest, and they're very creative. As much as we can celebrate the savoir-faire of the French, I think Americans are the most creative,"" said Elisabeth Leontieff-Hirshon, a senior manager of UBIFRANCE. The Academy of Art University in San Francisco is showing a collaborative collection sponsored by UBIFRANCE, the French Trade Commission, on Friday at Lincoln Center in an effort to boost the profile of French mills in the United States. The collaboration was launched after approximately 250 meters of fabric was donated by French mills to the university, according to Leontieff-Hirshon. Leontieff-Hirshon said the appeal of partnering French textiles with American students is that U.S. designers are typically more open to new fabrics and new ideas. ""The American market knows what's good and what's selling; they're visionaries,"" she said. An emerging market stepping onto the catwalk: Asia. Concept Korea is a collaborative show organized by the Ministry of Culture, among other state agencies. On display: true Gangnam style. During Concept Korea's show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week last September, Korean designer Kathleen Kye showcased for the first time. That appearance later helped launch her collection at Opening Ceremony, a boutique synonymous with fashion ambassadorship, featuring designs from a different country each year. ""It is a must that we create a presence in New York in order to step into global market,"" said Sang-Pyo Hong, chief director at Korea Creative Content Agency. Leather Japan is yet another Asia-driven show sponsored by the country's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Eight Japanese brands will showcase Japanese leather products, hoping to highlight the designers' craftsmanship, said Kaoru Imajo, a spokesman for the event. While the country's economy is flagging, new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has recently advocated stimulating growth by increasing exports; a somewhat contentious strategy because it could correlate with a depreciation of Japan's currency. ""The Japanese yen is expensive now, so that is not good for exporting, but the brands are trying everything they can to make it better,"" said Imajo. Rounding out the globe, there's a Scandinavian showcase with designers SIPILÃ„, Viola Blu and Olav making their debut to the U.S. market. Also showing is EDUN, a label working to increase trade with Africa that was launched in 2005 by Ali Hewson and her husband, U2 frontman Bono. While it's common practice for government-run organizations to participate in international trade shows like COTERIE and PremiÃ¨re Vision, governments actively orchestrating Fashion Week events is a recent development. ""That's why everyone who actually wants to sell clothes flocks here vying for interest of the best buyers and best media,"" said Rabimov. ""It is a perfect mix to launch a new brand, revamp heavyweights or showcase any country's fashion industry potential.""

"(CNN) -- New York City parents who are raising questions about the city's plan to expand its pilot program of dispensing contraception, including the morning-after pill, to high school students are doing what parents should do. They're asking questions. If they seek information from credible sources, they will learn that when taken within five days of intercourse, the morning-after pill Plan B, which contains one of the hormones found in regular pills, is safe and effective. They also will learn that other forms of contraception have been available in many New York City public high schools for years. This new plan, open to all, is actually designed for girls who have been hardest to reach. These young women, from poor and working-poor families, are much more likely than others to get pregnant by accident. Then, one of two things happens: A girl gets an abortion, or she has a baby she cannot support. Neither New York City's school authorities, nor Mayor Michael Bloomberg, finds those options desirable; both are quite rightly supporting the expansion. According to Joanna Kuebler of the National Assembly on School-Based Health Care, about 40% of school-based health centers in the United States are allowed by their school districts to dispense contraception. Sixty percent of centers are prohibited from doing so. Requirements for parental consent vary. New York's effort to reduce teen pregnancies appears to be among the largest and most comprehensive. What hangs some people up is the school administration's decision, during the recent pilot phase of the project, to allow parents to opt their children out of it. Parents received letters in the mail describing the program and telling them that their child would be in the program unless a parent disallowed it in writing. Only 1% to 2% of parents denied permission. It's a good bet many parents didn't read the letters, or if they did, thought their daughter wasn't having sex, or weren't sure how they felt -- so they didn't do anything. New York schools' Plan B program draws critics, supporters . The school system took their silence as an endorsement and moved to expand the program. I think I probably would have done the same thing. But opponents said a fairer way of judging parents' attitudes would have been to require them to opt their children in if they wanted them in the program. They argued that that would require a student and parent to talk to each other about the student's sexual activity -- a good thing. Advocates for the city's plan offered a credible response. They said that many students and parents would avoid such a discussion. Absent parental approval, students who were already sexually active, or about to be, would be in the same boat as before: unable to easily acquire contraception after either consensual or nonconsensual sex. We live in one of the richest, most well-educated countries in the world, yet we have the highest teen birth rate of comparable countries. That is simply not right. Yes, parents are children's first teachers and moral guides, but they need assistance, which is what the New York City system is attempting to provide. No reliable scientific evidence shows that the availability of birth control encourages young people to start having sex earlier. And there is good evidence that the increased availability of birth control, as well as improved sex education, has lowered the teen pregnancy rate dramatically. According to data released this week by the National Center for Health Statistics, the teen birth rate in 2011 -- about one birth for every 32 girls -- is the lowest it has been since the 1940s, when the center began to track childbearing. A lower teen pregnancy rate means a lower abortion rate. Among the 7,000 girls ages 15 to17 who got pregnant last year in New York City, nine out of 10 pregnancies were unplanned, and almost two out of three resulted in abortions. For that reason alone, we should embrace New York's efforts to make all forms of contraception accessible, as well as affordable and safe. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Laura Sessions Stepp.","N.Y.C. expands program to dispense birth control in high schools with morning-after pill .

"(CNN)  -- Bagpipers sounded ""Amazing Grace"" on a snowy day at a Utah cemetery as military pallbearers marched to rest the casket of Pfc. Aaron Thomas Nemelka, one of 13 people gunned down last week in Ford Hood, Texas. A throng of mourners arrived for the funeral service at a Mormon church in West Jordan, and then solemnly witnessed the burial of the 19-year-old combat engineer set for deployment in Afghanistan. One of six of the Fort Hood victims laid to rest across the country on Saturday, Nemelka was buried at the Utah Veterans Memorial Park, south of Bluffdale. American flags flapped in the freezing wind and a soldier played ""Taps"" amid a graveside huddle of military comrades, veterans, family members and Patriot Guard Riders, the motorcycle group that honors slain troops. ""This one is a little bit hard to understand,"" said Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, who spoke to reporters after the church service. He said Nemelka's death is particularly hard to accept because of the circumstances. Authorities say Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, a U.S. Army psychiatrist, opened fire at a military processing center at Fort Hood on November 5, killing 13 people. Hasan, who was seriously wounded in the incident, was charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder -- charges that make him eligible for the death penalty. Nemelka graduated from high school in 2008 and enlisted the same year, and then was ready to deploy to Afghanistan in January. The youngest of four children, Nemelka loved his work as a combat engineer and was being trained to defuse bombs, according to a report in Salt Lake City's Deseret News posted on the Nemelka family Web page. He had been assigned to the 510th Engineer Company, 20th Engineer Battalion in Fort Hood. Aaron's uncle, Maj. Kevin Nemelka, read a statement on behalf of his nephew's parents to reporters Saturday. They thanked people who sent cards, flowers and provided food for them and expressed gratitude to their son's military comrades. ""During this moment, when grief and sorrow threaten to overwhelm us, we look to our faith, to our family and to our friends for comfort,"" the statement said. The statement also said the family drew strength from people who lost loved ones and passed along condolences to the relatives of the other victims. In their statement, they made a point to say they were honored to meet President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at the Tuesday memorial at Fort Hood. The couple was comforted by the couple's ""heartfelt and sincere expressions of sorrow, support and love."" ""Since that visit, it has been our fervent prayer the president would receive the best advice"" and the ""inspiration of heaven as he struggles with the problems of our nation, most especially as he wrestles with the difficult decisions on the future of the long and terrible war in Afghanistan and Iraq,"" the statement said. The five other victims for whom funerals were Saturday were: . Pfc. Michael Pearson . Pearson, 22, of Bolingbrook, Illinois, enlisted in the Army more than a year ago to realize his musical dream. He hoped the military would be his path to college, where he could study musical theory, his brother Kristopher Craig said. Pearson was scheduled to deploy to either Iraq or Afghanistan in January, his brother said. He was learning to deactivate bombs and training in the Mojave Desert, said his mother, Sheryll Pearson. She was looking forward to seeing her son at Christmas. He was assigned to the 510th Engineer Company, 20th Engineer Battalion in Fort Hood. Spc. Jason Dean Hunt . The 22-year-old from Tillman, Oklahoma, enlisted in the Army in 2006 and spent his 21st birthday in Iraq, his sister, Leila Willingham, said. He chose to re-enlist, dedicating the next six years to the military. Hunt was recently married and set for his second deployment to Iraq, his sister told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" He graduated high school in 2005 and tested his hand at a career in information technology, Willingham said. He was assigned to the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division in Ford Hood. Sgt. Amy Krueger . Krueger, 29, of Kiel, Wisconsin, was a high school athlete who joined the military after the September 11 attacks, Kiel High School Principal Dario Talerico told the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel. Krueger played for the high school basketball and softball teams and graduated in 1998, Talerico said. A high school friend who later shared an apartment with Krueger had fond memories of the sergeant. She was assigned to the 467th Medical Company, Madison, Wisconsin. Capt. John Gaffaney . Gaffaney, 54, of San Diego, California, was an Army reservist and been a psychiatric nurse by training. He worked for two decades in San Diego County, California, where he helped elderly victims of abuse and neglect. Ellen Schmeding, assistant deputy director of the county's Aging and Independence Services Department, told CNN affiliate KFMB that Gaffaney most recently served as a supervisor for the county's Adult Protective Services Department. Gaffaney was assigned to the 1908th Medical Company, Independence, Missouri. Staff Sgt. Justin DeCrow . DeCrow, 32, of Plymouth, Indiana, went to Fort Hood in September to prepare for his deployment to Iraq, which was scheduled for sometime between December and March. Daniel DeCrow, Justin DeCrow's father, told CNN affiliate WSBT in South Bend, Indiana, that his son joined the Army after finishing high school in Plymouth. DeCrow was assigned to the 16th Signal Company, 62nd Signal Battalion, 11th Signal Brigade, Fort Hood.","Pfc. Aaron Thomas Nemelka was buried Saturday in snowy West Jordan, Utah .

"(CNN) -- Comfortable. Minimalist. Safari. Mullets. These are just a few of the themes that have bubbled to the surface since New York Fashion Week ended Thursday and the roundups started pouring in. Like most of us living outside the bubble, I relied on fashion magazines, blogs, phlogs, Tumblrs and tweets to stay abreast of the action. Here's a sampling of what I've gleaned. Starting from the end of the week-long event, Racked brings us a video love letter via Vimeo of dancing models and Fashion Week attendees. It's a good point of entry into the asymmetric shapes, colors and silhouettes swirling around the various Fashion Week venues the past week. As for a roundup of roundups, British Elle breaks down the major style trends and designers to dominate the runways, from pastels and prints to modern grunge meets sportswear. Refinery29 tackles the same theme with more pretty images. Then there are the looks that are so bizarre they can't be replicated off the runways, perhaps with the exception of wet mullets. Otherwise, Fashionista has the rest of them in its list of runway trends you should not try at home. For a quick day-to-day look, go to New York magazine's ""Five Things"" series and catch up on the looks and the gossip encircling the shows. Rounding out the random top 10 lists: best nail art. For the sartorially minded male with a lot of time on his hands, Esquire has a 72-image slideshow of best pieces from the shows, as chosen by editors of its Style Blog. There's also an abbreviated list of stuff they're coveting now, like neon suits, wedges and varsity jackets. Speaking of men's style, we published this in-depth story on how sites like Park and Bond and CLAD are banking on the stereotype that men don't like to shop in stores to draw an audience for full-priced luxury brands. Oftentimes, the parade of attendees outside the shows are just as visually stimulating as the ones on the runway. Images from GQ's street style series and Citizen Couture's spotlight on fashion week could easily be mistaken for a fashion shoot, although it helps that everyone's so attractive. For a culinary twist on the action outside the shows, makeup artist Annamarie Tendler teamed up with comedian Aziz Ansari to document visits to their favorite restaurants on her Tumblr. Since it's fashion week, they dress for the occasion. No fashion week coverage would be complete without putting the spotlight on one of the most famous names in fashion. Marc Jacobs sat down with CNN's Alina Cho to talk about being the creative director of Louis Vuitton and the possibility of working for Christian Dior. For more on the mainstream tip, CNN looks at J. Crew as America's iconic fashion label and how it's making a comeback. That's it for now.

"(CNN) -- Fat Tuesday is rolling up fast, so we asked for your recommendations for New Orleans' very best dishes. ""Excess is the new moderation,"" one iReporter proclaimed. Debatable, but not a bad mantra for a trip to diner's paradise. If you're not hungry now, you will be. Oysters every which way . Tucked into a baguette, charbroiled, fried, smothered in butter and cheese, sprinkled with bacon or just slurped right out of the shell, oysters turn up in many a New Orleans memory. The charbroiled variety from Drago's made a big impression on Heather Ackerly, a South Louisiana transplant. ""The rich butter and garlic mixed with the fresh saltwater taste of the oyster is heaven. And before you know it -- the oysters are gone. But that wonderful butter and herb sauce remains, waiting for you to soak it up with the French bread."" Felix's Oyster Bar gets iReporter Lulis Leal's vote. ""Whether served ice cold on the half shell, chargrilled and sizzling in garlic butter or fried to golden perfection, Felix's oysters are some of the best you'll ever have,"" Leal said. Eatocracy: What NOT to do during Mardi Gras . There's nothing better than the standard oyster po' boy, ""dressed, lots of Crystal,"" said Judy Pfau Hull of Rochester, New York. She likes Domilise's, Tracey's, Franky & Johnny's and Central Grocery for sandwiches. ""The wonderful thing about New Orleans cuisine is it really doesn't matter if you have $100 to spend or $10, you can always get something truly special,"" she said. Local Ed Killeen goes just blocks from his home in Old Metairie to Zeke's for the ""most stupendously crisp and fresh oyster po' boys!"" A proper po' boy requires lightly toasted French bread, real butter, crisp lettuce and pickles, thin-sliced tomato and ""most of all, freshly fried oysters,"" Killeen wrote in his iReport. Mardi Gras beyond bare breasts . A sandwich known 'round the world . Po' boys aren't the only world-famous sandwiches to come out of the Crescent City. The Central Grocery on Decatur Street is widely touted as the source of the original muffuletta, a sandwich of layered Italian meats, cheeses and olive salad on a flat round loaf of muffuletta bread. The sandwich has been replicated and interpreted, but Leal calls the Central Grocery's sandwich ""definitive."" ""Yes, other restaurants now make fatter ones on artisan breads with more exotic cold cuts and fancier ingredients in the olive salad, but Central Market's muffuletta has a classic dignity that simply cannot be bettered,"" she said. Eatocracy: Lick-the-screen muffuletta . Steven Wolfe of Houston urges diners to order a whole sandwich to stave off regrets. ""No other sandwich is so perfectly designed for proportion, texture and combination of tastes."" He's a fan of really communing with the muffuletta, so he suggests taking it back to your hotel room, ""where you can have a private experience with the sandwich, away from the eyes of strangers,"" he wrote on iReport.com. Recline after you dine. ""By the time you're ready to walk around, cocktail hour should be creeping up on the Quarter. A cold Abita and a few oysters sounds lovely. Give in,"" Wolfe advised. Eatocracy: What we ate in New Orleans . More fruits of the sea . Kristen Hendrix had an unforgettable taste of her husband's crab cake pasta at Oceana Grill. ""It was so rich and creamy, just the right amount of seafood flavor to it,"" she said. ""We have tried to replicate it at home with no success so far,"" said Hendrix, who lives in Charleston, Illinois. The alligator sausage cheesecake appetizer at Jacques-Imo's received two iReporter endorsements. Richard Senger of The Woodlands, Texas, called it ""inexplicable."" Mariel Metzenthin of Overland Park, Kansas, went for it with this description: ""The look on everyone's face at the table was the same, 'Damn!' -- eyes wide, mouths full and forks going in for seconds. The texture was smoother than a quiche, yet not as rich as the traditional cheesecake and the alligator sausage gave the right amount of bite."" When he's in New Orleans, former Louisiana resident Anthony DiFatta always stops at Coop's Place for the cajun pasta, a spicy creamy dish featuring crawfish, oysters, shrimp, artichoke hearts, mushrooms and cajun Tasso ham. He calls this ""little dive"" of a restaurant the city's best-kept secret. For true home cooking, Marissa Turner recommends Val's Marina in Maurepas, Louisiana, about an hour's drive from the New Orleans airport. ""I make the drive to Val's Marina because it feels like having dinner at my momma's house. And that's saying something,"" said Turner, who lives in Prairieville, Louisiana. New Orleans: The food that got them through . A cloud of powdered sugar . What's not to love about fried things doused in powdered sugar? The famous Café du Monde, established in 1862, popped up several times among iReport contributors. Beignets, French-style square doughnuts, are the main attraction, but coffee mixed with chicory is a natural complement. ""Don't get me wrong, I love étouffée, gumbo, po' boys, muffuletta, but I gotta have my oysters and beignets,"" said Diana Nguyen, who lives in the Chicago suburbs. More sweet treats . For a more unusual, sucré salé treat, head to Green Goddess. ""The standout, not-to-be-missed creation I'm crazy about is the bacon sundae,"" said Lynn Chen of Los Angeles. She tucked into this concoction -- pecan praline ice cream drizzled with bacon caramel sauce, topped with Applewood bacon and whipped cream -- instead of cake on her 35th birthday. And of course bananas Foster, bread pudding and pralines are well-loved New Orleans standards. See the gallery above for recommendations on where to indulge in those. Breaking away from the local standards . When you've had more oysters, crawfish and beignets than you can bear, veer away from tradition and make new ones. The dining scene in New Orleans is always evolving with fresh twists on the classics and totally original dishes. ""Now really, about all you have to do is walk or drive down the street until you see an eatery. Go inside and 99.9% of the time you will be delighted!"" wrote former New Orleans resident Duane Putnam. Eatocracy: The great gumbo debate . Very fine eateries rub shoulders with casual favorites. Port of Call has earned hearty praise from Sharon Curole, who first encountered this hole-in-the-wall bar's tremendous burger with baked potato before her wedding in December 1995. ""Every year since, my husband Chris and I make sure we get down to New Orleans to enjoy it again."" ""Get it loaded or 'dressed,' as they say in NOLA,"" said Curole, who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire. Melinda Green Harvey of Lubbock, Texas, offered another rave for a well-loved sandwich: the Cuban. She found a very tasty version at Cochon Butcher, a hybrid sandwich shop, butcher and wine bar. ""I get it. People go to New Orleans for gumbo, or red beans, or beignets. But when you get tired of that and just want something simple and delicious, head to Cochon Butcher.""","Oysters every which way rank high with New Orleans visitors .
Standards such as Café du Monde's beignets are still favorites .
For an excellent burger, head to Port of Call, says one iReporter ."
"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- A proposed regulation in the Dominican Republic could stop illegal immigrants from studying in the nation's public schools. Immigration officials say requiring students to have valid identification documents is part of the nation's sovereign right. But immigrant advocates have criticized the move, which is likely to affect a large number of immigrants from neighboring Haiti. ""We recognize that there is a human drama, a social drama impacting the Dominican Republic in terms of migration that particularly affects the case of our Haitian neighbors. And obviously Dominican society needs to approach it responsibly,"" said Jose Ricardo Taveras, the Dominican Republic's general director of migration. After a 7.0-magnitude earthquake devastated Haiti in January 2010, more than 200,000 displaced Haitians crossed the border, according to the International Organization for Migration. Since then, many have returned to Haiti. But historic tensions between the neighboring nations remain. There are about 54,000 foreign children studying in the country's schools, nearly half of whom are undocumented, according to government estimates. Children born in the Dominican Republic to illegal immigrant parents are not Dominican citizens, according to the country's constitution. It was unclear when the proposed regulation, which was included in a draft plan presented to the Dominican Republic's president on Wednesday, would go into effect. The president will have the final say on whether -- and when -- to implement regulations presented by immigration officials. The proposed measures also would require residency permits for foreigners and impose fines on businesses that hire illegal immigrants. Dominican Republic Education Secretary Josefina Pimentel said foreign students still have access to public education, and that officials have been working to help immigrant students obtain the necessary documentation. But immigrant advocacy organizations have said the government should reconsider its approach. ""We need to design a migration policy that conforms with the rule of law and conforms with the focus on human rights, which is what we are proposing,"" said Roque Feliz, deputy director of Centro Bono, a Jesuit nonprofit. In a statement Wednesday, the organization criticized immigration officials. ""We are aware that modern states are sovereign and define their migration policies, but ... no law nor any regulation can infringe on rights guaranteed in the constitution,"" the statement said. Taveras has defended the new measures, saying authorities are not violating human rights or aiming to deprive children of education. ""To enroll a Dominican child in a school, it is necessary to present a birth certificate, so it is the same for foreigners. We are not trying to violate, but rather regulate,"" he told CNN affiliate Telesistema. Dominican authorities have historically shied away from enforcing immigration laws, he said, noting that the country's immigration problems have long been complex and controversial. In recent years, immigration from Haiti has remained high, he told Telesistema, because the international community has not done enough to help Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. The Dominican Republic was the first country to give aid to Haiti in the earthquake's aftermath, sending food, medicine and rescue crews. But historically, a much wider gap in relations has existed between Haiti and the Dominican Republic since colonial times. Dominicans recall how they were under Haitian rule for a period in the mid-1800s, and how they repeatedly fought Haitian aggressions. Today, Haitians provide cheap labor in the Dominican Republic, a trend that has caused resentment on both sides, not unlike the illegal immigration debate in the United States. The Dominican Republic gained its independence from Haiti in 1844, after Haiti occupied it. By the early 20th century, Haitians had become a source of cheap labor in the neighboring country. Racism and security concerns resulted in a massacre in 1937, when Dominican leader Rafael Trujillo ordered the execution of Haitians living near the border between the countries, resulting in the killing of 20,000 to 30,000 Haitians, historians say. Taveras told Telesistema it was time for his country to do more to enforce immigration laws. ""We have to push this,"" he said. CNN's Mariano Castillo and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Dominican officials say immigration regulations are the country's sovereign right .

"(CNN) -- More than one and a half years have passed since a boyish-looking 22-year-old Army private was arrested, suspected to be behind the biggest intelligence leak in U.S. history. Much has been written about him. Politicians, pundits, celebrities and protesters have had something to say. But the single voice that could tell the real story has never been heard. Bradley Manning, are you finally going to speak? Will you say anything when a military arraignment begins on Friday at an Army base in Maryland, the first step in the government's case that intends to figure out how hundreds of thousands of its classified Afghan, Iraq and diplomatic documents came to be published on WikiLeaks.org? Manning is facing 22 charges of violating military code, ranging from theft of records to aiding the enemy. The latter charge is likely, experts say, to land Manning in prison for life. But, if a general sees fit, the law allows that Manning could be eligible for the death penalty, a historic turn in a case that is already unprecedented. So what has this young soldier from small-town Oklahoma got to say for himself? Defense attorney David Coombs isn't saying whether his client will speak at the Article 32 hearing, held to determine whether there's enough evidence to merit a court-martial, which is expected to last a week. Manning has been held at Kansas' Fort Leavenworth prison and will be transported for the hearing to Fort George Meade, where, incidentally, the National Security Agency has its offices. Security for media will be intense; there are only 10 spots for reporters in the tiny courtroom, so most will be relegated to a media room with a single closed-circuit television showing the hearing. The military has said it will cut that feed whenever material it deems classified is discussed in the courtroom. An Army Reserve lieutenant colonel, Coombs has a reputation for cutthroat and creative military lawyering, his contemporaries tell CNN. He is also an active blogger. He's been posting about the Manning case, including his client's alleged mistreatment at Quantico, since taking the case in 2010. An attorney for the Bradley Manning Support Network says the group has paid about $150,000 in expenses toward Manning's defense, money raised mostly in small donated increments online. Earlier this month, Coombs hinted on his blog at how he might defend Manning. He filed in court record, and then blogged, a kind of witness wish list. Coombs said it described military personnel who, if he could call them, would testify that Manning behaved like an unhinged, potentially dangerous soldier on base in Iraq. Manning's superiors repeatedly missed chances to either remove him from his intelligence job or revoke his security clearance, the document said. Read the entire witness filing . A few days later, Coombs posted another filing protesting the military's apparent rejection of all but 10 of his requested witnesses. The military told CNN that it will not comment until Friday's hearing. ""If Coombs uses the defense -- the 'It's not my fault, they didn't stop me' -- that's not going to fly with a military jury. That's not even a defense,"" said Michael Waddington, a criminal defense attorney who has tried at least 150 Article 32 hearings and many court-martial trials. ""The problem is that (the defense) is not really addressing the charges themselves. You're not saying 'I didn't leak anything, you can't prove it,'"" explained Waddington, who served two tours as an Army defense lawyer and has worked as a special assistant United States attorney and as an Army chief of military justice. Psychological problems . Military juries typically don't respond well to defense strategies that try to evoke sympathy for a defendant based on his or her alleged psychological problems, he said. ""To them, psychological problems are, like, 'Who cares?' The military takes a lot of people who have psychological problems, (then) they turn away and act like they don't see it. It's common. It will not be a shock to a military panel -- the jury -- and they aren't going to be appalled by that."" Waddington said he's tried several cases in which his clients' mental instability was known by military co-workers and superiors, yet those in power did little or nothing before a crime occurred. Waddington pointed to the case of Maj. Nidal Hasan to illustrate his point. Hasan was an Army psychiatrist who will face a court-martial in March. Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding dozens in a shooting November 5, 2009, at Fort Hood, Texas. A Senate report earlier this year found that various federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies missed an opportunity to prevent the rampage, even though they had information that Hasan supported Islamic extremism, had communicated with a terrorism suspect, and acted in a way that waved red flags about his mental stability. The report mirrored a Pentagon review which said that Hasan continued to advance despite concerns from others around him. In early November, victims' families filed suit asking $750 million from the military for failing to prevent the bloodbath. In Manning's case, if the prevention argument won't work, Waddington says, neither will painting him as a whistle-blower. In the opinion of some observers, including Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, the documents published by WikiLeaks deserved to be brought to light and Manning was ""brave"" -- in Ellsberg's words -- to leak the information. Others who support Manning's actions contend that, at worst, war crimes and an effort by the U.S. and its allies to cover up atrocities were revealed by the leaks. That was the general thrust of The Guardian's coverage on the intelligence, which The Guardian independently examined. Numerous reports, including those in The New York Times, which also independently analyzed the documents, said that the WikiLeaks disclosures revealed widespread corruption in both wars, a gross waste of money and mistreatment of detainees. ""If you're going to appeal to a military jury, whistle-blower doesn't work,"" Waddington said. ""The thinking they have is that when you sign up for a certain job in military intelligence and you manage data that is secret, you have a duty to protect that information."" Overclassified, overcharged . Coombs may have better luck if the defense concentrates on four other arguments, the attorney suggests. First, Coombs should try to demonstrate that the documents Manning allegedly downloaded were not marked individually as classified, and therefore he could not be held accountable for knowingly taking secret intelligence. He might also want to present the argument, bandied in numerous media reports, that the information Manning had access to has been overclassified. In other words, it's not necessary that a cable about Saudi royals having wild parties be classified in the same way as a cable about Tehran's nuclear activity. The defense attorney should also drive home the idea that the government has gone overboard with its charges -- especially aiding the enemy -- without proving that any actual harm was caused by the leaks, Waddington said. ""This isn't a case of someone sneaking behind enemy lines and handing over passwords to the computer system or giving a key to the back entrance to the military base,"" said Waddington. ""This is someone who downloaded some information he shouldn't have, which has not been proven to have harmed anyone or national security."" Third, the defense can try to show that Manning won't get a fair trial due to comments President Barack Obama made last year at a fundraiser. Obama said that Manning broke the law. ""I have to abide by certain classified information,"" Obama said on a video posted on YouTube. ""If I was to release stuff, information that I'm not authorized to release, I'm breaking the law. ... We're a nation of laws. We don't individually make our own decisions about how the laws operate. ... He broke the law."" There isn't anyone who reports to the commander in chief who would want to go against that, said Waddington, so the case seems unfair from the start. A controversial witness . If Waddington were defending Manning, he said, his first priority would be to attack the credibility of Adrian Lamo, a California hacker who says Manning reached out to him in an Internet chat and confessed to downloading intelligence and giving it to WikiLeaks. Neither Manning nor his counsel has confirmed or denied that Manning was indeed the one writing the instant messages in the chat log. WikiLeaks and the news organizations that published stories based on the leaked material have never identified who gave it to them. Lamo told CNN.com last year, and reiterated in interviews throughout the past year, that he turned Manning in to the FBI because he believed that what Manning wrote to him could be used to harm national security. In an unrelated incident, Lamo was convicted in 2004 on one count of computer crimes after breaking into the New York Times, Microsoft and Lexis-Nexis computer systems and has reportedly breached Excite@Home's company network and broken into the internal networks of Yahoo! and MCI WorldCom. Lamo has repeatedly told CNN.com over the past year that his hacking is in his past and he had altruistic intentions when it came to turning in Manning. Lamo was on the list of witnesses Coombs wants to question at the Article 32 hearing. Reached via e-mail late Wednesday, Lamo responded to CNN.com's question about whether he would testify. Lamo wrote that he was in a ""pre-hearing meeting."" He e-mailed, ""I'll be in the area, but can't confirm that I'll testify."" ""I would put that guy on trial and make him lay out the evidence he has against Manning,"" said Waddington. ""He would be the weakest link, to me, in the government's case.""","Bradley Manning is believed to have leaked classified intelligence .

"(CNN) -- It still makes Fatoma Dia's eyes widen whenever the Hilton hotel cleaning worker sees a bar of barely used soap on a bathroom counter. ""This,"" she says, picking it up with a gloved hand and dropping it in a brown bucket, ""is valuable where I come from."" The 35-year-old grew up in a mountainous region of southern Sudan where soap can cost more than a day's wages. Because some in the region, could not wash, they got sick. Across the globe, 2.4 billion people do not have access to clean sanitation, according to the World Health Organization. An estimated 1.5 million children die every year because their immune systems are not mature enough to battle diarrheal and respiratory diseases spread in contaminated environments. Sicknesses related to contaminated water supplies and poor human hygiene tend to plague poorer regions in sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, East Asia and the Caribbean. Water-borne illnesses such as cholera can hit countries suddenly, particularly in the wake of a natural disaster where there is little infrastructure previously in place to handle sustainable cleanup and recovery. A recent example is Haiti. Hit by an earthquake in January 2010, many Haitians were forced to live in tent camps and use water that was contaminated. Incidents of cholera plagued the country, a problem that continues today. Politically vulnerable nations or countries in the grip of war are also breeding grounds for sickness caused by poor sanitation. Illness tends to spread quicker when people are forced into cramped and overcrowded refugee camps where there are few bathrooms or none at all. Dia, who says she was the victim of religious persecution in Sudan, came to the U.S. several years ago. Her immigration liaison connected her with a job cleaning hotel rooms. In her home country, she personally had access to soap. But coming from a place with little sanitation to a hotel that observed a spick-and-span ethos was strange. ""It may be hard for people here to understand because it is so easy to wash, everything is here for you, you don't ever think about it,"" she said. ""Keep in mind that what you do every day may be the biggest task of the day for someone else."" Each day she works, Dia takes a little extra time during her shift to retrieve all gently used bars of soap in each room. She and other cleaning staff at this Hilton typically collect several hundred pounds of soap each month. The nonprofit Global Soap Project, which works with more than 300 hotels across the country, relies on their hard work and many other volunteers to pick up those heavy hauls and deliver it to a reprocessing location near Atlanta, where the soap is stripped, cleaned, reprocessed and then tested to make sure there is no trace of bacteria left. The bars are then cut into smaller pieces and shipped to nations such as Haiti, Kenya, Swaziland and Uganda. The founder of the Global Soap Project, Derreck Kayongo, is a Ugandan war refugee and one of the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. ""I was shocked just to know how much (soap) at the end of the day was thrown away,"" Kayongo said. Each year, hundreds of millions of soap bars are discarded in North America alone. ""Are we really throwing away that much soap at the expense of other people who don't have anything? It just doesn't sound right."" Children are key . In recent years, international health organizations, including WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have had success facilitating better sanitation in needy regions and teaching people the importance of basic hand washing. Since July 2010, more than 40 countries and regions have started hand hygiene campaigns, according to the WHO. ""It seems so simple, soap and water. But imagine never being taught how to do that,"" said Dr. Eric Mintz, who leads the Global Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Epidemiology team at the CDC. ""Washing hands is an afterthought for us. But at some point in American history, in the early part of the century, we had to build and improve our water infrastructure."" Mintz has worked in the field of water-borne illnesses for 22 years, specializing in the treatment of cholera, dysentery and typhoid fever. He has been part of projects to build latrines in villages in Kenya and Haiti. He also participated in a campaign in Kenya where school teachers encouraged students to learn how to wash their hands by making it seem cool to join a hand washing club. The children were sent home with comic books that explained when and how to wash in the hope that the kids would teach their parents. ""Children are often much more receptive than their parents or other adults because they don't feel that we are outsiders judging them and telling them they're living wrong,"" Mintz said. ""The adults feel less threatened when their children, innocently in the home, pass along what they've learned. To change a community's habits, reach the children first."" Colorful messages on cleanliness . Mintz and other health care experts also stress the effectiveness of posting large, brightly colored posters in public places to advocate frequent hand washing. Many point to the recent success of Global Handwashing Day to primarily target children and schools in developing countries. The campaign has a bright, cheerful and easily recognized logo, and its website offers tools to use in classrooms and community centers. In Ghana, where children suffer as many as 35 episodes of diarrhea and respiratory infections a year, children celebrated Global Handwashing Day (October 15) by performing plays about washing with soap. Two talk radio shows made it their main topic of conversation. In Somalia, hand-washing facilities were installed in health-care clinics and schools, a huge step forward in a war-torn region that suffers from a shortage of clean water and overcrowding in displacement camps and settlements. Radio ads also encouraged good hygiene and dispelled myths about illnesses resulting from bad sanitation. One 9-year-old Somalian girl wrote in an essay that she thought getting diarrhea was a ""punishment from God"" until she heard otherwise on the radio. In Pakistan, a new animated character named Sabu helped teach children the importance of hand washing with soap. Watch a video of Sabu on YouTube . Haiti was a big focus of the campaign this year. More than 400,000 have been sickened from cholera since the disease emerged in October 2010. At a Port-au-Prince school that was rebuilt by UNICEF, children learned a catchy phrase: ""Good morning, water! Good morning, soap! Goodbye, microbes!"" They then sang a song about why it's important to wash before eating and after using the bathroom. They also practiced washing their hands, a habit the Global Soap Project hopes they'll keep after recently sending many bars of soap to the nation. Fatoma Dia thinks about her own 15-year-old daughter when she considers the children whose lives may be saved by her simple task of collecting soap every day. ""I know that there are little ones who care and need this,"" she said, dropping another bar into a bucket. ""I am proud to do this. To be so far away, but to know I reach my people in this way, this makes me happy.""","Millions of people in developing countries don't have access to soap or clean water .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Sunday reiterated his commitment to getting the U.S. Senate to approve the New START treaty with Russia by year's end, saying he felt ""reasonably good about our prospects"" for the goal. ""When we look upon how important Russian support has been"" on Iran sanctions and the Afghanistan supply route, Obama told reporters aboard Air Force One, ""my hope is that because this is a good treaty we should get it done."" Obama spoke as he was returning from a trip to Asia, where he met with Russian President Dmitri Medvedev in Japan. The president said the White House has had a ""series of conversations"" with Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona, Jon Kyl, also of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina about the nuclear arms treaty and that they ""say they want to see this done."" On Saturday, a senior Obama administration official said that ""negotiations are under way"" to spend as much as $4 billion more to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal as part of the effort to push through the treaty by year's end. The official's comments came after a meeting in Yokohama, Japan, between Obama and Medvedev while attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference. The two leaders discussed a host of issues, from Iran to Middle East. A swift resolution to the New START treaty issue regulating the two nations' nuclear arsenals, though, ranked high on their agenda. The treaty, signed by Obama and Medvedev in April, would cut each country's deployed nuclear warheads by approximately a third, limiting each side to a maximum of 1,550. Some Republicans have held up a vote, saying despite lengthy hearings in the last session, they have more questions about the agreement. If no action is taken, new Senate hearings would be required and that could set back ratification for as much as two years. While they didn't win a majority in the Senate, Republicans made major gains in November's election -- meaning they'll have more clout when the upcoming ""lame-duck session"" ends and a new Congress takes office in January. ""We have a full-court press under way right now with the key senators,"" said the senior administration official. ""The president has made it very clear ... that this is his highest priority in terms of foreign policy pieces of business to get done in the lame duck session."" Obama has already included $80 billion over 10 years for nuclear weapons modernization in his budget, a move that experts saw as a bid to pre-empt criticism that he is not doing enough to safeguard the United States' military and nuclear strength. But Sen. Kyl, who is leading the charge against voting on the treaty in the lame-duck session, and fellow Republicans have said they are not convinced the Obama administration is committed to modernizing the nations' nuclear arsenal or to developing and deploying a robust missile defense system. For the New START treaty to go into effect, it must be ratified both by the U.S. Senate and by the lower house of the Russian legislature, the Duma. The Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, John Kerry, said Wednesday he's ""very hopeful"" the Senate will vote in December. The uncertainty in Washington have held up action in Moscow as well. Reacting to the midterm election, the Duma's International Affairs Committee delayed consideration by the entire Duma. ""They don't want to be caught in a situation similar to the one they were in with START II, which they ratified but the United States did not,"" said Sharon Squassoni, director and senior fellow of the Proliferation Prevention Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In their talks Saturday, Obama discussed with Medvedev his ""legislative strategy"" to getting the New START treaty ratified, and the two also talked about the political dynamic in Russia, the senior administration official said. The two leaders also discussed the ""next steps"" as Russia tries to join the World Trade Organization, a move that will likely happen next year, according to the senior administration official. Even with New START still in limbo, Medvedev and Obama discussed negotiating a new Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, or CFE, treaty. The pact, which was signed by 30 nations, sets limits for weapons and armament systems from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains, the administration official said. CNN's Ed Henry contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama says key Republican Senators ""say they want to see this done""

"(CNN) -- Authorities posted tropical storm warnings for parts of the Bahamas and hurricane warnings for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic on Sunday, as Tropical Storm Irene picked up steam near the Caribbean islands. The center of Irene was moving past St. Croix, with maximum sustained winds of about 60 mph (95 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported. At 8 p.m. ET, the most recent update, the storm was centered about 10 miles (15 kilometers) northwest of St. Croix and about 90 miles (145 kilometers) east-southeast from Puerto Rico, moving west-northwest at 15 mph (24 kph), forecasters said. Tropical storm warnings covered the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, the northern coast of the Dominican Republic and Haiti. The storm was expected to pass near or over Puerto Rico overnight and be near hurricane strength Monday, forecasters said.  It's expected to move near or over the Dominican Republic on Monday, and forecasters expect it will weaken as it does. The hurricane center warned that Irene could dump heavy rain on the Dominican Republic and neighboring Haiti, where previous storms have caused deadly mudslides down deforested hillsides. The NHC said Haiti and the Dominican Republic could see up to 20 inches of rain in isolated areas, with six to 10 inches possible across the rest of Hispaniola. The Christian aid group World Vision is prepositioning supplies and mobilizing its staff to fan out across camps in Haiti Monday, to help residents prepare for Irene. ""We are concerned that vulnerable families still living in temporary camps won't treat this storm as a serious threat, after Tropical Storm Emily didn't hit Port-au-Prince as predicted,"" warned World Vision's Meg Sattler in Port-au-Prince. ""If flooding hits, people living in unsafe housing will be the worst affected. Heavy rain has the potential to worsen sanitation conditions in camps, which, with cholera still so prevalent in Haiti, is a major concern."" Meanwhile, the storm known as Harvey strengthened slightly after weakening to a tropical depression.  The system continued unleashing heavy rainfall over parts of Guatemala and eastern Mexico on Sunday. At 8 p.m. ET, Harvey was about 60 miles (95 kilometers) north-northeast of the Mexican coastal city of Coatzacoalcos, packing top winds of about 35 mph. The storm could dump another two to four inches of rain over southeastern Mexico, with some areas seeing as much as 10 inches, forecasters said. Harvey struck land Sunday on the coast of Belize as a tropical storm, with top winds near 60 mph. It is expected to dissipate over southern Mexico by early Monday.","Hurricane warnings are issued for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic .

"(CNN) -- A former personal assistant of Waffle House's CEO accused him of forcing her to ""perform sexual services,"" among other degrading acts, during her nine years of working for him, according to an Atlanta police report. Police blacked out the woman's name in the report, but gave a graphic account of her accusation, based on an interview that she gave Atlanta police on September 28. CNN obtained a copy of the police report Friday, as news of the allegations against Joseph Rogers Jr. spread around the media. Efforts Friday by CNN to reach Rogers, whose father co-founded the Georgia-based 24-hour-diner chain were not successful. Similarly, CNN was unable to reach the man believed to be his lawyer. Atlanta police did not elaborate on to what extent they've been able to verify the woman's claims, with Sgt. Gregory Lyon saying, ""I can tell you that this is an open and ongoing investigation."" His accuser told police that, starting in 2003, she had worked out of Rogers' house as his assistant handling personal and work-related items. Within months of her hiring, the woman said Rogers ""on numerous occasions (tried) to force himself upon (her), attempted to have her perform oral sex on him (and) attempted to have sex with (her),"" according to the police report. She refused, but in 2003 and subsequent years, ""Rogers required (his assistant) as a condition of her employment to masturbate him,"" the report said. The police describe other allegations of sexually inappropriate acts as well, including Rogers making the woman buy pornography, frequently appearing naked in front of her, and touching her body and breasts. The accuser ""was forced to endure the harassment and demeaning treatment by Rogers because she was a single mother and needed her job to support herself and her son,"" according to police. On June 29, after her son graduated high school and earned a scholarship to college, she put her resignation letter in Rogers' ""sock drawer in an effort to spare Rogers' wife from pain and humiliation,"" police said. It was not clear why the accuser took so long after she had left her job to contact police. No charges have been filed in the case. Since the opening of its first restaurant in the Atlanta suburb of Avondale in 1955, Waffle House has become a culinary staple of the South with more than 1,500 restaurants that are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer is ""excited"" by the return of Rafael Nadal to the ATP Tour, but could face his great Spanish rival in the quarterfinals as he defends his Masters 1000 Series title at Indian Wells. Nadal made his return from seven months out through injury in clay court tournaments in South America, but will be playing his first hard court event as he tests his troublesome knee. World No.2 Federer, who is seeking his first trophy of 2013, is delighted Nadal is returning to the big time in California. ""I only just saw him yesterday after my practice. I was really excited to see him again,"" the Swiss maestro told the official ATP Tour website. ""We hadn't had much contact. I think he wanted to get away from it all, which I really understand."" Nadal won the final tournament of his early season 'clay court swing' in Mexico at the weekend and Federer took note. ""I was really happy to see him doing so well in Acapulco. It's great to see him here playing on the hard courts. I'm hoping to catch up with him this week."" Nadal, a two-time former winner in Indian Wells, said he was in good shape for the challenge ahead. ""I feel very good. I've practiced two times here,"" he said. ""But seriously, I understand my situation after seven months. I think it's not the right moment to talk about the knee. I am here to try my best and that's what I'm going to try. We'll see how the knee responds on hard. ""The results on clay were positive, especially because the knee was feeling better and better every week, especially last week. Now I'm going to try here."" Both will have their work cut out to prevent World No.1 Novak Djokovic getting his hands on the trophy for the third time. The Serbian is on a 17-match unbeaten run, stretching back to November last year, winning the Australian Open and Dubai titles in 2013. He potentially faces No.3 Andy Murray in the semifinals. Djokovic beat the Scot in the final of the first grand slam of the season in Australia.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- Any attempt to pardon Mikhail Khodorkovsky -- once Russia's richest man, now its most famous inmate -- must follow standard procedure, including an admission of guilt, the nation's president said Sunday. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, is imprisoned in a work camp 4,000 miles from Moscow. ""Concerning the possibility of a pardon for someone, Khodorkovsky or anyone else, the procedure has to be carried out in accordance with our country's rules,"" President Dmitry Medvedev said in a transcript on his Web site. ""In other words, a person must appeal to the president, plead guilty to having committed a crime and seek the appropriate resolution."" The president dismissed talks of a pardon, saying, ""at this point, there is nothing to discuss."" Khodorkovsky once headed the Yukos oil company, once Russia's largest oil producer. He is serving a nine-year sentence for fraud and tax evasion. Medvedev described corruption as a ""very serious Russian disease"" and emphasized the need to fight it. ""To this end, we have enacted a number of measures, including new legislation on corruption and special arrangements relating to government officials, their disclosures, declarations of income and so on,"" he said. ""We are determined to continue this work, because we believe it is extremely important."" The former oil magnate is incarcerated in a work camp near the town of Krasnokamensk, 4,000 miles (6,500 kilometers) from his native Moscow. He has been imprisoned since his arrest in 2003. Khodorkovsky had expressed a desire to run for office at the time and funded opposition political parties. He said the trial was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take the company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s. The Kremlin denied any role in his downfall. Yukos, which has since been crushed by a $27.5 billion back-tax bill, has been the object of a lengthy campaign by prosecutors and tax authorities. The court also ordered Khodorkovsky and his partner to pay about $600 million in back taxes.","There will be no favoritism for Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russian leader says .

"(CNN) -- A 10-year-old Southern California boy is in a juvenile detention center after denying in court Thursday a charge that he murdered another child, authorities said. The mother of the alleged victim, Ryan Carter, said on HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" show that the suspect was her 12-year-old son's ""best friend."" Lisa Carter, a registered nurse, said that her son died after stepping in front of the 10-year-old as he was trying to stab another child. ""The things we taught him cost him his life,"" Carter said of her son. ""We taught him don't start a fight, don't run away from a fight (and) if you see a fight ... stop it."" The San Diego County Sheriff's Department received a call shortly after 1 p.m. Monday about the stabbing in Lakeside, which is about 20 miles northeast of San Diego. Despite efforts by sheriff's deputies, paramedics and hospital staff to save him, the boy was pronounced dead around 2:30 p.m. Monday, the sheriff's department said in a statement. The San Diego County District Attorney's Office filed murder and felony charges Wednesday against the 10-year-old suspect, said Steve Walker, a spokesman for that office. An attorney for the young suspect ""denied the charges"" during his arraignment Thursday morning, according to Walker. The boy -- whose name has not been made public, in accordance with the district attorney's policies regarding juvenile suspects -- is now being held in a juvenile detention center in the county, he added. Lisa Carter said that the boy who stabbed her son was actually targeting another child. ""Ryan took the knife for that boy,"" she said, describing her son as intelligent, caring and ""everything to me."" The victim's father, Glen Carter, called his son a ""good ... boy with Christian values."" Since he is a juvenile, the boy accused of killing Ryan Carter cannot be found guilty but can be convicted on a ""true finding of fact,"" explained Walker. In convicted, he would have to be released by the time he turns 25 years old, if not earlier, the district attorney's spokesman added. The boy's next court date -- for a ""readiness"" hearing to determine if all sides are prepared to move forward -- is scheduled for February 23.

"(CNN)  -- Hurricane Paloma continued to intensify Friday night as the Category 3 storm pounded Grand Cayman island with strong winds and heavy rain. As of 10 p.m. ET Friday, Paloma was moving northeast through the Cayman Islands. The National Hurricane Center said additional strengthening of the storm could occur through Saturday night as Paloma turned northeast and headed toward Cuba. A hurricane warning was in effect Friday throughout the Cayman islands, with residents being told that ""preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the center said. A hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected within 24 hours. Cuban officials also issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Sancti Spiritus, Ciego de Avila, Camaguey and Las Tunas, the Miami, Florida-based hurricane center said in an advisory. As of 10 p.m. ET, Paloma's winds were near 115 mph (185 kph) with higher gusts. Paloma is forecast to approach Cuba as a Category 2 storm after weakening late Saturday, according to the hurricane center.  Watch rainstorms beat the Cayman Islands » . Friday evening, the center of Paloma was about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Grand Cayman Island and about 275 miles (443 kilometers) southwest of Camaguey, Cuba. It was moving northeast at about 7 mph and was expected to pass near Grand Cayman Friday night and approach the coast of central Cuba late Saturday, the hurricane center said. The storm's projected path would steer it away from the U.S. mainland and into the Atlantic.  See where the hurricane could be headed » . J.B. Webb, a manager at a radio station on Grand Cayman, said Friday evening that some residents had gone to shelters and others were shutting themselves in downtown businesses rebuilt to withstand a Category 5 hurricane. He said the local government had advised people to be off the roads by 11 a.m. The storm is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches over the Caymans and central and eastern Cuba, with isolated maximum totals of 15 inches possible. Flash floods and mudslides are possible, forecasters said. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles from the center, and tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 120 miles, the hurricane center said. iReport.com: Are you in Paloma's path? Forecasters predicted storm-surge flooding of 5 to 7 feet above normal tide levels, accompanied by dangerous battering waves, near the center of Paloma in the Cayman Islands. Near where Paloma is expected to make landfall, along Cuba's southern coast, storm surge flooding of 8 to 12 feet is forecast, the hurricane center said. Cuban television was broadcasting advisories to viewers, telling them not to cross swollen rivers, to avoid fallen cables and to evacuate if told to do so by Civil Defense officials. In Las Tunas, students in boarding schools were sent home, because the schools will be used as shelters. Evacuations were under way in some coastal areas prone to flooding. Rice and cereal was being shipped to other parts of the country to keep it from spoiling, and no tourists were being allowed to enter many areas.

"(CNN) -- The death toll from flooding and landslides after torrential rains hit Haiti earlier this week climbed to 23 Wednesday, the country's civil protection department said. Floodwaters from the rains swept through homes, tent cities and medical facilities, a report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Dozens of camps were flooded, hundreds of families were affected and at least six people were reported missing after the rains, which began Monday evening and stretched into Tuesday morning, the report said. The rainfall has forced residents to evacuate from homes and tent cities, and created a fertile breeding ground for the bacteria that causes cholera. The Pan American Health Organization warned the situation in Port-au-Prince continues to deteriorate and most cholera treatment centers are working at ""full throttle."" Aid agencies are scrambling to respond to a resurgence of cholera triggered by the heavy rain. Cholera is caused by drinking tainted water. Its symptoms can range from mild or even nonexistent to profuse diarrhea and vomiting. It's not difficult to deal with the disease but if left untreated, death from dehydration can come within a matter of hours. ""The situation continues to deteriorate,"" Beat Rohr, director of CARE in Haiti, said Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams brushed aside Maria Sharapova in straight sets Sunday to claim the season-ending WTA Tour Championships in Istanbul. Williams has looked unbeatable from the moment she struck her first shot in anger at the Sinan Erdem Dome and so it proved again in the final as she triumphed 6-4 6-3. Sharapova, who beat World No.1 Victoria Azarenka in the semifinals, put up a brave fight, but was outgunned by the 31-year-old American. The Russian World No.2 did not force a single break point as Williams again served superbly and came under constant pressure on her own delivery. A single break was enough for Williams to take the first set, finished with a flurry of aces as she served at 5-4 and an early break put her ahead in the second. Sharapova, who won the French Open to highlight her 2012, bravely stayed in the contest by clinging on to her service, but at 3-5 down she cracked again. Crunching ground strokes set up two championship points, finished with an explosive forehand as Williams claimed the WTA Championships for the third time. Azarenka clinched the season-ending ranking by reaching the semifinals, but on current form Williams will return to the top of the rankings early in 2013. ""I made a little bit of a slow start to 2012,"" she told Eurosport after her Istanbul romp. ""There's always 2013 and I'm looking forward to it,"" she added ominously for the opponents at the elite end of the women's game. Since mid-summer she has claimed the Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles before coming out on top in the WTA Tour's finale, despite having not played since her Flushing Meadows triumph. With golds in the Olympic singles and doubles, with sister Venus, at the London Games, it has proved a glorious finish to the year. Meanwhile, Juan Martin del Potro shocked World No.1 and home favorite Roger Federer in the final of the ATP tournament in Basel. The Argentine did not drop his service throughout the three-set match to deny the Swiss maestro a sixth title at the hard court tournament. He emerged a 6-4 6-7 7-6 winner after two hours and 44 minutes to claim back to back titles after winning in Vienna the previous week. Federer, under pressure from Novak Djokovic for the top spot in the rankings, later withdrew from the Paris Masters this week where he is defending champion to rest up ahead of the ATP Tour Finals in London. ""I have some niggling stuff that I want to heal, I don't want to take a chance for London,"" he added. In 2011 Federer won in Basel, Paris and London in a superb end to the season. Top seed David Ferrer won the Valencia Open title with a 6-1 3-6 6-4 victory over Aleksandr Dolgopolov of the Ukraine.","Serena Williams claims WTA Championships in Istanbul .

"(CNN) -- Israel's security can only be assured when its neighbors believe that it is no longer oppressing the Palestinian people but instead living in peace and harmony with them. The de facto strategy of past and present Israeli governments of seeking security through domination and by pushing Palestinians out of their homes, or allowing right-wing religious fanatics to create settlements throughout the West Bank to ensure that no Palestinian state could have contiguous parts, has not and cannot work to provide safety for Israel. Israel's fate and its well-being are intrinsically linked to the well-being of the Palestinian people. It's time for the powerful to show generosity to the relatively powerless. So those in the U.S. and Israel who want Israel to be secure should welcome the Palestinian Authority's decision to seek observer status as a nonmember state in the United Nations. The authority has agreed to return to negotiations with Israel without conditions once that status has been granted. The goal is creation of a state living in peace with Israel in borders roughly approximating those of the before than 1967 war, with minor border changes mutually agreeable through negotiations. So who opposes this? Hamas, Israel and the U.S. Opinion: Palestinian move at U.N. won't solve anything . Why Hamas? Because Hamas' strategy is to keep their area so powerless that the Palestinian people will turn away from support for the secular and peace-oriented and nonviolence-committed Palestinian Authority. So the last thing Hamas wants is for the Palestinian Authority to win popular esteem by being seen as having ""delivered"" a real tangible accomplishment to the Palestinian people in the form of statehood. To the extent that even observer status is a step in that direction, powerful elements in Hamas want to undermine it. In fact, Hamas consistently tries to undermine the Palestinian Authority. That explains why it has been so unwilling in the past years to stop its war crimes against Israeli civilians by sending (thankfully, mostly inefficient) missiles toward Sderot and other parts of southern Israel. But even as they fall short of their targets, Hamas manages to create fear and trauma for millions of Israelis. Why Israel? Because the Likud-Beiteinu dominated government does not want a Palestinian state to emerge that would limit the ability of the Israeli settlers to expand their hold on much of the West Bank. So while they sometimes talk about a two-state solution, they have in mind a tiny state that would not be economically or politically viable. Its strategy: Insist that it cannot negotiate seriously with the Palestinian Authority on creation of a state because the authority cannot control Hamas. With that reasoning, they ask how can Israel be expected to work with the authority on terms for a peace treaty that would actually be viable? And then simultaneously, Israel strengthens Hamas in various predictable ways. Palestinian United Nations bid explained . Its first move in this direction was to pull out of Gaza militarily without negotiating for the Palestinian Authority to take over control there, de facto leaving Gaza in the hands of Hamas. If the pull-out had been done in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority, there would have been no missiles and hence no ""proof"" that giving up land to the Palestinians would only increase Israeli vulnerability. To keep any substantial Palestinian state from developing, the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has managed, in the latest Gaza war (whose cease-fire is for the moment holding) to strengthen Hamas. It allowed Hamas to show that it can fight back against Israeli assault in contrast to the Palestinian Authority who, Hamas points out, has gotten nothing in return for the past five years of complete non-violence and security cooperation with the Israeli Army (IDF). Netanyahu is not stupid, and this is an intended outcome. The shelling of Israeli sites killed five people. Israeli bombing killed 150 Palestinians. Yet the air raids and missiles aimed at Israel again stimulated the latent post-traumatic stress disorder among Israelis that leads so many to vote for right-wing parties against their own best interests out of fear of the Palestinian people, most of whom would like to live in peace with Israel. (Palestinians told me when I visited a few weeks ago that the ongoing trauma of the occupation is so present it can't become post-traumatic). Palestinians again take status case to U.N. As long as Hamas is seen as the main face of Palestinians, even centrist and left-wing Israelis will support militarism rather than peace compromises. Why the U.S.? The Obama administration gave a green light to Israel's attack on Gaza, refused to support calls for an immediate cease-fire and has now joined Israel in opposition to upping Palestinian status at the U.N. The most charitable explanation is the Obama team believes the Netanyahu government will never negotiate a reasonable deal with the Palestinians and so has turned its attention to trying to gaining leverage with Israel to stop it from dragging the U.S. into a war with Iran. And for that, it's willing to ditch the Palestinian Authority, even though it certainly knows that the authority might soon collapse unless it can deliver something real for its people. In my recent book, ""Embracing Israel/Palestine"" (North Atlantic Books, 2012), I show that Israel will be safe when it becomes famous not for its power but for its spirit of generosity and open-hearted caring for the Palestinian people. I've outlined how a Marshall Plan to eliminate poverty in Israel and the surrounding states would totally change the political dynamics and create the preconditions for lasting peace. A similar path would make the U.S. far more popular and far more powerful around the world. But this strategy of generosity will take a major paradigm shift in the consciousness of Americans and Israelis, and for the moment, that seems unlikely. But it's worth fighting for.

"(CNN) -- First, there was ""Flying While Muslim."" This expression summed up the extra challenges of being an American Muslim when flying on commercial airlines. This situation has become almost accepted as part of the American Muslim experience. In fact, I have even comically offered advice to people in my community on how to avoid extra problems when they fly: ""Dress white, make your flight. Dress brown, never leave town."" But now there is something new: ""Studying While Muslim."" And there is nothing funny about it. Documents obtained by The Associated Press reveal that for the past few years, the New York Police Department has been engaged in the weekly surveillance of American Muslim college groups at 16 schools across the Northeast, including New York University, Yale, Rutgers and the University of Pennsylvania. (The NYPD has neither commented on the number of years that this surveillance was conducted nor if it's still happening.) As part of this secret program, the NYPD generated weekly reports about the Muslim student groups at these schools. They even set up an undercover ""safe house"" near the campus of Rutgers University to spy on students. Ironically, that operation ended when the building superintendent became suspicious and called the police thinking the NYPD officers were part of a terrorist cell. The NYPD also sent an undercover officer on a whitewater rafting trip organized by Muslim students at the City College of New York. The NYPD report indicates the students prayed four times a day and talked a lot about the nature of Islam. No mention if Muslims were good at whitewater rafting. On a personal note, in the past years, I have performed standup comedy at shows organized by the Muslim student groups at many of the colleges that were under surveillance. Is my name now in the counter-terrorism files of the NYPD? So why did the NYPD spend our tax dollars to engage in the weekly undercover surveillance of students at 16 colleges? Did the NYPD have evidence that students at each of the schools were a threat to America? Had the FBI warned the NYPD to be on the lookout for terrorists disguised as college students? Did the NYPD's research reveal that al Qaeda operatives love to go whitewater rafting? Nope. It was simply because these students were Muslim. Apparently, to the NYPD, being Muslim equals probable cause. No one should be surprised by this new revelation concerning the NYPD. After all, in late 2011, the AP also discovered that the NYPD had been engaged in secret programs -- created with assistance from the CIA -- to monitor American Muslims living in New York City at the places where they eat, shop and worship. Let's be brutally honest: If the NYPD were engaged in this type of widespread spying on any other religious, ethnic or racial group, the criticism would be deafening. However, because the case involves Muslims, the silence is deafening. There is simply no public outcry and little media coverage. If specific evidence indicated that an American Muslim -- or a person of any faith, for that matter -- were engaged in criminal activity, the police should vigilantly investigate that person. American Muslims are not asking for special rights, just the same rights as all other Americans. Freedom of religion is not just the freedom to pray. It also is the freedom to avoid being harassed or being treated less than American simply because of your faith. That is a bedrock principle of our nation. Authorizing the weekly surveillance of American Muslim students solely predicated on the fact that they are Muslim is wrong. It is profiling at its worst. But the issue of NYPD profiling appears to go beyond Muslims. As the New York Civil Liberties Union recently reported, in 2011 the NYPD detained 684,330 New Yorkers for questioning. Of those stopped, 59% were black, 26% were Latino and 9% were white. To put this in perspective, whites comprise 44% of New York City residents, but they make up only 9% of those stopped by the NYPD. But blacks -- who comprise 25% of New Yorkers --- represent 59% of those stopped and questioned by the NYPD. It appears that the use of skin color, ethnicity and religion as the basis for investigations is standard NYPD policy. That is both unconstitutional and morally wrong. NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly needs to make it clear that illegal profiling has no place in his department. If he does not, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg needs to replace him with someone who will respect the rights of all New Yorkers regardless of their race, ethnicity or religion.

"(CNN) -- The key to President Barack Obama's triumphant performance in Monday night's debate was not his command of the facts, his well-crafted answers or his cutting comeback lines. It was one thing: the stone cold, laser-like stare Obama shot his opponent when Mitt Romney was answering questions. I call it ""Obama-stare"" -- but unlike Obamacare, this Obama plan may not be good for your health. For those, like me, who watch the other candidate closely when his opponent is answering a question, the contrast between Obama and Romney's reactions was like comparing Darth Vader with Honey Boo Boo. Romney's look vacillated between forced smiles to that of a person whose stomach was alarmingly churning and was worried he wouldn't make it to the bathroom in time. But Obama pinned Romney with the look -- Obama-stare. It's not a look we saw at the previous debates. (Of course, Obama didn't even attend the first one.) Opinion: Obama in command; Romney plays it safe . Obama-stare resembles the grimace that Wyatt Earp might have had on his face moments before guns were drawn at the famed gunfight at the OK Corral. Or even Clint Eastwood's classic scowl in his ""Dirty Harry"" movies just before shooting a bad guy -- not to be confused with the look he recently gave to an empty chair. The Obama-stare is more than just a laser-like game face -- apparently it causes people to agree with him on issue after issue. Obama-stare is more akin to Obi-Wan Kenobi's use of the Jedi mind trick, or vampires on ""True Blood"" glamouring someone into saying exactly what they want to hear. Romney agreed with Obama so often I thought Mitt was going to endorse him. How else can anyone explain why Romney -- who is highly critical of Obama's foreign policy when he is out on the campaign trail -- would agree with the president on issue after issue when placed in the same room? Romney appeared as if he wasn't vying for commander in chief as much as for ""agree-er in chief."" For starters, Romney praised Obama regarding Osama bin Laden: ""I congratulate him on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al Qaeda."" Romney then agreed with Obama's policy regarding Egypt during the Arab Spring: ""I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his -- his action there."" Opinion: Romney endorses Obama's national security policies . Romney continued his ""I agree with Obama"" tour with regard to Israel: ""I want to underscore the same point the president made, which is that if I'm president of the United States ... we will stand with Israel."" And on the Obama administration's use of drones, Romney agreed some more: ""I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology. ..."" Romney also concurred with the president on employing a host of tough sanctions against Iran. (But I wish he would've said he would impose ""a binder full of sanctions."") And Romney agreed with Obama that at this time, he would not call for the deployment of U.S. military personnel into Syria to stop the bloody conflict there. True, there were some disagreements. But those were mostly in the area of domestic policy, which oddly dominated the middle portion of the foreign policy debate. Thankfully, moderator Bob Schieffer finally regained control and returned the candidates to foreign policy. I can only assume someone texted Schieffer the words ""Jim Lehrer."" I'm sure there will be those who fault Romney for agreeing so often with Obama instead of articulating a stark contrast on foreign policy. But it was truly refreshing to see a Democrat and Republican actually agreeing on issues. Opinion: Was Obama too relentless with Romney? Now, if the president can just figure out how to use Obama-stare on the entire Congress, maybe then we would see Congress get something done.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama signed legislation providing an additional $7.5 billion in assistance to the Pakistani government. President Obama signs the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 in the Oval Office on Thursday. The aid guarantee comes as the Pakistani government combats a wave of attacks believed to have been orchestrated by Taliban militants and as the Obama administration works on a comprehensive review of U.S. strategy in both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. ""This law is the tangible manifestation of broad support for Pakistan in the U.S.,"" the White House said in a statement on Thursday. The act bolsters a partnership ""based on a shared commitment to improving the living conditions of the people of Pakistan through sustainable economic development, strengthening democracy and the rule of law, and combating the extremism that threatens Pakistan and the United States,"" it said. On Wednesday, the heads of foreign relations panels in the House of Representatives and Senate provided a written explanation of the aid bill, a response to Pakistani complaints that the United States was meddling in its affairs. Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi joined Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Rep. Howard Berman, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as the U.S. lawmakers spoke to reporters. Qureshi rushed back to Washington this week to report on opposition inside the Pakistani Parliament to the five-year package of nonmilitary aid. Some Pakistani politicians said the aid bill was a U.S. attempt to micromanage Pakistan's civilian and military affairs. ""Everyone is on the same page,"" Kerry said. ""We are all clear about the intentions of the legislation."" Kerry argued the bill ""demonstrates the American people have a long-term commitment to the people of Pakistan."" Qureshi replied, ""This document, which I think is an historic document, is a step forward in our relationship."" Kerry said the explanatory statement attached to the bill emphasizes that no interference is intended with Pakistan's civilian or military operations. The statement said the bill establishes a variety of requirements meant to ensure U.S. efficiency and compliance but places no new conditions on the Pakistani government. ""The many requirements of this report are intended as a way for Congress to assess how effectively U.S. funds are being spent, shortfalls in U.S. resources that hinder the use of such funds and steps the government of Pakistan has taken to advance our mutual interests in countering extremism and nuclear proliferation and strengthening democratic institutions,"" the statement said. ""There is no intent to [establish], and nothing in this act in any way suggests that there should be, any U.S. role in micromanaging internal Pakistani affairs, including the promotion of Pakistani military officers or the internal operations of the Pakistani military."" Berman said the statement is ""a reflection of our desire to be long-term partners with the Pakistan people."" Relations between the two governments, however, are being tested by new violence in Pakistan. On Thursday, militants launched a string of attacks that killed at least 30 Pakistani police officers and civilians, Pakistani authorities said. At least 10 attackers also died, while others were missing.  Watch a rundown of the day's violence » . Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the Pakistani Taliban accepted blame for three attacks Thursday against two police training centers and the country's Federal Investigation Agency in Lahore. About a half hour after the trio of attacks, a suicide car bomber hit a police station in the Kohat district of northwestern Pakistan, killing at least 11 people -- eight civilians and three police, said Kohat Police Chief Dilawar Bangish. A dozen people were wounded. In a fifth attack, in Peshawar, a remote control bomb exploded inside a car parked in front of an apartment building.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Ousted Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov presided over a ""pyramid"" of corruption in the Russian capital that the Kremlin tolerated for political advantage, according to a document released by the website WikiLeaks on Wednesday. Despite an anti-corruption campaign launched by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, ""the extent of corruption in Moscow remains pervasive with Mayor Luzhkov at the top of the pyramid,"" according to a February cable from the U.S. Embassy there. ""Luzhkov oversees a system in which it appears that almost everyone at every level is involved in some form of corruption or criminal behavior."" But for Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, Luzhkov remained ""a trusted deliverer of votes and influence"" for their ruling party, United Russia. ""Putin and Medvedev's dilemma is deciding when Luzhkov becomes a bigger liability than asset,"" the cable states. Luzhkov apparently reached that point in September, when Medvedev abruptly fired the 74-year-old Moscow mayor. His dismissal came after criticism in Russia's state media that he had gone on vacation during a wave of forest fires that blanketed the capital in thick smog -- and after reports that he channeled funds and lucrative deals to his property-developer wife, now Russia's richest woman. Luzhkov denied the allegations after his dismissal and told CNN that he was fired to enable the Kremlin to tighten its grip on power. He won a libel suit against an opposition leader who leveled allegations of corruption against the mayor, though the U.S. Embassy cable notes the judgment was issued on technical grounds. The U.S. document, dated more than seven months before Luzhkov's dismissal, described a three-tiered ""kleptocracy."" ""Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term from the criminal/mafia world literally meaning 'roof' or protection) that runs through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as throughout the Moscow city government bureaucracy,"" the document states. It added, ""Luzhkov is at the top."" ""Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) since they not only have more guns, resources, and power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law,"" the cable continued. ""For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer so high in demand. Police and MVD collect money from small businesses while the FSB collects from big businesses."" In addition, according to one source quoted in the document, Luzhkov and other regional leaders were kicking payments up to the Kremlin. ""The governors collect money based on bribes, almost resembling a tax system, throughout their regions,"" the cable quotes that source, whose name was redacted.","A U.S. Embassy document describes Moscow as a ""kleptocracy""

There appears to be no end to the mass mourning for this snack cake so closely associated with our childhoods. It was as if the loss of Twinkies was somehow going to erase our fondest childhood memories. But here's my question: Where were you when Hostess needed you? Such as any day before they announced its closing. Before Friday, you could have easily bought Twinkies, Ding Dongs, Yodels, Sno Balls, Suzy Q's or any other Hostess treat. But you weren't there for them then. The company's sales dropped, and with rising costs, Hostess had to file for bankruptcy. Not once, but twice: In 2004 and again in 2012. Hostess has lost $250 million over the last three years and is saddled with more than $850 million in debt. Nope, you weren't there for them then. And neither was I. Why? Because millions of us began to realize that junk food was not good for us. So in a desperate effort to live forever -- or at least a little longer -- many of us began to cut Twinkies, and foods like it, out of our diets. True, Twinkies offered a tasty treat, but it also offered other things, such as 300 calories per package of two, nine grams of fat and 37 other ingredients ranging from high fructose corn syrup to chemicals that I never heard of. And then there's the even more insidious Ding Dong -- they're even higher in fat and calories than Twinkies at 368 calories a serving and a whopping 19.4 grams of fat, which represents 30% of the total fat nutritionists recommend we consume in a day. The upside to these chemicals is that Twinkies never seem to grow old -- they're the Dorian Gray of snack foods. They can likely be bequeathed to your grandkids and look the same as the day you bought them. But before anyone becomes truly depressed over Twinkies' fate, keep in mind that Twinkies will never really disappear -- and not just because of preservatives. On Monday, Hostess Brands Inc. announced it will enter into mediation with the striking Baker's Union, which offers a little hope that the company might be saved. And there is always a chance that another company will buy the rights to produce Twinkies if Hostess does indeed close.But even if you are never be able to consume a Twinkie again, Twinkies will live forever in pop culture. Twinkies have appeared in movies for years from ""Ghostbusters"" to animated films such as ""WALL-E"" to ""Zoombieland,"" where Woody Harrelson's character searched, prophetically, for the last box of Twinkies. iReport: Is this my last Twinkie ever? While you may not be able to consume them, Twinkies will live forever in pop culture. Twinkies have appeared in movies for years from ""Ghostbusters"" to animated films such as ""WALL-E"" to ""Zoombieland,"" where Woody Harrelson's character searched, prophetically, for the last box of Twinkies. Twinkies will even live in the annals of criminal justice, thanks to the famed ""Twinkie defense."" Dan White shot and killed San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor and gay activist Harvey Milk in 1978. At White's trial, his attorneys argued that his diet of sugary snack foods, such as Twinkies, had damaged his mental capacity. White was found not guilty of murder, but of the lesser charge of manslaughter. So Twinkies are immortal. But there is one real loss in the closing of Hostess that should evoke sympathy. It's not the possible end of Hostess' Ho Hos or even its oh-so-soft and white Wonder Bread. It's the 18,500 Hostess employees who are out of work. It's obviously never good to have your job end with no warning -- it's even worse when that happens in a challenging economy such as ours and right before the holiday season. But as we close the book on Twinkies, we can all take some solace in the fact that they had a great 82-year run. It makes me think of the words of Shakespeare: ""Parting is such sweet sorrow."" Although on a calorie-by-calorie basis, I think Twinkies might actually be sweeter.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Japan and Australia are exchanging harsh words and threats of legal action in a dispute over a whaling incident near Antarctica. Environment Minister Tony Burke is threatening to take Japan to international court, claiming a Japanese whaling fleet attacked Australian ships on Wednesday. But in the Japanese version of what happened, it's the Australians who deserve court sanctions. ""Japan needs to stop this once and for all,"" Burke told Australia's Seven Network on Thursday. ""What we are watching and what we've been seeing Japan do in that Southern Ocean year on year now is just disgusting. No other way of describing it. Now, as a government we don't settle it in the car park, we settle in the court,"" he said. ""There's been the most outrageous attack on the Sea Shepherd Australia ships,"" said Bob Brown, a member of the board of directors of Sea Shepherd Australia, describing it as the ""worst incident"" the anti-whaling group had experienced since one of its vessels sank two years ago. In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Brown said that a large Japanese factory ship, the Nisshin Maru, had repeatedly rammed Sea Shepherd ships in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica where it was trying to refuel and that a Japanese government escort vessel had directed water cannon and lobbed concussion grenades at the activists. He claimed the Japanese ships had intruded into Australian territorial waters and breached international and Australian law. ""I'm very concerned and alarmed that Japan has decided to become pirates in our territorial waters,"" he said. ""It's time the Australian government acted."" Burke told Seven Network it's not that simple. ""In terms of sending in the Navy, you've got to make sure you don't have a response here that blows up a whole lot of other things. The reason -- even though they're our territorial waters -- we don't assert that. And that's part of the whole Antarctic Treaty System, which prevents mining in Antarctica. You don't want to blow up that system,"" he explained. ""I've got to say with that court case we are now getting very close. It has been too long. We are now getting very close on that. But I'm not going to take an action that blows up the Antarctic Treaty System either,"" Burke said. ""What we will do, though, is take the action that we've taken already with the International Court of Justice to [expose] that this gimmick that they've got -- claiming that's its scientific whaling, when everybody knows that's a con."" Japan annually hunts whales despite a worldwide moratorium, utilizing a loophole in the law that allows for killing the mammals for scientific research. Whale meat is commonly available for consumption in Japan. Each year, environmental groups such as Sea Shepherd face off with Japan's hunters in a high seas drama that has led to collisions of ships, the detaining of activists and smoke bombs fired back and forth between the groups. The Japan Fisheries Agency's Institute of Cetacean Research disputed the Australian claims in a statement. The ICR says three Sea Shepherd ships sailed recklessly and abnormally close to the Nisshin Maru and its fueling ship during a refueling operation on Wednesday. Although the Nisshin Maru tried to ward off the Australian ships with loud speakers and water cannons, the Sea Shepherd ships' ""extreme dangerous"" acts halted the refueling operation, the ICR said. During the process, the three Australian ships bumped the Nisshin Maru at least four times, causing some damage, the ICR said. The Japanese agency said it's considering filing a third claim in a U.S. court for Sea Shepherd's ""insults against the court authority."" According to ICR, Sea Shepherd has been banned from threatening whaling ships' operations or sailing within 500 yards of whaling ships. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki in Tokyo contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- Millions of hectares of land have been acquired in the past few years across Africa by investors who are moving into large-scale agriculture to take advantage of potential windfall gains. Popularly these deals have become known as ""land grabbing,"" but they could just as well have been framed as ""water grabs."" The current global rush for agricultural land grew partly in response to increased global food prices since 2007. Global capital is finding its way to agricultural investments on the basis of expectations of high returns, either through increased production or through speculation on further rising land prices. Optimistic promises that such investment would also reinvigorate depressed rural economies, by virtue of employment creation and improved livelihoods, have proven to be vastly overstated, if not unfounded in many cases. But one of the untold stories of the global land grab is the quest to capture one of the most vital resources: water. As land is grabbed and earmarked for development, this often has implications for the water nearby, for local people's land and water rights and environmental sustainability. All around the world powerful actors (transnational as well as national) are pointing out that the lands in which they invest are ""marginal"" and ""unproductive"" lands. This has been shown to be untrue for many cases; either the land is already used by small-scale food producers, or is of prime quality and associated with good (potential) access to water. Read this: The myth of Africa's land grab . In the Tana Delta for example, the Kenyan government marked the Tana river basin for development, designating the floodplain area as ""unused"" and the adjacent terraces as ""empty dryland"" with irrigation potential. But this region has long been home to small peasant farmers, fishers and pastoralists from different ethnic groups, whose cooperative sharing of fragile land and water resources over the years has been possible because of delicately balanced customary use rights agreements amongst themselves. The violence last year in the Kenya's Tana region demonstrates the perils -- and tragedy -- of ignoring more complex social realities that exist on the ground. In most countries where land deals are taking place it is no use having land without also having access to water. Research published in a special issue of Water Alternatives has shown water to be one of the prime drivers of the global rush to acquire land. Despite this, many land deal contracts -- or the prior environmental assessments upon which they ought to be based -- do not explicitly mention water requirements, let alone quantify them. The issue of water grabs is a particularly slippery one. Unlike land, water flows and moves from one place to another; its availability goes up and down, affected by the seasons, human use, or climate change; it can be visible on the surface and invisible underground. It can be a source of food, or disease and pollution. Rights, access and uses are complex and varied. Who has the right to the water in a river -- the people who live beside it in a given place, the farmers who depend on it for irrigation, or those upstream or downstream? Read this: One woman's mission to fix water crisis . Water's elusive nature makes it a prime target. The boundaries between legality and illegality are often fuzzy, and questions of jurisdiction over water can be unclear. Grabbers often take advantage of this legal complexity. In Ghana, according to research by the International Water Management Institute, the separation of land and water rights created the space for water grabbing: pre-existing customary water rights were abolished and instead ownership, management and control of water were placed under authority of the state. Similarly, water-quality impacts reach far beyond the place of pollution. A case in point is a large-scale land deal in the Iringa Region of Tanzania under a lease-agreement with the government. According to a paper published by Italian NGO Acra, fertilizers, pesticides and faeces of cattle led to the contamination of downstream drinking water sources serving a population of some 45,000 people. Proponents of large-scale land deals deploy powerful narratives of underutilized land and water resources that ""require"" investment to ""unlock"" their potential, or an abundance of water and land, ready to be woken up by commercial agriculture. But it is at least debatable if the targeted land and water resources are indeed unused or even underutilized. The narratives of ""unexploited resources"" provide justification for governments to displace existing users of resources and the ways in which smallholder farmers use their water remain unrecognized some can create new scarcities for others. The hidden aspects of water grabbing do not just make it a very ""slippery"" terrain, but also imply that large-scale land acquisitions all around Africa actually can be understood as ""water grabbing."" That we call this a process of grabbing does not mean that these deals are strictly illegal, but there are serious underlying social justice questions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jennifer C Franco, Lyla Mehta and Gert Jan Veldwisch.","Large-scale land deals in Africa can be seen as ""water grabs, write three researchers .

"(CNN) -- In a dusty corner of southern Chad's Moula refugee camp, the pounding beat of a skin drum drives a group of young men through a cluster of brick-made huts and into a makeshift soccer field. They're summoned here, however, not to kick a football but to engage in an uplifting activity that can help them forget the tough conditions they live in: dancing . Organized by Chadian dancer and choreographer Taïgue Ahmed, these dance workshops are helping scores of displaced people to regain their self-confidence, while having fun and and finding a way of expressing themselves. ""The first time that I was at the refugee camps, the people were all quiet and in their tents. And now with the dance project, everyone came out, I think it has also changed their outlook,"" says Ahmed, an acclaimed dancer in his own right who has graced stages across Africa and internationally. Landlocked in north central Africa, the Republic of Chad is one of the poorest countries in the world. Along with poverty and drought in the Sahara desert, hundreds of thousands of people have been uprooted, due to violence, corruption and civil war. Chad's migrant workers pay price for Libya conflict . In 2005, Ahmed, who began dancing at the age of 13, created the dance company ""Ndam Se Na,"" which means ""dance together"" in Ngambaye, a local language in southern Chad. He initially launched a project where he used dance sessions as an educational tool to help children abstain from violent activities while at school. The success of the sessions prompted him to take his dance workshops to refugee camps along the border with the Central African Republic, introducing the joy of dance to its traumatized residents. ""The idea came to me after reading articles about refugees in Darfur,"" he says. ""The children were exposed to war -- seeing weapons, nothing but war, the kids are traumatized. And the idea I had was, why can't I adapt this dance workshop for the refugee camps, to give the children an outlet, a way to have fun and to have a life."" According to the United Nations, Chad has been affected by a humanitarian crisis since 2001. Statistics reveal an alarming picture as the country had more than 300,000 refugees in 2010, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. S. Africa's first black dean teaches 'reconciliation over revenge' In 2006 Ahmed reached out to the UN refugee agency for help with his dance workshops in the camps. He was then told to launch a pilot project in Gore, an area with two large refugee camps sheltering thousands of people. ""I was asked to test the project and that there weren't any resources for it but that I had to go try and see how it could work. So when my pilot project launched, the refugees were curious, they wanted to know what I was planning on teaching them,"" says Ahmed. The project was a quick success: in the Gondje refugee camp 181 people of all ages signed up to Ahmed's dance workshops, followed by 76 refugees at the Ambucu camp. After the sessions ended, the refugees demanded Ahmed's return to the camp to continue teaching them how to dance. ""I see there is hope because this dance that I am doing will help me earn an income,"" says 19-year-old refugee Bienvenue Ndubabe who has lived in a refugee camp for the past four years. ""It will enable me to carry on with my studies,"" adds Ndubabe, who attends school in the local village and has every intention of furthering his studies next year. Last October, Ahmed also teamed up with friend and colleague Jean Michel Champault -- director of the African Artists for Development foundation -- to start a project together called ""Refugees on the Move."" The goal is to create a chain reaction and extend Ahmed's dance workshops to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. ""Through dance we are trying to bring hope to troubled youths and try to reduce violence and bring a sense of social interactions,"" says Champault. Somali rapper K'naan makes songs in the key of love . Inside the camp, Ahmed's dance lessons are life lessons, teaching people of all ages important skills as well as encouraging hygiene and education. Ahmed also doesn't shy away from sensitive issues, raising awareness on HIV/AIDS, women's rights, hygiene and education. ""What makes me the proudest is to see them smile, dance and laugh,"" says Ahmed. ""When I dance I see others who laugh and from time to time I laugh! I'm only interested in this."" Ahmed has succeeded in giving the refugees that they need as much as food and shelter -- their sense of humanity and belonging. ""I've always said that for me, dance is something magical, that doesn't have barriers. We can find ourselves in an open space like this one and dance together -- it's joy, sometimes people meet up and become partners forever.""

"(CNN) -- From the ""Twilight"" trilogy to the tearjerkers adapted from Nicholas Sparks novels to nearly every film where Matthew McConaughey takes off his shirt, let's face it: Most cinematic love stories are made for women. So it may seem strange to release the new ""Die Hard"" installment, ""A Good Day to Die Hard,"" on Valentine's Day. But for our money, it makes perfect sense. Where ""The Notebook"" is the gold standard for women, the original ""Die Hard"" is the ultimate romantic movie for men. Sound crazy? Stick with me. The 1988 original stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, a sarcastic New York cop visiting his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and his two children in California. When he arrives at Holly's office Christmas party, the tension in their relationship is immediately evident. Holly is using her maiden name again and John doesn't even plan to stay with his family while he's in town. There's no doubt that John loves his wife and wants to rekindle the romance, but he can't seem to admit it. But while John proves incapable of communicating his feelings to his wife verbally, an opportunity arises allowing him to prove his devotion to her. Review: Willis goes through the motions in 'A Good Day to Die Hard' Midway through the party, a team of terrorists led by the stylish Hans Gruber (a scene-stealing Alan Rickman) interrupts the event and holds most of the attendees hostage. The quick-thinking John eludes their grasp and eventually begins taking down the bad guys one by one in order to rescue his captured wife. The story's subtext recognizes the stereotypical, but undeniable fact that many men aren't romantic or open with their emotions. Despite what many rom-coms and dramas suggest, a lot of guys don't picture themselves courting a woman by blasting a boombox outside a bedroom window, as is done in ""Say Anything."" (In fact, that's probably illegal in most states.) And forget ""Titanic."" Guys don't want to get the girl of their dreams by freezing in the ocean while keeping the one they love afloat on a piece of driftwood. (That plan doesn't actually work long-term, either.) Men often imagine winning a girl's affection by proving their worth in a battle against someone or something that threatens their loved one's life. While many women want the men in their lives to be sensitive like Ryan Gosling's ""Notebook"" character Noah, guys aspire to be like the renegade John McClane in ""Die Hard."" John offers a brand of masculinity and strength that men can look up to (akin to what John Wayne and Clint Eastwood once offered moviegoers). John doesn't back down and he never gives up. The cold and calculating Hans may mock John for his cowboy mentality, his freewheeling spirit and his assumed affection for masculine film actors of the past (like Wayne). But John doesn't care what Hans thinks. John just keeps killing bad guys. While separated from his wife, John shows his love for her by killing terrorists and trying to protect her. Compare that to Gosling's Noah: When he's separated from the girl he loves, he writes love letters. How does John send messages in ""Die Hard""? He writes notes on the sweatshirts of dead terrorists, and in one scene even throws a dead terrorist out a window to send a message to a passing police officer. That's how he communicates. The climactic scenes at the end of ""Die Hard"" prove why it's a perfect Valentine's Day flick for guys. There is no declaration of love between John and his wife. There is no grand romantic gesture that shows how much he cares for her. As the story concludes, John McClane â€” who has been shot, brutalized and cut by hundreds of pieces of glass â€” has proven his love for his wife by killing all the terrorists who threatened her. And with that, he gets the girl and they make out in the back seat of a limo. Now that's love.","Writer argues that ""Die Hard"" is kind of romantic .

"(CNN) -- A substitute preschool teacher suspected of molesting up to 50 children has been arrested in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, the international police organization Interpol said. Dutch prosecution officials have said the 27-year-old man, known as ""Robert M,"" confessed to abusing dozens of children and had images of child sexual abuse at his home, according to a statement Monday from Interpol. An investigation started after the image of a young boy was identified by his family following its broadcast on Dutch television on December 7 at the request of Dutch national police, Interpol said. The victim's image was part of a series depicting the sexual abuse of a child under age 5 seized during an operation in the United States by officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Interpol said. The series was added to the International Child Sexual Exploitation database (ICSE) at Interpol's general secretariat in Lyon, the police organization said. Images from the same series of child pornography had already been seized and added to the database by victim identification specialists from the National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Interpol said. ""This case is a clear demonstration of the fact that so-called 'child pornography' can only be produced through the actual sexual abuse of children and that the global trade in child sexual abuse material can only be effectively policed by international cooperation through global channels of the type facilitated by INTERPOL's victim identification team,"" Bernd Rossbach, director of Interpol's specialized crime unit, said in the statement.","Officials identify the suspect as ""Robert M,"" a substitute preschool teacher .

"(CNN) -- As a young child Egyptian mountaineer Omar Samra didn't resemble someone who would one day tackle Mount Everest. At 11 years old he was scrawny and asthmatic. He'd wake up nightly gasping for air and required two inhalers to keep his airways open. The doctor told him that his condition would eventually disappear in his 20s or sooner if he started seriously exercising. This diagnosis would end up changing and eventually defining his life. Just after two months of rigorous exercise he was off his inhalers and one year later he was winning running competitions. ""For me as a young kid, that was a transformation moment because then I realized if I actually work hard and train hard at something, I can actually change the cards that I'm dealt and I can actually control my own fate and that for me was very inspiring,"" says Samra. Seventeen years after the doctor's diagnosis, Samra took this determination to tackle the world's tallest peak. The former asthmatic navigated deadly glaciers and subzero temperatures to ascend 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) to the thinnest air on Earth and into the history books. He became the first Egyptian and youngest Arab to ever climb Mount Everest. ""I think Everest was a turning point in my life,"" says Samra. Read related: From war child to U.S. Olympics star . This turning point saw him quit his job as an investment banker to become a full time adventurist. He started Wild Guanabana, which was the Middle East's first carbon neutral travel company. He also planned to summit the tallest peaks on all seven continents. He scaled Aconcagua, the tallest mountain in South America, oblivious that trouble was brewing back home in Egypt. ""I started this climb on the 20th of January 2011 and everybody knows what happened on the 25th. Now I was maybe 5,000 - 6,000 meters above sea level, somewhere completely remote without any access to the outside world. On the 28th, I had this intuitive feeling that I should call home."" Samra couldn't reach his family. Frantically he called every number he could remember but every call ended in an error message. It wasn't until he went online he found out Egypt was swept up in a revolution against President Hosni Mubarak. He was presented with a hard choice, return home or push for the summit. He decided climb on undeterred and sent an emotional message to the people rallying in Tahrir Sqaure when he reached the top. ""I had the Egyptian flag with me and I wrote 'Egypt it's for its people.' I was inspired and taken by the whole emotion of what was going on. I climbed the mountain and raised the flag."" After reaching the summit, Samra raced down the mountain, leaving equipment behind, to board a flight for Cairo making it back in time to see Mubarak step down. Read related: Paula Kahumbu teaches lions and humans to get along . Samra's experiences have made him a sought after motivational speaker and minor celebrity around the world. But he says he draws inspiration from his mother and her championing the rights of the intellectually disabled in Egypt through the Right to Live Association. Samra is also deeply attached to this cause as both of his older sisters suffer from learning impairments. His devotion to family combined with his experiences would come together to form the charity the Right To Climb Association (RTC). ""Almost one out of ten Egyptians has a disability of some kind and we have to do something to raise awareness and funds,"" says Samra. RTC takes climbers up Africa's tallest mountain, Kilimanjaro, to raise money through donations for the charity. Since the RTC initiative started Samra has raise over one million Egyptian pounds, roughly $164,000. Samra hopes the mountains he's conquered, both literal and metaphorical, will resonate with others so that they become better by pushing their own limits. ""I hope that everything that I've done and everything I do in the future will inspire people to push beyond their own boundaries; to understand that the challenges that we face or the limitations that we think about only lie in our mind and that we basically can accomplish anything that we set out to do.""","Omar Samra recovered from childhood asthma to become first Egyptian to scale Everest .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- After dumping intense rain and bringing strong winds to Haiti and Cuba on Saturday, Tropical Storm Isaac picked up steam -- and promised to pick up strength -- as it spun toward Florida. The storm left at least two people dead in the impoverished Caribbean nation of Haiti, pounding camps where hundreds of thousands of people live in tents. As the Haitian government and outside agencies continued to assess the damage, the focus surrounding Isaac increasingly turned toward Florida, much like the storm itself. Isaac was roughly 65 miles northeast of Camaguey, Cuba, and 340 miles east-southeast of Key West by late Saturday, moving at about 17 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm system is expected to gain strength and become a hurricane by early Monday as it moves past the Florida Keys and into the Gulf of Mexico. After barreling north -- affecting Florida's western coast along the way -- the storm is expected to pack 100 mph sustained winds by the time it makes landfall sometime late Tuesday afternoon or early evening on the Florida Panhandle, likely near Panama City, according to forecasters. That progression prompted Republican Party officials in Tampa to effectively push back Monday's scheduled start of the Republican National Convention one day, hoping the move will make it safer and easier for delegates to attend. Tropical storm conditions could first be felt there by late Sunday, and by late Monday afternoon and early evening, Isaac's eye should be west of the coastal city. Florida's governor, Rick Scott, insisted Saturday that his state will be ready for whatever happens. ""This is a state that has dealt with hurricanes forever,"" he told reporters Saturday in Broward County. ""We are a state that we know we have to get prepared for hurricanes."" As preparations continue, authorities in Haiti spent Saturday assessing Isaac's aftermath. The country is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that struck more than two years ago, and its challenges are compounded by the fact it is led by a relatively new government with limited resources. All that said, the top U.N. humanitarian official in the nation praised the initial response efforts. ""So far, I think we're faring reasonably well in our response,"" Kevin Kennedy told CNN on Saturday afternoon, referring to the efforts led by the Haitian government and assisted by U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations. Haitian radio reported that the worst damage was in the country's southeast. Heavy rain and strong winds persisting into the morning hours caused visible damage to trees and houses in the city of Jacmel, on Haiti's southern coast, and knocked out power. As many as 1,500 of the city's residents took refuge in a school serving as a shelter. Jacmel Mayor Hugues Paul confirmed at least one death on the outskirts of his city, voicing fears that more deaths will be reported. A 10-year-old girl also died when a wall fell on her house in Thomazeau, near Port-au-Prince, the country's civil protection agency said. At the Mega IV camp, where 8,000 Haitians live in makeshift shelters, fallen trees and flooding damaged hundreds of tents. Almost no one had evacuated the camp before the storm, and authorities were searching the camp tent by tent looking for victims. At another camp, Canaan, half the tents were blown away, according to an official statement on the radio. Haiti's national electricity supplier at one point said that 30 out of the country's 32 electricity grids were down. Bernard Mevs Hospital was operating on generator power after losing electricity, just before midnight, said Scott Gillenwater of the Project Medishare, which provides services at the hospital. The nation's main airport closed for a time, but had reopened by late Saturday afternoon, according to Rachel Brumbaugh, operations manager in Haiti for the Christian humanitarian organization World Vision. In Port-au-Prince, people were evacuated to areas behind the presidential palace and also to a stadium. The storm dumped up to a foot of rain around Hispaniola -- the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic -- with up to 20 inches in some locales. Kennedy pointed out the prospect of another humanitarian disaster would have been much worse right after the 2010 earthquake, when about 1.5 million people were living in about 1,500 makeshift camps. Today, he said that figure is closer to 400,000. But Haiti may not be out of the woods yet, with the possibility of even more heavy rain causing a host of problems along the coast and in populated areas downhill from mountains. ""We could possibly get another 10 inches and, should that happen, we'd be very concerned about flooding in the low-lying areas and those places adjacent to the sea,"" Kennedy said. Water levels along the Grey River in Port-au-Prince are already ""at their breaking point,"" and more rain could cause them to overflow their banks and flood surrounding areas, Brumbaugh said. In Jacmel, residents fear that large amounts of rainfall may cause mudslides, runoff and severe flooding as it did several years ago. ""I'm very worried about the water coming off the mountains and that the city fills up like a sink,"" said Paul, the city's mayor. Isaac threatens destruction, cholera . After hitting Haiti, Isaac skirted eastern and central Cuba. Cuban officials reported some storm surge and flooding from rain in the far eastern part of the country, and about 200 people were said to be in shelters in the town of Baracoa. But thus far no major damage or injuries were reported. Strong wind gusts were also felt in Havana. After passing Cuba and getting back out over open water, Isaac is forecast to gain strength over the next 48 hours, the hurricane center reported. The Florida Keys, Florida Bay and the state's west coast, from Bonita Beach south to Ocean Reef, are under a hurricane warning. And a hurricane watch, first issued early Saturday, continued overnight for Florida's east coast from Golden Beach south to Ocean Reef. A watch means hurricane conditions are possible, and a warning means that hurricane conditions are expected. A tropical storm warning, meanwhile, was in effect overnight Saturday for Cuba's eastern provinces, most of the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, the east coast of Florida from Sebastian Inlet south to Ocean Reef and the west coast of Florida from Tarpon Springs south to Bonita Springs -- an area that includes Tampa. ""It has been a fortunate seven years since Wilma hit Florida,"" National Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb said, referring to the last hurricane to make landfall in the state. ""The luck is going to run out at some point."" Scott declared a state of emergency for his state, which he said is ""standard protocol"" to ensure a well-coordinated response with local, state and federal agencies. Big storms like these are nothing to Floridians, the governor pointed out, and people are already working to get ahead of this one. In Key West, the southernmost point in the United States and likely the first part of the Sunshine State to be hit by Isaac, Mayor Craig Cates told CNN on Saturday that ""we're ready (and) we're confident that it's not going to be really bad."" Many storefront windows were boarded up, while hotels were largely vacant even though no orders or recommendations for evacuations had been issued. Some in Key West, though, suggested they were ready and eager to ride out the storm. ""We came down here to have a good time, we're not going to let a hurricane get in the way,"" Paul Cannella, a tourist from Chicago who is visiting the Keys. ""I am a big believer in lifetime experiences, (and) I've heard about hurricane parties, so we're going to have some fun with it."" Opinion: Wyclef Jean: What about Haiti?

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal's rivals take note -- the Spaniard is on his way back and he's ready to fire on all cylinders. The former World No.1 won his first title since ending a seven-month injury layoff by clinching victory in the final of the Brazil Open Sunday. The 26-year-old saw off Argentina's David Nalbandian 6-2 6-3 in 78 minutes to claim the top prize of $82,300. And Nadal, currently ranked fifth in the world, said he was delighted with his latest success. Nadal's hardcourt injury claims . ""It's a great title and important for me,"" he told reporters. ""Yesterday (during the semi-final) the knee hurt. Today it's better, rather bearable. I am happy to win in Brazil for the second time. ""I am going to think about Acapulco (later this month) and nothing else. ""We are going to see how the knee responds and then take stock. I don't have any problem playing against better rivals because I accept that I can lose. Losing is not a problem for me."" Knee injury continues to 'bother' Nadal . Nadal played at the Vina del Mar Open in Chile earlier this month, losing the singles and doubles finals last Sunday. But 11-time grand slam winner is hopeful that he's back on the right path following a torrid time with injury. He added: ""I just need time to continue improving and return to a more competitive level."" Since last June's shock second round exit at Wimbledon, Nadal has suffered with a torn tendon and an inflammation of his left knee. Nadal was forced to miss the Olympics and U.S Open as he continued his battle for full fitness. His return was then further delayed by a stomach virus, forcing him to withdraw from the Australian Open.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev arrived Thursday in Dagestan to hold talks with regional political leaders and government officials following this week's bomb blasts in Moscow and car bombings in the southern Russian republic. Medvedev planned to to hold a meeting about the situation with the heads of republics in the North Caucasus, territorial units of Russia's Federal Security Service, and the Interior Ministry, the Interfax news agency reported. A car exploded in Dagestan late Wednesday, killing two men and wounding one more, Russian state-run news agency Itar-Tass reported. The Dagestani Interior Ministry said the car may have been carrying a homemade explosive device, Itar-Tass reported. It happened in the Khasavyurt region, about 75 kilometers (46.5 miles) from the regional capital of Makhachkala, the news agency said. Twelve people were killed and 23 wounded earlier Wednesday when two car bombs exploded in the Dagestani town of Kizlyar, near the restive republic of Chechnya. Most of the dead and wounded were police officers, officials told CNN. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said he doesn't rule out the double bombings earlier Wednesday were carried out by the same terrorist groups behind Monday's suicide attacks on the Moscow metro, in which two female suicide bombers killed at least 39 people. Chechen rebel leader Dokku Umarov claimed Wednesday on a Chechen rebel Web site that he personally gave orders for the subway attacks.","Medvedev's visit to restive southern republic follows suicide bombings .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called on the ruling United Russia party Saturday to endorse Prime Minister Vladimir Putin for president in 2012. Putin in turn suggested that Medvedev should take over the role of prime minister if the party wins parliamentary elections in December, in what would be a straight swap of roles. Putin has already served two terms as the country's president from 2000 to 2008. It had not been clear until now whether Medvedev, his protege, would seek to run for a second term in presidential elections due to take place in March, fueling months of speculation. Addressing the party congress in Moscow, Medvedev said he wanted to answer the important question of who would be the party's presidential candidate -- and that he believed it should be Putin, the party's chairman. The ruling party's endorsement makes it highly likely that Putin will be returned to the country's top office, observers say. Medvedev's remarks were interrupted by applause as the crowd gave Putin a standing ovation. ""This applause spares me the need to explain what experience and authority Vladimir Putin possesses,"" Medvedev said. He explained the long delay in making clear which of them would run for president next year as an issue of ""political expediency,"" saying they had to play by the rules of politics. Medvedev, who said he accepted Putin's proposal that he stand for prime minister, said the government had succeeded in restoring a country that had been in ""a deep decline, in a systemic crisis"" a decade ago. ""By our common efforts we've managed to preserve and restore our beloved fatherland, our Russia. And we will not give it back to anyone,"" he said. ""We will not give it back to those who want to destroy it, to those who deceive people by giving them empty and unfeasible slogans and promises."" In his own speech, Putin said it was a great honor to run for president and that his voice of command ""is not lost."" He said he wanted to see economic growth in Russia increase to 6-7% in the near future. In the next five years, Russia should be among the five most powerful economies in the world, he said. Putin also set out the task of fully rearming the Russian armed forces in the next five to 10 years. Putin said he was sure the United Russia party, whose election ticket will be headed by Medvedev, would win December's parliamentary elections. Medvedev would ""be able to build a new, efficiently-functioning and young team of managers, and lead the government so as to continue modernization of all aspects of our lives,"" Putin added. For more than two years, Putin and Medvedev have repeatedly said they would decide together which of them would run for the Russian presidency in 2012, fanning the flames of intrigue. Even during his time as prime minister, Putin has been widely perceived as the senior member of the Russian ""ruling tandem."" Putin had stepped down in 2008 because the Russian constitution at that time limited a president to two consecutive four-year terms. Under amendments to the constitution that came into force on December 31, 2008, the presidential term was extended to six years. This means that if Putin is elected in March 2012 for six years, he would be eligible to run for another six-year term after that, potentially keeping him in charge until 2024. Under the same constitutional amendments the term for parliament members was extended from four to five years. Currently, the United Russia controls more than 300 seats in the 450-seat State Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian parliament. More than 10,000 people attended the party congress, held in Moscow's Luzhniki Sports Arena. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko and Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Putin says Medvedev should be the next prime minister if the party is reelected .

"(CNN)  -- Security forces aboard a U.S. naval vessel fired warning shots toward two approaching small boats off the Somali coast Tuesday, the U.S. military said Wednesday. The USNS John Lenthall is one of 14 fleet refueling ships operated by Military Sealift Command. The rounds landed in the water, prompting the boats to turn around, and no casualties were reported, the military news release said. It is unclear whether the boats were trying to attack the 41,000-ton USNS John Lenthall, the military said. ""It is clear they were not following the international rules of the road observed by mariners around the globe,"" it said. The release noted that the location of the incident, the types of boats involved and the maneuvering were all ""consistent with reports from previous attacks on merchant vessels in the region."" The USNS John Lenthall is one of 14 ""fleet replenishment oilers"" in the Military Sealift Fleet Support Command, according to a U.S. Navy Web site. Oilers refuel Navy ships at sea and any aircraft they may be carrying. Attacks by pirates have increased dramatically off the northern coast of  Somalia in the past year, prompting the United States and other nations to step up patrols in the region. In May, the U.S. Navy warned merchant ships to stay at least 200 miles off the Somali coast. But the U.S. Maritime Administration warns that pirates sometimes issue false distress calls to lure ships closer to shore. The pirates are often armed with automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rockets, according to warnings from the agency.","Warning shots fired after two boats raise suspicions of piracy .

"(CNN) -- The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries has tagged two great white sharks off Cape Cod in an area where shark sightings have been reported, state officials said Sunday. A great white shark is tagged Saturday off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Shark sightings closed nearby beaches. The first tagging Saturday marked the first time a great white shark had been successfully tagged in the Atlantic Ocean off the U.S. coast, the division said in a statement. A second shark was tagged Saturday afternoon, officials said. The taggings took place in the waters near Chatham, Massachusetts, two days after Greg Skomal, shark expert for the Division of Marine Fisheries, reported as many as five large sharks were seen near Monomoy Island, a National Wildlife Refuge off the southern elbow of Cape Cod. The island is about a mile away from Chatham's Lighthouse Beach, a public swimming area. Chatham's beaches were closed to swimmers after the sightings, Skomal said. CNN affiliate WCVB reported that all of Chatham's east-facing beaches were closed after three sharks came within 75 yards of the coastline.  Watch who is making money from sharks » . The beaches will be off-limits to swimmers until the middle of the week, officials told WCVB. After the sightings, Skomal and other biologists set out to identify the species, the division statement said. Skomal identified a great white shark on Friday, and then the two were tagged Saturday. ""The tags, which use satellite-based technology to record where a shark travels, allow scientists to better understand migratory patterns,"" the division statement said. Great white sharks are relatively rare in New England, the division statement said, but have been seen feeding near seal colonies. Massachusetts has recorded only four shark attacks since 1670, two of which were fatal. The last fatal shark attack in Massachusetts happened in 1936. Researchers have also tagged great white sharks off the coast of South Africa.","Taggings of great whites are the first in the Atlantic Ocean, state officials say .

"(CNN) -- A man accused of crimes against humanity who has evaded International Criminal Court warrants for seven years has surrendered to the U.S. Embassy in Kigali, Rwanda, officials said Monday. ""I can confirm that this morning Bosco Ntaganda ... walked into U.S. Embassy Kigali. He specifically asked to be transferred to the ICC in The Hague. We're currently consulting with a number of governments, including the Rwandan government, in order to facilitate his request,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters. She said she didn't think U.S. authorities had any advance notice that he would surrender. News of Ntaganda turning himself in was also reported in a Twitter post from Rwandan Minister of Foreign Affairs Louise Mushikiwabo. The ICC first issued an arrest warrant for Ntaganda, who at different times has been a Congolese rebel leader and a general in the army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 2006. That warrant alleged that Ntaganda had forced children to become soldiers in the DRC. A second ICC warrant issued in July 2012 accused Ntaganda of murder, rape, attacks on civilians and slavery.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev welcomed Cuban President Raul Castro to Moscow on Thursday, marking the first time any Cuban leader has visited Russia's capital since Fidel Castro made a trip there 22 years ago at the end of the Cold War. Cuban President Raul Castro reviews honor guards after arriving Wednesday in Moscow, Russia. The two presidents appeared together on Russian state television in an informal meeting in which the Cuban leader spoke fondly of his last trip to Moscow almost 30 years ago. Medvedev and Raul Castro will discuss bilateral issues Friday during their official meeting at the Kremlin. ""We plan to reach the signing of a number of agreements aimed at the promotion of interaction of our countries in the trade-economic, financial-investment and cultural-humanitarian areas at the talks,"" Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov told Prensa Latina in an interview posted on the official ministry Web site. ""In general, there is no doubt that Castro's visit will contribute to the strengthening of the Russian-Cuban partnership."" The last time Medvedev and Castro spoke face to face was in November when Medvedev traveled to Latin America, including a stop in Cuba. The visit, during which Medvedev also met with Raul's ailing brother, Fidel Castro, was part of a regional tour to Venezuela and Brazil, sending a poignant message to the United States that Russia is quickly gaining support in its backyard. After the collapse of Soviet Union, ties between communist Cuba and ex-communist Russia cooled. In 2001, then-Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Havana, Cuba, to begin new talks with the former Cold War ally. Besides discussing the world's hot spots and the global financial crisis, Medvedev and Raul Castro will ""focus on solving the issue of lifting the blockade from Cuba under the new U.S. administration,"" Lavrov said, referring to the decades-old U.S. embargo against the Caribbean island nation. ""We hope that the joint position of the vast majority of members of the international community on this issue will finally contribute to revising U.S. approaches in a realistic manner,"" Lavrov told the interviewers. ""On our side, we are ready to decisively pursue our line aimed at canceling the blockade, in which we can see a relic of the past era."" Castro's visit is due to last until Wednesday.","Cuban president's trip intended to strengthen ties with Russia .

"(CNN) -- The president of the Central African Republic has fled the country's capital and rebels have seized control of the city, a government official said Sunday. President Francois Bozize crossed into the Democratic Republic of Congo, said Jules Gautier Ngbapo, a spokesman for the government's territorial administration minister. He declined to disclose Bozize's location Sunday. Read more: What's behind the unrest? ""The Central African Republic has just opened a new page in its history,"" said a written statement from Justin Kombo Moustapha, secretary general of the Seleka rebels. The statement described Bozize as the country's former president and urged residents of the landlocked country to remain calm and prepare themselves to welcome rebel forces. Word of Bozize's surprise departure came as violence erupted in the capital, Bangui. Read more: Who are Seleka? Witnesses reported hours of gunfire, and Ngbapo said at least seven civilians were killed as rebels and local residents looted shops. Some South African soldiers were killed in clashes, according to a statement from the office of French President Francois Hollande. South African officials could not be immediately reached for comment. A United Nations spokeswoman based in Bangui described the situation as confusing and very tense. ""A number of U.N. offices have been looted as well as residences of some U.N. personnel,"" spokeswoman Uwolowulakana Ikavi said. Sounds of fierce gunfire rang out for hours Sunday, she said. The country has been on edge since rebel fighters pushed their way into the capital. The wave of unrest started in December, when the Seleka rebel coalition launched its offensive. The rebels accused Bozize of reneging on a peace deal and demanded that he step down. The rebel group, based in the country's north, managed to take control of several towns and move toward Bangui in the following weeks. The Seleka and the government brokered a new peace deal in January, agreeing to form a unity government led by Bozize. But that peace deal also fell apart. On Saturday, about 150 French troops secured the airport in Bangui. France also asked for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting to address the crisis in its former colony. Hollande's office said the French president had spoken Sunday with South African President Jacob Zuma, expressing condolences for the soldiers' deaths. ""They called on all the parties to be calm,"" the statement from Hollande's office said, ""to stop looting and to respect the political accords of Libreville,"" where leaders signed a peace deal in January.

The African Union condemned the Seleka rebels' renewed offensive and also announced a travel ban and asset freeze against political and military actors involved in violating humanitarian rights or the January peace agreement. Meanwhile, on Sunday, U.N. officials in the Central African Republic were preparing to evacuate. U.N. staff on the ground in Bangui are not allowed to leave the compound, Ikavi said, and non-essential staff will be evacuated or relocated once the security situation allows. ""As a human being, I am afraid,"" Ikavi said. ""No one can stay calm when you hear heavy shooting not far from the place that you are staying.""

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- On the eve of a two-day summit with U.S. President Obama, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev says both countries are ""moderately optimistic"" about ""resetting"" their relations. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev spoke to Italian media about conflicting views on U.S. missile defense. In an interview with Italian media RAI and Corriere della Sera, Medvedev said relations ""have begun to revive"" after a period of significant deterioration during the administration of President George W. Bush. The top issue on the agenda for the two leaders, Medvedev said, is working out a new treaty on limiting strategic offensive nuclear weapons to replace the 1991 START I agreement, which expires December 5. The Russian leader stakes out the position Russia has held for some time: that the issue of reducing those weapons is linked to the issue of a missile defense system, and he repeated his opposition to the missile defense shield the United States has proposed to be installed in Poland and the Czech Republic. The Bush administration raised the idea; the Obama administration is reviewing the plan and has not decided whether to proceed. But, significantly, Medvedev said he thinks ""we are fully able to find a reasonable solution"" to the standoff. ""In order to resolve this issue, we do not necessarily have to cancel out all the previous decisions that have been made,"" he said. ""It is enough to show restraint, to show an ability to compromise. And then we can agree on the basic foundations of a new START treaty and agree at the same time on how we will approach missile defense."" The president's remarks are the clearest expression yet of Russia's position on linkage, and they appear to indicate that Russia will not torpedo ongoing negotiations to replace the START I treaty just because Moscow opposes the U.S. missile defense proposal. ""The Russian Federation is not against the development of such a means of defense,"" Medvedev said, ""but we believe that it should not be unilateral nor, in essence, directed against one of the participants in this dialogue, a major nuclear country such as Russia. We believe that the decisions that were taken on this topic have put us in a difficult position."" A missile defense system, he said, ""must refer to global action to protect ourselves from countries which actually pose a threat today. And we are ready for such a dialogue with the United States of America."" U.S. officials insist that the Obama administration wants to work with Russia on missile defense as part of a network of interconnected systems that might include sites in Russia. But final proposals on this are on the back burner as the administration carries out a major review of its defense policy in a ""nuclear posture review,"" scheduled to be completed by this fall. The Russian president, however, rejects the U.S. explanation that the missile defense system is aimed at threats from Iran. ""They are too far apart geographically. I do not understand how people can say that missile defense is linked to the problems of the Middle East,"" he told the Italian media. ""Therefore, it seems to me that all these arguments have been developed simply to justify the decisions taken by the previous administration of the United States.""","Relations have ""begun to revive"" after Bush administration, he says .

"(CNN) -- For Grover Norquist's Taxpayer Protection Pledge, the latest rebellion began last week in the South, by way of friendly fire. ""I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge,"" Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia, told Macon station WMAZ. ""If we do it his way, then we'll continue in debt, and I just have a disagreement with him about that."" The next shot came from South Carolina's Sen. Lindsey Graham: ""I think Grover is wrong when it comes to we can't cap deductions and buy down debt....I will violate the pledge, long story short, for the good of the country."" More Republican salvos followed. Rep. Peter King of New York said the hard line on revenue was based on outdated thinking: ""A pledge you signed 20 years ago, 18 years ago, is for that Congress"" -- not an entire congressional career. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, insisted he was ""not obligated on the pledge."" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor downplayed the pledge's significance, saying no one in his home state cared all that much about it. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, stuck to a hard line on taxes, but sounded a similar note: ''Oh, I signed it,'' he said. ""...But we've got to deal with the crisis we face. We've got to deal with the political reality of the president's victory.'' The man behind the pledge says he's not so much embattled as bored. ""I've seen this movie about 50 times before,"" he told CNN. ""I get this every time someone burps. It always gets reported as all these guys have caved and said they're for tax increases. All it is happens to be a handful of people are having impure thoughts,"" he said, turning to his favorite recent description of the trend. Take last year, when Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, sounded a defiant note. ""I signed (the pledge) in 1998 when I first ran. I didn't know I was signing a marriage agreement that would last forever,"" he told Fox News. ""And I think that the majority of members of Congress understand that you have to have additional revenue."" Rand Paul warns of GOP becoming dinosaur, cites robotic squirrels . And back then, Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, one of the half-dozen Republicans who hadn't signed the pledge, took direct aim at Norquist from the House floor. ""I believe how the pledge is interpreted and enforced by Mr. Norquist is a roadblock to realistically reforming our tax code,"" he said. ""Have we really reached a point where one person's demand for ideological purity is paralyzing Congress to the point that even a discussion of tax reform is viewed as breaking a no-tax pledge?"" In other words: Over the years, semiregular flashes of Norquist defiance have tended to be one of those Washington obsessions that grab big headlines to little permanent effect, sort of like open-mike profanity on the campaign trail. One or more Republican lawmakers will appear to publicly waver on their commitment to the pledge. (Norquist points to Chambliss, Graham and King as repeat offenders.) That open questioning is often followed just as predictably by a private call to Norquist -- who says Chambliss has called to apologize -- and more often than not, some kind of public mea culpa. Norquist, 56, has never been elected to public office or held a Cabinet post. He isn't a deep-pocketed donor or celebrity magnate. The millions of dollars Americans for Tax Reform, the group he heads, spent on the 2012 campaign is a healthy sum, but pocket change in the post-Citizens United era. Norquist may have had influence over the direction of super PAC funding, but he didn't hold the purse strings. And yet he's routinely named one of the most powerful men in Washington. He hosts off-the-record weekly meetings of the conservative movement's top figures. The ""K Street Project"" he pushed during the Bush era was a leading driver of a massive shift in the lobbying landscape to the GOP's benefit. And the Taxpayer Protection Pledge he debuted more than two decades ago has achieved an almost mythic status among fans and foes alike. Norquist views that two-line document -- fewer than 70 words in all -- as something like a blood oath, an ironclad, immutable contract between lawmakers and their constituents that they will not back any bill to raise taxes or revenue. Famously, he keeps original copies of every signed pledge -- each of which has to be co-signed by two witnesses -- in a fireproof vault for protection. This congressional session, that safe held the signatures of nearly every Republican member of Congress, as well as some Democrats. Opinion: Republicans wisely break with Grover Norquist . Norquist warns lawmakers who, in his view, turn wobbly on taxes that they're risking their political lives -- including Republican icons like Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar, who lost both Norquist's backing and his primary race to Richard Mourdock this year. Mourdock, of course, went on to lose a near-guaranteed Republican Senate seat to Democrat Joe Donnelly by nearly six points, despite Mitt Romney's solid Indiana win at the presidential level. There are some who say the zeitgeist has shifted in some tangible way during the current Congress. Last year, 40 Republicans joined 60 Democrats as co-signers of a letter that expressed a willingness to consider revenue increases as part of a deficit solution. And amid the latest GOP pushback, the wave of ""Is Grover Over?"" headlines has been mounting. Norquist himself often speaks with the casual confidence of a Washington fixture, secure in the knowledge that his position is far more secure than any elected official's. ""We are not auditioning for fearless leader,"" he told activists at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference. ""We don't need a president to tell us in what direction to go. We know what direction to go... We just need a president to sign this stuff. We don't need someone to think it up or design it."" It was the sort of remark liberal critics often point to as evidence Norquist is a conservative puppet master with near-limitless power. One artist recently depicted him as the Wizard of Oz, an unseen but seemingly omnipotent force (a portrait Norquist himself jokingly embraced, retweeting a link to the picture with the caption: ""My mom wants one."") Graham says he'd break no-tax 'pledge' Earlier this year, President Obama complained to Rolling Stone magazine that some Republicans would like to work with him, but ""in an atmosphere in which folks like Rush Limbaugh and Grover Norquist are defining what it means to be a true conservative, they are lying low."" When Norquist last year slammed bipartisan efforts to end pricey ethanol subsidies as a backdoor tax hike, former President Clinton mused that it seemed GOP moves had to be ""approved in advance by Grover Norquist."" ""You're laughing,"" Clinton told the crowd at the Aspen Ideas Festival. ""But he was quoted in the paper the other day saying he gave Republican senators permission"" to scrap the subsidies. ""I thought, 'My God, what has this country come to when one person has to give you permission to do what's best for the country?' It was chilling."" Of course, some of the toughest barbs aimed at Norquist don't come from the opposite end of the political spectrum; they come from some fellow conservatives and deficit hawks, particularly members of the old guard who served in an era when tax hikes were still a politically acceptable deficit-fighting option. His feuds with some of these figures date back decades. More than two decades after George H.W. Bush's signoff on a tax increase first drew Norquist fire, the former president is still not a fan: . ""Who the hell is Grover Norquist, anyway?"" Bush asked Parade magazine over the summer. Last year, former GOP Sen. Alan Simpson, whose Simpson-Bowles commission called for a deficit solution that included a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases, slammed Norquist's influence: ""If Grover Norquist is now the most powerful man in America, he should run for president. He has people enthralled."" Conservative activist and CNN contributor considers primary bid . And this week, Simpson riffed on Norquist's infamous goal of reducing the federal government ""down to the size we can drown in the bathtub."" ""So how do you deal with guys who came to stop government, or Grover wandering the earth in his white robe saying you want to drown government in the bathtub,"" Simpson asked MSNBC on Tuesday. ""I hope he slips in there with it."" Norquist â€” widely viewed as one of the funniest men in Washington -- says he's unfazed by the attacks, and that the portrait of him as some sort of political enforcer is overblown. (Although his claim that he collects ""whackers"" -- items used to hit people -- probably doesn't do much to help banish the image.) ""I understand it comes with the territory that people attack me personally. Uh, it doesn't bother me. I am very comfortable in my own skin. If they want to waste their time personally attacking me, they're free to do so,"" he shrugs.","Lawmakers are publicly defying the Taxpayer Protection Pledge .

"(CNN) -- The internet empowers each one of us to speak, create, learn and share. Today, more than two billion people are online â€” about a third of the planet. The internet has become one of the motors of the 21st century economy, allowing all of us to reach a global audience at a click of a mouse and creating hundreds of thousands of businesses and millions of jobs. According to a new OECD study, the net already accounts of 13% of American business output, impacting every industry, from communications to cars, and restaurants to retail. Not since Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, or Alexander Graham Bell the telephone, has a human invention empowered so many and offered so much possibility for benefiting humankind. Today, this free and open net is under threat. Some 42 countries filter and censor content out of the 72 studied by the Open Net Initiative. This doesn't even count serial offenders such as North Korea and Cuba. Over the past two years, Freedom House says governments have enacted 19 new laws threatening online free expression. Some of these governments are trying to use a closed-door meeting of The International Telecommunication Union that opens on December 3 in Dubai to further their repressive agendas. Accustomed to media control, these governments fear losing it to the open internet. They worry about the spread of unwanted ideas. They are angry that people might use the internet to criticize their governments. The ITU is bringing together regulators from around the world to renegotiate a decades-old treaty that was focused on basic telecommunications, not the internet. Some proposals leaked to the WICITLeaks website from participating states could permit governments to justify censorship of legitimate speech -- or even justify cutting off internet access by reference to amendments to the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs). Read more: Why aren't robots doing my dishes yet? Several authoritarian regimes reportedly propose to ban anonymity from the web, making it easier to find and arrest dissidents. Others have proposed moving the responsibilities of the private sector system that manages domain names and internet addresses to the United Nations. Yet other proposals would require any internet content provider, small or large, to pay new tolls in order to reach people across borders. The upshot? The next garage-based phenomena would face a steep and probably insurmountable financial hurdle in its effort to become the next YouTube, Facebook or Skype. Let us be clear: We do not advocate for an end to the ITU. The UN agency has helped the world manage radio spectrum and wired and wireless telephone networks, bringing much needed investment to the developing world. But this inter-governmental agency is the wrong place to make decisions about the future of the internet. Only governments have a vote at the ITU. This includes governments that do not support a free and open internet. Engineers, companies, and people that build and use the web have no vote. The multi-stakeholder model of internet policy development that is the hallmark of the Internet Engineering Task Force, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the Internet Governance Forum, the Regional Internet Registries, among many others, is the only sensible way forward. Transparency and openness are keys to informed participation in policy making. The proposals for amending the ITRs are not generally available to the public or other stakeholders. The treaty conference and proposals in Dubai are formally confidential. We consider this to be a serious deficiency and an inhibitor to thoughtful policy development. At Google, we see and feel the dangers of the government-led net crackdown. We operate in about 150 countries around the globe. Our services - including Search, YouTube and Blogger, to Gmail and Maps - have been blocked at some point, temporarily or permanently, in more than 30 different countries. We're not alone in standing up. Users, experts and organizations from around the world have voiced their opposition to governments justifying their regulation of the internet through the ITU's International Telecommunication Regulations. These include countries not just in the West, but also African internet leaders such as Kenya and North African beacons such as Tunisia. In all, more than 1000 organizations from more than 160 countries have raised concerns about the upcoming closed-door meeting in Dubai. Internet lovers around the world can learn more about the issue on our website -- and if they choose to do so, can pledge their support. While some governments argue that the internet needs new global rules to speed its rollout in the developing world, we believe the present market-driven approach is best positioned to keep up with the net's exponential growth. Broadband services are being rolled out. Service interruptions remain rare. Within a few years the net is predicted to be serving four billion users -- more than half of humanity! The bottom-up, loosely-coupled, bilateral and multi-stakeholder practices that have created the network of networks we call the internet allow for a broad range of business models. The critical technical standards developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force and the World Wide Web Consortium create interoperability. A state-controlled system of regulation is not only unnecessary, it would almost invariably raise costs and prices and interfere with the rapid and organic growth of the internet we have seen since its commercial emergence in the 1990s. The net's future is far from assured and history offers much warning. Within a few decades of Gutenberg's creation, princes and priests moved to restrict the right to print books. History is rife with examples of governments taking actions to ""protect"" their citizens from harm by controlling access to information and inhibiting freedom of expression and other freedoms outlined in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We must make sure, collectively, that the internet avoids a similar fate.

"(CNN) -- Today, when I turned on the news, I watched in horror as Tropical Storm Isaac marched toward Haiti. Almost every news channel covered the story and the potential damage Isaac could wreak on an already injured Haiti. We'll soon know whether Mother Nature has decided to spare her from Isaac, but more storms will threaten, and Haiti still needs our help. Haiti's plight has always been close to my heart. It is the country of my birth and I am passionate about it. As we face this latest potential disaster, however, I find myself asking an uncomfortable question: Where has Haiti been in the national and international news? After the devastating earthquake in 2010, the people of the world opened up their hearts, minds, and wallets and pledged help to Haiti. Ordinary citizens near and far, celebrities, politicians donated time, energy, and money to disaster relief causes and organizations. For a while the spotlight was on Haiti, but lately there's been next to nothing. I don't mean to say that there aren't people and organizations still committed to Haiti. There are. Organizations such as Habitat for Humanity, Oxfam, the International Medical Corps, Project Medishare, Doctors Without Borders, Food for the Poor, J/P HRO, Donna Karan's Urban Zen organization, and We Advance, just to name a few, have done and continue to do outstanding work. But after the earthquake, most (including the media) stopped paying attention, either believing they had done all they could, or maybe because they were simply tired or overwhelmed. Today, almost three years later, there are more than 400,000 refugees still living in hundreds of tent cities, where sanitation is primitive and life is dangerous. Health issues abound; wrecked buildings and rubble remain. While the nation's current president has done an admirable job at letting the world know that Haiti is ""open for business,"" the problems facing the country remain enormous. The $2.1 billion raised in the earthquake relief effort may seem like a staggering sum, but we have to remember the scale and the magnitude of the devastation -- the total destruction of Haiti's minimal infrastructure. The task of rebuilding remains gargantuan. For example, people have stayed in tent cities that sprang up in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere because they have nowhere else to go. These places are fraught with dangers for women and children in particular. Many have left and are homeless. Some have moved into transitional shelters, but these must give way at some point to a more permanent solution. The government and charity organizations need more time and locations to build stable and secure homes and move the displaced. Cholera, which broke out in the year after the quake and has claimed thousands of lives and sickened hundreds of thousands, remains a constant threat because there is limited access to fresh water and sanitation. This, even though an admirable job has been done to contain the disease's spread. This year's rainy season has touched off new concerns about its re-emergence, and the coming storm can only make matters worse. This week, Haiti has returned once again to the national and international consciousness. This time, let's not forget. Whatever happens in the storm -- and we hope for the best -- Isaac can remind us that things don't change unless we remain active and continue to bring attention to the causes we believe in. The hardest part is always rebuilding -- and Haiti cannot effectively rebuild if she doesn't get the attention she deserves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wyclef Jean.","Wyclef Jean: Tropical Storm Isaac could renew misery of quake-damaged nation .

"(CNN) -- If there was ever a time to doubt the prognosticating abilities of Punxsutawney Phil, this might be it. Last month, the legendary Pennsylvania groundhog failed to see his shadow, thereby predicting an early spring. But at this point, people in the Rockies and Midwest would have been happy if it felt like spring when the season officially began -- on Wednesday -- as winter won't go quietly. Much of Colorado was pummeled with snow Saturday, causing travel-related and assorted other headaches. In the eastern part of the state, white-out conditions prompted authorities to close 154 miles of Interstate 70 from Denver to the Kansas line. And those wishing to fly out of Denver International Airport just had to wait. About 45 miles north of Denver, Interstate 25 northbound shut down Saturday afternoon after a weather-related incident ensnared 20 to 50 vehicles that either crashed or spun off the roadway, the Colorado State Patrol reports. Flames engulfed a semi-tanker caught up in the mess, which also affected at least four tractor-trailer trucks. Video posted on CNN affiliate KUSA's website showed the burning tanker, with parts of two cars pinned underneath. That part of the highway stayed closed until 4:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET). Even then, the Colorado Department of Transportation warned drivers that there were still ""high winds and poor visibility in the area."" Weather groundhog Phil 'indicted,' accused of lying . But at least folks in Colorado can take solace in the fact the snow should stop Saturday night. The same cannot be said for points east, from Kansas and far beyond. While they're expire soon in the Centennial State, winter storm warnings will be in effect for four other states through, in some spots, Sunday night. The fun has already started in parts of Kansas and Nebraska, with the snowstorm expected to roll over the Great Plains between interstate highways 70 and 80, according to CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. Kansas City and St. Louis, for instance, are among those cities facing winter storm warnings thanks to snow that could fall through late Sunday. The system will continue to barrel east from there, dumping snow on Louisville, Kentucky, and, by Monday, possibly on Washington, D.C., Maginnis said. And it's not just a matter of snow. In many locations, the storm will kick off as rain before temperatures cool and it changes to snow -- with other precipitation permutations such as sleet possible. Add in winds that could gust up to 40 mph, it equates to a big wintry mess -- whatever the calendar says. You call this spring? ""I don't think this will be one for the record books, but it is definitely going to add some interest this weekend and to the work week,"" Maginnis said. Winter weather overstays its welcome .","NEW: I-25 in northern Colorado reopens, though visibility is still poor, a state agency says .

"(CNN)  -- The assault began at dawn, as bullets and rockets peppered the remote outpost in eastern Afghanistan. Lt. Cason Shrode said that in less than two minutes, his team's generator was hit and they were out of power. The insurgency was so fierce, according to one soldier, that the troops couldn't get to their mortars to fire back. ""They were under heavy enemy contact,"" Sgt. Jayson Souter said, describing the October 3 attack that pinned his comrades at Combat Outpost Keating, a remote base in Nuristan province. Four servicemen -- Souter, a fellow soldier, an Apache helicopter pilot, and a gunner -- talked to a military reporter about their roles during the Keating attack in an interview posted by the Department of Defense on Facebook and NATO's International Security Assistance Force YouTube Channel. The United States says about 200 insurgents -- mostly local fighters, with some Taliban organizers and leaders -- had been planning the attack for days, hiding mortars, rockets and heavy machine guns in the mountains.  Watch more about their story » . The battle started early on October 3 and lasted for 12 hours. At the end, eight American soldiers and more than 100 militants were killed and buildings at the outpost were destroyed. Fire support officer 1st Lt. Cason Shrode said the initial round ""didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary."" There was a lull and then there was a heavy attack. ""We started receiving a heavy volley of fire. Probably 90 seconds into the fight they ended up hitting one of our generators so we lost all power,"" Shrode said in the interview posted online by the Defense Department. ""At that point I knew that this was something bigger than normal."" Troops called in air support. Helicopter gunner Chad Bardwell said he had to confirm the fighters he saw on ridgelines were the enemy because he had never seen such a large group of insurgents. ""We tried to stop them as they were coming down the hill. ... We were taking fire pretty much the entire day,"" he said in the Defense Department interview. Chief Warrant Officer Ross Lewallen, the Apache pilot, said a few aircraft were damaged in what was a ""time-consuming endeavor"" governed by tough terrain. He said the morning battle was ""significant,"" but later troops were able to identify targets and eliminate larger weapons. ""One of the primary reasons for the fight taking so long is that it is an extreme terrain,"" he said in the same interview. Lewallen said the valley sits beneath mountains to the west and north. ""There's a lot of cover so you really can't detect the enemy until they start moving again,"" he said, adding that it was tough for medical evacuation aircraft to land ""because we were still trying to control"" the outpost. The intense assault on Keating led to fires. There were five main buildings at the post and four of them burned. Soldiers eventually ended up going into one building. ""The next morning it was pretty much ash besides that one building. I mean that's the way to describe it. Most of it had burned down. So we were pretty much at one building and the rest was just a shadow of what it used to be,"" Shrode said in the Defense Department interview. Lewallen said what came together was ""air-ground integration."" ""All the training we've done before deploying here; it really clicked that day,"" he said in the interview. ""We started realizing that the guys on the ground knew what they needed to tell us to get the job done. It made things that much easier."" He disputed media reports suggesting that there weren't enough weapons and troops. He said 40 minutes into the fight, air power arrived. ""We had everything we needed. It was just a big attack with a lot of people. Bad things happen -- but I think we did well, under the circumstances."" Reflecting on the fight, Souter said, ""Everybody basically came together and in the mix of it all, they were donating blood for the wounded that we had. They all pulled together to make sure that we can pull our boys out of this.""","Soldiers describe October 3 attack at a remote base in Nuristan province .

"(CNN) -- Mississippi's governor has signed into law a bill requiring physicians performing abortions in the state to be a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist and to have admitting privileges at an area hospital. ""I believe that all human life is precious, and as governor, I will work to ensure that the lives of the born and unborn are protected in Mississippi,"" Gov. Phil Bryant said in a statement Monday. He has previously expressed his desire that the state become ""abortion free."" Seven other states require abortion providers to have hospital privileges, but no other state requires that an abortion provider be an OB/GYN, said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute in Washington. Though the 1973 Supreme Court landmark decision in Roe v. Wade made abortion legal in all 50 states, Mississippi's law could make the state the first where no abortions could be performed, she said. ""It's an attempt to eliminate access without taking on Roe directly."" Mississippi has only one abortion facility, Jackson Women's Health Organization. Should it close, Mississippi women seeking abortions would have to leave the state. The clinic's owner, Diane Derzis, said in a telephone interview this month that all her doctors are obstetrician-gynecologists, but only one has admitting privileges at an area hospital. She vowed to fight to remain open. ""We are going to do everything we can to remain there ... we are not going to let the women of Mississippi down,"" said Derzis. But Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves previously said that the bill ""should effectively close the only abortion clinic in Mississippi."" The bill ""puts in place requirements that intentionally try to make it impossible for physicians to provide abortion services,"" Felicia Brown-Williams, regional director of public policy for Planned Parenthood in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, said in early April. There is no medical reason to require physicians performing abortions be board-certified OB/GYNs or that they have admitting privileges, she said. If the clinic stops offering abortion services because it is unable to find providers with those qualifications, the bill ""would be a backdoor ban on abortion."" The Center for Reproductive Rights' state advocacy counsel, Jordan Goldberg, said that, if the goal of the legislation is to impose restrictions on abortion providers that are not imposed on other medical providers offering similar care, then ""that would raise serious constitutional problems and a legal challenge would certainly be possible."" ""It's not about medicine,"" she said. ""It's just about politics."" Last year, the state introduced a bill known as the Personhood Amendment, which would have defined life as beginning at the moment of conception. The bill was defeated by voters in November. In 2008, the last year for which data are available, 2,770 abortions were performed in the state, according to Guttmacher. CNN's Joe Sutton and Tom Watkins contributed to this report .","The bill could force the state's lone abortion clinic to close .

"(CNN) -- When Gino Covacci walks on the beach, he always keeps his eyes peeled for shells, fish and whatever else washes up. But it's not every day that he comes across something that seemingly looks right back at him -- as happened this week. Covacci's discovery: a blue-tinged softball-size eyeball. Even scientists don't know quite where it came from, beyond the sands of Pompano Beach. ""I find many different things,"" he said of his daily walks by the sea, ""but not something like this."" On Wednesday, Covacci said, he was walking along the southeastern Florida beach with a friend visiting from Greece when he spotted something protruding from the sand. He picked it up, cleaned it off, turned it around and realized he was staring into a giant eyeball. Excited about his find, Covacci flagged down a police officer and eventually got in touch with researchers based across the Sunshine State. ""The only thing is, I had to give it up,"" he said Friday of the eyeball. Carli Segelson, a spokeswoman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, confirmed Covacci's account and said members of her agency ended up with the specimen. ""Staff have been looking at the eye to ID what it is,"" she said. Experts didn't know late Friday what species the eye belongs to. Segelson said a conclusive finding on its origin could come early next week. For the time being, the wildlife commission spokeswoman said, ""the front-runner is some type of large fish."" But having peered closely into the mysterious eye, Covacci has other ideas. ""It is a squid; it's not a fish,"" he speculates. ""Prove me wrong!""

"Washington (CNN) -- Members of Congress focused on the Army's soldier-performance review and promotion process Wednesday, questioning the chief investigators behind a Pentagon report examining November's shootings at Fort Hood, Texas. ""This guy was a walking time bomb,"" said Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-California, referring to Maj. Nidal Hasan, an Army psychiatrist and the alleged shooter in a rampage that killed 13 people and wounded 43. Sanchez and other members of the House Armed Services Committee questioned Togo West Jr., former Army secretary; and retired Navy Adm. Vernon Clark, who explained their review of the shooting. Committee members asked about issues surrounding the incident, including protection for soldiers on base, emergency response policies and efforts to recognize soldiers exhibiting erratic, radical or violent behavior. But many on the committee wanted to know specifically about the Army's performance evaluation process, including whether performance reviews are watered down in an attempt to shift problem employees elsewhere. ""I am particularly concerned about the system of officer evaluation in the Army and other services,"" said committee chairman Ike Skelton, D-Missouri. ""The performance reports ... must accurately reflect the strengths and weaknesses of officers. Problems must not be passed from one assignment to another."" Hasan was promoted to the rank of major in May despite weak performance reviews and reports that he was becoming increasingly radical. Sanchez acknowledged that one of the most difficult things about being a manager is firing or demoting employees and dealing with subsequent legal issues. ""It doesn't make any of us feel good,"" she said. ""We tend to move them on."" Sanchez said including poor performance reviews in a soldier's file can have far-reaching implications, and managers often consider ""how much you can damage the career of someone who has made the military their career."" Like other committee members, she asked the panel about military constituents who have sought psychological help, only to have their careers negatively affected by doing so. Clark paused before responding. ""I wish to goodness that I was not constrained from talking about this,"" he said, referring to the classified parts of the report he wasn't allowed to discuss publicly. Hasan's commanders ""were responsible for developing him and educating him and training him in the field of medicine, and as an officer in the United States Army. Our impression -- and the words in our report are as straightforward as we can say them -- it needed work."" West, who is also a former secretary of Veterans Affairs, sympathized with the difficulties commanders face when writing performance reviews. He described what basically amounts to a fine line between ""damaging careers with hasty judgments,"" or conversely, simply passing off a sub-par employee. He said there's ""tension"" for commanders regarding when to act on information versus when not to, and what should be passed along versus what shouldn't be. But, he said, ""Evaluations make a difference, and we can't do the job of leading or protecting against threats if honest evaluations are not done by those who have the duty, the information, and the authority to do so.""","House Armed Services panel question chief investigators in Fort Hood shootings .

"(CNN) -- California's parole board Tuesday refused to release onetime Manson family acolyte Leslie Van Houten, finding the 60-year-old remains dangerous more than four decades after the group's Southern California murder spree. The board found that Van Houten ""still poses a risk to society,"" spokesman Luis Patino said. The decision marks the 19th time that she has been denied parole, and she won't be eligible again until 2013, Patino said. Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Patrick Sequeira praised the decision. ""The crime itself was absolutely horrendous -- the brutal slaughter of two individuals in their home, in a cruel and very horrifying manner,"" said Sequeira. ""It is our position that she never really has fully accepted responsibility for her crimes."" Known as ""Lulu"" while one of notorious spree killer Charles Manson's followers, Van Houten helped hold down Rosemary LaBianca while other Manson family members stabbed her and her husband, Leno LaBianca in 1969. She was 19 at the time. She has been imprisoned at the California Institution for Women at Frontera for more than three decades, following her final conviction on first-degree murder charges in 1978 and a sentence of life in prison. Prison spokesman Lt. Robert Patterson told CNN in 2009 that Van Houten is a model inmate involved in prison programs and a mentor to other inmates in the facility's college program. And lawyer Brandie Devall, who has been representing Van Houten for just under a year, said Tuesday before the hearing that the ""fact that Leslie has had good reports since 1978"" should help persuade the parole board to release her. Van Houten, Manson, Pat Krenwinkel and Susan Atkins were found guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to death in 1971. Their sentences were commuted to life in prison after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down death penalty laws in 1972 and established a four-year moratorium on executions. Van Houten's original conviction was overturned in 1976 on grounds that a judge erred in not granting a mistrial after her attorney, Ronald Hughes, disappeared and later was found dead. The jury deadlocked in her first retrial, and she was released on bond for a few months. But in her third trial, in 1978, she was convicted of first-degree murder. Ahead of Tuesday's parole board hearing, Devall said she was ""excited"" about the appearance. She planned to bolster her argument with rulings in two cases from the California Supreme Court since Van Houten's last parole hearing, in 2007. Each case was recently upheld by federal courts. Devall said during Tuesday's hearing, she planned to cite the case of Sandra Lawrence, a convicted murderer who was released in 2007 after more than 20 years in prison. The California Supreme Court decided that if an eligible parolee has spent enough time on rehabilitation and reform, the panel has the burden of proving that the inmate poses a current threat to public safety and should not base its decision on what happened decades earlier. In addition, Devall planned to use the case of Richard Shaputis, who was sentenced to 15 years to life following his 1987 conviction for second-degree murder -- and remains behind bars. Devall says in that case, the court found that parole boards should give significant consideration to psychologists' reports regarding whether inmates have demonstrated acceptance of responsibility, insight and understanding of their crimes, as Van Houten has. Van Houten told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" in 2002 that she herself stabbed Rosemary LaBianca 16 times. ""The autopsy reports have shown that it was Tex [Charles ""Tex"" Watson] that wielded the fatal wounds, but I contributed, and I attempted to hold her down for Pat,"" she said. ""I called to Tex because we couldn't kill her. You know, it's -- morally, I feel as though I did."" And during a 1994 CNN appearance, Van Houten told King the Manson family's lifestyle attracted her. ""I met these people. They said that they came from a commune in L.A. where they lived for the day and for the moment, and it was a lot of the [Timothy] Leary kind of philosophy of 'Be here now.'"" Van Houten called Manson ""an opportunist of the cruelest, most vicious kind,"" but she was quick to emphasize that she accepts blame for her role in the crimes. CNN's Ashley Hayes and Matt Cherry contributed to this report.","NEW: No parole for Manson acolyte Leslie Van Houten .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored for the 12th successive Spanish league match on Sunday to prevent Barcelona falling to a second defeat this season, while Mario Balotelli made the headlines on his return to Italy. Barca's 1-1 draw at Valencia meant the club's La Liga lead was trimmed to nine points by Atletico Madrid, who later beat Real Betis 1-0, but it moved the Catalans 16 points clear of third-placed Real Madrid. Stand-in Barca boss Jordi Roura was satisfied with the result following the midweek draw against Real in the first leg of the Spanish Cup semifinal. ""We're coming off of a very tough match away to Madrid and that, from a physical standpoint, always wears you down,"" said the assistant to coach Tito Vilanova, who was absent due to his ongoing cancer treatment. ""Valencia pressure you a lot and they don't let you play. Their intensity made it difficult for us to play our game and it was hard for us to get close to their area."" Messi leveled with a penalty six minutes before halftime after Valencia's goalscorer Evar Banega fouled Pedro. It was the four-time world player of the year's 34th league goal in 22 games. Banega had put sixth-placed Valencia ahead in the 33rd minute after a failed clearance by Gerard Pique. Roura paid tribute to goalkeeper Victor Valdes, who has been in fine form despite announcing he will not be extending his contract at the Camp Nou -- in particular denying Roberto Soldado a goal at the end. ""He's the best keeper for us. This Sunday he showed that he's at a fantastic level and he denied Valencia the winning goal. While he's with us, he'll help us,"" Roura said. Barca could also have snatched a victory, but David Villa missed a golden opportunity to mark his 100th first-team appearance after coming on as a substitute. Fourth-placed Malaga spurned the chance to close the gap on Real after drawing 1-1 with Real Zaragoza, but Betis stayed a point behind in fifth after Diego Costa's 61st-minute winner for Atletico. In Italy, Juventus moved three points clear at the top of Serie A with a 2-1 win at Chievo but the big story of the day was Balotelli's controversial debut for AC Milan. The former Manchester City striker put his side 1-0 up with a left-foot volley after 25 minutes against Udinese, who leveled through Giampiero Pinzi. However, Balotelli had the final say with a trademark penalty in the fourth minute of time added on after Stephan El Shaarawy went down under what looked like a fair tackle from Thomas Heurtaux. It lifted Milan to fourth in the table on goal difference above city rivals Internazionale. Balotelli's former club crashed to a 3-1 defeat at Siera, while third-placed Lazio lost 3-2 at Genoa. In Germany, two-time defending champions Borussia Dortmund moved above Bayer Leverkusen into second place after winning their clash 3-2. Dortmund led 2-0 in side 10 minutes but the home side leveled with two goals in four second-half minutes from midfielder Stefan Reinartz before Poland striker Robert Lewandowski struck the winner from close range just 60 seconds later. Dortmund could afford to miss a penalty by Poland midfielder Jakub Blaszczykowski, who had scored in the first half, but trail Bayern Munich by 12 points with 14 games to play. Seventh-placed Borussia Monchengladbach's European hopes suffered a blow with a 2-1 defeat by fifth-from-bottom Nuremberg.","Sunday's 1-1 draw with Valencia leaves Barcelona nine points clear in Spain .

"(CNN) -- There are just a few days until spring, but winter isn't done with some of us yet. A significant storm will threaten the Northeast on Monday into Tuesday, and areas of Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota could see blizzard conditions through the night. Forecasters said Boston will get 3 to 6 inches of snow and sleet before rain begins to fall Tuesday night. All public schools in the city will be closed Tuesday, according to an announcement Monday evening on the official Twitter account of Boston's public school system. CNN affiliate WCVB warned its viewers that by Tuesday morning, the commute to work will be slow. ""We'll have at least a couple of inches of snow on the ground with heavy snow still falling. Mix/freezing rain will develop from south to north during the morning. This will keep overall snow totals down, but traveling will still be difficult,"" meteorologist J.C. Monahan said. The New England mountains will get between 10 and 14 inches with snow falling at up to 2 inches per hour Monday night, forecasters said. Other areas of New England could get up to 8 inches. Fewer than 300 flights were canceled Monday, but delays are expected at airports from Ohio to New York. It was unusually cold and blustery in New York, where a little snow was expected to fall before changing to rain overnight. Track the winter storm . The low visibility was causing delays of almost an hour at Newark International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in the New York area. There will be storms in the South and while the rain could help firefighters near the tourist destination of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, as they try to contain a wildfire that has burned more than 35 buildings, they will also battle wind gusts of up to 20 mph. A tornado touched down Monday afternoon in Rutherford County near Nashville, Tennessee, county officials said. The tornado was on the ground for about 4 1/2 miles, said Joe Gourley of the Rutherford County Emergency Management Agency. Fewer than a dozen homes suffered minor to moderate damage, trees were toppled and roads were blocked, Gourley said. Just to the west, students at Fairview Middle School were evacuated after lightning struck the school and started a fire on the roof, CNN affiliate WTVF reported. In North Dakota, a no-travel advisory was issued by the state department of transportation for the eastern half of the state. The warning said there were areas where visibility was almost zero because of blowing snow, and there was significant ice on the highways and streets. One highway was blocked because of snow drifts covering the road, CNN affiliate KXJB reported. Minnesota officials had also closed three highways in the west central part of that state, KXJB reported. CNN's Justin Jones and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","Up to 6 inches of snow expected in Boston .

"Park City, Utah (CNN) -- At its best, driving in Los Angeles is like driving backward into a parade.  So, when my lady and I set out for the airport during rush hour, getting choked in traffic was inevitable. Yet, a quarter-mile later, we were still moving at a brisk clip. Which brings me to one of my cardinal rules of travel: Think inside the box. Here's how it works: When traveling during peak travel times -- Thanksgiving, spring break, even for the weekend --  schedule your journey at the most ""inconvenient"" time. This is because despite what we've learned from reality television, Americans aren't nutjobs. They're smart. They think outside the box. They tweak their schedules to avoid the big rush. They leave a day early or catch the red-eye. Which means peak times can be easy sailing. ""So this 'think inside the box' philosophy has nothing to do with the fact that you waited to the last minute to buy tickets?"" my girlfriend said, peering over a limp piece of airport pizza. ""Nope. It was part of my plan all along."" ""Kinda like your 'famous' burnt broccoli recipe."" ""Exactly."" And away we went to Park City, Utah, the former mining town, the schmancy ski resort, the home of the Sundance Film Festival. Like many Rocky Mountain ski towns, Park City's vibe is part snowhemian, part Patagucci. You can window shop for things you can't afford and then crack wise about it at the local independent coffee shop. Over-the-counter culture in Austin . Oh, and there's skiing. Three amazing resorts full. My girlfriend's family, who was hosting us, hails from California, so they're as comfortable with powder under their skis as they are with sand between their toes. Me? I grew up outside Philadelphia. So when I think ""downhill,"" I think school systems. Accordingly, instead of skis, I brought three books and ""National Lampoon's Vacation/European Vacation"" double-feature DVD. As it turns out, I used these things exactly never. Is skiing something one should start doing in one's 30s? Does it make sense to start testing my body now, after decades in which playing cards was the height of my athletic activity? These questions ran through my mind, as well as this great American paradox: Now that I'm old enough to afford health insurance, I'm old enough to know that hurdling down a mountain on two slick sticks makes as much sense as strapping acoustic guitars to my feet and jumping off a roof. NYC: Cheap thrills with an old flame . ""You skiing?"" my girlfriend asked. ""I think I'll hang here and practice sleeping,"" I said. ""If you don't come skiing, you'll miss 'après-ski.' "" ""What's that?"" ""It's like a post-ski happy hour where you sit in front of a fire and drink cocktails and relax."" ""Well, I've always thought mountains looked cool in pictures,"" I said, grabbing my parka and heading to the door. So convinced of skiing's addictive power, the resorts in Park City offer a special lesson/ski lift package for first-time skiers. Thus, before I knew it, I was on top of a frozen mountain, feet in boots the size of Honda Fits, trying to decipher my instructor's Romanian accent through multiple layers of polar fleece. ""Does 'après-ski' really require this much 'ski'?""  I wondered . But soon, I was zigzagging around the slopes like an old pro. And when I say ""old,"" I mean nonagenarian. I went very, very slowly, and despite the occasional 10-year-old using my crumpled body as a mogul, I made it through the day with little more than a bruised ego. But, man, did I excel at après-ski. We parked ourselves at High West, a handsome whiskey distillery, restaurant and saloon built in a turn-of-the-century house and livery stable on the edge of town. Within minutes, we were slaloming between gooey fondue bites and sips of house whiskey. We then moved up the street to Butcher's Chop House, where we ate prime rib the size of trash can lids. That night, my legs throbbed like two lighthouse lights, and I dreamed that I was on a ski lift traversing a giant lake of molten cheese. For our last day, we decided to give our knees and wallets a rest. We packed a picnic and went for a drive. While surveying the tony Deer Valley Resort, we glimpsed the new St. Regis hotel and decided to investigate. Is it OK to have a crush on a funicular? Because I do. Picture a roomy elevator with leather banquettes and windows that frame a panoramic view of the breathtaking Wasatch Mountains. It's the only way the public can visit the St. Regis resort, and that's fine by me. The funicular opens up onto the lobby of a posh grill owned and operated by famed chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Once at the top, my girlfriend and I were eager to hike. She along a snowy elk trail that necklaced the valley. Me from the funicular to the bar. The bloody mary as we know it was invented at the original St. Regis hotel in New York in 1934, the hotel claims. In honor of that brunch-changing event, every St. Regis hotel has its own signature version of the drink. The Park City version uses local vodka and wears a green cap of wasabi and celery mousse. But the coup de grace is a squeeze-bulb stir-stick filled with a Worcestershire/Tabasco sauce blend that lets you regulate the spiciness of your drink. It looks kind of like an IV, which is appropriate for a cocktail that people normally start consuming first thing in the morning. I was content in my après-après-ski state. ""You know, instead of covertly eating our picnic, it would be easier if we just ordered lunch here,"" I said, eyeing a hanger steak being delivered to a nearby table. ""Yeah, but we already have the leftovers,"" my girlfriend said, patting the Tupperware boxes carrying our premade lunch. ""You said yourself that you didn't want to get suckered into paying for another overpriced meal in a tourist town. This way, we can admire the view and save money."" ""I know, I know. But maybe we should think outside the box on this one,"" I said, licking my wasabi and celery foam mustache.","The after-ski social hour is a true reward for the half-hearted skier .

"(CNN) -- When Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo spoke out in August in favor of a Maryland ballot initiative that would legalize gay marriage, state Delegate Emmett C. Burns Jr. wrote a letter to Ravens owner, Steve Bisciotti saying that many football fans are ""opposed to such a view"" and suggesting that Bisciotti ""inhibit such expressions"" from his employee. Ayanbadejo, one of the first pro athletes to publicly support gay marriage, saw Burns' efforts to stifle him as a violation of his First Amendment rights. On September 7, Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe's penned a scathing response to Burns, stating, among other things: ""I can assure you that gay people getting married will have zero effect on your life. They won't come into your house and steal your children. They won't magically turn you into a lustful c**kmonster."" When football, same-sex marriage and politics collide . In an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow, Kluwe attributed the ""lustful c**kmonster"" bit to the fact that he developed a talent for coming up with attention-grabbing message board postings after growing up playing a lot of online video games. ""If you can't make a point that sticks in someone's mind,"" Kluwe explained, ""most people probably won't really listen to you. So I developed a writing style that combined logical presentation of facts with hopefully some pretty hilarious insults."" Colorful language aside, Kluwe was trying to make a serious point. He hoped that calling Burns out would spark a genuine conversation about the issues highlighted in the letter. Professional athletes, on the whole, aren't as outspoken as Kluwe when it comes to gay marriage and other hot-button issues. For the most part, they keep low profiles because they don't want to upset fans, risk endorsement deals or disappoint their coaches. Jackie Robinson, the first black man to play in the majors since the 1800s, desegregated Major League Baseball in 1947 when he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers. Robinson let his talent speak for itself, playing in six World Series with the Dodgers, until his playing career was over and he became an advocate for civil rights. Recognized as a hero of the era, Robinson is the only player ever to have his jersey number -- 42 -- retired across the board by every Major League team. In 1966, when he became eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War, boxer Muhammad Ali declared himself a conscientious objector. That same year, the heavyweight champion also delivered the ""Black is Best"" speech to 4,000 students at Howard University upon being invited to speak by the campus protest group Black Power Committee. For refusing to enlist, Ali was arrested, fined and stripped of his title, and for more than three years he could not box in any state in the U.S. In 1967, Ali was convicted of violating United States Selective Service laws by refusing to be drafted. As public opposition to the war grew, Ali delivered speeches across the country, at one point asking, ""Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?"" Ali's conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1971. Pro athletes ignore backlash, show true political colors . The outspoken Alis, however, were few and far between. In 1990, for example, Michael Jordan declined to endorse Democratic North Carolina Senate candidate Harvey Gantt, saying ""Republicans buy shoes, too."" Times have changed, and this past summer, Jordan helped President Barack Obama's re-election campaign net $3 million at a $20,000-a-plate fundraising dinner. While the majority of professional athletes today still adopt a laissez-faire attitude toward taking a stand on controversial issues, the tide is slowly turning. Cleveland Browns linebacker Scott Fujita, a longtime advocate for NFL player safety, publicly accused Commissioner Roger Goodell this month of abusing his power by not being more vigilant about health and safety issues concerning players. ""He failed to acknowledge a link between concussions (and) post-career brain disease,"" Fujita said in a statement, ""pushed for an 18-game regular season, committed to a full season of Thursday night games, has continually challenged players' rights to file workers' compensation claims for on-the-job injuries, and he employed incompetent replacement officials for the start of the 2012 season. His actions or lack thereof are, by the league's own definition, 'conduct detrimental.' "" Goodell maintained that Fujita, a former New Orleans Saints team captain, should have done more to stop players from participating in a team bounty program. That scandal involved several Saints defensive players who were discovered to have secretly managed a pool of money from which bonuses were awarded to players who injured opponents between 2009 and 2011. Goodell suspended Fujita for three games but reduced that suspension to one, acknowledging that Fujita did not participate in Bountygate. In Minnesota, as residents prepare to vote on an amendment to ban gay marriage, Kluwe remains outspoken. ""It would be great if Minnesota could show America that this state treats people the right way and knows that gay people contribute just as much to society as straight people,"" Kluwe said. Although he himself is not a homosexual, Kluwe posed for the November cover of Out magazine. He noted that historically -- though most sports figures are reluctant to do so -- it has often been professional athletes who have brought about awareness of issues like gay marriage and civil rights. ""When sports gets on board with a civil issue, then that issue is rapidly resolved in the next, you know, 10, 15 years,"" he said. ""Sports speaks to a large segment of the population, and when kids look at athletes as role models, they say, 'OK, hey, these guys are saying it's OK if you're gay, it's OK to have same-sex marriage.' "" Kluwe maintains that, despite his outspokenness, he has no plans to become a politician after his playing days are over. He hopes that one day, it won't be necessary for him to defend the issue of gay marriage. ""It shouldn't be news when someone speaks out for equality,"" he said. ""It should be news when someone speaks out against equality.""","Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe is an advocate for gay rights .

"(CNN) -- If you can come up with a tale that better illustrates America's messed-up moral views on abortion, parenting and personal freedom than the story of Crystal Kelley -- the surrogate mother who was offered $10,000 by the parents to abort the fetus she was carrying for them -- then you've got a better imagination than I do. Let's run through the story quickly: Kelley had agreed to be a surrogate and was being paid $2,222 a month by the parents for her trouble. But an ultrasound scan of the fetus showed serious abnormalities. Fearing that the child would never lead a normal life -- whatever that may be -- the parents asked Kelley to abort. Although the surrogacy agreement contained a clause to this effect, Kelley refused. This is where things became, to put it charitably, unseemly. The parents offered Kelly an extra $10,000 to terminate the pregnancy. Although she said she was against abortion for religious and moral reasons, Kelley eventually thought she might be able to quash those ethical qualms if the parents paid her $15,000 -- $5,000 apparently being the difference between ""against"" and ""fine with it."" The parents refused, and Kelley says she regretted the offer. How to keep your surrogacy conflict-free . From there, events degenerated into the default American setting for dealing with any disagreement: legal proceedings. Ultimately, Kelley decided to have the child, who was born with severe medical conditions and lives with adoptive parents. Both Kelley and the parents who paid her to be a surrogate have been roundly criticized for their behavior -- let's be honest, no party haggling over the price of an abortion will ever win prizes for public morality. But in truth, neither Kelley nor the parents are to blame here. The problem stems from our conflicted understanding of what we mean when we say a woman has the right to choose what she does with her body. A woman's right to choose is, of course, the founding principle of the pro-choice movement and its valiant campaign to keep abortion safe and legal -- no matter, for now, that the legality of abortion mostly rests on physician-patient privacy. But as a principle, the right to choose doesn't just apply to abortion, it also underpins the ethics of surrogacy. The moment a woman isn't freely choosing to be a surrogate mother for someone else -- well, then we're into Victorian Gothic by way of ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and Ripley in ""Alien,"" and nobody really wants to go there. The idea of someone forcing a woman to bear their child against her will is horrifying. Of course, Kelley was not forced to be a surrogate. Indeed, she was being rather handsomely paid. Like most surrogates, she is not financially well-off; note the distinct lack of fully employed, millionaire surrogate mothers. The temptation is to imagine that it is the money that is morally significant. Kelley was being paid, right? So surely she is obliged to do what she is being paid to do? It's a basic capitalist principle: Money buys labor. There are terms and conditions, of course, but once agreed to, the labor must be carried out as agreed. A tempting view, but one which insists that you equate being pregnant with any other type of work, from shelf-stacking to brain surgery. This is, of course, nonsense. Pregnancy is something that only happens to women. The whole reason that we embrace the ethical principle of the right to choose is that it goes some way to ensuring that a woman's biology does not come to define her life in a way that would never happen to men. Surrogate mother: A new wrinkle in the abortion debate . It is a simple matter of justice: The right to choose goes a long way toward ensuring equal rights and opportunities for women. Turning pregnancy into work that can be bought and sold radically undermines that right. If we have any pretensions about defending a woman's right to choose, then we must defend that right even when, like Kelley, she chooses to change her mind. Even when, like Kelley, her reasoning doesn't always seem consistent. The alternative is that women's bodies can be packaged up like any other consumer good and sold off to the highest bidder. This might seem to leave parents who seek surrogacy in a difficult position. How can they be sure that their surrogate will not change her mind and have an abortion -- or, like Kelley, refuse to? The short and uncomfortable answer is that they cannot, although the vast, vast majority of surrogacies are completed to the satisfaction and delight of all sides. Those who seek surrogacy should understand that it is only possible because we believe in a woman's right to choose. I don't for a moment wish to underestimate the needs and desires of those couples, but I do think it is important for us to recognize that, as an ethical issue, a woman's right to control her body far outweighs anyone's rights to have the child they want. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dan O'Connor.","Dan O'Connor: Surrogate mom offered $10,000 to abort reveals our confused moral views .

"(CNN) -- Politicians are in plentiful supply this Memorial Day as the ramp-up to the 2012 presidential election begins in earnest. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who began a nationwide bus tour Sunday, generated plenty of buzz, visiting Fort McHenry in Baltimore and Mount Vernon in Virginia on Monday. She told CNN on Monday that she plans to take her ""One Nation"" bus tour to Iowa, the state that votes first in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. ""I'm sure at some point I will be going to Iowa,"" Palin said. The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee told reporters earlier on Monday she is ""still kind of contemplating"" a White House run. ""I think any Republican candidate is very, very electable,"" she said. ""I think Americans are ready for true change."" Palin's Memorial Day schedule was also expected to take her to the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. As of 5 p.m. ET she hadn't arrived yet, but more than 100 people were waiting, some for hours. Over the next few days, Palin's ""One Nation"" bus tour is also scheduled to make stops at historic sites in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, the latter home to the nation's first primary. ""This isn't a campaign bus,"" she said. ""This is a bus to be able to express to America how much we appreciate our foundation, and to invite more people to be interested in all that is good about America."" ""We don't need to fundamentally transform America,"" she added. ""We need to restore what's good about America."" Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who would compete with Palin for Tea Party support should she run, was attending Memorial Day events in New Hampshire. She has already hired staff in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina -- all key states that hold early caucuses or primaries. Bachmann has promised to make a presidential announcement during June in Waterloo, Iowa, the town where she was born. Former Minnesota Gov. and Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty, who announced his candidacy last week, was spending the day in Iowa, including a stop at a pancake breakfast in Waukee. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who is expected to announce his presidential bid on Thursday in New Hampshire, did not share his Memorial Day plans. He did release a statement, however, praising both veterans and current military service members. ""As we observe Memorial Day, we owe thanks to the many Americans who have fought and died to defend our country,"" Romney said. ""Those patriots who are on the battlefields today or have gone to battlefields in the past, some never to return, have left us a stronger country, a great nation that, whatever its divisions, shines as a beacon of liberty before the peoples of the world.""","Sarah Palin plans to go to Iowa .

"(CNN) -- A bill that seeks to increase prison sentences and extend parole terms in California for certain sex crimes against minors was passed in a unanimous vote by the state Senate on Tuesday. ""Chelsea's Law"" -- named after 17-year-old Chelsea King, who was raped and murdered by a convicted sex offender this year -- will go to the State Assembly next week for a vote. If it passes, it will go to the desk of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has already lent support to the legislation formally know as AB 1844. King disappeared February 25 during a jog in a suburban San Diego park, sparking a massive search that ended a few days later with the discovery of her body. Registered sex offender John Gardner pleaded guilty in April to killing her and another San Diego-area teen, Amber Dubois, in a deal that spared him the death penalty. The case set off a firestorm of debate over the management of sex offenders in California, with King's parents lending their voices to legislative efforts. ""The heartbreaking loss of Chelsea earlier this year revealed a broken public safety system, and it called our entire community and our entire state to action. With the King family's unwavering dedication and with the good faith of many who contributed to shaping this measure, we've built a solution that will protect children and spare other families from tragedy,"" Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher, the bill's sponsor, said in a statement. But Chelsea's Law also has its detractors. They argue it advocates a one-size-fits-all approach to punishing sexual offenses and that its fiscal implications are too much for the cash-strapped state to bear. Supporters of Chelsea's Law, which include California Attorney General Jerry Brown and U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, say it targets the worst of the worst with provisions such as one-strike life without parole sentencing and lifetime parole for certain sex offenses against children younger than 14. Among the crimes that could carry potential sentences of life without parole under the proposed legislation: rape, lewd and lascivious acts on a minor, continuous sexual abuse of a child that were committed during a kidnapping, first-degree burglary or that resulted in great bodily injury. Offenders could also face a true life sentence for inflicting ""aggravated mayhem or torture on the victim"" in the commission of the offense. The bill also requires lifetime parole and GPS supervision with no possibility of discharge for crimes including continuous sexual abuse of a child and certain sex crimes on children younger than 14. The proposed legislation also would make it a misdemeanor for a registered sex offender who committed a felony offense to enter any park where children regularly gather without written permission from a parole official or chief park official. It also calls for a revision of the California mentally disordered offender laws to provide for continued detention of offenders where evaluation and assessment deem such to be necessary. Critics of the bill call it a blanket approach that pushes sex offenders further to the fringes of society without addressing the root causes of sexual offenses. ""We need to seek solutions to this one shoe size fits all policy and target those who are of high risk to re-offend after being assessed by professionals in the field, as well focus our money and resources into prevention and awareness programs on sexual abuse, and preventing the first crime,"" said Mary Duval, CEO of the Sex Offender Solutions and Education Network, a nonprofit resource center on sex offender issues and a support network for registered sex offenders. A preliminary analysis of the bill by the state Legislative Analyst's Office completed earlier this year estimated it would increase state prison operating costs by ""at least a few tens of millions of dollars annually"" as a result of certain offenders remaining in prison for longer periods of time, resulting in a larger prison population. Parole operations might also be stretched to their limits, the study said. The analysis, noted, however, that a number of variables made the findings inconclusive, such as how often district attorneys would choose to prosecute crimes under Chelsea's Law or the possibility that the law could deter future criminal activity. ""The long-term nature of the fiscal impacts of some of the provisions of AB 1844 further means that our forecasts may not fully account for significant potential changes in prison operating costs and in the size of the population of sex offenders that could occur over time,"" the LAO said in a letter to Assemblyman Fletcher dated May 12. In an interview with CNN in May, Fletcher said the projected costs of the bill were relatively small compared with the the expense of maintaining a system that does not seem to be working. ""We've tried to create a narrowly focused bill that goes after the worst of the worst by improving upon sentencing laws and guidelines that already exist,"" he said. ""The first responsibility of government is public safetyand if we can't protect our children from violent sexual predators then nothing else matters. This has to be our priority.""","Bill calls for life without parole, lifetime GPS monitoring for certain crimes against minors .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- While nearly all maritime activity on the Potomac River will be halted on Inauguration Day, a handful of Mall-goers will sail from Virginia to Washington on water taxis. Some people will cross the Potomac River via water taxi on Inauguration Day. Working closely with the United States Coast Guard, the Potomac Riverboat Company, based in Alexandria, Virginia, plans to ferry up to 3,200 passengers from across the frigid Potomac on seven climate-controlled boats. The service is partially a response to the closure of all bridges from Virginia to D.C. on Inauguration Day, a measure that prompted an uproar among Virginia residents. According to maritime authorities in charge of the region, PRC is the only company being allowed to taxi across the river on the 20th. ""Because the taxi service provided us with a security plan that we examined and deemed adequate to provide good security, I granted them a waiver to operate at an increased security level,"" National Capitol Region Port Captain Brian Kelley says. ""The taxis are going to operate on a strict schedule and a strict route."" The Coast Guard established a temporary security zone on waterways in the National Capitol Region, stepping up restrictions day-by-day leading up to 11 p.m. on January 19. At that point, all vessels must be docked and only boats with an approved sail plan will be allowed to operate. John Lake, a ship captain and the general manager of the company, said the sail plan he submitted was approved only a week ago and details nearly every move taxis will make. ""All the departures are scheduled times. And those departures are supposed to leave on-time,"" Lake said. ""We have to call in on each departure to the Coast Guard, let them know we're preparing to get under way, and get the permission, basically, to get under way."" The boats depart the Alexandria Marina for the 40-minute trip beginning around 6 a.m. and must be docked on the southwest D.C. shore by 10 a.m. From there, it's a cold, mile-long walk to the Mall, so Lake has some advice for passengers. ""Show up early to get through the security check and dress warm,"" he said. ""It's going to be nice and toasty on the boat, but not so much outside."" Return trips, tentatively scheduled for around 6 p.m., are not allowed to depart D.C. until after the inaugural parade events have concluded and President Obama is secured. In keeping with the Coast Guard's security measures, Lake says all passengers must arrive at least an hour early for a full screening. Passengers that want to stay in D.C. after the early evening departures will have to find other transport back across the Potomac. PRC Vice President Charlotte Hall says tickets went on sale Monday and the initial response from customers has been enthusiastic.","Up to 3,200 passengers to be taken across Potomac on seven boats .

"(CNN) -- The former JetBlue flight attendant who soared to instant celebrity after deploying an emergency evacuation slide to dramatically exit an airplane in 2010 has been sentenced to a year of probation after completing a mental health treatment program. In accordance with a plea deal reached in Queens Supreme Court in October 2010, Steven Slater withdrew his guilty plea on Wednesday to a felony charge of attempted second-degree criminal mischief and will serve a year of probation on a misdemeanor charge of attempted fourth-degree criminal mischief, according to a news release from the Queens County district attorney's office. Slater, 39, must still pay $10,000 in restitution to JetBlue, the price of repairing or replacing the emergency evacuation chute. He made an initial payment of $500 and must continue to shell out $831.25 each month, the release said. Slater faced up to four years in prison for the felony charge and up to six months in jail for the misdemeanor charge, the release said. Instead, he underwent a year of court-ordered treatment through the Queens Mental Health Court. ""It's great to see that there is an alternate to hard time for cases that, in my mind, don't necessarily merit hard time,"" Slater told CNN. ""This was a good alternative.""

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Armed gunmen hijacked a Japanese freighter and its 23-member crew off the coast of Somalia, South Korean officials said Sunday. Somalia, which has had no functioning government since 1991, is the world's top piracy hotspot. Also a Russian patrol ship was able to thwart a hijack attempt on a Saudi Arabian vessel, a spokesman said Sunday. The 20,000-ton Japanese cargo ship was seized 96 miles (154 km) east of the Gulf of Aden on Saturday, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said, quoting the country's foreign ministry. Among the crew members, five are South Korean and 18 are from the Philippines, the ministry said. ""It was not yet learned who the hijackers are and whether the crewmen are safe,"" the ministry official told Yonhap. The Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, has become a treacherous stretch for ships, particularly along Somalia's coast. According to Noel Choong of the International Maritime Bureau, which tracks piracy attacks, there have been more than 84 attacks and 33 successful hijackings off Somalia's coast this year. The hijacking came as the Korean government is considering sending a warship to join those from some other countries to combat piracy in the area. Meanwhile, a Russian naval spokesman confirmed reports that a Russian patrol ship thwarted the attempted seizure of a Saudi Arabian ship in the Gulf of Aden. The spokesman said the Russian ship was escorting a convoy when a Saudi ship in the convoy was attacked by gunmen on speed boats. An anti-terror team from the Russian ship prevented the seizure and the gunmen fled, the spokesman said.","Japanese ship carrying 23 crew, including five South Koreans and 18 Filipinos .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods won his first golf tournament in more than two years, narrowly defeating fellow American Zach Johnson to capture the Chevron World Challenge title Sunday. Woods finished three strokes under par for the day, allowing him to leapfrog Johnson for the one-stroke win at the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California, according to the PGA Tour's website. The victory was the 35-year-old golfer's first since capturing the Australian Masters title in November 2009. ""It feels awesome,"" said Woods on his official website, tigerwoods.com. ""It was a lot of fun coming down the stretch."" The five-time winner was one stroke behind Johnson going up the 17th, before he birdied the final two holes -- including a 16-foot putt at 17 -- to clinch the title. ""If I don't make that putt it's in Zach's control,"" Woods said. ""That putt was huge."" Despite the disappointing finish, Johnson was quick to pay tribute to his rival. ""He made two great putts,"" he said, in quotes carried by tigerwoods.com. ""You just tip your hat. I'm proud of how I handled the situation and continued to fight."" Woods the hero as United States retain Presidents Cup . There were 18 players total in the Chevron field, far fewer than in more traditional tournaments. Even so, the PGA Tour website noted that Woods moved up 20 spots in the Official World Golf Ranking with the win. Woods had reigned as golf's No. 1 for a record 623 weeks between 1997 and 2010, until his career stalled amid a slew of injuries and well-publicized reports of affairs that led to the end of his marriage. In October, he dropped out of the world's top 50 for the first time in 15 years. The PGA Tour's 2012 ""regular season"" schedule officially begins the first week in January at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions at Kapalua, Hawaii. In April, Woods likely will be among those battling in the season's first major, The Masters, which he has won four times.","Woods narrowly beats Zach Johnson to win the Chevron World Challenge .

"(CNN) -- He may not have won a tournament in almost two years, but Tiger Woods can still be a major force in golf according to his new high-profile sponsor. Woods lost some major backers in the wake of the scandal about his marital infidelities, including Tag Heuer. But another high-end watch-maker, Rolex, has taken on the fallen former world No. 1. ""Rolex is convinced that Tiger Woods still has a long career ahead of him and that he has all the qualities required to continue to mark the history of golf,"" read a statement on Wednesday from the Swiss company, which also sponsors CNN's Living Golf Show. ""This association pays tribute to the exceptional nature of Tiger Woods and the leading role he plays in forging the sport's global appeal."" Rolex has a history of linking with golfing greats, including 18-time major champion Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. It is the second backing for Woods' commercial value in two days, with influential business magazine Forbes keeping the 14-time major winner at the top of its ""most valuable athlete"" standings with a brand worth of $55 million. It cited his June deal with Japanese medical group Kowa as evidence that he was far from a spent force. Woods dropped out of the world's top 50 this week ahead of the PGA Tour's fall season Frys.com Open -- a minor tournament that he has never played before. He has not stepped out for an official event since the PGA Championship in August, but will make his ninth start of an injury-plagued season as he warms up for the Presidents Cup in Australia next month -- having been given a wild-card place by U.S. team captain Fred Couples. ""I'm excited to be back. I've had good practice sessions at home and am eager to get back under the gun,"" Woods said ahead of the California tournament. Woods' website said he shot a course-record 10-under-par 62 last Saturday at his new home course in Jupiter, Florida -- the Greg Norman-designed Medalist Club. He will play the opening rounds at CordeValle Golf Club, near San Jose, with 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa and U.S. amateur Patrick Cantlay on Thursday and Friday.","Tiger Woods signs new endorsement deal with Swiss watch-maker Rolex .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods overtook Jack Nicklaus for second place on the all-time PGA Tour list as he claimed the AT&T National at Congressional Sunday. It was his 74th victory and he needs eight more to draw level with Sam Snead. The two-shot win over nearest challenger Bo Van Pelt also leaves him in fine fettle heading into the third major of the season at Royal Lytham and St Annes later this month. Woods is four short of leader Nicklaus on that all-time list but has not won a major since the 2008 U.S. Open after his career stalled through injury and well chronicled problems in his personal life. In extra preparation for his tilt at a 15th major at Lytham, Woods has added the Greenbrier Classic, which starts Thursday, to his schedule. The Greenbrier course in West Virginia is closely associated with Snead, who lived in the area and Woods said he was ""excited"" about the prospect of claiming a fourth win this season to draw nearer to the legendary golfer. Tiger gives chase at storm-hit Congressional . But then he will hone his preparations for Lytham and told gathered reporters after his Congressional win that he faced a testing challenge on the seaside links in northern England. ""I will be practicing some different shots, I will need to hit the ball a bit lower, more flighted,"" he said. But after his final round two-under 69 at Congressional for an eight-under 276 total, Woods was in buoyant and defiant mood. ""What an incredible week,"" he said. ""I remember there was a time, about six months ago, when people were saying I could never win again."" Victories at Bay Hill and Muirfield Village ended that long drought and his game held up well under pressure after a storm-hit AT&T, which had to be played Saturday without spectators because of safety fears. ""Yesterday was a silent day, but I think everyone saved it up for today,"" said Woods, who had the added pressure of being the tournament host in Maryland. Van Pelt, who mounted a stiff challenge, is in no doubt that Woods is back to his formidable best. ""I think he's the only guy to win three tournaments on tour this year -- on three different golf courses,"" Van Pelt said. ""And he was leading the US Open after two days. So I'd say that he's playing the best golf in the world right now.""

"(CNN) -- Amanda Knox will wake up at home in Seattle on Wednesday for the first time in four years as she enjoys her new-found freedom after an Italian appeals court threw out her murder conviction. Knox and her family arrived on a British Airways flight Tuesday evening. ""I'm really overwhelmed right now,"" a tearful Knox told cheering supporters at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. ""I was looking down from the airplane, and it seemed like everything wasn't real."" ""What's important for me to say is just thank you, to everyone who has believed in me, who has defended me, who has supported my family,"" she said, her voice shaking. Being with her family, she said, is ""the most important thing to me right now."" ""Thank you for being there for me,"" she said. Before beginning her remarks, Knox smiled and said, ""They're reminding me to speak in English, because I'm having problems with that."" An Italian appeals court on Monday overturned Knox's murder conviction in the 2007 death of her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher. Knox initially was sentenced to 26 years in prison. Knox's mother and stepfather, Edda and Chris Mellas, also thanked those who have supported their family, as well as the Italian attorneys who fought on her behalf. ""Meredith was Amanda's friend,"" said Philadelphia attorney Theodore Simon, who spoke at the news conference. Knox wants the Kercher family to be remembered, Simon said as Knox nodded and appeared to fight tears. Ahead of her arrival, Knox supporters in Seattle said they planned a rousing welcome. ""To Amanda herself, we say, 'Way to go, kid,' "" Tom Wright, founder of the group Friends of Amanda Knox, said Monday night. Knox was convicted in 2009 of murder, sexual assault, possession of a weapon, interfering with a crime and theft. The jury cleared Knox of those charges, freeing her. The court also cleared her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito. But the jury Monday upheld her conviction on the charge of defamation against Patrick Lumumba, whom Knox accused of killing Kercher. Lumumba was arrested, but released after his alibi checked out. He later sued Knox, winning 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages. Knox was sentenced Monday to three years on the defamation charge, but received credit for the years she spent behind bars, her attorney said. A third person, drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted separately of involvement in the killing and is serving 16 years. Defense teams for Knox and Sollecito have suggested Guede could have been the sole killer. CNN's Josh Levs and Sandra Endo contributed to this report.","Amanda Knox returns home after four years .

"(CNN) -- Lance Armstrong's attorney denied his client was in discussion with the U.S. or world anti-doping agencies following a report by The New York Times that the disgraced cycling icon was contemplating publicly admitting he used illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Attorney Tim Herman in an email to CNN Sports late Friday did not address whether Armstrong told associates -- as reported by the newspaper -- that he was considering the admission as a way to restore his athletic eligibility. Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life last year after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency found there was overwhelming evidence that he was directly involved in a sophisticated doping program. Silence falls as Austin awaits Armstrong's 'last word' Armstrong has repeatedly and vehemently denied that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs as well as illegal blood transfusions during his cycling career. In the past, Armstrong has argued that he took more than 500 drug tests and never failed. In its 202-page report that detailed Armstrong's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions, the USADA said it had tested Armstrong less than 60 times and the International Cycling Union conducted about 215 tests. The agency did not say that Armstrong ever failed a test, but his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided the tests altogether. The New York Times, citing unnamed associates and anti-doping officials, said Armstrong has been in discussions with USADA officials and hopes to meet with David Howman chief of the World Anti-Doping Agency. The newspaper said none of the people with knowledge of Armstrong's situation wanted to be identified because it would jeopardize their access to information on the matter. Under World Anti-Doping Agency rules, an athlete who confesses to using performance-enhancing drugs may be eligible for a reinstatement. Armstrong has been an icon for his cycling feats and celebrity, bringing more status to a sport wildly popular in some nations but lacking big-name recognition, big money and mass appeal in the United States. He fought back from testicular cancer to win the Tour from 1999 to 2005. He raised millions via his Lance Armstrong Foundation to help cancer victims and survivors, an effort illustrated by trendy yellow ""LiveSTRONG"" wristbands that helped bring in the money. The cyclist's one-time high-profile relationship with singer Sheryl Crow also kept him in the public eye. But Armstrong has long been dogged by doping allegations, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after failing a drug test -- making a series of claims in 2011. Armstrong sued the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency last year to stop its investigation of him, arguing it did not have the right to prosecute him. But after a federal judge dismissed the case, Armstrong said he would no longer participate in the investigation. In October 2012, Armstrong was stripped of his titles and banned. Weeks later, he stepped down from the board of his foundation, Livestrong. It is unclear whether Armstrong would face criminal prosecution for perjury should he confess. Armstrong was involved in several cases where he gave sworn testimony that he never used banned drugs. Armstrong and his publicist did not immediately respond to a CNN requests late Friday and early Saturday for comment on The New York Times report.

"(CNN) -- Amanda Knox has signed a deal with HarperCollins to write a memoir about her trial, conviction and acquittal for murder in Italy, the publisher said Friday. The book, based in part on journals she kept, will give never-before heard details about her ""harrowing experience"" while in custody there, HarperCollins said. ""For the very first time since her trial for murder, her four-year incarceration in Perugia, Italy, and her appeal and acquittal of all charges, Amanda Knox will share the truth about her terrifying ordeal,"" the publisher said in a statement. ""Knox will give a full and unflinching account of the events that led to her arrest in Perugia and her struggles with the complexities of the Italian judicial system."" The memoir will show how Knox drew on her inner strength and strong family ties to cope with the challenge, the statement adds. Jonathan Burnham, who negotiated the deal for Harper Collins, is quoted as saying: ""Many accounts have been written of the Amanda Knox case, and countless writers and reporters have speculated on what role, if any, was played by Knox in that tragic and terrifying sequence of events. Italian prosecutors appeal Knox decision . ""No one has yet heard Amanda Knox's own account of what happened, and this book will give Knox an opportunity to tell the story in full detail, for the first time."" The deal comes after prosecutors in Italy lodged an appeal Tuesday of the acquittal of Knox, now 24, and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher. Knox was 20 and Kercher was 21 when the two shared a home as they studied at the university for foreign students in Perugia, Italy. Kercher's semi-naked body was found in November 2007 at the home, with her throat slashed. The case has gripped the attention of the public in the United States, Italy and Britain ever since. The filing of the appeal of her acquittal raised the question of whether an arrest warrant or extradition order could be issued for Knox if her acquittal is annulled, or if she could be made to serve the remainder of her initial 26-year prison term. But Knox's family said in a statement issued through a spokesman that the prosecutors' appeal was unwelcome, but no cause for concern. Knox is herself currently appealing her conviction for defaming Patrick Lumumba, a club owner whom she falsely accused of killing Kercher. CNN's Matthew Chance and Mark Norman contributed to this report.","NEW: Publisher: ""This book will give Knox an opportunity to tell her story for the first time""

"Editor's note: How would you rate President Obama's first 100 days? You'll get a chance to make your opinion known at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday on the CNN National Report Card. The Obamas enjoy their new family dog, Bo, at the White House. (CNN) -- Heather Ferreira works in the slums of Mumbai, India, where she has watched thousands of women live under a ""curse."" The women she meets in the squalid streets where ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was filmed are often treated with contempt, she says. They're considered ugly if their skin and hair are too dark. They are deemed ""cursed"" if they only have daughters. Many would-be mothers even abort their children if they learn they're female. Yet lately she says Indian women are getting another message from the emergence of another woman thousands of miles away. This woman has dark skin and hair. She walks next to her husband in public, not behind. And she has two daughters. But no one calls her cursed. They call her Michelle Obama, the first lady. ""She could be a new face for India,"" says Ferreira, program officer for an HIV-prevention program run by World Vision, an international humanitarian group. ""She shows women that it's OK to have dark skin and to not have a son. She's quite real to us."" Those who focus on Michelle Obama's impact on America are underestimating her reach. The first lady is inspiring women of color around the globe to look at themselves, and America, in fresh ways.  See photos of past first ladies » . ""She might be the first woman of color that females in male-dominated countries have seen as confident, bright, educated, articulate and persuasive,"" says Barbara Perry, author of ""Jacqueline Kennedy: First Lady of the New Frontier."" A symbol for women around the globe . The notion of a woman being a first in anything is alien in many parts of the world. Millions of women struggle against sexual violence, discrimination and poverty, several women activists say. But Michelle Obama offers a personal rebuke to that message. Her personal story -- born into a blue-collar family; overcoming racism and once even making more money than her husband -- makes her a mesmerizing figure to women across the globe, says Susan M. Reverby, a professor of women's studies at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Reverby says this is the first time many women have seen their class and color reflected in America's first lady.  Watch how Michelle Obama has done during her first 100 days » . ""This is someone who appeals across the usual divides,"" Reverby says. ""She is a celebrity you can imagine being, not a celebrity you have to watch from afar."" A hint of Michelle Obama's global appeal came recently when she spoke at an all-girls school in London, England. The students came from various backgrounds: Muslim, Christian, black and white. Yet they all surged forward, shrieking and even crying, as they hugged the first lady. Thu Nguyen, a native of Vietnam, wasn't at the London school, but she experienced a similar sense of elation when Obama became first lady. In her native country, she says women ""are not human beings."" But when Obama became the first lady, Nguyen called her niece and told her that any hard-working woman could become the first. Vietnamese women can identify with Michelle Obama, Nguyen says. ""We have a yellow color because we're Asian, so we felt a bond with [Michelle] Obama when she became the first black first lady,"" says Nguyen, who works at a nail salon in South Pasadena, California. Some women's identification with the first lady, however, goes deeper than skin color. Sue Mbaya of Nairobi, Kenya, says the first lady inspires African woman to assert themselves in their personal and professional lives. Many African women are conditioned to be subservient, she says. They're prevented from rising to management positions in the workplace, and their families often relegate them to taking care of household tasks while sending their brothers off to school. But Obama is a high achiever who didn't intimidate her husband, says Mbaya, a native of Zimbabwe who is the advocacy director for World Vision's Africa's region. ""I've always liked knowing that she was Barack Obama's supervisor when they first met,"" Mbaya says. ""He once said that he wouldn't be where he is without his wife. That really appeals to me."" Women in the West also find inspiration in Obama. Christine Louise Hohlbaum, who lives near Munich, Germany, says the first lady impresses German women because she is a powerful public figure who doesn't seem threatening. German history is marked by charismatic leaders who wielded personal power for malevolent ends, she says. ""She's the perfect blend of power and civility. That's important in German culture,"" says Hohlbaum, author of ""The Power of Slow: 101 Ways to Save Time in Our 24/7 World."" How does Michelle Obama define herself? While other women have defined Obama's appeal, the first lady is refining her role. She has talked publicly about the pressures military families face. She has encouraged healthy eating by planting a White House garden. She's opened the White House to ordinary people and children. Service to community and family seems to be her theme. She recently drew the most attention for what she did, not said, during a visit to London. She briefly embraced Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, breaking royal protocol. The Queen, however, according to press accounts, responded warmly to the first lady's embrace. Obama has often been compared to another regal woman: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But Autumn Stephens, author of ""Feisty First Ladies,"" says that Obama reminds her more of former first lady Hillary Clinton. ""But Hillary really downplayed the mom part, whereas Michelle has really played it up,"" Stephens says. ""She is straddling both worlds."" In a poll of first ladies, certain women are invariably cited by historians as the most noteworthy: Abigail Adams, Lady Bird Johnson and Eleanor Roosevelt, who is widely considered to be the most influential first lady, Stephens says. Where would Stephens rank Michelle Obama? ""She's got the whole package,"" Stephens says. ""She's in a class by herself.""","Michelle Obama inspires women of color around the globe .

"Rome (CNN) -- The jury that cleared American student Amanda Knox of murder did so for lack of evidence proving she was guilty, the judge in the case said in legal paperwork published Thursday. ""Even taken all together,"" the prosecution's evidence does not ""prove in any way the guilt of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for the crime of"" killing British student Meredith Kercher, the judge wrote. Prosecutors will probably appeal the acquittal, prosecutor Giuliano Mignini told CNN on Thursday. Either side can appeal a conviction in Italy, but appeals cannot be filed before the judge publishes the jury's reasoning for its verdict. An appeal in the Knox case would be on narrow technical grounds only and would probably take a day or two. It is unlikely Knox would return to Italy from the United States for the appeal. Knox and Sollecito were convicted of murder in 2009 but cleared on appeal in October. Knox was 20 and Kercher was 21, studying at the university for foreign students in Perugia, Italy, when Kercher's semi-naked body was found November 2007 in the house they shared. Her throat had been slashed. Sollecito, 23 at the time, was Knox's boyfriend, studying computer science at another university in Perugia. The case gripped the attention of the public in the United States, Italy and Kercher's native Britain, where the tabloid press portrayed the defendant as femme fatale ""Foxy Knoxy."" A third man, Ivorian drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted separately of the killing. Guede admitted having sexual relations with Kercher but denied killing her. Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman said in the paperwork published Thursday that it was not up to the jury to reconstruct what had happened. ""What matters in reaching the ruling is only the lack of proof of guilt of the two defendants,"" he wrote. The jury was apparently convinced by a determined defense effort to discredit DNA evidence that played a role in the 2009 conviction. Knox's attorney, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said he was ""fully satisfied"" with the judge's report, known in Italian as a motivazione, or motivation. ""We've always said that there was no evidence, that the first court ruling was based on probabilities and not facts,"" Dalla Vedova said. ""The first ruling was a mistake, which has now been corrected, so we are very satisfied with it."" Knox's family issued a brief statement Thursday saying the paperwork affirms ""that Amanda had absolutely nothing to do with the tragic and terrible murder of Meredith Kercher."" ""Amanda and we are satisfied with the motivations and take heart in the strength of the judge's words and proclamation of her innocence,"" the family said in the statement.

"(CNN) -- The state of Arizona executed convicted killer Jeffrey Landrigan late Tuesday after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the lethal injection, a corrections official said. The execution was carried out at 10:26 p.m. (12:26 a.m. ET), said Barrett Marson, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Corrections. ""I'd like to say 'thank you' to my family for being here and all of my friends,"" were Landrigan's final words, according to Marson. He concluded with ""Boomer Sooner,"" a cheer often used by University of Oklahoma fans. Landrigan's last meal consisted of steak, fried okra, french fries, strawberry ice cream and a Dr. Pepper, Marson said. The way for the execution was cleared after a majority of Supreme Court justices moved to vacate a federal judge's order that had temporarily stopped the execution scheduled for earlier in the day. In a 5-4 decision, the court overturned two lower court rulings. Earlier Tuesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had sided with U.S. District Court Judge Roslyn Silver, who blocked Landrigan's execution 18 hours before it was set to happen at noon MT Tuesday (2 p.m. ET). Landrigan's attorneys filed a civil rights complaint last Thursday alleging the planned execution violated his constitutional rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment and to due process. On Monday, Silver issued the temporary stay after concluding that the state did not provide Landrigan's side enough information to make its case sufficiently about the safety and legality of substances that would have been used to kill him. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruling vacated the lower court order, saying ""there is no evidence in the record to suggest that the drug obtained from a foreign source is unsafe."" Judge Silver wrote that she ""was left to speculate"" that the drug was harmful, but in a statement the Supreme Court, citing a different 1993 ruling, concluded in a one-page order that sentiment should not equate to the fact it was ""sure or likely to cause serious illness or needless suffering."" ""There was no showing that the drug was unlawfully obtained, nor was there an offer of proof to that effect,"" the Supreme Court ruling said. The decision to vacate the order was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor sided with Silver and would not have vacated the ruling. In 1989, Landrigan escaped from an Oklahoma prison, where he was serving time for second-degree murder. He was convicted of strangling Chester Dean Dyer in Arizona a year later during an armed burglary, and a trial judge sentenced him to death.

"Washington (CNN) -- Washington Wizards point guard Gilbert Arenas has been charged with a felony gun violation after admitting he drew guns in the team locker room in a highly publicized December 21 incident. Arenas was charged with one count of carrying a pistol without a license, according to court documents filed Thursday. ""We are aware of the charge filed against Gilbert Arenas today and will continue to follow the ongoing legal process very carefully,"" the team said. ""We will also cooperate fully with the proper authorities and the NBA."" The team said it would have no further comment beyond their previous statements on ""this serious and unfortunate matter."" A hearing is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. Friday in Superior Court in Washington before Judge Robert E. Morin. There was no immediate comment from his attorney, Kenneth L. Wainstein. It wasn't immediately clear when Arenas, who has been indefinitely suspended from the NBA, would be arraigned on the charge. The document that describes the charge is called an ""information,"" which is filed when a plea agreement has been reached. A basketball source familiar with the investigation said the Wizards have been informed that Arenas has reached a plea agreement with prosecutors. The team has been told by Arenas' legal circle that the agreement does not involve jail time, the source said. Arenas' indefinite suspension remains in effect until a separate NBA investigation is complete and Commissioner David Stern reaches a decision, the source said. The league investigation, which had been on hold at the request of federal prosecutors, will now resume, the source said. Arenas described the incident as ""a misguided effort to play a joke on a teammate"" in a statement released earlier this month. ""Contrary to some press accounts, I never threatened or assaulted anyone with the guns and never pointed them at anyone. Joke or not, I now recognize that what I did was a mistake and was wrong."" Citing NBA sources, the New York Post reported in December that Arenas and Javaris Crittenton both brandished firearms in the team's locker room. Crittenton's agent, Mark Bartelstein, said his client ""hasn't done anything wrong. I'm extremely confident he'll be exonerated."" Asked if Crittenton brought a gun into the Verizon Center that day, Bartelstein said, ""I'm not going to get into details."" He said Crittenton has not met with authorities, nor has such a meeting been requested or scheduled. Arenas, a three-time NBA All-Star, spent January 15 in a voluntary meeting with federal prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington and with District of Columbia metropolitan police, according to his attorney. Arenas said he told authorities he stored four unloaded guns in his locker at the Verizon Center to keep them away from his children. ""I brought them without any ammunition into the District of Columbia, mistakenly believing that the recent change in the D.C. gun laws allowed a person to store unloaded guns in the District,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Now that President Obama has set the timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq, the debate has begun over its possible consequences. U.S. troops secure a street in in the southern Dura district of Baghdad, Iraq, this week. Does it provide enough time for Iraqis to forge a functioning government and an economy that benefits everyone? And if it doesn't, could a civil war be the result? The plan, as outlined in a February 27 speech by Obama, calls for most U.S. troops to leave Iraq by August 2010. A ""transitional force"" of 35,000 to 50,000 troops will remain in the country to assist Iraqi security forces, protect Americans and fight terrorism, Obama said. Track Obama's First 100 Days . All troops will be withdrawn by the end of 2011, a date established last year by the Bush administration and the Iraqi government. Another condition of that agreement requires U.S. troops leave Iraqi cities by June 30 this year. Obama's plan is predicated on a relative decrease in violence in Iraq and the belief that Iraqis are increasingly becoming more capable of ensuring security.  Watch Iraqi reaction to Obama's plan » . With the exception of February 2009, Iraqi civilian deaths have been steadily dropping since the fall of 2007, according to statistics compiled by an Iraqi Interior Ministry official. U.S. military casualties in Iraq have also generally decreased when compared to 2006 through 2007. Casualties: The names and faces who've fallen . The U.S. military attributes the decrease in violence to three main factors: the so-called ""surge"" of U.S. troops, implemented at the beginning of 2007; the Sunni ""Awakening"" movements, in which local communities turned against al Qaeda in Iraq; and the ceasefire announced by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Yet, it's very much a question whether the disparate Iraqi groups and communities used that decrease in violence to work toward settling some thorny issues, Iraqi experts and observers said. ""The surge failed,"" Thomas Ricks, the longtime Washington Post correspondent, said during a CNN interview on February 20. Ricks has written two books about the Iraq war: ""Fiasco"" and the recently published, ""The Gamble."" ""Its purpose was to lead to a political breakthrough. It improved security but didn't achieve that larger purpose. And because of that, none of the basic questions in Iraq have been addressed."" Ricks said those questions include the final form of the Iraqi government, the relationship between the main sectarian groups and how oil revenue will be shared by them. The political question . In Iraq, the year began with a round of provincial elections and will end with parliamentary elections. In between are a host of other important political events and other elections that will shape Iraq's future. ""This is the critical year of decisions for Iraqis. What direction do they want to go?"" said J. Scott Carpenter, an expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He served in the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and the State Department. An important decision yet to be made is the form of the Iraqi government. Will it be a strong, central government, or will it be a loose confederation that will parcel out power to its various provinces and regions? Carpenter said the results from the provincial elections indicated the Iraqis preferred the former. ""They said very, very clearly 'we're tired of the sectarian nonsense. We want services delivered. We want a government that functions. We're Iraqi, first and foremost.'"" The stakes, however, were low in the provincial elections; the provinces have little money to spend and not much power to exercise, Carpenter said. ""That's not going to be the case in the parliamentary elections,"" he predicted. ""The question is whether or not you can have national parliamentary elections in which real competition takes place and at the end of the day, whoever loses those elections accepts those results."" It is that prospect -- an embittered, defeated group that turns to violence to achieve what they couldn't in the electoral process -- that is unnerving. And there are a range of possibilities that could result in such a situation, experts say. The sectarian question . The war has fundamentally altered Iraq's political structure, with the Shiites emerging as the governing political class, Carpenter said. ""That has been a huge thing for the Sunni minority to swallow. So, the digestion is going to take some time."" Sunni Iraqis, especially in volatile areas such as Anbar province, will have to be incorporated into the political dialogue and provided jobs, experts say. Meanwhile, the Kurdish-Arab relationship is worsening, observers say. ""During the years of warfare between Sunni and Shiite Arabs, the Kurdish issue lay dormant. But now, it has roared back to the forefront,"" Michael O'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack, Iraq experts at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a New York Times op-ed published February 26. The issues do not involve sectarian hatred but ""the cold, hard issues of land and oil and cash, as well as the distribution of power between Iraq's center and its regions and provinces,"" they wrote. The Kurds, who have long sought to establish a state, have operated with relative autonomy for the past few years. They also hold oil-rich regions in the northern parts of Iraq. A law detailing how oil revenue would be shared between the different groups has yet to be formally agreed on, further contributing to political tension. ""There are oil revenue sharing mechanisms in place. It's that they don't have the sanction of law which is what the Kurds desperately want,"" Carpenter said. Observers say that accommodating the interests of these various groups while assuaging their fears has been and will be a considerable challenge. ""The Kurds have ambitions of their own. The Sunnis have needs of their own. The Shiites have divisions of their own,"" said Simon Serfaty of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The reconciliation of those communities and the willingness to live within a single unit is still in question."" There are many other questions when it comes to Iraq: What to do with the 4 million refugees displaced to some neighboring countries? Is Muqtada al Sadr sincere in his ceasefire or is he waiting for the U.S. troops to leave before he acts? What about the many Iraqis being held by coalition forces? Are the Iraq security forces truly ready to take the lead? See map of Obama's global challenges . With such questions in mind, observers and lawmakers voice a range of opinions on the impact of the ""surge"" and Obama's policy to withdraw troops. Some say they are confident that Iraq is edging toward stability; others are not as confident. ""There are still people who predict Iraq will have a civil war, that all the surge did was kick the can down the road a couple of years. Whether that's true or not, we don't know,"" said Ricks, the author. Carpenter, who describes himself as an ""inveterate optimist"" when it comes to Iraq, says he is hopeful for a positive outcome. ""Most of these groups and these leaders have looked into the abyss and not seen what they wanted to see, so have a reason for accommodation,"" he said. ""Time is the critical factor, time for accommodation and time for political deals."" Whether the 19 months of time provided by the Obama timeline is enough might be the most important question of them all.

"(CNN) -- A controversial bill that California legislators say would allow the early release of more than 27,000 inmates from crowded prisons will be taken up by the state Assembly on Monday. Inmates at Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, California, interact in a gym modified to house them in August 2007. The Senate on Thursday passed the corrections package 21-19, after Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, assured senators the changes would protect the public from the most violent offenders. The legislation also would direct more resources toward parolees, he said. Senate Republicans say the bill would undermine public safety. All 15 Senate Republicans voted against the measure. Both houses of the legislature are controlled by Democrats. Consideration of the bill comes as California faces a mid-September deadline for reducing its prison population by about 40,000 inmates. A special panel of three federal judges issued the order, contending the crowded prison system violates prisoners' constitutional rights. The judges said they will make the reductions themselves if the state fails to act. The measure would save the financially strapped state $524.5 million, according to a statement from Steinberg's office. When coupled with budget revisions that lawmakers made in July, the total corrections savings would be $1.2 billion, he said. That is the amount that Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger wants as part of his efforts to cut state spending and balance the budget. Republicans said the bill would lead to the release of about 27,000 prisoners, while Democrats estimated it would reduce the prison population by 27,300 in the 2009-10 fiscal year and 37,000 during fiscal year 2010-11. ""It is undeniable that the real failure of our criminal justice system is that it fails to distinguish between violent offenders and nonviolent offenders,"" Steinberg said. ""Of course, we want to keep violent criminals off our streets and out of our communities, and this reform package is a necessary step to do that because it concentrates our incarceration efforts on the violent criminals and ensures that nonviolent offenders have more contact with parole officers,"" he said. Some nonviolent offenders could serve shorter sentences. According to Steinberg, each parole officer in California is responsible for about 70 parolees, many of whom recommit crimes and go back to jail. If the legislation is passed, the ratio would be reduced to 45 to 1, he said. ""They [parole officers] cannot adequately supervise those who are the most at risk and those who are the most risk to the public safety,"" Steinberg said. With a lesser workload, the officers also can make more home visits and arrange more meetings with the people they supervise, the lawmaker said. Senate Republicans called the legislation a threat to public safety. ""Among the inmates who could be eligible for early release under the Democrat plan include felons convicted of human trafficking, stalking, identity theft, violent child abuse and threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction,"" the Republican Caucus said in a written statement. ""Unfortunately, this proposal exploits a fiscal crisis in order to advance a dangerous liberal agenda that seeks to undo successful anti-crime laws,"" said Senate Republican Leader Dennis Hollingsworth of Murrieta. GOP lawmakers in the Senate also strongly opposed the creation of what they described as ""an unelected and unaccountable sentencing commission that would be given broad authority to alter important public safety laws."" The legislation would establish a 16-member Sentencing Commission that would put in place new sentencing guidelines by July 1, 2012. Unless vetoed by the legislature and governor, the guidelines would become effective January 1, 2013. The 13 voting members of the commission would include the chief justice of the California Supreme Court, a judge appointed by the chief justice, the state public defender and the secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. A crime victim would be among the three ex-officio members. California Assembly Speaker Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles, issued a statement early Friday morning, explaining that the assembly recessed around midnight and will reconvene Monday. On Thursday and into Friday morning, she said in the statement, ""we have been taking into account many of the concerns raised by law enforcement, and are working toward a bill that the people of California can agree makes sense,"" and that process will continue through the weekend. ""Our target remains a responsible approach that will achieve our public safety and budgetary goals, and allow us to prevent the wholesale release of prisoners by federal judges."" ""Relieving prison overcrowding and reducing recidivism are monumental challenges, but they are challenges that we will not retreat from,"" Schwarzenegger told an audience of prosecutors in June. California has a 70 percent recidivism rate.","California Senate OKs bill to allow early release of 27,000 inmates .

"(CNN)  -- Judging by the hysterical reaction in some quarters, to President Obama's handshake with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, or his bow to Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, you would think that America's national security rested solely on body language not sound policy. The presidential handshake between Barack Obama and Hugo Chavez spurred many comments. But just for the record, let's not forget that President George W. Bush kissed and held hands with the same Abdullah after 9/11, while also looking deep into the soul of Vladimir Putin. And a generation earlier, egged on by British Prime Minister ""Iron Lady"" Margaret Thatcher, President ""Tear Down That Wall"" Ronald Reagan, decided that indeed Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was a man he could do business with: the business of ending the Cold War. While Obama has not managed in 100 days to defeat Islamic militants, usher in a Middle East peace treaty or disarm North Korea, on these and other issues he has laid down some important groundwork. Most importantly, the global polls following his first overseas trip show he has begun restoring America's name and reputation, key ingredients to successful policy making. Even before stepping onto foreign soil, Obama began by ordering the infamous Guantanamo Bay detention center closed, thus returning the United States to upholding the very same rule of law it preaches to other nations. He also has  stated over and over again that ""America does not torture,"" thus returning the United States to leading on human rights, not cherry-picking them. To those such as former Vice President Dick Cheney who claim this will make America more vulnerable, even some former Bush administration officials now concede that rigorous but patient above-board interrogation has proven to yield better, more reliable intelligence than a rush to the waterboard. Obama has kept a campaign pledge and given a fixed date for ending the unpopular U.S. war in Iraq. ""Let me say this as plainly as I can: By August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end,"" he announced. Yet the perils are clear. Hundreds of Iraqi civilians have been killed in Baghdad and other cities in a surge of sectarian violence since January. The Obama administration and U.S. military leaders are playing it down, blaming the suicide bombings on a few militant cells. That brings back memories of Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld blaming a ""handful of dead-enders"" as the original insurgency was getting into full swing. Much work still needs to be done to stabilize Iraq militarily and politically. Drawing down in Iraq means surging in Afghanistan, which along with Pakistan is still viewed as the central front on terror. ""If the Afghanistan government falls to the Taliban or allows al-Qaeda to go unchallenged,"" Obama said in March, ""that country will again be a base for terrorists."" So he has ordered 21,000 new U.S. troops there by summer. But for all the talk of more boots on the ground, negotiating with moderate Taliban and beefing up Afghan security forces, danger will persist unless the Afghan people see more of a peace dividend. As Obama himself recognizes, ""There will be no lasting peace unless we expand spheres of opportunity for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.""  Watch highlights from Obama's first 100 days » . Dire poverty still stalks the land and people desperate to feed their families will lay an IED for cash if they cannot farm or find a decent paying job. Although the Taliban had less than 8 percent support in Afghanistan at the end of 2007, according to an ABC poll, Afghan public opinion is turning against the U.S.-led coalition partly because of the rising number of civilian casualties as the U.S. military hunts down terrorists with airstrikes. The same is happening in Pakistan. When unmanned drones and other airstrikes target militants but cost many civilian lives, it turns people against the United States. One month ago, President Obama unveiled an Afghan-Pakistan strategy for stabilizing the region, and yet things have gotten so much worse in the weeks since that now he, British officials and other world leaders openly fear the Talibanization of nuclear-armed Pakistan. A furious Pakistan government accuses the United States of sowing panic among the people and insists it's in full control of its country and its nuclear arsenal. But it is hard to overdramatize the danger as this U.S. ally concedes land and appeases the Taliban, then watches as it reneges on a so-called ""peace deal"" and rolls ever closer to the capital, Islamabad. On May 6 and 7, Obama will be meeting in Washington with the presidents of Pakistan and Afghanistan. In the fight to deny the militants a tipping point momentum, the military tells me 2009 will be crucial. As for Iran, which even two years ago candidate Obama said would be directly engaged by his administration, there is nothing formal yet between the two sides. After 30 years of enmity, President Obama offered Iran ""the promise of a new beginning"" in a Persian New Year video message, and since then has clearly signaled the United States was over regime-change. The Iranian government and leadership have responded in kind, saying they are ready to engage with America if the administration is really committed to changing its Iran policy. However, much of this good will has been over the airwaves and direct or back-channel talks have yet to start. Into this vacuum are stepping all the sundry pro- and anti-Iran interest groups, experts, analysts and nations, with their often-conflicting advice and sometimes confused understanding. Yet it is widely acknowledged that a strategic realignment with Iran would benefit U.S. and regional security and stability. The new Israeli government wants to see no such thing, and wants people to believe it will bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, a belief it fosters with background briefings to journalists in the United States and presumably elsewhere. In an ironic twist, Israel's Arab neighbors are bringing their dire warnings about Iran to the White House. Meantime, Obama has named a new Middle East Peace envoy, former Sen. George Mitchell, signaling he wants to take negotiations out of the deep freeze and committing to the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. Trouble is new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not signed on to the two-state solution and is trying to fend off this pressure, even suggesting Israel won't engage with the Palestinians until the United States takes care of Iran. Last week, Obama told Jordan's King Abdullah at the White House, ""My hope would be that over the next several months you start seeing gestures of good faith on all sides."" He added, ""We can't talk forever; at some point, steps have to be taken so that people can see progress on the ground."" The president has invited the leaders of Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to the White House in coming weeks. iReport.com: Grade Obama's first 100 days . The second hundred days in foreign policy will be filled with mini-summits at the White House and major summits abroad -- Russia in July and China sometime later.

"(CNN) -- BP showed up in court last week, finally, nearly three years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster and the hell it unleashed on the Gulf Coast. It's a huge, high-stakes trial, and BP is taking the beating it's earned. Here's what's at stake for America if there is a judgment: potentially tens of billions of dollars that will be used to create jobs while restoring some of our most productive and vulnerable natural places. Whether the trial results in a decision or a settlement, the outcome will send a signal about how serious this country is about enforcing its common-sense rules that guarantee clean air and waters. BP and its partners have already confessed to criminal negligence in the 2010 blowout that killed 11 men and gushed nearly 5 million barrels of oil. Every part of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem, from the deep-sea corals to dolphins to migratory birds, was affected. Gulf Coast residents suffered billions of dollars in economic losses, with effects that rippled across the country. And despite those slick commercials that assure you all is well and then invite you to spend your tourism dollars on the Gulf Coast, the disaster is still unfolding. Last summer, scientists found traces of BP's oil and dispersant in the eggs of migratory white pelicans nesting all the way up in Minnesota. Oil is still present on the Gulf's beaches, in the marshes and under the water. It is working its way through the food chain, so it will be years before we understand the full extent of the disaster. BP's billions at stake as courtroom showdown starts . Just Wednesday, in fact, the Gulf Restoration Network documented a fresh rash of tarballs on a Louisiana beach known as Elmer's Island -- a spot that gets re-oiled every time a storm stirs up BP's submerged goo. We're nearly three years in, and there's no end in sight. That's why our justice system must hold BP and other polluters fully responsible under the law for the worst offshore oil disaster in history. How much could BP end up paying? BP is liable for up to $17.6 billion in penalties under the Clean Water Act if it is found grossly negligent. (And if this isn't gross negligence, it's hard to imagine what is.) Add to that figure the potential for tens of billions more in fines under the Oil Pollution Act. This much is clear: The rules were put in place to deter and, if needed, to penalize the offenders. The Deepwater Horizon was the kind of disaster that was envisioned when the full force of these penalties was contemplated. Those penalties -- and nothing short -- are the fair outcome. It wasn't surprising to see BP's stock rise when it agreed to an unprecedented $4.5 billion in criminal fines. The market was saying, in essence: Guys, it could have been a lot worse. BP claims it now leads the way on safety . So we know that some amount of penalties -- a staggering amount by normal standards -- has already been ""priced in"" to BP's value. So, this isn't about whether BP will continue to be an ATM for shareholders. It will be. And we're not saying that there shouldn't be drilling in the Gulf Coast. We're saying that even megacorporations need to play by the rules. If Justice Department lawyers agree to a weak settlement, the burden of rebuilding from this disaster will be transferred from a foreign corporation to American taxpayers. Worse, it will send a message to polluters that we don't take seriously our air, water, wildlife, communities or economic health. What's the difference between a $15 billion settlement and a $35 billion dollar judgment? The ability to rebuild the Louisiana wetlands -- America's delta-- for generations to come. A healthy, productive Gulf Coast where people and wildlife thrive. The principle that if you break it, you buy it. Families of killed rig workers react to BP settlement . Under the terms of the RESTORE Act -- passed last year with historic bipartisan support -- 80% of Clean Water Act civil penalties will go back to restore the environment and economies of the Gulf Coast states. That's right and fair. We don't love how the states want to spend every dollar. But this is what a grand political bargain looks like, in case we've forgotten. Two weeks ago, we and our partners hand-delivered more than 133,000 petitions to the Department of Justice, calling for full and complete accountability under the law for BP and its partners. The point of the petitions was pretty straightforward: These rules matter to Americans, and everyone needs to play and -- in this case -- pay fully. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Yarnold.","David Yarnold: BP is rightly on trial, potentially facing judgment in tens of billions .

"(CNN) -- A Florida man pleaded guilty Thursday to murdering four relatives on Thanksgiving Day in 2009, avoiding a possible death sentence after reaching a plea deal with prosecutors. After hearing from relatives of the victims, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Joseph Marx sentenced Paul Merhige to seven life terms. As part of the agreement, the defendant agreed to waive any rights of appeal. ""You'll never see the light of day,"" Marx told the 37-year-old Merhige on Thursday, in front of a packed West Palm Beach courtroom. Having shaved his head and tried to disguise his 2007 blue Toyota Camry with a car cover and switching its license plate, Merhige was arrested in January 2010 at a Florida Keys motel after an ""America's Most Wanted"" viewer recognized him. He was on a computer when U.S. marshals burst into his second-floor room at the Edgewater Lodge, where he had checked in under the name John Baca, according to authorities. Merhige was then charged with four counts of premeditated murder and three counts attempted first-degree murder in the Thanksgiving night shooting deaths of his twin sisters, a 6-year-old cousin and a 79-year-old aunt at a family home in Jupiter, Florida. One of the victims -- Lisa Knight, 33, who was one of Merhige's sisters -- was pregnant. Her husband, Patrick, was one of two other family members who survived after being wounded in the shooting rampage, authorities said. Family members suggested in interviewers that Merhige ""had ongoing resentment"" for some of his relatives, Jupiter Police spokeswoman Sally Collins-Ortiz said shortly after the shootings. Patrick Knight, who was shot in the stomach, was among the family members who told the judge Thursday that he approved the plea deal. He explained that he wanted to ""pick up the pieces"" and did not want to endure ""20 years"" of appeals. But Jim Sitton, whose 6-year-old daughter, Makayla, was among those gunned down, objected to the agreement as he wanted Merhige to go on trial and potentially face the death penalty. He urged the judge to delay the sentencing so he could ""prepare a proper presentation"" with an attorney to detail his argument. Near the end of his statement Thursday, the judge sternly told Sitton -- then carrying a large picture of his daughter -- to ""stop!"" after he knelt down. ""This plea decision is far too important to rush through without any time for us, for all of us, to think,"" said Sitton, accusing the state of trying to push the deal through. ""We've been waiting patiently for almost two years for this case to come to trial. ... Justice is what is at stake here."" The start of Merhige's trial had been set for January. His public defenders had filed court documents expressing their intent to defend him using an insanity defense. After Thursday's court proceeding, State Attorney Michael McAuliffe released a statement in which he said that -- ""after careful evaluation and consideration"" -- he decided to accept Merhige's plea, having determined it is ""an appropriate resolution to the case."" Noting the disparate opinions among the victims' family members and about the death penalty generally, McAuliffe said he felt it sufficient that Merhige ""will have no hope of having favorable rulings by a court"" and ""will have no ability to affect ... the lives of those he harmed."" ""I believe that seven consecutive life sentences recognize the heinous nature of the crimes and adequately punish the defendant,"" he said.","NEW: Paul Merhige waives the right to appeal as part of his plea agreement .

"(CNN) -- Former New Jersey Nets star Jayson Williams was sentenced to five years in prison Tuesday for the fatal shooting of his limo driver in 2002. Williams tearfully apologized to the family of Costas ""Gus"" Christofi during his sentencing hearing Tuesday morning. ""There's not a day I wake up and I don't feel sorry for what I did to Mr. Christofi,"" Williams said. He pleaded guilty last month to aggravated assault in the 2002 shooting death of Christofi, a limo driver he had hired. Under the plea deal, Williams could have been sentenced to anywhere from 18 months without the possibility of parole to five years in prison. Williams, who turned 42 on Monday, appeared before Somerset County Superior Court Judge Edward Coleman. After sentencing, he will be taken to the Central Reception and Assignment Facility in Trenton, New Jersey, said Corrections Department spokeswoman Deirdre Fedkenheuer. There, over the course of several weeks, he will be photographed, DNA samples will be taken, and he will be given medical, dental, psychological and educational evaluations, she said. Only afterward will a decision be made about where to send him, she said. Williams waived his right to appeal. In return, the state changed the indictment from a charge of reckless manslaughter to a charge of aggravated assault by recklessly causing bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon. Prosecutors said in January they would recommend Williams be sentenced to five years in prison on four charges of attempting to cover up the fatal shooting. A jury convicted him of those charges in 2004. Though he was acquitted of more serious counts -- tampering with a witness, tampering with evidence, fabricating evidence and hindering apprehension or prosecution -- the jury was unable to reach a decision on the second count of reckless manslaughter. Coleman declared a mistrial on that count, and the state had decided to move forward with a retrial on that charge when the plea deal was struck. Williams will serve his sentence concurrently with the 18-month sentence for aggravated assault. Last year, the state attorney general took the case from the Hunterdon County, New Jersey, prosecutor. A spokesman for the attorney general cited a gag order in declining to discuss the case. Williams has been free on $250,000 bail with the condition that he not consume alcohol and that he check in daily with probation officers. The condition that he refrain from alcohol was imposed soon after Williams was charged with drunken driving in early January after crashing his SUV in Manhattan. A New York judge ordered him to wear an electronic bracelet that monitors perspiration to detect whether alcohol has been consumed. The fatal shooting occurred February 14, 2002, in the bedroom of Williams' New Jersey estate. The 55-year-old driver had been hired to drive the former athlete and several of his friends to dinner following a sporting event in Pennsylvania. Afterward, the group, including four members of the Harlem Globetrotters, went back to Williams' home. The prosecution contended that Williams was recklessly handling a 12-gauge shotgun when it discharged and that he and two others tried to make it look as if Christofi had shot himself. In January 2003, Williams paid Christofi's family $2.75 million to settle a wrongful death lawsuit. Williams, who retired in 1999 because of a leg injury, played nine seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets.","Judge gives Williams maximum for aggravated assault in shooting death .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When it comes to buying an iPhone in Brazil, consumers have one extra option that the rest of us do not. There's the ""iPhone"" made by the California tech giant Apple. Then there's the ""iphone"" made by the Brazilian firm Gradiente Eletronica and, perhaps in a slap to Apple, runs on rival Android's operating system. And it's going to stay that way pending any future appeal or settlement. On Thursday, Brazil's Institute of Industry Property (INPI), the country's main patent regulator, ruled that Apple holds no exclusive right to use the iPhone moniker to market its mobile phones. If Apple continues to use the iPhone name, Gradiente can sue. INIP added that Gradiente Eletronica holds exclusive rights to the trademark though 2018 after having registered for the iPhone name in 2000. Apple only unveiled its iPhone name in 2007. Apple may have gotten a bruising but an appeal is in the works. And in a twist on timing that Apple hopes may help it win branding rights, Gradiente Eletronica only launched its first ""iphone"", the iphone Neo One, in December 2012 -- five years after Apple debuted its inaugural iPhone. Gradiente explained it held back on releasing its own iphone until recently as it concluded corporate restructuring from 2008. Apple's trademark trouble in Latin America's most populous country is just the latest in a series of global snafus that have spanned China, Japan and the United States. Just days after Apple announced its first iPhone in January 2007, Cisco Systems sued the company in U.S. federal court saying it had owned trademark rights since 2000. Apple and Cisco agreed to a settlement the following month that allowed both companies use of the iPhone name. In 2009, Apple paid Proview Taiwan a sum of $55,000 for use of the ""iPad"" name in mainland China. But in a complicated dispute, Proview claimed Apple set up a shell company to fool it into selling the trademark. In addition, Proview Taiwan did not actually own the rights to the iPad trademark in mainland China -- a subsidiary, Proview Shenzhen, did. Apple only secured the name in 2012 after paying out the actual trademark owner $60 million. And in 2010, Apple secured the iPad trademark in the United States from Japanese electronics maker Fujitsu which had registered the name in the U.S. in 2003. According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the title transfer was recorded on March 17, 2010, five days after Apple began pre-selling its first iPad.","Apple loses right to iPhone trademark in Brazil .

"Editor's note: CNN has asked its journalists across the country to offer their thoughts on how the economic crisis is affecting their cities. In this installment, All Platform Journalist John Couwels reports from Orlando, Florida. Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, has announced that it will lay off employees. ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Orlando: What first comes to mind? Walt Disney World or Universal resorts, perhaps? The two parks are the nation's biggest tourist draws. As a new resident of Orlando, I find that the tourist areas are more removed from the city than I thought. Still, some people in the area where I currently live either work or have business dealings at tourist attractions. As with every city in the United States, Orlando is dealing with the fallout of an economic slowdown. Tourism officials expect an 8 percent to 10 percent drop in tourism dollars for 2009. Nonetheless, during a recent visit to Disney's Magic Kingdom with my family, I experienced a packed park. My first visit in 10 years: The park did not seem any different except for the $129 I paid for a six-month Florida resident pass. Disney World recently announced a major loss in income and that layoffs are expected. Sources within Disney say the layoffs could begin this week. Disney will not say how many people will be eliminated while it restructures and consolidates operations. I have not heard panic among businesses and city officials over the Disney announcement, despite the fact Disney World says it is the biggest single-site employer in the United States with 62,000. Disney spokesman Mike Griffin said: ""We are bigger than the Pentagon."" Disney told me cuts would be significant, affecting back office workers. Griffin said guests visiting the parks would not see any difference. Danielle Courtney, spokeswoman of the Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau, said she was sure that ""Disney will provide a value experience for their guests."" But she said Disney is doing what every other business is doing: cutting costs. Orlando's economic and development director, Bill Billingsley, said the city has not lost a significant amount of jobs. Billingsley is concerned about the Disney layoffs but optimistic on the limited effect on the city's economic health. From the big corporations to the funky little tea and sandwich shop east of downtown, businesses are feeling the pinch. The owner of Pom Pom's Teahouse and Sandwicheria was telling my friend how she had to cut everyone's hours to part time to save on expenses. The store has been open since 2006. Owner Pom Moongauklang, a trained pastry chef, told me she's doing whatever it takes to stay open. Pom cut her four employees' hours instead of their jobs, lowered prices and extended hours to 24 hours on the weekends. Pom said of the 60- to 70-hour work week: ""It's killing me, but it's working."" Along the epicenter of tourist hotels, restaurants and T-shirt shops, International Drive business owners say they are hurting. Aby Aly, owner of a gift shop selling goods from T-shirts to plush dolls, said that ""business is off by 35 percent, and people are not buying."" As I drive around town, I do not see a large number of closed-down stores. Like other cities, Orlando has seen big national chain closures like Linen-N-Things and Circuit City. Yet at two of the area's outlet malls, you would never know there is an economic crisis. I waited 10 minutes in line to enter the parking lot. In the suburbs where foreclosures are their highest, more businesses have closed their doors. As I looked for a house to rent I was surprised how a one-bedroom condo in downtown was the same price as a four-bedroom house only five miles away. Real estate agent Sue Bee Laginess said the city has a glut of homes and condominiums for sale or rent. She said her office has seen business double from four months ago because of the low prices. The agent said owners have either lowered prices, been foreclosed on or are selling the house for the amount owed to the bank. For one store in my new quaint neighborhood of College Park, business has never been better: Top Drawer Consignments. Fred Rodgers, a former Disney designer and one of the store's owners, said ""the tough economy is helping us."" Shoppers say they save money buying used furniture. Yet College Park has not been immune from the economic crisis; real estate offices and gift shops have closed there, too. Despite the downturn, Orlando officials believe their city has fared better than most. Orlando's economic development director told me Orlando is building a medical city that will add 10,000 jobs in the coming years. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer will give his State of Orlando speech Wednesday, the same week the area's biggest employer could begin layoffs.","Resort mecca Orlando, Florida, feels the pinch of economic slowdown .

"(CNN) -- They're friendly, intelligent and playful. So who'd want to shoot a dolphin? Conservation experts and federal agents say they're looking into the violent deaths of several bottlenose dolphins along the northern Gulf Coast this year, including one that was shot and another that was stabbed with a screwdriver. ""I can't explain why anyone would shoot a dolphin,"" Jeff Radonski, a Florida-based special agent for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told CNN. Radonski said NOAA is investigating four of the six deaths reported since June. Samia Ahmad, a spokeswoman for the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport, Mississippi, said at least six dolphins had died as a result of foul play since January. In one case, a dolphin had its jaw cut off, she said. In September, a dolphin that washed up on Elmer's Island, Louisiana, had been shot. The bullet that killed it was found in its lung, NOAA reported. In June, a bottlenose was found in Perdido Bay, on the Florida-Alabama state line, with a screwdriver stuck in its head, the agency said. Dolphins are covered by the Marine Mammal Protection Act, a 1972 law that makes killing them punishable by fines of up to $20,000 and a year in prison. In at least two previous cases, fishing charter captains have been found guilty of shooting at dolphins that approached their boats or the fish their passengers had hooked, NOAA says. NOAA spokeswoman Allison Garrett told CNN that the most recent prosecution involved a Panama City, Florida, man who was convicted of throwing pipe bombs at dolphins. He was sentenced to two years in prison in 2009 for violating the federal conservation law and for possessing an explosive device as a convicted felon.

"(CNN) -- The whole world watched Thursday as a lighter-than-air craft set loose by a 6-year-old boy floated above eastern Colorado. Several media outlets offered to help track the balloon with their helicopters, a sheriff's spokeswoman says. Web sites as diverse as Al-Jazeera and Australia's Sydney Morning Herald carried news of the wayward aircraft with reports that authorities feared the boy, Falcon Heene, was inside. The Web sites for The Sun, Britain's largest newspaper, as well as the BBC, posted by-the-minute updates on the aerial odyssey, as did many international sites. The story was a bonanza for social networking sites. Facebook, in a little more than an hour, had three fan pages and three groups dedicated to ""Balloon Boy."" Members were piling on as the story developed. After the balloon landed near Colorado Springs, law enforcement authorities found it empty, according to CNN affiliate KMGH, which cited a police report. But while the aircraft was airborne, it was the saucer seen round the world.  Watch ""unbelievable"" footage of ""homemade flying saucer"" » . Michael Karns, director of marketing at Zazzle, an online customized products platform tied to trends and ideas, said the balloon excursion sparked the creation of 6,000 ""products,"" (shirts, bags, shoes, doggie attire, etc.) tied to the news event. ""What's interesting about this story is that it played out over a significant period of time,"" Karns said. ""Expressions [on the T-shirts] changed from ""Go, Falcon, Go"" (when the boy was believed afloat) to ""I Believe"" (when he was reported missing) and once it came clear the kid, Falcon, was hiding in the attic, the products changed to sort of making fun of the whole thing."" Karns said the Redwood City, California, company received about 200 orders of shirts related to the event by 8 p.m. ET Thursday. Karns predicted the ""Balloon Boy"" may become a hot Halloween costume as well. The attention it garnered also gave some indications of how a real-life flying saucer, an unidentified flying object, may be documented in a high-tech world. Watch report on shifting attitudes towards ''balloon boy' saga » . Twitter was inundated with news about Falcon, with the updates occupying seven of the 10 trending topics on the site from 3:30 p.m. to nearly 5 p.m. ET. While most of the tweets were repeating national headlines about the balloon, some people expressed their opinions along the way. Mleswan tweeted, ""Oh sweet irony. The kid's name is FALCON?!?! Oh that's classic."" Tmilewski tweeted, ""I call both horrible parenting AND horrible craftsmanship on this one!"" On Reddit, a social networking site known for its hilarious discussion threads about news events, the topic elicited fun and fast dialog. Neoncow said: ""I don't care what they say. A father who builds a flying saucer hot air balloon with his son is a good father."" Lyrus said: ""What did Beyonce say to the parents of the 6-year-old kid that flew away in a balloon? If you liked it then you should have put a string on it."" Mossyskeleton: ""I wonder if his dad is going to ground him when he gets back."" Falcon's parents, identified as science enthusiasts and storm chasers Richard and Mayumi Heene, were featured earlier this year on ABC's prime-time program ""Wife Swap,"" ABC said. The Heene family was involved in ""scientific experiments that include looking for extraterrestrials and building a research-gathering flying saucer to send into the eye of the storm,"" the network's Web site said. Richard Heene, who has posted at least one iReport, calls himself a general contractor, published scientist and inventor. The aircraft, which appeared to be a Mylar-coated helium balloon, had been tethered to the Heene home in Fort Collins, Colorado, the Larimer County Sheriff's Office said. Falcon evidently untied the rope anchoring the balloon, and it was feared that he had fallen from the craft. Authorities say that after ground and air searches, he was found hiding in a box in the attic of his family's home Thursday.","Facebook had fan pages, groups dedicated to ""Balloon Boy""

"(CNN) -- Recently, we learned two important things about Mitt Romney. First, he would rather see the American economy fail than President Barack Obama win. Second, the extent of his hypocrisy is amazing. While he laments the toll that outsourcing has taken on our workers and economy, he amassed a fortune by investing in companies that outsourced American jobs. In word and deed, Romney roots for failure, and his insincerity reveals a disdain for the common good and disregard for people's common sense. Americans deserve better. As Bloomberg News reported, Romney urged Florida Gov. Rick Scott to downplay good economic news in the Sunshine State. It's his way of sending a signal to Republican governors in states where the economy is improving -- in the battlegrounds of Virginia, Ohio and elsewhere -- to be quiet. Obscure the truth, he begs. Obstruct any progress. But these governors know better. Scott continues to tout Florida's economic recovery, as he should. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell notes that the state's 5.6% unemployment is the lowest in three years -- in other words, it's been falling since Obama's policies took effect. Ohio is another key state where the facts contradict Romney's scorched-earth message. Following the president's recent Cleveland speech, Romney urged residents to ""look around Ohio"" to see the impact of Obama's policies. So let's take him up on it. Ohio's unemployment rate fell from 10.6% to 7.5% in three years. A main reason is the resurgent auto industry, which the president rescued but Romney opposed -- an undeniable success that Ohio's Republican Gov. John Kasich still tries to downplay. By all means, Republican governors should take credit for the economic turnarounds in their states. But give credit where credit is due. States are not islands unto themselves. Their economies are intertwined with that of other states, and with the nation's economy as a whole. Some states went into the Great Recession faster than others; some went in deeper. But all were sucked into the same economic abyss of the failed policies of the past -- the same policies, by the way, that Romney promises to repeat as president. Similarly, some states have climbed out of recession faster, some further, but all have been pulled up by the president's policies that are moving us forward. While we're far from a full recovery, ""we're all in this together; we rise and fall as one nation and as one people,"" as the president says. What we're seeing from Romney as the leader of his party is the worst and most predictable kind of politics. Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has said his party's top priority is to defeat Obama. Not to create jobs. Not to get our economy going again. But to win an election. His troops have carried out that mission in lockstep. Congressional Republicans have stalled, slow-walked or stopped everything -- even blocking the president's jobs plan, which addresses the most important issues in the country and is full of bipartisan ideas that would create as many as 1 million new jobs for our teachers, police officers, firefighters and construction workers. Another part of the president's jobs plan would create tax incentives to reward companies that bring jobs back to America rather than those that send them overseas. But we're unlikely to see Romney start showing any signs of leadership now. In a major report from The Washington Post, we learned that Romney's corporate buyout firm bought companies that specialized in outsourcing. He made a fortune helping companies send American jobs to China, India and Mexico, maximizing profits for himself and his investors while laying off American workers, gutting companies and devastating communities here at home. If Romney really supports American jobs as strongly as his stump speech suggests, he'd stand up to members of his Republican Party and encourage them to pass the president's jobs plan. If that's a bridge too far, perhaps he'd consider coming up with a jobs plan of his own. As former Clinton Treasury official Brad DeLong said, ""President Obama has a plan for dealing with our cyclical unemployment crisis,"" but Romney does not. Even worse, according to Harvard professor and former Obama budget official Jeffrey Liebman's op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Romney's ideas ""would slow the recovery, reversing the gains we have made since the recession ended."" Which is why Romney is trying to convince voters of two impossible contradictions simultaneously. One, that the national economy is lousy, but state and local economies are improving. And two, that if an economy has improved, it's only because of Republican efforts and in spite of the president's leadership. Economists disagree, and even Republican governors refuse to play along with Romney's games. Romney's detachment from, or denial of, the truth is not just a political tactic or say-anything-to-please character flaw. It reveals a lack of leadership. It reveals an elemental attitude he shares with the special interest super PACs that support him -- silence the truth, show indifference to the hardship of others and sow distrust of the American people's belief in the common good and common sense. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: Romney would rather see U.S. economy fail than President Obama win .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Philadelphia prosecutors say they may seek the death penalty against abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, who is charged with murder after allegedly performing illegal late-term abortions at a dirty facility. Authorities allege that some of the infants were born viable and alive during the sixth, seventh and eighth months of pregnancy and then were killed with scissors, which were used to cut their spinal cords. Prosecutors ""did preserve the right to seek the death penalty at a later date by giving a notice of aggravating circumstances in court today,"" said Tasha Jamerson, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, in a statement released Wednesday. The circumstances in this case are the deaths of people under age 12 and multiple murder charges . Gosnell, 70, faces eight counts of murder in the deaths of seven babies and a 41-year-old woman. Karnamaya Mongar died November 19, 2009, after overdosing on anesthetics prescribed by the doctor, according to Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams. Gosnell's defense attorney, Jack McMahon, appeared in court Wednesday for the formal arraignments. Gosnell's presence was not required, and he was not in court. McMahon promised to ""vigorously defend"" Gosnell against the charges. Last month, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett fired a half-dozen employees and announced changes in two departments, calling state oversight of an abortion clinic where the deaths occurred ""despicable."" The Department of Health and the Department of State have primary oversight over such clinics. ""This doesn't even rise to the level of government run amok. It was government not running at all. To call this unacceptable doesn't say enough. It's despicable,'' Corbett said. Seven employees from the Department of Health, as well as the Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs, a branch of the Department of State -- are no longer employed by the state, having either resigned or been terminated since the situation came to light, Corbett said in statement. In addition, four other former employees named in the grand jury investigation had previously resigned. District Attorney Williams earlier called the facility ""a house of horrors"" that performed ""botched and illegal abortions"" and was full of containers of fetuses' body parts. Six other defendants face charges. All had some role at the Women's Medical Society clinic, which was run by Gosnell and served mostly low-income minority women, Williams said. A grand jury investigation determined that health and licensing officials had received repeated reports about Gosnell's practices for two decades, but had taken no action, even after learning that women died during routine abortions, Williams has said.","Prosecutors may seek the death penalty against abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Police in Zimbabwe on Tuesday confirmed that one person was killed and 15 injured in an accident involving President Robert Mugabe's motorcade on Sunday. Zimbabwe's police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena confirmed to CNN that an accident had been reported by state media. ""I can only confirm on Tuesday if there are new details. So far all I know is that one passenger who was in a commuter bus died on the spot and 15 passengers from the two vehicles sustained injuries,"" Bvudzijena said when asked to confirm reports of two more deaths in the incident. The accident was the third in two weeks involving the 88-year-old Zimbabwean leader's motorcade, which consists of about 15 vehicles, including a Mercedes limousine, motorcycles and army vehicles. The motorcade travels at high speeds and all traffic is expected to make way for it. Kubatana, an online network for Zimbabwean activists, on Tuesday sent an SMS message saying: ""Mugabe's motorcade has been in three crashes in past month causing death and injury. Should he slow down or is it up to us to get out of the way? Let us know."" All three accidents happened in Mugabe's rural home district, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southwest of Harare in Mashonaland West province.

"(CNN) -- In 1992, the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal label introduced the world to Luscious Jackson, the New York rock-punk-funk-hip-hop-disco-electro-indie band made up of singer/bassist Jill Cunniff, singer/guitarist Gabby Glaser, drummer Kate Schellenbach, and keyboardist Vivian Trimble. They released four albums and their biggest song to date, ""Naked Eye,"" hit the Top 40 chart. They appeared in quintessential '90s pop culture like the ""Clueless"" soundtrack, the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" TV series and even their own Gap ad before amicably disbanding in 2000 because Cunniff wanted to have children and didn't think that the life of a touring musician would be conducive to that. Today, Cunniff, Glaser and Schellenbach are mothers and recently reunited for a new Luscious Jackson album. Instead of going the traditional label route, they decided to put out their new material with the help of their fans through PledgeMusic. Their new single ""Are You Ready?"" is out now and they're currently hard at work on the full album, giving little sneak peeks along the way. This week they tweeted that they're recording a new song called ""Twi Lite."" ""Like that '70s disco song 'here in the twilight.' Not the vampires."" CNN spoke to Cunniff and Glaser about reuniting in a changing musical landscape, why their kids hate when they sing and the best advice the Beastie Boys ever gave them. CNN: It's been an exciting couple of years for fans of '90s music with a bunch of those band reuniting. Was that a factor in putting out new Luscious Jackson music? Jill Cunniff: I hope there's nostalgia, that's great, but it has nothing to do with what we're doing. It's just because the time is exactly right to do it. Five years ago, there wasn't this type of social network connection, connectivity. I think now people really miss that spirit of another time. People were really sad to hear we broke up and I guess now those people realizing that we're reuniting and they're writing about how happy they are. It's great. CNN: How has it been to get yourselves back out there? Cunniff: It's so hard to build yourself into a national brand of any kind. We're fortunate that we have a name so we can go back there. With Pledge, artists are realizing they can create their own fan base and reconnect with them. That's exciting. Getting the mailing list back from the label, getting the Facebook, getting the Twitter. Then it becomes an Ani DiFranco thing, where you're calling the shots. That's what we hope we'll ultimately be. We get to put out our music ourselves, run it ourselves, tour as we wish. It's a really great feeling. CNN: Do you have an album title yet? Cunniff: Not yet. I think the core of the album needs to be made and then we'll understand what it is. I think ""Are You Ready?"" is a really good example of what it's going to be like. It'll have a range, but a fun, up-tempo, youth vibe. I think we're both feeling that fun's really important. We're older now so the lyrics are different. There probably won't be cursing. I was listening to the old stuff and there was a lot of cursing. I'm not feeling like curses in my lyrics right now. But I don't feel like an old person. It's definitely not like, oh, we're adult contemporary now. CNN: Luscious Jackson albums are known for their eclectic mix of genres and references, is that what fans can expect with the new album? Cunniff: Now we're not using samples because it's too expensive and no one does, but there's core people that we are and that's what we bring. Our mission was to infuse (the music) with a lot of influences. We were like, how could we add that cool funk riff in? Why not put in this reggae guitar? So that's where it comes from, but I don't think we'll go crazy with anything drastically new. Gabby Glaser: Death metal! CNN: Will there be any collaborations on the new album? Cunniff: Cibo Matto is back together, that could be really cute. They were always around with us. A lot of people are still doing music, Ben Lee, the Grand Royal people. We could collaborate with anybody. I saw Mike (D. of the Beastie Boys) recently, so maybe down the road. You're hitting us at the beginning stages. CNN: What music currently inspires you? Cunniff: I love the Erykah Badu and J Dilla tracks and they're not that far to me from what we've always done. They're some of the best tracks I've heard in the last umpteen years. J Dilla passed away, but when I hear that stuff, I'm like, aaaaah! You know how you get when you're really inspired? That's how I get when I heard those tracks, and the singing is great too. Nneka, Ladyhawke, Amy Winehouse, Adele. I like Fleet Foxes. I listen to a lot of pop with my kids, like Rihanna and Nicki Minaj. Those are probably my favorite female pop artists, but I wouldn't say I'll bring that into the new album. I like to dance around the house, just myself, and I'll put that on. I've done that since I was a teenager. Glaser: Liquid Liquid and ESG, those were huge influences in my life. Cunniff: Huge, huge. I was watching ESG with my daughters and they were like, how could you like this? I don't get this. Kids don't understand if it doesn't have a pop hook on it. Glaser: When they're really little, you can play them a great Kinks song. Then they want to like whatever anyone else likes. CNN: Do your kids listen to your music? Cunniff: Mine have started to listen to our music, and they heard it when they were younger. They hate me singing, so it's kind of a problem. Glaser: All kids hate their parents singing. Cunniff: Because it takes the attention off of them, that's what I think. CNN: How has the band had to adapt to the changing music industry? Cunniff: I don't think anyone understands the music business right now. Having been in it for 10 years, everyone sits around and talks about what it is. No one knows. That's the damn truth. We had some cool people promoting us. I look back and can't believe how savvy they were marketing us. The stuff that we did was really hip and cool and underground. They didn't pressure us to do anything particularly commercial. We dressed how we wanted. That was the biggest limit was, don't do something wack. By wack, we all knew what that meant: something incredibly cheesy. I love cheesy music myself, like Lisa Lisa, but I'm talking about that mainstream commercial cheese and the sexy dancing and all that crap. We were never told to anything like that. I imagine now, you'd be pressured to be wack left and right. Glaser: Now we're really, really sexy, so we're going to pull it out now. Cunniff: We're going to be in our leotards by the end of this. No pants. Pants-free. That's going to be the name of the album! CNN: What is your favorite Luscious Jackson album? Cunniff: I like all our old albums. I don't feel like we had that crappy album. Glaser: They were all of the time. Cunniff: The only thing we did was make a video and almost kill ourselves roller derbying. I showed my kids the video and they were like, your outfits are horrible. I was like, those are roller derby outfits! I wasn't trying to look like a glamazon. Somebody just put a roller derby outfit on me; sorry I don't look like Rihanna in the video. That video was crazy. At one point the director was sitting there with his head in hands, like, what have I done? And then these roller derby women come out and they smacked everyone around. They smacked Vivian down. She got an injury in her neck. Glaser: You play music and you record the video, but you don't want to be so incredibly challenged physically. Cunniff: (Director) Tamra Davis was incredible. She really got our vibe. She did ""Daughters of the Kaos,"" ""City Song"" and ""Ladyfingers."" We did a ton of videos with other people, but those were probably our favorite. The ""Daughters of the Kaos"" video, we totally looked like hookers. We thought we looked like ""Charlie's Angels."" Glaser: No. Hookers. CNN: Luscious Jackson was introduced through Grand Royal and the Beastie Boys so that was great, automatic validation, but do you ever resent being asked about them when talking about your music? Cunniff: Not at all. Not at all. As the years go by, I become more appreciative of what they did and how it was done, what they tried to do with Grand Royal. It was a noble effort to bring out new artists that were interesting and create a community of music that was creative. There's not that many people doing that. They never really were part of our music; they were more like mentors in the professional world of music. CNN: What was the best advice they ever gave you? Cunniff: Don't be wack. That's it.","Luscious Jackson have recently reunited for a new album .

"(CNN) -- A year after the remains of a Florida toddler were discovered, a lawyer for the slain child's mother asked a judge Friday to stop prosecutors from seeking the death penalty against her. Lawyer Andrea Lyon told Orange County Circuit Court Judge Stan Strickland that the ""real reason"" prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Casey Anthony is because they want to ""get as biased a jury as they possibly can."" Lyon said a jury that is qualified to serve in a death penalty case is more likely to convict defendants. But prosecutor Jeff Ashton told the court that the state is not seeking the death penalty; rather, the jury and judge will decide whether it is appropriate. Anthony has pleaded not guilty to murder in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. The toddler's skeletal remains were discovered December 11, 2008, six months after she disappeared. The remains were bagged and partially buried in a swampy, vacant lot, and duct tape covered the child's mouth. Ashton said the death penalty question is not for the prosecution to answer. ""Everyone who is indicted by a grand jury in the state of Florida for the crime of first-degree murder is eligible for the death penalty,"" he said. ""The decision by the prosecutor is simply, should a jury, and ultimately, a judge, be allowed to make this decision?"" Further explaining why he believed the case was eligible for the death penalty, Ashton speculated what jurors might infer from the facts presented to them. He suggested that Caylee's killer may have either given the toddler a substance to knock her unconscious before applying duct tape to her mouth and nose, or had physically restrained her before doing so. ""As the killer looked into her face, maybe her killer even saw her eyes, as the tape was applied,"" he said. As he spoke, Anthony sobbed, as her lawyer comforted her. Lyon noted that there is ""no evidence ... that this tape had anything to do with the death of this child."" Police released documents this year showing they believed that Caylee was slain within days of the time she was last seen and that her body was in the trunk of her mother's car for ""a period of time."" Authorities have said that the cause of Caylee's death is homicide by undetermined means. In her argument, the defense attorney noted the toddler's undetermined manner of death, saying that the death penalty infringes on Anthony's constitutional rights. ""They cannot be seeking the death penalty in good faith because there is insufficient evidence ... to establish first-degree murder,"" she argued. Earlier Friday, Anthony's lawyer also urged the judge to prohibit jail officials from videotaping sessions between her and her client, as well as visits from Anthony's friends and family. She said that she has been told that the videos are for security and that the sound is disabled, but said that she and her client have the ""feeling that perhaps we're being listened to."" The judge said he would make his rulings as soon as possible. Anthony's parents also appeared in the courtroom for Friday's hearing. In a May interview on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" George and Cindy Anthony said they believed their daughter was innocent.","NEW: Prosecutor says it's up to jury, judge to decide whether death penalty is appropriate .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Singer Bobby Brown faces his second drunken driving charge this year after a Los Angeles police officer pulled him over in the Studio City community early Wednesday, police said. The officer smelled ""a strong scent of alcohol"" when he approached Brown during the Ventura Boulevard traffic stop, prompting a field sobriety test, a police spokesman said. After the test, Brown was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and booked into a jail, the police spokesman said. He was released on bond about seven hours later, he said. Brown's representative did not immediately respond to a CNN call for comment. Photos: Celebrity mug shots . Brown checked into a ""confidential rehabilitation center"" in August for treatment ""relating to alcohol use,"" his spokesman said at the time. Brown, 43, agreed to enter a 90-day alcohol treatment program when he pleaded no contest in Los Angeles County to driving with a blood alcohol content of .08% or higher in April. He also was sentenced to 36 months of probation, according to his attorney, Tiffany Feder. Brown married Alicia Etheridge, his manager, in a ceremony in Hawaii in June. The couple got engaged in 2010 at a New Edition concert after dating for close to three years. They have a 3-year-old son, Cassius. He admitted himself to the rehab proram three weeks after concluding his honeymoon in Mexico and during a break from the New Edition tour, his spokesman said. Brown was previously married to the late Whitney Houston, who he divorced in 2007. In addition to Cassius, Brown has one daughter, Bobbi Kristina, from his relationship with Houston, as well as three other children. Brown has been touring this year with his group New Edition. The R&B artist released ""Masterpiece,"" his first solo album in 14 years, in June.

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Death row inmates in Japan spend decades in isolation and face inhuman conditions that can lead to mental illness, Amnesty International said Thursday. Amnesty urged Japan's new government to improve death row conditions. Some who have exhausted their legal options are not told they will be put to death until the last minute, the human rights group said. Japan executes such prisoners despite signing an international law that requires inmates with serious mental illness to be exempt from the death penalty, according to Amnesty. The report urged the government to establish a moratorium on executions and consider abolishing the death penalty. As many as 102 prisoners face execution in Japan -- many of them elderly inmates who have lived in isolation for decades, the human rights group said. However, the number of death row prisoners suffering from mental illness is unknown. ""The secrecy around the death penalty and prisoners' health, combined with a lack of scrutiny by independent mental health experts, has led to reliance on secondary testimony and documentation to assess the mental state of those on death row,"" Amnesty said. Japanese officials declined to comment Thursday. The report by the London-based human rights group comes as a new Japanese administration prepares to take over after ousting the long-ruling government in a landslide victory last month. Amnesty urged the new Democratic Party of Japan government, which will form in mid-September, to improve death row conditions. Inmates are especially vulnerable because of their lack of human contact, Amnesty said. Inmates are allowed only visits to restrooms and must remain seated in their cells at all times, without light and fresh air, Amnesty said. ""These inhuman conditions increase a prisoner's anxiety and anguish, and in many cases push prisoners over the edge and into a state of mental illness,"" said James Welsh, Amnesty International's health coordinator and lead author of the report. The illness affects prisoners' ability to take part in the legal process, sometimes leading them to end their appeals, Amnesty said.","Report urged the government to establish a moratorium on executions .

"Washington (CNN) -- For the third straight year, federal customs officials marked the Cyber Monday online shopping extravaganza by seizing scores of websites that were allegedly selling counterfeit or falsely labeled products to unsuspecting customers. Read more: Black Friday, Cyber Monday and now #GivingTuesday . For the first time, U.S. authorities said they had partnered with European nations to conduct a similar crackdown overseas. All told, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said they had seized control of 101 U.S.-based websites, while European authorities had seized 31, with more actions expected. ""The vast majority of these websites are operating overseas and (in) foreign countries in which we are not present. That's part of the challenge here,"" ICE Director John Morton said. ""We're dealing with organized criminals who ... are trying very hard not to be caught."" Read more: Is there still a need for Cyber Monday? By partnering with European law enforcement, ICE is bringing transnational pressure to transnational crime, Morton said. Morton said the websites are growing more sophisticated, mimicking or even duplicating legitimate websites. The seized websites claimed to be selling familiar name-brand products, including Ergobaby Carriers, New Era hats, Nike sneakers, Tiffany jewelry, Oakley sunglasses, NFL jerseys and Adobe software. Although some products may have fooled customers, many were inferior products and some should have been obvious frauds. One website sold a DVD entitled ""100 Years of Disney,"" but the Walt Disney Company -- founded in 1923 -- is less than 100 years old, Morton said. Read more: Cyber Monday off to a strong start . Shoppers who visit the websites will now see a banner reading, in part: ""This domain name has been seized by ICE - Homeland Security Investigations pursuant to a seizure warrant issued by a United States District Court."" With the 101 domain names seized this season, ICE's National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center has seized 1,630 sites since it began operating in June 2010. Of those, 684 have now been forfeited to the U.S. government, ICE said. Under the forfeiture process, individuals who have an interest in seized domain names can contest the action in federal court. If no claim is filed, the domain names become the property of the U.S. government. Morton advised online shoppers to research the websites they use. ""Do your homework. Know your supplier,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, trust your instincts. This is probably your best line of defense, so don't reason away your intuition simply for the sake of an extra dollar or two."" ICE officials said that law enforcement agencies from Belgium, Denmark, France, Romania and the United Kingdom, and the European Police Office (Europol) are participating in this year's crackdown, dubbed Project Transatlantic. They executed seizures of foreign-based domains such as .eu, .be, .dk, .fr, .ro and .uk. The intellectual property center and Europol received leads from various trademark holders regarding the infringing websites. Those leads were disseminated to eight field offices in Baltimore; Buffalo, New York; Denver; El Paso, Texas; Newark, New Jersey; San Antonio, San Diego and Ventura, California, and to the investigating Europol member countries.","U.S. immigration, European police shut 132 websites selling counterfeit goods .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Singer Bobby Brown pleaded no contest Wednesday to driving with a blood alcohol content of .08% or higher and was sentenced to 36 months of probation, his attorney said. The charge to which he pleaded no contest is a violation of the California vehicle code, the attorney said. In Los Angeles County Superior Court, prosecutors dismissed two other counts against him -- a drunk driving charge and a suspended driver's license charge -- said Brown lawyer Tiffany Feder. Brown was also sentenced to one day in jail -- which he already served -- and must undergo a 90-day alcohol treatment program, Feder said. Brown didn't appear in court, Feder said. Brown, 43, showed signs of intoxication and failed a field sobriety test during the traffic stop last month in the Reseda area of Los Angeles County, California, Highway Patrol spokeswoman Tiana Reed said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld West Virginia's redrawn congressional districts, and officials hope to have the changes in place for the November vote. The justices said in an unsigned opinion on Tuesday that a divided three-judge federal district court panel had ""misapplied the standards for evaluating"" challenges to voting maps drawn by the state legislature. The case was thrown back to the lower court, which is expected to approve the changes in time for Election Day. West Virginia officials indicated previously they would use the redrawn map if they prevailed in court. All states are required to redo their voting boundaries following the recently completed U.S. Census. There are about 30 court cases nationally dealing with similar challenges. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether population variances among West Virginia's three congressional districts were enough to violate the law. Decades old Supreme Court precedent has solidified the ""one person, one vote"" standard to ensure equal voting districts. Precedent also requires states to make a ""good faith effort"" to achieve equality in voting districts, but that those districts need not be drawn with ""precise mathematical equality."" The lower court concluded last January that the redrawn districts did not provide equal representation among seats for the U.S. House. The state is represented by Republicans David McKinley and Shelley Moore Capito and Democrat Nick Rahall. The redrawn maps were used in May primaries. West Virginia's plan was approved by large margins in the state Senate and the House of Delegates, then signed into law by Democratic Gov. Earl Tomblin. Commissioners in Jefferson County originally sued to block the state from carrying out its plan, saying other legislative proposals would better achieve lower population variances. West Virginia state officials told the Supreme Court in their appeal that crafting a new map would be time-consuming, expensive, and cause ""irreparable harm."" But the Supreme Court's ruling signaled skepticism of the lower court's insistence on ""zero variance"" in population between the districts. The redistricting process is inevitably political and partisan to some extent as the majority party in the state legislature seeks to achieve a map that will maximize its voting strengths. The case is Tennant v. Jefferson County Commission (11-1184).","U.S. Supreme Court decision overturned lower court ruling on redrawn voter map .

"(CNN) -- Growing up in New York City, there are a few things I never imagined myself doing, like driving a car, living in a house or attending big high school games like the ones I'd seen on TV. Yet in the years since leaving the isolated enclave of Manhattan, I've taken pleasure in expanding my horizon and checking off all-American rites of passage, most recently, the baseball spring training road trip. By now, it's a familiar tradition: as spring approaches, Major League Baseball teams head for camps in Florida and Arizona to work off the winter flab and get ready for the regular season. It's become a big tourist draw, with 2012 game attendee numbers in Florida expected to surpass 1.5 million as the spring training season winds down this week. A new era of enhanced training facilities and stadiums have all the 21st-century bells and whistles, but in some respects, spring training is still a throwback to a more casual, pastoral brand of baseball. My initiation was an abbreviated tour, three games in three stadiums, with a beach condo in Indian Shores as home base. I'm not a huge baseball fan, though I have found that appearing tolerant of sports generally makes you more likeable. But I consider myself a loyal girlfriend to a Braves fan who starts counting down on January 1 to the day pitchers and catchers report, who brought me to a Montgomery Biscuits game early in our relationship. Plus, we would be staying on the beach, so I welcomed the opportunity to familiarize myself with one of the nation's most cherished pastimes. Friends and colleagues had briefed me on themes to look out for, including the corporatization of spring training, ""snowbirds"" and interstate billboards warning against abortion on one side and promoting strip clubs on the other. I encountered nearly all of them, but what made the most profound impression was experiencing baseball stripped of its major corporate trappings: stadiums where puny chain-link fences separate fans from idols and beer is cheaper than in the majors (though it'll still set you back at least $5); no Home Depot-sponsored tool races or incessantly loud Jumbotron ads. It's a magic formula that has drawn fans to Florida for decades, though people only really began coming in droves in the last two decades, said Nick Gandy with Florida Sports, a sports promotion and tourist development organization. The advent of live remote broadcasts, which showed stadiums lined with palm trees and players with rolled-up shirtsleeves, started pulling in visitors from snow-covered states, he said. When players' salaries began to rise in the 1980s, teams turned to spring training to expand the franchise, i.e., revenue. A similar pattern emerged in Arizona, home to the 15 teams of the Cactus League, the Western version of Florida's Grapefruit League. With 2011 game attendance surpassing 1.5 million visitors in 14 Florida stadiums, devotees worry that spring training's popularity is diluting its homegrown appeal. A hotel room near a stadium for less than $100 was hard to come by, and had we waited until game day to buy tickets we would've been shut out of two of three games. ""That's the biggest difference right there,"" said Gandy. ""Walking up and buying a ticket on game day (used to be) easy -- lucky if you can do that anymore."" The movement of teams from old stadiums into major complexes turned spring training into big business for the teams and the communities that host them, Gandy said, bringing in roughly $753 million a year in Florida. ""You have the Atlanta Braves in 1998 going from West Palm Beach to Disney World, of all places,"" he said. ""You know if Disney's getting involved in it there's some big business there."" Big business indeed. ""It's so Disney,"" one man lamented as we walked out of a Braves game at ESPN's Wide World of Sports. Champion Stadium, preseason home of the Braves, is located behind Disney World's arch, and many consider the team's presence near the Magic Kingdom antithetical to the spirit of spring training. Ticketmaster runs some of the box offices flanking the ESPN Club House, where the selection of Braves gear pales in comparison to the array of apparel festooned with Disney characters. Inside the flawless cream-colored stadium, ""cast members"" served food in baskets bearing Mickey ears and the tagline ""where dreams come true."" Donald Duck escorted a local sports anchor onto the field to throw the first pitch. When the game gets boring, you can seek a reprieve in the PlayStation Pavilion, equipped with 17 PS3 consoles, at $5 for 30 minutes. Near the field, however, the mood in the air was more akin to a county fair than a professional baseball game. In a section of designated lawn seating, clusters of families and friends stretched out on blankets and children ran amok among stumbling drunks while couples canoodled. Plus, I can vouch for the pulled pork sandwich. It was heartwarming stuff, the ""real America"" that I'd grown up seeing on TV and in movies, a place where baseball is a microcosm of the community, the underdogs win and the guy gets the girl. But, make no mistake, real America requires a car and a license, or a boyfriend with both. And patience, because traffic's a bitch, especially in places like Clearwater, spring training home of the Philadelphia Phillies and the Clearwater Threshers (that's a shark!) the rest of the year. Located, ironically enough, on a former Home Depot site on U.S. 19, the Phillies' Bright House Stadium represents the partnerships among local government and the franchises that have nurtured spring training. It seems to be a win-win for folks in Clearwater and tourists from up North, where the Gulf Coast is promoted year-round as a vacation destination, and not just for spring training, Gandy said. The day we saw the Braves play the Phillies, I also learned that the beauty of preseason play is that it creates a home away from home for fans from afar. Concession stands offered Philly Cheese Steaks, knishes and P-shaped pretzels. At the bar, strangers swapped profanity-laced travel tips. In ""tiki bar"" outfield seating, fans sat on bar stools behind long tables, raising bottles of Coors Light in the direction of players passing by. Others of a more inebriated nature demanded that Antonio Bastardo sign a beer bucket or have his ""ass kicked"" and needled sports anchor Gregg Murphy with taunting, prolonged cries of ""MURPH!"" Fans rooted for the home team and made fun of the Braves. In the grassy parking lot, a leathery old man hawked collectors' cards a few feet from Girl Scouts selling cookies. A man and a child tossed a ball around while we naively sat in our car for an hour waiting to reach the interstate. We didn't have that problem leaving Disney World. Many teams enjoy longstanding relationships with host cities, including the Phillies, who've trained in Clearwater for more than 60 years, confirming their place within the community. But smaller host cities like Bradenton enjoy a special air of nostalgia, thanks to an old stadium recently renovated to retain a look reminiscent of scenes from ""A League of their Own,"" the only baseball movie I ever enjoyed. McKechnie Field, preseason home of the Pittsburgh Pirates for more than 40 years, is in downtown Bradenton in between a smaller baseball diamond, a Domino's Pizza and the Boys and Girls Club of Manatee, where parking is available for $7. That may seem like a lot, but to my boyfriend, who pays $10 to park at the IBEW lot near Turner Field and then walk another 10 minutes, it was money well spent, especially for a short walk. Outside the stadium, fans tailgated on the lawn of the public works building and a Land O' Lakes truck offered free grilled-cheese sandwiches. Inside the home of the Bradenton Marauders, vendors sold Iron City Beer next to county-fair-style stalls offering kettle corn, funnel cakes and turkey legs. In the stands before the game, sun-scorched retirees vacationing as ushers chastised fans for leaning over the dugout for autographs. But they didn't actually stop them from tossing balls and baseball caps to Tampa Bay's Sean Rodriguez, who patiently smiled and signed. What our plastic stadium bench seats lacked in shade was made for up in proximity to the Pirates' warmup area, separated from the fans by a low wall and a chain-link fence. Fans of Tampa Bay filled the stands, their black shirts eclipsing the Pirates' St. Paddy's Day green. In front of us, a man complained to his neighbor of the difficulty of getting tickets for the Yankees at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa. ""Those New Yorkers,"" he muttered. Meanwhile, his wife gave instructions to their granddaughters via cell phone on where to stand to get Sean Rodriguez's autograph. I was reminded of something my boyfriend said the day before, as we walked along the beach and listed all the license plates we'd seen so far: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick (Indian Shores is near Dunedin, home of the Toronto Blue Jays since 1977): . ""I like the idea that all these people are on vacation to see baseball,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Those slick, intricate tests used by forensic investigators on shows like ""CSI"" look infallible, but that is the stuff of television. In the real world, forensic tests are much more ambiguous and rarely demonstrate a definite tie between an individual and a crime. The National Academy of Sciences found that U.S. crime labs lack uniform standards, training and oversight. That's what the National Academy of Sciences found when it studied the nation's forensic crime labs for two years. What the academy discovered was a ""badly fragmented"" system that produces inconsistent results and needs a major overhaul. In its report published Wednesday, the academy showed there is a serious lack of uniform standards, training and oversight. And, with the exception of DNA technology, the report concludes experts often overstate how much can be determined by forensic techniques running the gamut from fingerprinting to bite mark and hair analysis. According to the findings, except for DNA technology, ""no forensic method has been rigorously shown to have the capacity to consistently, and with a high degree of certainty, demonstrate a connection between evidence and a specific individual or source."" The report noted that forensic experts in court cases often overstate what can be proven by forensic methods and even attach a numerical percentage of accuracy that may not be based on clearly established scientific standards. The panel recommends that Congress create an independent National Institute of Forensic Science that could formulate standards for various forensic disciplines, regulate training and accreditation, and lead research. Another recommendation is that crime labs should be autonomous and not controlled by police departments or prosecutors' offices to head off any real or perceived bias toward law enforcement. The report also says many labs are ""underfunded and understaffed, which contributes to case backlogs and makes it hard for laboratories to do as much as they could to inform investigations and avoid errors."" One of the co-chairs of the study, Judge Harry Edwards, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., says much is at stake. ""We determine whether people are innocent or whether they are guilty in part based on forensic science evidence, so as a nation it is terribly important to us that we do it as well as it can be done,"" Edwards told CNN. ""And we are not doing it as well as it can be done right now."" Edwards said the panel received input from members of the forensic science community who agreed that improvements can be made. Constantine Gatsonis, a professor of biostatistics at Brown University and the other co-chair of the study, says the goal of the forensic community should be ""how to do the science better, how to report it more reliably ... and then how to practice it in a way that is uniform and according to standards across the country."" The report does not examine specific cases but looks at various forensic techniques used in thousands of trials. In the area of firearm analysis -- a discipline used by police crime labs to determine if a bullet recovered in a crime might have come from a particular gun -- the report says, ""Sufficient studies have not been done to understand the reliability and repeatability of the methods."" Fingerprints are used by law enforcement every day. The report notes the quality of the prints can vary greatly and that individual analysts ""make subjective assessments"" in trying to decide if a print can be linked to a particular individual. Therefore, the report states, ""zero-error rates are not plausible."" On hair analysis, the panel found: ""There appear to be no uniform standards on the number of features on which hairs must agree before an examiner may declare a 'match.'"" While the report says DNA analysis has the highest degree of certainty, it says other techniques can help narrow the field of suspects in an investigation. Peter Marone, chairman of the Consortium of Forensic Science Organizations, said his group supports a comprehensive review of forensic science and efforts to improve standards and oversight. But Marone does not think the release of the report should be an occasion to ""put down the work of thousands of scientists and forensic examiners."" Marone, who also served on the National Academy of Sciences panel that produced the report, told CNN ""the great majority of labs are doing first-rate work top to bottom, and make an enormous contribution to public safety."" The study by the National Academy of Sciences was requested by Congress. The panel has no authority to institute changes in the nation's forensics labs, but Congress could act to implement its recommendations.","Crime lab system in the United States needs major overhaul, study contends .

"(CNN) -- Dutch striker Robin van Persie has returned to the Arsenal squad for their European Champions League clash against Barcelona on Tuesday. Van Persie, 27, was expected to miss the second leg of the last 16 tie after suffering a knee injury while scoring Arsenal's goal in the 2-1 Carling Cup final defeat to Birmingham City. However, manager Arsene Wenger told a news conference: ""Van Persie has made quick progress over the last few days and this morning he had tests as he really wanted to play. ""I really want him to play but only if he is 100% fit. With Van Persie he has had a ligament problem which is different to a muscular injury and so the risk is a lot less of himself doing damage."" The Gunners were given a further boost with the news that captain Cesc Fabregas has a ""90%"" chance of facing the Spanish giants. Spain's Fabregas has been sidelined with a hamstring injury picked up in Wenger's side's 1-0 win over Stoke on February 23. Wenger also confirmed England midfielder Jack Wilshere will be fit for the tie, which Arsenal lead 2-1 ahead of the second leg at the Nou Camp, but central midfielder Alex Song will miss the match with a knee injury. ""Cesc is vital for us because he is important in the transition between attacking and defending. He is also the leader of the team so we want him there. ""Alex Song is completely out. He had a test on Sunday morning and it was negative. Wilshere will be fit."" Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola also has his own injury worries ahead of Tuesday's match. The former Barca captain is currently suffering from a back injury and will spend Monday night receiving treatment ahead of the game. The 40-year-old is expected to be fit enough to stand on the touchline for the contest with Arsenal and Guardiola hopes the London team's top players are fit enough to take part. ""I want all the great players to play, everyone against everyone and see a great show tomorrow,"" Guardiola told a press conference. ""I hope they are all in the team, Van Persie, Samir Nasri, Cesc (Fabregas), because I would like to play the best possible Arsenal. ""Arsenal are always at the top, when you compete every season at the top, it is because they are quality. Many teams arrive at the top for a year, but then are finished. Arsenal are there every season."" The Catalan outfit are without first-choice central defensive duo Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique for the match.

"Golan Heights (CNN) -- Israeli troops fired on protesters trying to cross the fortified border between Syria and the occupied Golan Heights on Sunday, with Syrian authorities reporting more than a dozen dead and hundreds wounded. The protests came on the anniversary of the 1967 Middle East War, when Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria. The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately confirm any casualties, though a spokeswoman said that Israeli troops used tear gas and live ammunition on members of an ""angered mob."" ""We warned them verbally (and) with warning shots into the air,"" Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich told CNN. ""And when these two options failed, we had to open fire selectively into the area, and this actually stopped those Syrians from reaching the Israeli-Syrian fence."" The Syrian state news agency said 23 people were killed and more than 350 wounded in the protests, which continued past nightfall. Medics could be seen carrying the wounded to vehicles and driving them away from the border. A spokesman for U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the violence and urged restraint. ""The events of today and of 15 May on the Golan put the long-held cease-fire in jeopardy. The Secretary-General calls for maximum restraint on all sides and strict observance of international humanitarian law to ensure protection of civilians,"" he said. As many as 500 people took part in the demonstration, holding mid-day prayers on the Syrian side of the border, then crouching down behind ramparts that Israel constructed in response to similar demonstrations three weeks ago. The number later dropped to about 50, with protesters waving Palestinian and Syrian flags. Clashes also broke out between Palestinians and Israelis at the Qalandia crossing between Jerusalem and Ramallah in the West Bank on Sunday. At least six Palestinians were injured there, one seriously, by rubber bullets. Israeli forces also fired tear gas, while Palestinians threw stones. The clashes come three weeks after similar demonstrations marking the 1948 birth of the Jewish state -- a day of mourning for Palestinians, more than 700,000 of whom were displaced from their homes during the fighting that followed. Those protests left at least 12 dead. Leibovich accused Syria of trying to use the protests to create a diversion ""from the bloodshed that is taking place inside Syria,"" where the United Nations says a crackdown against anti-government protests has left more than 1,000 dead. ""There is no question about it,"" she said. ""The policemen, the armed Syrian forces are looking back and not doing anything."" Demonstrators arrived in at least eight buses before the protest began, then came down from a hill known locally as ""Shouting Hill"" -- where people shout to family and friends on the other side of the border -- toward the ramparts Israeli forces constructed last month. Leibovich said Israeli troops were better prepared to deal with the demonstrations than with the May 15 protests, beefing up forces along the frontier and making clear ""that we would not tolerate any infiltration into the Israeli side."" CNN's Mike Schwartz, Kevin Flower and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","A U.N. spokesman condemns the violence and calls for restraint .

"(CNN) -- ""Muddin"" in the neighborhood ""holler,"" bringing raw deer meat to a party and brawling with a neighbor after noise complaints -- ""Jersey Shore"" is so over. Welcome ""Buckwild,"" an MTV reality show that debuted Thursday featuring nine young adults from West Virginia. Often stereotyped and sometimes forgotten as its own state, West Virginia is now at the center of MTV's latest drunken portrayal of young people goofing off (and occasionally working). The show uses subtitles in case viewers don't understand some of the accents. #Buckwild: 10 crazy tweets about the new show . ""You preyed on young people, coaxed them into displaying shameful behavior -- and now you are profiting from it,"" charged U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virgina, in a December letter to MTV asking the cable network to cancel the show. That's not likely to happen, though several reviews have panned the show. ""Not only is it another tired portrayal of Southern stereotypes, but it's also inexcusably poorly executed,"" claims the Hollywood Reporter. The state's tourism officials seem to have shrugged off the stereotypes. ""While some reality television programming is designed to excite, entice and generally entertain viewers, these types of programs tend to represent an extremely small segment of a population. This program does not represent our state or our citizens,"" the West Virginia Division of Tourism said in a statement. The spotlight may help promote the state, as the ""Jersey Shore"" did for that state, despite the antics of Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi and Mike ""The Situation"" Sorrentino. Much ado about ""Buckwild"" There's more to West Virginia than ""Buckwild"" suggests. Born of a group of anti-slavery citizens in western Virginia who would not secede with Virginia, West Virginia became its own state on June 20, 1863. The state celebrates 150 years of statehood this June. ""West Virginia is looking forward to celebrating its 150th anniversary,"" said Jacqueline Proctor, deputy commissioner at the West Virginia Division of Tourism. ""Our state is steeped in the history of the nation and born of the Civil War."" The state's tourism website highlights the events that formed West Virginia. ""These locations and other events off the battlefield not only influenced the war itself but the very shape of our state. Communities across the state are developing commemorations, reenactments and celebrations. The entire state will recognize the formation of West Virginia on June 20th."" An abolitionist state . The state has a long an illustrious history of anti-slavery activity. And nowhere is that more pronounced than Harpers Ferry National Historic Park. In 1859, John Brown and his supporters attacked the U.S. Armory and Arsenal at Harpers Ferry, attempting to capture the arms there for a slave uprising. After being captured, charged with ""conspiring with slaves to commit treason and murder,"" Brown was convicted and hanged for his crimes. Harpers Ferry was also the site of the arrival of the first working railroad and one of the earliest integrated schools in this country, where former slaves were educated.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Chelsea recovered from falling behind to the fastest goal in FA Cup final history to beat Everton 2-1 at Wembley on Saturday in coach Guus Hiddink's final game in charge of the English club. Chelsea's players celebrate after winning their only piece of silverware this season. England midfielder Frank Lampard scored their winner in the 72nd minute after Didier Drogba had equalized Louis Saha's opening goal for Everton, which came after just 25 seconds. Lampard cut inside to fire an emphatic left foot strike past Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard who could merely help it into the net. It was Chelsea's first trophy of a season in which they briefly challenged for the Premier League title and went out in the semifinals of the Champions League in controversial fashion to eventual winners Barcelona. Russian national coach Hiddink took the reigns at Stamford Bridge on a temporary basis in February after the sacking of Luis Felipe Scolari and has presided over a remarkable change in Chelsea's fortunes. ""He's a great manager and a great man,"" Lampard said. ""It's a great send-off for him and we're delighted to give him a trophy. It was amazing. After we went 1-0 down we dominated the game. I always felt we could win it and I'm pleased to get the goal that won it."" Everton boss David Moyes told ITV1: ""Chelsea were the better team on the day. I thought we were having our best spell when they got their goal from Frank Lampard. He's a big player and he scores goals, and that's what he did. ""The margins were very narrow in terms of the result but there were bigger margins on the field."" Hiddink, who will now return to coaching duties with Russia ahead of this summer's World Cup qualifiers, rated the victory as among the biggest in his career. ""When I was a young manager there was one Saturday in May when I had to find a telly to watch the FA Cup. This FA Cup is regarded as one of biggest cups and that is why it means a lot to me,"" the Dutchman said. Chelsea started as favorites, but it was Everton who made a remarkable start to the final as Belgian international Marouane Fellaiani cushioned a header for Saha to fire home with an emphatic left foot volley which left Petr Cech clutching at thin air. The strike made FA Cup history and was a dream start for the underdogs, but Florent Malouda was giving Tony Hibbert problems down the left flank, drawing a yellow card for the Everton defender and then forcing his way past him before testing Howard as the ball was scrambled away. Everton did not heed the warning and on 21 minutes Malouda was given space and time to find Drogba with a pinpoint cross which he headed firmly past Howard. Everton's attacks were becoming more sporadic as they struggled to gain meaningful possession in midfield and it was Chelsea who had the best opportunity just before half-time as the ball rebounded kindly for man of the match Ashley Cole, but his shot from an acute angle was sprayed wide. Everton manager David Moyes hauled off the hapless Hibbert at half time to shore up the right side of the Everton defense with Dane Lars Jacobsen. Chelsea also made a change on the hour as Michael Essien went off to be replaced by Michael Ballack in central midfield, but it was Everton who appeared to benefit more from the changes and from a Leighton Baines cross Saha came desperately close to his second of the match as he headed over. Chelsea's first meaningful attack of the second half came as Cole crossed for Drogba to head into the side-netting at the near post, but soon afterwards Lampard scored after being set up by Nicolas Anelka. Malouda then blazed over from close range and saw a 20-meter effort thump the underside of the crossbar with Chelsea appealing for a goal. For all their endeavor, Everton could offer little in the way of reply and it was the Chelsea players who were celebrating as referee Howard Webb brought the curtain down on the 128th FA Cup final. England full-back Cole entered the record books as he became the first player since the late 1800s to win five finals, three of them with former club Arsenal. Meanwhile, north of the border, Rangers completed a domestic double by beating Falkirk 1-0 in the Scottish Cup final in Glasgow, with half-time substitute Nacho Novo scoring a spectacular long-range winner just 29 seconds after coming on.","Louis Saha's goal for Everton the quickest in FA Cup final history at 25 seconds .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday reinstated a Michigan man's murder conviction that had been overturned because the victim's dying words were used in the trial. The justices concluded the mortally wounded man's statements to police were ""non-testimonial"" and therefore admissible in court. The 6-2 decision found police were confronted with an unresolved situation at the crime scene involving an at-large suspect. That gave officers latitude to question Anthony Covington, the bleeding victim, for information. ""There was an ongoing emergency here where an armed shooter, whose motive for and location after the shooting were unknown, had mortally wounded Covington within a few blocks and a few minutes of the location where police found Covington,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the majority. In April 2001, police in Detroit found Covington at a gas station with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, in great pain, and having a hard time speaking. When asked ""what had happened, who had shot him, and where the shooting had occurred,"" Covington replied that he was shot outside a nearby home, had driven himself to the gas station and identified the assailant as Richard ""Rick"" Bryant. After the five- to 10-minute conversation, the victim was taken to a hospital, where he soon died. Police used the statements to go to Bryant's home, where they found the victim's blood and identification, along with a spent bullet and a bullet hole. Bryant was arrested and later convicted of second-degree murder and felony possession of a firearm. He appealed, saying the dead man's statements violated the Constitution's confrontation clause, which gives defendants the right to cross-examine ""testimonial"" evidence against them, including eyewitness statements. At issue was whether Covington's remarks represented such testimony or were ""excited utterances"" that helped police assess a crime emergency. Sotomayor said police's initial inquiries about what happened ""were the exact type of questions necessary to allow police to assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim."" She added that since ""the situation was fluid"" with different officers arriving at different times and each asking what happened, police ""did not conduct a structured interrogation,"" which would normally be barred from trial without the presence of the person who had been questioned. The high court in 2006 gave greater protection to defendants over the use of hearsay testimony in criminal cases. The justices said cross-examination is required to admit prior testimonial statements of witnesses when those statements have since become unavailable. That case involved a spouse who refused to testify in court about a stabbing after earlier telling police what had happened. The Bryant case involved the so-called ""dying declaration"" exception, and whether that should be applied in this case. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted in her dissent that the question was never raised in the original appeal, so could not be resolved by the court. In a separate, tartly worded dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia, he blasted the majority for ""judicial mischief."" ""Today's tale -- a story of five officers conducting successive examinations of a dying man with the primary purpose, not of obtaining and preserving his testimony regarding his killer, but of protecting him, them, and others from a murderer somewhere on the loose -- is so transparently false that professing to believe it demeans this institution,"" he wrote. ""In its vain attempt to make the incredible plausible, however -- or perhaps as an intended second goal -- today's opinion distorts our Confrontation Clause jurisprudence and leaves it in a shambles. Instead of clarifying the law, the court makes itself the obfuscator of last resort."" He warned the court was offering a ""hollow constitutional guarantee,"" and concluded: ""For all I know, Bryant has received his just deserts. But he surely has not received them pursuant to the procedures that our Constitution requires. And what has been taken away from him has been taken away from us all.""","The court's ruling centers on the use of the slain victim's words in the trial .

"(CNN) -- Sangduen ""Lek"" Chailert is known as Thailand's elephant queen. For over a decade she has been working tirelessly to save abused elephants after seeing first-hand the mistreatment many of them faced while working in the timber industry. ""When I first saw elephants pulling logs in the jungle it changed my life,"" she said. ""As it pulled the chain to move the logs it cut deep in to his skin... I saw the look in his eye and the pain he was in. ""I couldn't get it out of my head and it made me realize I need to go and do something for the elephants, someone needs to stand up for them, they can't speak so I need to do it for them."" Chailert's response was to set up the Elephant Nature Foundation that provides a sanctuary and rescue center in Chiang Mai province in northern Thailand, where elephants from all over the country can be nursed back to health. One of the programs Chailert runs from the center is a field clinic for elephants called Jumbo Express. With a team of volunteers she travels to some of the remotest hill tribe villages in the country administering emergency health care to stricken animals. ""When I visit the villages I see so many elephants suffering but not just elephants, cats, dogs, hens and other animals and there's not much that can be done because these villages are so remote there are no doctors up there to help,"" she said. An endangered species, Asian elephants in Thailand have seen their number decline dramatically over the last few decades, with only 500 estimated to be left in the wild in the country. The 1989 ban on logging also meant that thousands of working elephants were left unemployed. With a lack of work in the forest, many elephants and their owners were forced in to the cities to beg, while others quickly became an essential part of the tourism industry working in elephant camps and circuses. 'Begging' elephants in Bangkok . Dr. Jan Schmidt-Burbach, from the World Society for the Protection of Animals, says elephants working in the tourism industry can be subjected to terrible cases of animal cruelty. ""The required extreme restraint of animals in the vast majority of elephant camps does not allow for free movements of the animals,"" he said. In an area famous for its tourist elephant camps, Chailert says her center allows elephants time to heal and live in self-chosen family groups. This is something that Schmidt-Burbach says is very important. ""Elephants are some of the most socially developed mammals in the world, with the females forming large and stable groups for all their life. Depriving them from social interaction with other elephants must be seen as an act of cruelty,"" he said. ""From the venues we know of in Thailand, the majority allow only very limited social interaction with other elephants, usually only if chained up near one another,"" he continued. Chailert believes that conditions can only be improved at grass-roots level through education. In many of the remoter villages in Thailand elephants are still used as essential members of the community's workforce and for entertaining visiting tourists. As well as caring for elephants and giving them everything from injections to medicine the Jumbo Express program also hopes to educate local people so they can care for the animals once they leave. ""It is really hard sometimes seeing people abusing the animals but sometimes it is down to a lack of education,"" she explains. Chailert says that in most cases the elephant's owner, known as a ""mahout"", doesn't have the skills or knowledge to tend to their animals properly. She cites the example of a jungle-trekking elephant that was carrying tourists on mountainous trails with a glass bottle lodged inside its foot because her owner did not know how to remove the object. ""They don't treat their animals properly when they are sick and there is the risk that disease will spread to their families,"" Chailert said. ""So when we go up there we decide to educate the villagers on how to care for the elephants with the same love they show towards their families and ask them for their co-operation to look up to the animal,"" she continued. The Elephant Nature Foundation works with various tribes including the Karen people to make sure elephants are not exploited. She says that tourism is the biggest threat facing Thailand's elephants. ""We don't want to discourage tourism, it helps the elephant but we need to educate the people in how to look after their animals in a more humane way, but the problem right now is that they see tourists there and they see nothing but money,"" Chailert said.","Elephant Nature Park is a sanctuary and rescue center for elephants in Northern Thailand .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Less than two weeks after suffering his third major heart attack, Gallagher told CNN he's suspending his comedy club career to improve his health and give him more time to work on new challenges. ""I'm sick and tired of it,"" the 65-year-old comedian said of constantly touring at small clubs. Instead, he'll finish a cartoon movie script he's been writing and try to create television shows, he said. ""If Betty White can have a career at her age, I might have two or three years of something different,"" Gallagher said. White turned 90 this year. Gallagher has been performing his prop comedy -- most notably using his trademark Sledge-O-Matic to smash watermelons and other objects -- on the road for 32 years. He suffered his latest major heart attack on March 14 while waiting to on stage at Hat Tricks in Lewisville, Texas. It came a year after another heart attack suffered while on the stage of a Minnesota club. And his promotional manager, Christine Scherrer, confirmed to CNN that the comedian suffered yet another heart attack -- albeit a mild one -- on Sunday due to complications from the March 14 attack. Gallagher was awake and resting comfortably Sunday night at a hospital in Sedona, Arizona, Scherrer said. Following the March 14 heart attack and after two stents were placed in his clogged coronary arteries and he spent several days in an induced coma, Gallagher checked himself out of the hospital. ""It's a plumbing problem, and once the plumber opens up the pipe you feel fine,"" he said in a CNN interview Saturday. The long flights and poor diet that come with comedy one-night stands could kill him, Gallagher said. ""Maybe that's why I have the heart attacks,"" he said. ""I don't really exercise that much."" Besides, ""there's no more challenge"" in the clubs, he said. ""I'm tired of going to these bars,"" he said. ""I'm just tired of it, and I want to have the time to put something else together."" Small clubs also limit his income, he said. ""Just figure it out, 250 people at $25 each. Plus, there's the advertising and the bar wants to make some money. It's not a good business."" The next challenge could be on television or in the movies, he said. Gallagher produced 14 Showtime comedy specials over 25 years. He thinks his comedy is better now than ever. He's been on the road constantly in recent years to pay the mortgage on two Los Angeles homes, making him unavailable to develop more television specials, he said. He's writing a cartoon movie that's ""like a graphic novel,"" but ""I just need the time to do it,"" he said. The cancellation of his tour, which would have taken him to Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Virginia, California and Wisconsin over the next two months, could give him that time, he said. ""I am going to stand at the end of the bar like a whore waiting to be picked up by a cowboy,"" he said. He decided to stop paying the mortgages on his big homes and let the bank have them, because he was staying in hotel rooms every night anyway, he said. He expects to continue the hotel stays, without choosing one city to settle in, he said. ""I can be anywhere,"" he said. The Sledge-O-Matic, which is just a large wooden mallet, is not Gallagher's only invention. He holds the patent on software for slot machines and a solar-powered vending machine. Before show business, Gallagher earned a chemical engineering degree and served as a chief chemical engineer at a large plant, he said. Politics is another area where Gallagher claims expertise. ""I know America better than these politicians,"" he said. ""I know what people laugh at. I know their vocabulary."" Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger beat Gallagher when he ran for governor in California's recall election in 2003. Gallagher placed 16th out of 135 candidates with about 5,000 votes. He tried out a new political joke on the CNN interviewer: ""It's still called Capitol Hill because they never had a mountain of capital."" Gallagher fans who delighted in his wordplay while dodging pieces of watermelon that sprayed his audiences can hope that he'll someday return to the live comedy stage. His promotional manager, Scherrer, says he just needs time to rest and recover. Until then, his tour is canceled. ""I'll just let the dust settle,"" Gallagher said.","""I'm sick and tired of it,"" Gallagher says of constant comedy club touring .

"(CNN)  -- Espanyol captain Daniel Jarque has died from a heart attack while on a pre-season training camp in Italy. Jarque's death has stunned Barcelona-based Espanyol. The 26-year-old defender  died at the hotel where the team were staying in the town of Coviciana. He was found after teammates realized he had not come for an evening meal. Club doctors and Italian paramedics tried to revive Jarque, a product of the Espanyol youth system, but without success. Jarque's death comes two years after the death, also from heart failure, of Sevilla defender Antonio Puerta, who died after collapsing in the opening game of the Spanish Primera Liga season. It is shattering blow for the Barcelona-based club, who beat Liverpool 3-0 in a pre-season friendly as part of their preparation for the start of La Liga with Jarque playing in the match. A statement on the club Web site, www.rcdespanyol.cat confirmed the terrible news on Saturday night. ""Tragedy struck Espanyol and the family of Dani Jarque this evening. The blanquiazul player died from a cardiac arrest. "" ""The doctor Cervera carried out CPR on the player and used a defibrillator, which showed that the arrest was non-responsive. ""The medical services continued carrying out CPR, administering adrenaline and atropine for an hour, but the player's heart did not react, so finally that determined his death. ""RCD Espanyol, broken with pain, wish to put themselves at the absolute disposition of the family of our captain Dani Jarque, to whom go our warmest thoughts."" Espanyol, who had been due to play Italian side Bologna on Sunday, have suspended their pre-season tour of Italy and will fly back to Barcelona. Jarque joined Espanyol at the age of 12, making his debut in 2002, and was given the captaincy this summer as a reward for his strong performances.","Espanyol captain Daniel Jarque dies of heart attack on Italy training camp .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- What appeared to be smoke was rising Tuesday from two adjacent reactors in the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a nuclear safety official said. Smoke spewed Monday from the same reactors, setbacks that came despite fervent efforts to prevent the further release of radioactive materials at the stricken facility. Hidehiko Nishiyama, an official with Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said smoke was rising from the plant's No. 2 and No. 3 reactors. It was not immediately clear why. On Monday, after 6 p.m., white smoke was seen emanating from the facility's No. 2 reactor, according to Nishiyama. About two hours earlier, workers were evacuated from the area around the No. 3 reactor after gray smoke began to rise from the wreckage of its steel-and-concrete housing, which was blown apart by a hydrogen explosion last week. The No. 3 reactor has been the top priority for authorities trying to contain damage to the plant and stave off a possible meltdown. Its fuel includes a small percentage of plutonium mixed with the uranium in its fuel rods, which experts say could cause more harm than regular uranium fuels in the event of a meltdown. Nishiyama said there was no evident explosion, spike in radiation or injuries at the No. 3 reactor Monday. The smoke was coming from the building's southeastern side, where the reactor's spent nuclear fuel pool is located, but the origin of the smoke at either reactor was unknown. The coolant pools contain spent fuel rods that still generate high amounts of heat. Authorities have been working to keep them full to prevent the rods from being exposed. The nuclear agency estimated that, between roughly 9 p.m. Sunday to 4 a.m. Monday, 1,170 tons of water were sprayed on the reactor and its fuel pool. In Geneva, Switzerland, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned that while signs of improvement at the site are evident, the plant ""has been seriously damaged by flood water and is littered with debris."" ""The crisis has still not been resolved, and the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant remains very serious,"" Yukiya Amano, the director-general of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, told its board of governors Monday after a visit to the site. ""Buildings have been damaged by explosions,"" he said. ""There has, for the most part, been no electric power. Radiation levels are elevated. It is no exaggeration to describe the work of the emergency teams as heroic."" On the other hand, Amano told reporters, rising pressure inside the containment unit at reactor No. 3, a concern from the weekend, was down and power had been restored to some of the reactors. The plant's owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, has been working to restore electricity to the damaged plant after it was hit by the massive earthquake and tsunami the struck northern Japan on March 11. The electric company told CNN on Monday that electrical cables had been laid to connect the No. 3 reactor and the neighboring No. 4 reactor with an outside power source. That meant that power could now be funneled to all six of the plant's reactors for its cooling systems. But electricity was still not moving to units No. 1 through No. 4 because the quake and tsunami had damaged numerous pumps and other gear. A Tokyo Electric official said spare parts were being brought in so that everything could work again. The disaster has killed more than 8,900 people and left close to 13,000 missing, many of them killed as a wall of water rushed in following the quake. Ever since, authorities have been working to avert further crisis -- and prevent more deaths -- at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, some 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Those efforts include the possibility of encasing one or more of the reactors in concrete, a last-ditch effort similar to what was done after the 1986 meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the former Soviet Union -- considered the worst nuclear disaster at a plant. Japan's nuclear agency said Monday that it expected to conduct tests on what it called a ""concrete pump engine,"" which the agency initially said would pump a mix of mortar and water into the No. 4 reactor's spent nuclear fuel pool and containment vessel, the agency said. But Tokyo Electric said later that the device would be used only to pour water, not the mortar mixture. In just over two hours on Monday morning alone, 13 fire engines sprayed about 90 tons of water toward that reactor in an attempt to cool it down. A Tokyo Electric official told CNN that six workers trying to restore electricity to that reactor have been exposed to more than 100 millisieverts of radiation. For reference, an individual in a developed country naturally is exposed to 3 millisieverts of radiation a year -- though Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare has reset the exposure level upward to 250 millisieverts for those trying to combat the crisis at the Fukushima plant. That is 2.5 times the previous limit, according to the ministry. These efforts came as concerns remained high about the impact that already emitted radiation has had on food, water and people within range of the Fukushima facility. Very small amounts -- far below the level of concern -- of radioactive iodine have been detected in tap water in Tokyo and most prefectures near the plant. The health ministry said levels of radioactive iodine three times greater than the regulated standard were found in drinking water in a village near the plant and asked residents not to drink from the tap, Kyodo News reported Sunday. High levels of radioactive substances have also been found in seawater near the plant, Tokyo Electric said Tuesday, adding that the results do not represent a threat to human health. The Japanese government has banned the sale of raw milk from Fukushima Prefecture, where the  plant is located, and prohibited the sale of spinach from neighboring Ibaraki Prefecture after finding levels of radioactive iodine and cesium higher than government standards, the country's health ministry reported. And officials in Fukushima halted the distribution of locally grown vegetables outside the prefecture. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said the contaminated milk detected in Fukushima Prefecture had not been distributed or sold. On Saturday, officials said tainted milk was found 30 kilometers (about 18 miles) from the plant, and spinach was collected as far as 100 kilometers (62 miles) to the south, almost halfway to Tokyo. That prompted a statement of concern from the World Health Organization, which said early Monday that the spread of contamination was ""more serious"" than initially expected. ""It's new and something we're watching,"" WHO spokesman Peter Cordingley told CNN. But he said the reported levels of radioactivity posed no short-term health risk, and Japanese officials were taking a ""very precautionary"" stance. ""Nobody is seeing that there's an immediate health problem,"" Cordingley said. The latest results accumulated and posted online by Japan's Education, Science and Technology Ministry showed slight but notable upticks in airborne radiation readings around Japan in recent days. But even the highest readings -- .11 millisieverts some 30 kilometers northwest of the plant -- were still considered significantly below what's considered dangerous to humans. Nevertheless, the USS George Washington pulled out of its port in Yokosuka, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Tokyo, ""as a precaution,"" according to a posting on the ship's Facebook page. The ship will remain off the coast of Japan, the posting said. The U.S. Navy previously repositioned the USS Ronald Reagan after radiation detectors found minute traces of contamination on sailors and equipment. The U.S. military is also considering the mandatory evacuation of thousands of American troops and their families in Japan out of concern over rising radiation levels, a senior defense official tells CNN. The official, who did not want to be on the record talking about ongoing deliberations, said the talks have focused exclusively on U.S. troops in Yokosuka, just south of Tokyo. Yokosuka is home to America's largest naval base in Japan. The United States will start Tuesday to distribute potassium iodide pills to government, military and civilian personnel and their dependants, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the State Department said Monday. The pills are commonly prescribed to curb the ill effects of radiation exposure. Nature has helped to minimize airborne exposure since the quake, as winds from the northwest have blown many emissions from the  plant out to sea. But the wind direction is expected to change through Wednesday, potentially pushing more of the material to the southwest and over land. ""People are watching,"" said Akira Shioi, who lives in Kawasaki. ""And people have greater concern than ever about the nuclear power plant incident."" CNN's Junko Ogura, Catherine E.

So It is no surprise that Formula One's ""Iceman"" is playing down the significance of his Lotus leading the timesheets in practice ahead of Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix. It continues what has been a promising start to the season for the Finn, who took the checkered flag at last weekend's season opener in Australia. The Circuit: CNN's look at the Malaysian GP . ""Look at this place: it is hot, it is humid and the track is completely different,"" the 2007 world champion told Formula One's official website as he downplayed his achievements in practice. ""On top of this we could see rain at any point of the race, so how should I know what is happening on Sunday afternoon? ""The only thing that I can say right here, right now is that the car is good, that the team is working fantastically and that I want to keep the lead in the drivers' standings. Let's see where these factors will bring us in the race. ""At the moment I would say that it is trial and error for all of us, and the more you are able to try, the more you have the chance to eliminate any errors. It looked good for us this afternoon, but it is Friday so it doesn't mean much."" Close behind Raikkonen was reigning triple world champion Sebastian Vettel, on a day which saw dry conditions in the morning and rain in the afternoon. The Red Bull driver recently spoke of his respect for Raikkonen, who denied that his new found pace would affect their off-track relationship. ""Seb is for me an honest guy -- and, yes, we get along very well,"" explained Raikkonen. ""What happens on the track and life outside the cockpit are two completely different pairs of shoes.

That we are running with a knife through the paddock seeking revenge after a race incident, or what?"" Tyre degradation . Vettel, who finished third in the first race of the season, admitted improvements are needed for the Red Bull car ahead of qualifying on Saturday. ""This afternoon we couldn't do so much due to the weather, but this morning it looked OK, although the tyres don't last very long!"" the 25-year-old German said. ""We need to try a couple of things now overnight to improve and take a step forward."" Double world champion Fernando Alonso was fourth fastest, edged out by his Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa who went third fastest at the Sepang International Circuit. Spain's Alonso won this race last year and he will be looking for the fourth victory of his career in Malaysia. ""Today, the car worked well in all conditions and that is very good news for us,"" explained Alonso. ""Now we must see how tomorrow goes, when it could rain at any moment and on a track where tyre degradation is much higher than in Melbourne."" Lewis Hamilton was ninth fastest as he continues his integration into the Mercedes team following his switch from McLaren. ""We made some positive steps with the set-up over the two sessions today,"" explained the 2008 drivers' champion. ""I had a good long run in the dry which has given us a lot of information to look at tonight. ""We didn't learn too much in the wet this afternoon however as the conditions were quite mixed when I went out.

Sales introduced us to a number of players in London's vast underground fraud network, who tutored us in various scams that, cumulatively, cost every adult in Britain £621 ($1,000) a year. A number of those we met were young, working-class men, most in their late teens or early 20s. One young fraudster explained that he first started scamming online to finance his wrestling action figure collection, though when he discovered how easy it was to obtain purloined credit card numbers, he graduated to more expensive items like sneakers, stereo equipment and large grocery orders (which, he claims, are then given to local single mothers). We were allowed to watch as he plied his trade, but his identity was never known to us and we were blindfolded for the round trip to his apartment. See the rest of UK fraud at VICE.COM . We also spent time with a Nigerian underworld figure calling himself Mr. Gold, the purveyor of a strangely ingenious scheme called ""wash, wash."" Gold convinces other criminals -- including, he claims, members of the Irish Republican Army -- that he has obtained large amounts of cash that once belonged to Osama bin Laden. He then charges his victim thousands of pounds to ""wash"" the former al Qaeda leader's ""dirty money,"" which has been stained brown for ""reasons of security."" The cleaning fluid, Gold explains, is prohibitively expensive and can only be obtained by bribing military personnel. Despite the absurdity of the scam, he claims it has netted him hundreds of thousands of pounds. How did we gain access to this world? Well, Tony Sales argues that he is now a reformed fraudster, and hopes that this documentary will demonstrate to the British government that they should employ him to help combat fraud. We wish him all the best.","Fraud in Britain is estimated to cost taxpayers $47 million a year .

"Editor's note: Mike Galanos hosts ""Prime News"" from 5-7 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays on HLN. ""Prime News"" uses the day's most powerful headlines as a starting point for diverse perspectives, spirited debate and your points of view. Mike Galanos says parents should help teens make decisions about emergency contraceptives. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In a matter of weeks, teenage girls, just 17 years old, will be able to get their hands on the ""morning after pill"" without ever talking to a doctor and without their parents ever knowing or being a part of this major decision. Think of a 17-year-old girl. Most of the time she's a high school senior, still living at home with Mom and Dad. She still needs her parents in the tough times. But they will be cut out of a traumatic situation. All thanks to U.S. District Judge Edward Korman. Korman stated in his order, ""The record shows that FDA officials and staff both agreed that 17-year-olds can use Plan B safely without a prescription."" Now keep in mind birth control pills require a doctor's prescription, but a drug that is more powerful doesn't? The effective ingredient in Plan B is the synthetic progestin levonorgestrel and this is also found in daily oral contraceptives. Some forms of birth control that require a prescription have levonorgestrel, while Plan B has significantly more of the synthetic hormone. Do we really want our daughters putting something like this in their bodies without a doctor? I still want Mom and Dad in on this. Some argue that a girl can get an abortion without parental notification in some states, so why not Plan B? But just because those states got it wrong by leaving parents out of the loop doesn't mean others should follow suit. And the larger point is, society must help parents, not undermine their rights by keeping them in the dark on their child's life-changing decision. Here's some perspective for you: In most states, minors can't get a tattoo, body piercings or go to a tanning salon without a parent's permission, but we are going to leave them alone to take Plan B. The ""morning after pill,"" or Plan B, is 89 percent effective in preventing pregnancy when it's taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex. It's no surprise that Planned Parenthood applauds the now broader access to this drug, calling it ""a strong statement to American women that their health comes before politics."" I question that, when we are cutting a doctor out of the decision to administer a powerful drug. Timing is essential to the drug's effectiveness, Plan B supporters say, so getting parents and doctors involved would unnecessarily delay the teen's ability to pop the pill the ""morning after."" Does it really take that long to get a prescription? I also don't buy the argument that this will help with unplanned pregnancies and abortions. The Center for Reproductive Rights says making Plan B more widely available could reduce them, but The New York Times reports that since 18-year-olds were allowed to get Plan B without a prescription in 2006, there has been no evidence of it having an effect on the country's teen pregnancy or abortion rates. But let's get back to the first point: We are making it available to high school girls. We're enabling teenagers to act carelessly with an easy way out. During a recent discussion on my show, Jackie Morgan MacDougall, supervising producer of the Web site Momlogic.com, said it best. ""Teenagers are known for thinking they're untouchable and here we are saying that they can continue to do that and that there aren't any consequences."" With Plan B, they can do it now and deal with it later. Don't tell me high school dynamics won't play in here. The boyfriend will talk his girlfriend into unprotected sex with the promise of buying the ""morning after pill"" the next day. Any 17-year-old boy will be able to buy this drug, just as any 17-year-old girl will. Yes, this could encourage unprotected sex and that means a greater risk for sexually transmitted diseases. What about the 17-year-old girl who may get Plan B for her 15-year-old sophomore friend? These are the kind of decisions high school girls will make. Korman didn't stop there. He asked the FDA to consider making Plan B available to girls of any age. That's a slippery slope and what's worse, the ones who will fall are our daughters. Think of a 14-year-old girl taking Plan B without the love, support and guidance of parents and without the medical supervision of a doctor. Yes, teens have sex and difficult situations will arise, but should we open the door for our girls to go through this alone? That is not what is best for our daughters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Galanos.","Mike Galanos: Mom and dad should help teens make decisions about Plan B .

(UWIRE) -- In spring 2007, University of California Berkeley Energy and Resources Group professor Ashok Gadgil challenged students in his Design for Sustainable Communities class to come up with an affordable and efficient solar water heater that could be used in low-income households. The heaters installed in Guatemala have made an important impact on peoples' lives, student says. Now, a little more than a year later, one team of students has already installed solar water heaters on the roofs of several homes in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. They have been so beneficial to the recipients that there are already plans to mass produce the heaters locally. The team of UC Berkeley graduate students and alumni said they are planning to enter their heater design into a national competition in October. Though the heater has only been tested in middle- and lower-class residential homes in Quetzaltenango, the team hopes to extend the technology to other developing countries in Latin America, Africa and Southern Asia, said Kenneth Armijo, a mechanical engineering doctoral student currently in Guatemala. ""The more we advance with the project, the more we realize it has an important impact on the life of people and it has a great potential to be replicated in other places around the world,"" said team member Ernesto Rodriguez, who is working toward a masters in business administration. Armijo said the team hopes the heaters will stimulate local economies. ""This is a crucial step to not only integrate technologies into the third world for beneficial resources, but to make these resources available sustainably,"" said Armijo. The team spent the spring 2007 semester working to perfect the design of a solar water heater Gadgil had presented to their class. Over spring break, team member Merwan Benhabib, an engineering doctoral student, traveled to Quetzaltenango to assess the community and see what local materials were available to build the heaters. ""Merwan found that ... households use electric in-line heaters for showering, which are costly due to the electricity expenses and hazardous since you are prone to getting shocked,"" said engineering doctoral student Sara Beaini. By the end of the spring 2007 semester, the team had built and tested a prototype that heated water up to 40 degrees Celsius-sufficient for showering, members said. During spring break this year, members of the team traveled to Guatemala to test a third prototype of the heater and conduct market analysis surveys. In the coming months, Rodriguez said he plans to survey the families that tested the heater to find out the impact it has had on their daily lives. Though the team said it currently has two heaters that have been successfully installed, there are several adjustments to make based on user feedback before they can present their finished product to manufacturing companies. ""It is one thing to develop a technology in a university lab, but another to develop it in the field with all of the uncertainties and unknown challenges that aren't always technically and socially apparent,"" Armijo said. Despite temporary challenges, the team remains confident that the affordability of the heater will dramatically alter the lives of low-income families. The group estimates the heaters will cost $100 each when mass produced. ""(Quetzaltenango) is an urban community with significant economic activity that has little access to new technologies ... there is a lot of potential to create a local industry that will create jobs, bring better products to the market and improve quality of life of the population,"" said Rodriguez.","Students at University of California Berkeley design efficient solar water heater .

"(CNN) -- While Mexico's drug wars have ravaged some regions and claimed thousands of lives, most of the country's tourist sites have remained relatively unscathed. A shootout at Mexico City's international airport may give U.S. travelers further pause about visiting the beautiful, troubled country. On Monday, federal police officers under investigation for drug trafficking opened fire on fellow officers at Benito JuÃ¡rez International Airport, killing three, officials said. Americans have visited Mexico more than any other foreign country for more than two decades: 16 million Americans in 1990 and 20 million in 2010, according to the Department of Commerce's Office of Travel and Tourism Industries. As drug violence has escalated over the past few years, travel agents have tried to reassure U.S. citizens that it's still safe to visit Mexico's famous beaches, artist colonies and archaeological sites. Aside from the February robbery of a bus carrying Carnival Cruise ship guests during a shore excursion, that has mostly been true. Casting ballots on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border . ""I've always advised people to be careful in Mexico City, and I've tried to avoid transferring planes there"" because of the hassle and bad connections, said travel agent Marianne Braly. ""I'd rather put them on a nonstop or an American carrier transferring (to Cancun) in Houston or Dallas. I will continue to avoid the Mexico City airport, for an additional reason. ... Now it's possibly unsafe."" Mexico on the rise . Travelers wouldn't fly through the Mexico City airport to get to popular locations such as Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan or Puerto Vallarta, said Braly, owner of Now Voyager Travel in Huntington Beach, California. ""My personal experience is that every place I send people in Mexico, there's never been a problem."" Journey Mexico founder and owner Zachary Rabinor has gotten a few concerned calls but no cancellations since Monday's shooting. ""It's hard to tell people not to be concerned about this type of thing, but I think (the Mexico City airport) would be more safe now than it has been in the past,"" Rabinor said. ""There's no need to cancel."" Despite bad press and travel warnings, Mexico tourism holds its own . Most AAA customers visiting Mexico tend to travel to popular destinations such as Cancun, Cozumel and the Rivera Maya, according to AAA spokeswoman Cyndie Brough. ""Most of our customers don't fly through or to Mexico City,"" she said. ""It's more of a business destination for a lot of U.S. businesspeople."" A travel agent can help you keep on top of breaking news and make any changes to your travel plans, Brough said. She also suggests checking U.S. Department of State warnings and registering with the federal agency's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program when you travel abroad. That way, the U.S. government knows where you are in an emergency. And remember to carry local U.S. Embassy or consulate contact information with you. Mexico's presidential candidates vow a different kind of drug war . More than 47,500 people have died in drug-related violence throughout Mexico since December 2006, when President Felipe Calderon announced plans to deploy troops in efforts to combat drug cartels. Yet murder rates in Mexico City are half the national rate of 18 per 100,000 residents and are lower than homicide rates in U.S. cities like New Orleans and Washington. The suffering in the country of her birth saddens Viridiana Abernethy, who married a U.S. citizen a few years ago and lives in Arlington, Texas. ""Mexico is such a beautiful country with a lot of nice places, and people are fantastic,"" Abernethy wrote in an email. ""It saddens me that many of the good people are suffering the loss of their jobs because tourists won't visit their cities. I know it's frightening, but we can't live in hiding and submit to fear.""

"(CNN) -- Could the shop-over be the new buzzword for addicts to serious retail therapy? This delicious term has been coined by a tour operator that is packaging two-destination holidays with great shopping cities at their core. Many itineraries put hundreds of miles between the closest shopping mecca and the beach, but Western & Oriental's Rome-Amalfi combination is one of many possible pairings in which a world-class shopping capital and a legendary vacation playground are linked by just a few hours' drive. Rome and Amalfi Coast, Italy . Western & Oriental suggests a shop-over in Rome before chilling out on the romantic and glorious Amalfi Coast. And the Eternal City is not all about Gucci, Prada and other Italian designer stores lining the Via Condotti; Western & Oriental puts up its guests in Monti, a hip neighborhood with some great little boutiques, happening bars and cool restaurants. In Amalfi, it's back to tradition at the Monastero Santa Rosa, converted from a 17th-century monastery. Like all the most desirable hotels along this coast, it offers fabulous mountainside views over the sea. From $2,635, excluding international airfare, for the four-star Rome and Amalfi combo: www.wandotravel.com . New York and Vermont, United States . No one disputes that the Big Apple is the shopping capital of the world, but it's less well-known that certain hotels have close links with the personal shoppers in Manhattan's most desirable stores. The Waldorf Towers concierge can arrange for personal shoppers from Barneys or Bloomingdale's to come to the hotel, or you can have your in-store purchases delivered to the hotel at any hour, leaving you unburdened as you head downtown to shop the boutiques of SoHo and other areas. Not to mention that the Towers apartments have the heady 1930s ambiance of a Fred and Ginger movie. From Shop-Till-You-Drop Central, peaceful Vermont is only a four-hour drive. The Blue Horse Inn in Woodstock is a serene place to stay in a beautiful village -- and there is more retail therapy not far away at the tony outlet town of Manchester, Vermont. Mumbai and Goa, India . You can fly direct to Goa's beaches on the west coast of India, perhaps the most laid-back and eclectic coastal paradise in the world. But it's more fun to take a couple of days to explore the country's most cosmopolitan and vibrant city, Mumbai -- not least because it's home to so much great homegrown design . The best way to explore the boutiques is to hire a car and driver for half a day and hand over a list of hot addresses. These should include Anokhi, Abraham & Thakore and Le Mill, but at a top hotel like the Taj Mahal Palace, the concierge will know the names of even newer, hotter places shoppers may want to add. The hotel has one of the world's best urban outdoor pools, perfect for post-shop chilling in a hectic town. Paris and Normandy, France . Paris is such a brilliant shopping city, you'll be footsore by the time you've combed the Rue des Francs Bourgeois and other shopping streets of the trendy Marais, not to mention the Rue Napoleon on the Left Bank and the designer haunts of the Faubourg St. Honore. A hotel designed specifically for ladies who shop is the Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, with fashion murals in the corridors and in-room macaroons on request. Kitted out in style, head for the Gare St. Lazare station and follow the chic Parisiens taking the train to the twin resorts of Deauville and Trouville on the Normandy coast. They're as different as chalk and cheese; Deauville, with its upscale boutiques and boardwalk emblazoned with the names of Hollywood stars, looks like a location for a Ralph Lauren resort catalog. Trouville is laid-back, charming and family-friendly; don't miss the fabulous brasserie Les Vapeurs for a dinner that could turn into a wild night. You can walk from one town to the other. Shanghai and Zhou Zhuang, China . Shanghai has some of the most exciting shopping in Asia: Head for the boutiques of Xintiandi, a redeveloped neighborhood of beautiful old buildings retaining a 1920s ambiance, to find some of the most inventive fashion and accessories in China. Many international designer brands are housed in Maison Mode on Huaihai Road, but it's more fun to hunt down local designers like Mary Ching, whose shoes are China's Louboutins, on Ferguson Lane. Fashionistas can now stay within a few steps of the boutiques in The Langham hotel in Xintiandi. Less than two hours' drive away, the old China lives on in Zhou Zhuang water village, dubbed the Venice of the Orient for its canals. The highlight is a picturesque double bridge, with Chinese gondoliers standing by to ply the waterways. The tiny town also has gardens to rival the more famous ones of nearby Suzhou -- but the bigger city has the better hotels. A non-cookie-cutter choice with one of the most famous Suzhou gardens on its doorstep, as well as greenery of its own, is the Garden Hotel. Marrakech and Essaouira, Morocco . The souks of Marrakech are a shopper's paradise for everything from embroidered kaftans to punched-metal lanterns to the pointy-toed slippers known as babouches. You don't need a guide, but you do need a serene place to escape to after a frenetic round of shopping. Choose one of the riads -- lovely old houses built around courtyards -- within the medina, or old city, just a five-minute stroll from the souks. Riad Farnatchi offers good insider info and has a great hammam for soothing sore feet with steam and massage. On the next leg, drive to Essaouira, a dazzling little blue and white town on Morocco's west coast with a medina of its own that's light, bright and laid-back, a complete contrast to crowded Marrakech. Essaouira's original guesthouse, the Villa Maroc, offers traditional decor, bags of atmosphere, a popular restaurant and the odd celebrity sighting. Melbourne and Daylesford, Australia . From high design to vintage fashion, resin jewelry to aboriginal art, Melbourne is Australia's shopping mecca, thanks to a diverse and creative population. It's more about the neighborhoods than downtown; check out tony South Yarra (Chapel Street), edgy Fitzroy (Gertrude Street and Brunswick Street) and eclectic Prahran (Greville Street and the fabulous Prahran Market). You can stay among some of the best boutiques at the Olsen Hotel on Chapel Street. Within a 90-minute drive is Daylesford, whose mineral springs make it Melbourne's spa bolthole of choice. The village of Daylesford itself is charming, and if you can't linger overnight, there are day spas, including the historic Hepburn Bathhouse in nearby Hepburn Springs. But it would be a shame to miss a stay at charming properties like the Lake House, which boasts an award-winning restaurant as well as a state-of-the-art spa.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- One of the two Philadelphia priests on trial in a landmark child sexual abuse and conspiracy case admitted in 2008 that he allowed a 14-year-old to view pornography and sleep in the same bed with him during an overnight visit in 1996, according to testimony given to church investigators. Monsignor Kevin Quirk, the presiding priest over the 2008 canonical trial of Rev. James Brennan, read Brennan's testimony into the court record on Monday. Brennan is accused of attempted rape in the 1996 incident and is currently standing trial in criminal court. ""Did I allow it happen? Yes. I take full responsibility for it,"" Brennan testified in 2008, adding that the behavior was ""borderline"" inappropriate. Brennan denied touching the 14-year-old or exposing himself, according to the 2008 testimony that Quirk recounted for the court on Monday. ""I was just devastated,"" Brennan testified in 2008 regarding the allegations of sexual abuse. This is the first time the 2008 canonical testimony has been revealed to the public. Also on trial is Monsignor William Lynn, the first high-ranking church figure charged with child endangerment. He's accused of knowingly transferring priests from parish to parish despite allegations of sexual abuse of minors, including Brennan. Both have pleaded not guilty. A number of alleged victims of clergy abuse have testified since the criminal trial began March 26. Both Brennan and Avery's accusers have claims that fall within the statute of limitations. Brennan's accuser, now in his 30s, was a former altar boy who cried on the stand weeks earlier as he described the incident with Brennan. The man, a former Marine, was discharged because of mental health issues. ""I was a little boy. I didn't know what to do,"" the man testified through sobs. Former Marine testifies against Brennan . The witness testified before Common Pleas Judge Teresa Sarmina that Brennan, who he described as a close family friend considered to be like an uncle, viewed online sex-chat rooms with him and suggested they masturbate together before insisting the witness sleep with the priest in the same bed. ""I was scared. I was afraid that if I said no, he'd kill me or something,"" he said, crying. The witness testified that while in bed together and wearing only T-shirts and boxers, Brennan hugged him from behind and pressed his genitals against his buttocks. He said he prayed he would fall asleep and recalled wetting himself but does not remember anything after that. During the 2008 testimony that was recounted Monday, Brennan repeated denied having any physical contact with the 14-year-old, in what may be the closest jurors get to hearing directly from the priest other having him on the witness stand. ""No, nothing happened physically between us -- nothing,"" Brennan testified. Brennan was removed from active ministry in 2006, after the witness first came forward with his allegations. During cross-examination, Brennan's attorney, William Brennan, no relation, asked Quirk whether he was aware of the sole alleged victim that came forward despite the archdiocese's making the allegations public via ""television, newspapers and smoke signals."" Quirk, who answered in the affirmative, was ordered to testify earlier this month by a West Virginia judge who noted he was a ""necessary and material witness,"" according to court documents obtained by CNN. Two grand jury reports accused the archdiocese of failing to investigate claims of sexual abuse of children by priests. The 2011 report led to the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office criminally charging four Philadelphia priests and a parochial school teacher with raping and assaulting boys in their care, while Lynn was accused of allowing the abusive priests to have access to children. Days before the trial began March 26, defrocked priest Edward Avery of the Philadelphia Archdiocese pleaded guilty to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and conspiracy to endanger the welfare of child after admitting that he sexually assaulted a 10-year-old altar boy during the 1998-1999 school year. Priest's guilty plea throws wrinkle into trial . Avery, 69, was sentenced to two-and-a-half to five years.","Presiding priest over 2008 canonical trial of Rev. James Brennan reads testimony .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Since it became a viable energy resource around 20 years ago, wind power has emerged as a leading renewable technology. Wind power is a success story of renewable energy. Finding a way to store the power it generates would increase its contribution to overall energy provision. At the end of 2006 the worldwide capacity of all wind turbines was close to 75 gigawatts, which represents around one percent of all electricity use in the world. Three quarters of that wind power usage is currently based in Europe. The Danes lead the way with nearly 20 percent of their electricity created by wind. They are followed by Germany, which generates around half that amount and Spain around seven percent. But although it's clean, plentiful and relatively cheap, there is an inherent problem with wind power. It's not always there when you need it, leaving more conventional, more polluting energy resources to take up the slack. The wind's variability has been one of the sticking points for wind power growth in the UK energy market. Given the UK's famously inclement weather and its island status -- which offers unrivalled offshore facility - you might think that wind power capacity was being filled at a rate of knots. But in reality, wind power currently contributes about one percent of the UK's energy needs, with around 2000 on and offshore turbines up and running. Whilst wind is no silver bullet to the energy problem, it can make an important contribution to the equation. This is especially true in the UK, which possesses 40 percent of Europe's total wind energy. The prospects for wind power could be greatly enhanced if cost-effective storage could be implemented. Some, like Minnesota based Xcel Energy, are putting their faith in new battery technology. But a UK professor, Seamus Garvey thinks he might have found another solution -- storing energy in flexible containers on the ocean floor. Professor Garvey's idea of using Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) isn't a new one, but his methods are. Traditionally, CAES stows energy in a vast underground reservoir. During peak energy hours, air is released powering a turbine, which in turn produces electricity. There are currently only two CAES sites in the world -- in Huntorf, Germany and in McIntosh, Alabama. Based at Nottingham University, Professor Garvey -- whose interest in wind turbines stretches back to his school days -- began his research into compressed air storage two years ago. ""I was thinking about how textile composites and textile structures might be relevant in the context of renewable energy,"" he told CNN. In a moment of inspiration, Garvey realized that air could be compressed using a wind turbine or a wave-powered device. ""Drawing a mass down within the blade of the piston itself compresses the air,"" he said. The prospects for his energy storage idea with tidal power are perhaps even better. ""With tidal power you can use a hydraulic ram. This can take a large flow of water at a low pressure. Out of that it can then give you a small flow of water at a high pressure."" Naturally, storing vast amounts of air requires vast amounts of storage. Professor Garvey envisages a cone-like structure stretching 50 meters wide at the top to around 80 meters across at the base. The bags are made of a combination of plastics. ""A polyester reinforcement at the core with probably a polythene layer around that,"" Garvey said. At a depth of around 600 meters, Professor Garvey calculates that the bags would be able to store 25 megajoules of energy for every meter cubed. The deep water is essential. ""Only in deep water, where the pressure is greatest, are the bags a good economic proposition,"" Garvey explained. Although there is an additional cost in fixing reinforcement cables and ballast, Garvey believes the future economic prospects for his invention are good. He plans to put the storage bags through smaller scale land-based tests, with four-meter-diameter bags, to prove that his calculations are right. The centrifugal force required to compress the air is too great for small wind turbines to cope with, so much larger turbines will have to be installed for the project to realize its goals. Currently, wind turbines are situated in relatively shallow water -- around 40 meters. So how will the project work if the bags need to be at a depth of 600 meters? Well, a series of pipes will link turbine and bag and Professor Garvey believes the distances, in Europe at least, wouldn't have to be too long. Research into floating turbines is underway and, as Professor Garvey points out there are steep ocean shelves off the west coast of France and Portugal and around the entire periphery of the Mediterranean. ""You could put wind turbines on these shelves and within a few hundred meters, or kilometers you could be in 600-meter-deep water,"" he said. Professor Garvey, who has secured a three year grant from German energy provider E.ON, is confident that with the right funding the UK can achieve its stated aim of providing 20 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020. ""We're probably the richest country per head in the world in terms of renewable energy,"" he said. ""But we're way behind Denmark, Germany and the United States."" He thinks that the realistic prospect for the future is a combination of nuclear and renewable energy as the best way to reduce carbon emissions quickly. The argument against wind power being intermittent and therefore unreliable may dissolve as Professor Garvey continues his research. Plastic bags in our oceans might prove to be a cause for celebration and make wind power a much more attractive economic proposition than it is today.","Wind power has the potential to become a leading source of energy .

"New York (CNN) -- With memories of a monster Christmas blizzard still fresh, another blast of winter began charging across eastern states Friday, with snow predicted as far south as middle Georgia. A large complex winter system stretched across the northeast Friday, making for messy commutes in cities like Philadelphia. The good news? The storm was moving fast and wasn't predicted to paralyze the area as the massive storm did less than two weeks ago. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings, watches and advisories for portions of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Vermont for Friday as well as Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina. Several major airlines -- including American, United/Continental, U.S. Airways and Delta -- announced to their customers that they could voluntarily reschedule flights to and from snow-affected areas without penalty. Southwest expanded the option for passengers flying in and out of not just New York and Pennsylvania airports but also to Washington Dulles and Baltimore. Forecasters project between 2 and 4 inches of snow across the greater New York City area, with heavier amounts of snow expected over eastern sections of Long Island. Snow was predicted later in the weekend for Atlanta and areas even further south. Emergency workers, criticized for their slow response to the blizzard two weeks ago, will now get another chance to prove themselves. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said New York has already instituted a series of changes in the aftermath of the Christmas weekend storm. The heavy snow over the Christmas weekend hampered morning commuters, delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours, officials said. Following sharp criticism of the city's slow response, John Doherty, the chief of the sanitation department, has made management and personnel shake-ups in Brooklyn. An investigation is underway into whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed clean-up efforts over frustrations of demotions and citywide budget cuts. Bloomberg also announced that some city snow plows will be fitted with global positioning systems in a pilot program meant to better track sanitation vehicles as officials brace for a winter storm. ""It gives us the ability to check on the location and progress of our snow plows,"" Bloomberg told reporters, saying that the devices will be added to some trucks in New York's Brooklyn and Queens boroughs where heavy snowfall last month left many residents snowbound. The city will also deploy scout teams to transmit video images of neighborhoods back to City Hall during clean-up efforts, the mayor said.","Winter storm warnings have been issued in several states .

"(CNN) -- It's easy to understand why travelers venture to some of the world's largest cities.

Yet there are potential downsides to a high density of culture. Bustling metropolises usually attract massive crowds, frustrating traffic and deafening noise. For those looking for some respite, book a room in hotels sequestered away in quieter quadrants of these respective cities.

While most hotels and B&Bs in Portugal's capital are concentrated in buzzier Chiado, Rossio and Bairro Alto, Hotel da Estrela's less-central address offers quiet nights and crowd-free streets—and the city's best restaurants, lounges and shopping are just a 10-minute taxi ride away. If places like this are still too close for comfort, opt to inch even farther out of the center at an accommodation situated in the outlying areas of a city. If you decide to book one of the grand resorts in Marrakech's Palmeraies region, you won't be within walking distance of the city's major tourist points, but you might not want to be: The Palmeraies house some of Marrakech's most over-the-top resorts, including Palais Namaskar. The hotel doesn't skimp on luxury amenities—with two palaces and a private jet—so even though it is off the beaten path, it still has everything. Shangri-La Hotel, Paris . Staying in one of the City of Light's most-popular arrondissements—any of the first five, for instance—will prove to be a crowded proposition. Go for Shangri-La's original European outpost, hidden in the westernmost reaches of Paris in the 16th Arrondissement, where your sidewalk companions are Hermès-toting locals, not fanny-packed tourists. This leafy residential neighborhood is the perfect setting for Shangri-La's opulence, which becomes obvious as soon as you see its grand, historical building, previously home to Roland Bonaparte, Napoleon's grandnephew. The interior is like a modernized palace, complete with an impressive art collection, atmospheric library, marble furnishings and Michelin-starred dining venues. Rooms, from $865; 10 Avenue d'Iéna; 33-1/53-67-19-98; shangri-la.com. Departures: World's top walking cities . The Siam, Bangkok . In Bangkok, seek solace from buzzing markets and traffic-jammed streets at the months-old Siam. It is the only hotel in the Dusit district, which is surrounded by temples and palaces and is located on the northern bank of the Chao Praya River, near the Krungthonburi Bridge. Plus, all 39 rooms here, including 10 villas with private pools (the Siam is the only retreat in the Thai capital to offer such luxury), are spread over three acres of private gardens. If you crave total anonymity, look no further. Even the chemical-free Opium Spa by Sodashi caters to the mega-recluse: The nearly 11,000-square-foot spa has just five treatment suites, each with its own steam shower and pneumatic bed. Rooms, from $530; 3/2 Thanon Khao, Vachirapayabal; 66-0/2206-6999; thesiamhotel.com. Sumahan on the Water, Istanbul . For a city that straddles two continents, it's almost unfair that in Istanbul nearly everything a traveler is encouraged to see is on the European side of town. This is exactly why you should opt to stay on the Asian half at the stylish, 20-room Sumahan on the Water (a former raki factory). While it may not offer lightning-quick access to the Hagia Sophia, it does feature stunning, uncluttered views of the Bosphorus Strait without the tourist din that haunts more central neighborhoods like Taksim or Beyoglu. Sumahan's perch on the water—minutes away from authentic fish restaurants and produce markets—and sleek, no-fuss decor make total relaxation easy. For hardcore sightseeing, Sumahan's reliable and complimentary private boat service travels to Europe in as little as 15 minutes. Rooms, from $250; Kulelí Caddesi No 51; 90-216/422-8000; sumahan.com.

Located in art-heavy West Chelsea, Hotel Americano—the first U.S. property from Mexican hospitality giant Grupo Habita—and its area attract gallery-hopping New Yorkers and international jet-set types. As far as location goes, it remains within walking distance of some of the hottest restaurants and bars in the Meatpacking District. Designed by Mexico City--based architect Enrique Norten, the ten-story, mesh-wrapped boutique hotel has 56 simple yet striking rooms (some suites come equipped with gas fireplaces), a rooftop pool that is transformed into a hot tub when temperatures drop and a terrace eatery that serves Greek fare in the summer and Argentinean dishes in the winter. Rooms, from $265; 518 W. 27th St.; 212-525-0000; hotel-americano.com. Hotel da Estrela, Lisbon, Portugal . Though not as popular as other major European destinations, Lisbon is no sleepy town. Because of its highly regarded hostels, relatively lower prices and mild year-round climate, it attracts students and budget travelers. They generally crowd the downtown neighborhoods, including Bairro Alto, Lisbon's loud nightlife center. Make a beeline for two-year-old Hotel da Estrela in Campo de Ourique, a central neighborhood whose most interesting points of reference are mom-and-pop shops, relaxing parks and 18th-century churches. When weather permits, try the hotel's quaint dining program (an extension of the popular basement-level Cantina de Estrela) on the adjacent lawn. Instead of reserving a table, sign up for an outdoor picnic towel and lunch on the grass. Rooms, from $155; Rua Saraiva de Carvalho 35; 35-1/21-190-0100; hoteldaestrela.com.

At the 40-room Hotel Santa Teresa, situated in a preserved colonial building in the middle of 43,000 square feet of gorgeously landscaped greenery, chic, tropical-inspired design awaits via burned-cement floors, tropical woods, black-and-gold limestone slate and Portuguese tiles, as well as art from all regions of the country.

The challenge of a stay in Morocco's newest gem (part of the Oetker Collection) is that it may prevent you from venturing out to explore. Its location in the Palmeraies, at the foot of the Atlas Mountains, means you are a drive away from the town square of Djemaa El-Fna and its snake charmers, the Koutoubia Mosque and thumping nightclubs like Ibiza import Pacha. But do not be ashamed to laze around the grounds and be spoiled by nearly 540,000 square feet of scented and masterfully manicured Balinese-inspired gardens, cascading waterfalls and tranquil lakes. There are casual dining options here, but Le Namaskar restaurant is a culinary masterpiece that overlooks the main pool.

"Denver, Colorado (CNN) -- Soccer may be the king of sports in Africa, but one man is on a mission to change that by uncovering the continent's rising basketball stars. Masai Ujiri is the general manager for the Denver Nuggets and the first African to take charge of an American major league sports team. The Nigerian, himself a former professional basketball player outside the NBA, took over at the Nuggets in 2010 but has been working to develop the game across Africa for just short of a decade. ""I don't just want to be the first African GM in American sports -- I want to win. I want to make an impact in Africa (and) grow the game,"" he says. See also: Luc Mbah a Moute -- African prince of the NBA . Ujiri is a camp director with Basketball without Borders -- a community outreach program run by the NBA which sees talented youngsters around the world receive coaching from professional players. He is also the founder of the Giants of Africa Foundation, a basketball camp that aims to give talented young African players a solid education and the skills to compete at an international sporting level. ""Kids come from Benin Republic or in the past we have had kids come from Ghana and Togo. I think it has been a great concept,"" says Ujiri of his foundation. ""My honest goal is to try to build facilities in Africa ... so kids have [the] chance that I got, to get to where I am."" Watch video: Masai Ujiri's meteoric rise . Since opening its started in 2004, more than 80 camp attendees have moved on to high school or university in the United States, whilst around 20 now play professionally in Europe. Ujiri hopes to generate a level of interest that will result in more players making it to the very top of the sport in Africa and beyond. He highlights Cameroon's Luc Mbah a Moute -- now in his fourth season at the Milwaukee Bucks and former Basketball Without Borders attendee -- as the type of player he hopes to see more of in the professional game. Watch video: Basketball boss scouts global talent . ""It's all up to us to find the talent,"" says Ujiri. ""Building facilities, helping coaching ... helping to start leagues, all these things are going to enhance one person somewhere."" But in Africa, basketball must compete for attention with already established sports, making it even more challenging to encourage young people to take up the game. Some of the world's most identifiable soccer stars, such as Samuel Eto'o, Didier Drogba and Michael Essien hail from Africa and are feted as heroes across the continent. A host of European football clubs meanwhile have partnerships with their African counterparts. ""I think [with] basketball we are little bit behind,"" admits Ujiri. ""I said to my friends years ago, football is going to make some kind of impression because the talent is so great. ""Look at it now all over the world you can look at any big team and see so many impactful [African] soccer players. ""Basketball will get there, I hope during my time, and I hope we can build facilities where kids can get a place to play and we can find more talent."" See also: From war child to U.S. Olympic star . Even with increased focus on promoting basketball opportunities in Africa, Ujiri is mindful to point out just how difficult it remains to be successful basketball pro. He cites his own circuitous journey to the peak of his profession as an example of the sacrifice, dedication and good fortune required to make it to the top. After ending a professional playing career in 2002, which saw him grace a number of European leagues, Ujiri worked as a youth coach in Nigeria and an unpaid talent scout for the NBA's Orlando Magic. He secured his first paying NBA gig in 2003 as a scout for the Nuggets before moving to the Toronto Raptors to work as director of global scouting. In 2010 he returned to Denver to take over as GM. ""Not many make the NBA. It's really tough and you try to explain that to a lot of African kids not many have made it that way, the Luc Mbah a Moute's [way],"" he says. He is keen to impart this wisdom to the youngsters who attend his schools and training camps. But Ujiri remains confident that with the right encouragement and role models, Africa's talented young players can become the NBA's stars of tomorrow. ""I was once a basketball player like them,"" he says. ""I grew up in Nigeria playing basketball ... there is always a way. ""Roads may be bumpy and [you] may have to take a longer path but Africa is a wonderful continent.""","Masai Ujiri is the general manager of NBA team the Denver Nuggets .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered his troops to be on the highest alert Sunday as he visited the DMZ, or demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. In his first reported visit to the tense border since taking control of North Korea last December, KCNA, the state-run news agency, said the young leader had visited ""the biggest hotspot where the gunfire could be heard anytime due to the reckless provocations of the enemies."" The visit comes amid heightened rhetoric from Pyongyang, with recent threats of a ""sacred war"" against Seoul and Washington. Current joint military drills between the United States and South Korea have been condemned by the North as a provocation. The United States says the drills are defensive in nature. About 150,000 North Koreans protested at the Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang on Sunday to condemn the South, according to South Korean media. North Korea's KCNA reported a South Korean army unit hung portraits of the late leader Kim Jong Il and the founder of North Korea, Kim Il Sung, on walls and doors of a military base and wrote ""unspeakable defamatory words below them."" Asked by reporters about the presence of such posters, Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said, ""For South Korean soldiers fighting at the front line, it's important for them to be armed with a proper mindset against the enemy. I believe the posters were placed to encourage this spirit, so responding to the North's criticism on this matter is not appropriate.""","The visit comes amid recent threats of a ""sacred war"" against South Korea and the United States .

"Washington (CNN) -- At 106-feet tall, the new control tower at Frederick Municipal Airport in Maryland could be called monumental. On Friday the nation will learn whether it's a monument to government dysfunction. Opened last May with a $5.3 million from one federal government program, the tower could be closed because of another. The stimulus package -- a 2009 law spearheaded by President Barack Obama to jump-start the economy -- was Santa Claus, giving Frederick the new tower. The forced spending cuts -- which went into effect March 1 -- are The Grinch threatening to shut the tower down. ""It's so much irony, it's almost ridiculous and laughable,"" said Mamie Ambrose, one of the controllers expected to lose her job. ""I mean, we're all so disgusted with it."" FAA says 173 air traffic control towers will close April 7 . Altogether, 238 towers are on the chopping block. On Friday, the FAA is focusing on 189 low- or moderate-volume towers staffed by contractors. In letters to the airports, the FAA said it expects to cut funding to the ""vast majority"" of the towers. But the sharpest sting may be felt at those towers that have just opened, often at great government expense and at personal sacrifice to people who moved to accept the controller posts. At least three towers, like Frederick, were built with federal stimulus money and still have that ""new car"" smell. At Albert Whitted Airport in St. Petersburg, Florida, a tower built to withstand 130 mph hurricane winds was dedicated in July. It was built with $1 million in stimulus money and $2.1 million in congressional earmarks. At Opa-locka Executive Airport, near Miami, the federal government spent almost $1.9 million in federal stimulus money on the new control tower. Both are likely to be axed. ""It makes no sense,"" said Craig Fuller, president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a national group headquartered at the Frederick airport. ""Tragically something is going to happen, and then were going to review this decision and, I'm sure, roll back some of the cuts they are considering now,"" Fuller said. Survey: U.S. entry driving visitors away . The FAA says it is facing an untenable situation. By congressional mandate, it must cut nearly $600 million from its nearly $48 billion budget this fiscal year. Because the majority of its 47,000 employees are air traffic controllers, it is impossible to cut its budget without affecting controllers, the agency says. The FAA is furloughing employees, eliminating midnight shifts at some control towers and reducing maintenance on non-critical facilities. In an effort to affect the fewest travelers, the FAA said it is targeting lower-volume airports -- those that have fewer than 150,000 operations a year (a takes off or landing is an operation) and fewer than 10,000 commercial operations. The 238 towers fall under those thresholds, including 49 FAA-staffed towers and 189 contractor-staffed towers. The FAA cuts to be announced Friday focus solely on the contract towers. The FAA said it will consider keeping a tower open if the airport convinces the agency it is in the ""national interest"" to do so. The FAA received 1,000 letters from the airports appealing the action. It has declined requests to make those letters public. But in letters released by the airports, many have cited their use by the military and medical flights, and their roles as ""reliever airports"" for nearby airports as evidence of their national significance. Closing towers will not meaning closing airports. Aircraft can use services from other FAA facilities or can use a common radio frequency to announce their intentions to take off or land. The FAA says the closures will not impact safety. But contract controllers disagree. Airports can make case to keep towers open . If the FAA said building the tower would improve safety, controller Ambrose says, how can it argue that closing the tower won't hurt safety? Controllers say closing the towers will eliminate one layer of safety -- the extra set of eyes in the tower -- while contributing to the workload at other FAA towers, which will themselves be affected by furloughs. The FAA said it will manage the system by reducing volume, not reducing safety. As a result, flights to major cities such as New York, Chicago and San Francisco could experience delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours when the effects of furloughs are felt later this spring. ""Delays in those major airports will ripple across the country,"" the FAA says. The most immediate impact will be on non-commercial flights. The 189 contract towers handle approximately 20% of all airport operations nationwide, but less than 2.5% of commercial operations, the FAA says. Advocates for contract towers argue they are suffering a disproportionate amount of pain. ""The rest of the FAA's budget is getting a 5% haircut; the contract towers are getting a 75% cut, because the FAA is cutting 189 of the 251 contract towers,"" Spencer Dickerson of the U.S. Contract Tower Association told CNN. CNN Correspondent Rene Marsh contributed to this report.","The FAA will announce which of 189 air traffic control towers will be closed .

"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- Police in the Dominican Republic were responsible for an ""alarming"" 10.5% of the nation's killings last year, Amnesty International said Tuesday, citing government statistics. A report from the human rights organization sharply criticizes the Caribbean nation's police, saying they have been behind ""scores of cases of killings, torture and ill-treatment."" ""These abuses are committed by the same police who are supposed to protect the people in the country, which is going through a rising crime rate,"" said Chiara Liguori, Caribbean researcher at Amnesty International. Speaking to CNN before the organization released its report, National Police spokesman Col. Maximo Aybar said police in the Dominican Republic were committed to protecting the public. ""We are more than aware that we are here to defend members of society, not to assault them. And that is an institutional position. In those cases where excesses may have been committed, investigations have occurred and measures have been taken: members were suspended from their posts and placed at the disposition of the courts,"" he said. Police were responsible for at least 260 of the nation's 2,472 homicides in 2010, Amnesty International said, citing statistics from the National Police and the prosecutor general. That figure marked a decrease from previous years. In 2008, for example, police were responsible for 19% of the killings in the nation. Details about the circumstances of those killings were unclear. A spokeswoman for Amnesty International said the organization does not have comparable figures for other nations. In the United States, the killing of felons by law enforcement officers made up 3% of slayings in 2010, according to FBI homicide statistics. In the Dominican Republic, the 977 people injured by police in 2010 accounted for 16.6% of violent injuries in the nation that year, according to Amnesty's report. Amnesty International said Dominican police interviewed by the organization denied torture allegations and argued that the number of deaths corresponds with police efforts to stop crime. Police also said those killed were convicted or suspected criminals, Liguori said. ""Deaths among the police and the criminals occur because the police carry out preventative patrols. If the police wouldn't do that, there would be no deaths, but criminality would remain unchallenged,"" said one police chief, according to Amnesty's report. Police also have been victims. So far this year, 97 officers have been killed, and 176 have been injured, police said. Last month a United Nations report noted that homicide rates have soared in the Dominican Republic, citing rising organized crime as a cause. Tough conditions for policing are no excuse for human rights abuses, said Amnesty International, which said the nation must reform its police force to increase accountability and stop human rights violations. ""Unlawful and unprofessional conduct by many police officers is contributing to the rise in crime and violence in the Dominican Republic,"" Amnesty's report said. ""Widespread police corruption, aggressive policing and the involvement of law enforcement officers in criminal activities are undermining the capacity of the state to protect human rights and ensure public security."" Diulka Perez reported from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.","NEW: Amnesty International: Police often say those killed were suspected criminals .

"(CNN) -- There is no title in football that hangs heavier on the shoulders of a young player than that of teenage prodigy. A spell at Benfica could help Adu adjust to the pressures of European football. Those who can carry it -- Pele, Maradona, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho -- go on to become the greatest players in the game. Those who can't fade into obscurity -- Nii Lamptey anyone? The jury is still out on whether Freddy Adu -- like Lamptey Ghanaian-born -- will fall into the first category or the second, but the footballing world should soon be a little closer to finding out after the 18-year-old's move this week from the shallow waters of Real Salt Lake and the MLS to Benfica of Portugal. Adu, who moved to the U.S. as a child and has American citizenship, already has three seasons under his belt in the MLS, having made his professional debut at 14. As an MLS player his progress has been steady if unspectacular for a player inevitably compared to the incomparable Pele. Indeed, in the eyes of some -- unfairly -- Adu has already failed to live up to the expectations placed on him. In 2003 an MLS coach told Sports Illustrated, shortly before Adu signed a $1 million contract with Nike, that Adu would start for the U.S. at the 2006 World Cup. To date he has just a solitary international cap to his name. ""Freddy, when we signed him, was one of most talented young players in the world. I think, today, he still is one of most young talented players in the world,"" says MLS deputy commissioner Ivan Gazidis. ""What we've struggled with is the expectations, not that we've placed on him, but that the media has placed on him."" For a player feted as a future major world star though, Benfica is perhaps not the destination those who had mapped out his career along the lines of the Hollywood soccer trilogy ""Goal"" would have chosen. The Lisbon club may be one of European football's greatest names, but it is a long time -- just one Portuguese title in 13 years -- since they were one of the Europe's great teams and Adu had previously been linked with the likes of Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Manchester United or Chelsea . Yet by favoring Benfica over bigger clubs, Adu's advisors have actually made a smart move. Moving to Portugal will give the teenager a chance to acclimatise to the higher standards and tougher expectations of European football away from the high-pressure atmosphere of one of the continent's true giants. Adu is also following a well-worn path for non-European youngsters. Ronaldinho first signed for Paris Saint Germain when he first left Brazil, while Ronaldo originally settled at Dutch side PSV Eindhoven. Both subsequently moved onto greatness at Barcelona; U.S. soccer fans will be willing Adu to make a similar leap upwards from Benfica sooner rather than later.

"(CNN) -- Much of the country has turned up the heat during the deep freeze this week, but for some, the icy chill is on its way out. The Deep South joined most of the rest of the nation with sub-zero temperatures Friday as a fast-moving cold front knifed its way down to Florida. Combined with moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, the frigid air dumped a dangerous mix of ice and snow throughout the Southeast Thursday night and Friday morning, coating roadways with a slick glaze. At least nine deaths around the country were blamed on this week's round of winter weather. Relief is in sight for the Midwest this weekend, however, as higher temperatures make their way eastward, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers. But the cold will tighten its grip before warmer air takes hold. An Arctic air mass over the Plains will cause severe wind chills through Saturday morning, the National Weather Service reported. The weather service has issued wind chill advisories for northwestern Missouri, northeastern Kansas, eastern Nebraska and southwestern Iowa, meaning the wind chill could be severe enough to cause frost bite or hypothermia. The South will also experience higher temperatures by the end of the weekend but that region, too, will shiver a while longer. Floridians braced for a second surge of Arctic air that promised to dip well into the southern parts of the state. Key West already set a record low temperature on Thursday, bottoming out at 47 degrees -- shattering the previous low set back in 1897. Temperatures on Sunday and Monday are expected to be in the low-to-mid-40s. The citrus growing regions in Florida and Texas will have to keep an eye on their crops as the cold air remains in the area, Meyers said. In southern Texas, the National Weather Service has issued a hard freeze warning through late Saturday morning, saying that the conditions ""will kill temperature-sensitive vegetation and could cause widespread damage or destruction to crops."" The East might not feel the warmth until Tuesday, Meyers said, and will continue to feel temperatures that are 10 to 20 degrees below average. Residents in New York City and the surrounding area, including northeastern New Jersey and southern Connecticut, won't feel temperatures above 30 degrees this weekend, the weather service reported. Saturday night is expected to be the coldest, with lows in the teens and below in some areas, the weather service said. iReport: Show CNN how how the cold is affecting you . While forecasts don't predict snow east of the Rocky Mountains in the coming days, Meyers said, a storm system in the far west could drop as much as 10 feet over the Canadian site of the 2010 Winter Olympics. Flakes are expected Saturday and may fall in the coming days on a swath of land ranging from British Columbia to the northern Sierras of California, Meyers said. The most snow -- about 10 feet -- is expected to fall in Canada's Whistler Blackcomb, the venue for the Olympic Alpine skiing event. The heavy snow is a plus for the event but could also bring threats of avalanches, Meyers said. 29-car pileup near Atlanta airport .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi has told Kaka that he must decide on his reported $92 million move to Real Madrid on Monday. Former World Player of the Year Kaka must make a decision about his future. The Serie A club's owner revealed on Italian television station Rai, he would meet with the Brazil playmaker at the start of next week to thrash out the former World Player of the Year's future. Catch up on the latest football transfer gossip. ""I will speak on Monday probably,"" Berlusconi said on Wednesday night's Porta a Porta program. ""On Monday you will all know the decision that has been taken. And to add, we will talk when we have a definite decision. ""At the moment there is no decision. On Monday I will meet with Kaka, and then we shall see. Putting aside the great friendship [with Kaka], the negotiations are in the hands of Kaka's father, he is the one who will decide. [If Kaka goes] we still have a certain Ronaldinho."" Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani said that the club had agreed to sell the 27-year-old Kaka for ""solely economic"" reasons: ""Milan can not go on losing €70 million ($99 million) a year,"" he told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport on Thursday . ""Kaka has behaved very professionally with us, he has never asked for his deal to be revised or his contract extended. He has been here six years and won everything there is to win. But we can't afford to miss out on $100 million."" Galliani said there was no chance of English club Chelsea -- who appointed former Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti as manager on Monday -- swooping in to beat Real for Kaka's signature. An agreement with Chelsea could not exist,"" he told Gazzetta dello Sport. ""Kaka goes to Real or he remains at Milan. That is his will and we are doing everything in complete agreement."" Chelsea had earlier denied making any bid for the player, following British reports that the Londoners would make a world-record offer. Earlier on Wednesday, Milan denied a Spanish radio station's report claiming that a deal had already been sealed following a meeting between Galliani and new Real president Florentino Perez. Milan's official Web site denied the report, saying that Galliani had visited Madrid purely for a special dinner in honor of Perez, who won the recent club presidential elections. On the Web site, Galliani also sounded a note of warning over the loss of star players from Serie A to the bigger spending clubs in Spain and England. ""I might sound boring, but today no one even dares to think that players like Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo can come to Italy,"" he said. ""If we don't solve these problems, we will not have the Kakas, Patos and Ibrahimovics anymore. If we go forward like this, with these stadiums, we will become a small league."" Kaka is currently in Brazil with the national team ahead of a World Cup qualifier against Uruguay, and on Tuesday had appeared to rule out a move from Italy's Serie A. ""I'll say it for the last time. The last time. I don't want to leave Milan,"" he told Gazzetta dello Sport. ""In this period I prefer to remain silent because I don't want to be misunderstood. Or, worse still, to be used. ""To the millions of Milan supporters, I say that I have made my choice. I have said what I want to stay. Leave me in peace, please."" Last January, Kaka rejected a move to Premier League Manchester City who were prepared to pay him a reported $750,000 per week.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes ""amicably settled"" their divorce just two weeks after Holmes filed for it, an attorney told CNN Monday. While no details of their agreement are public, the former couple said they are ""working together"" in the ""best interests"" of their young daughter. In the June 28 divorce filing, Holmes sought sole custody of 6-year-old Suri. Holmes and Cruise have been married for five years. ""Tom is really pleased we got there, and so am I,"" Cruise lawyer Bert Fields said.

"(CNN) -- The prison sentence for the highest-ranking CIA officer ever convicted of espionage should grow significantly Tuesday when a federal judge penalizes him for continuing his covert activities while incarcerated. According to the U.S. District Court of Oregon website, Harold James ""Jim"" Nicholson will be sentenced -- again -- at 1:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) in Portland after admitting to working through his son to secretly pass information to and get payments from Russia. The elder Nicholson received a 23-year sentence in 1997 after pleading guilty to spying for Russia, one year after he was arrested at Dulles International Airport outside Washington while attempting to board a flight to Switzerland. Federal prosecutors said that at the time of his arrest, Nicholson was carrying 10 rolls of film of classified documents as well as coded messages on a computer disk. They said he planned to meet his Russian handlers, who would pay him more than $180,000. But his covert, and profitable, relationship with the Russians did not end while he was imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution in Sheridan, Oregon. Nicholson admitted as much in November, when -- 21 months after being indicted again -- he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy to commit international money laundering as part of an agreement with federal prosecutors. At that hearing, the 16-year former CIA station chief confessed to working with his son, Nathan, to funnel information to and get money from the Russian government between 2006 and December 2008. Nicholson could have faced 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines for both crimes. But instead, he will have eight years tacked onto his existing sentence per the plea deal, a statement from the U.S. Attorney's office in Oregon said. According to court documents, Nathan Nicholson, 26, cooperated with prosecutors in their case against his father after FBI agents confronted him about frequent international travel. The younger Nicholson, a former U.S. Army paratrooper, admitted to authorities during the FBI questioning that he had not gone overseas to visit ""a battle buddy"" as he had claimed previously. FBI agents then informed Nicholson that lying to them was a federal crime and offered him a chance to change his story, according to one agent's testimony. At that point, FBI Special Agent John Cooney testified, Nicholson became more ""forthcoming."" Nathan Nicholson told the agents that at his father's behest, he made trips to California, Mexico, Peru and Cyprus, where he met with Russian government representatives who gave him payments totaling more than $35,000 in cash. During Nathan Nicholson's prison visits to his father, according to court records, ""Harold Nicholson spent a significant amount of time advising (the) defendant on how to conduct himself in a clandestine manner as he traveled to and from various international meeting locations. Harold Nicholson tried to impart his CIA training to (the) defendant."" Prosecutors alleged the Russians gave the elder Nicholson back-pay for his prior espionage activities and for details on how he was caught. ""The Russian Federation was specifically interested in how Harold Nicholson got caught by the FBI,"" according to a government sentencing memo filed with the court. It added that the information concerned ""who interrogated him after his arrest and the timing of his transfers as a CIA Officer prior to his arrest."" According to court records, the elder Nicholson and his son put the plot into motion after Nathan Nicholson complained to his father about the family's precarious finances. The sentencing memo said that Nathan Nicholson provided crucial help in the prosecution of his father. The elder Nicholson pleaded guilty on the day that his trial was set to have begun last month and who now faces an additional 20 years in prison. In an October psychological report entered into the court record by prosecutors, Nathan Nicholson took aim at his ex-spy father. ""I wasn't aware of his selfish side,"" Nathan Nicholson said, according to the records. ""I allowed myself to be blindsided. I was like a lobster in a pot, heated slowly until it was too late."" CNN's Patrick Oppman contributed to this report.","Harold ""Jim"" Nicholson will be sentenced Tuesday, again, for espionage .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Here we go again. Every time the Atlanta Falcons are on the verge of making the rest of the National Football League take them seriously beyond just an occasional tease, along comes -- well, something. Danny White to Drew Pearson. An arrest on the night before the Super Bowl. Dogfighting. Thousands of cheeseheads dominating the stands to turn the Georgia Dome into Lambeau Field South. So here we are now, with the Falcons preparing during their 47th season to play hosts on Sunday afternoon to the Seattle Seahawks in the National Football League's divisional playoffs. There will be none of that past silliness this time for the Falcons. At least, that's what those associated with the team keep saying, and why shouldn't we believe them? History, for one. Lots of brutal history. But there are so many signs that the Falcons are in the midst of a renaissance with their personal Mount Rushmore of owner Arthur Blank, general manager Thomas Dimitroff, coach Mike Smith and quarterback Matt Ryan. They've been together since 2008. They've produced five consecutive winning seasons for a franchise that hadn't managed two in a row before that. They've accumulated one of the NFL's best records (56-24) during that stretch, and they've been particularly dominant in the Georgia Dome. They also entered the postseason with the best record in the National Football Conference at 13-3 to earn home-field advantage along the way to the Super Bowl. That is, if they keep winning. And they could. Only the prolific likes of Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Drew Brees and the Mannings (Peyton and Eli) have been as consistently impressive as Ryan during the past five seasons. Plus, Blank has given Dimitroff enough financial freedom to acquire talent as he sees fits, and Smith has won enough in Atlanta to shatter the record for most victories by a Falcons head coach. Playoff weekend X-factors . The results? Three previous trips to the playoffs for the Falcons' Mount Rushmore, and three losses. Even so, before usually gabby Falcons wide receiver Roddy White decided to go silent this week with the media for one of the few times during his eight-year career, he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, ""With the team that we have now, and all the guys that have been around each other, with (Ryan) leading us as a group and knowing that everybody is on the same page, it's going to be a different outcome."" Uh-huh. We'll see. The Falcons Nation has heard this before. In 2008, the Falcons were picked to handle a rising but suspect Cardinals bunch on the road in Arizona. The Falcons lost 30-24. Two seasons later, those 2010 Falcons resembled these current Falcons by building a 13-3 record that led to home-field advantage throughout the NFC side of the playoffs. It didn't matter. With all those cheeseheads screaming like crazy, and with Falcons fans either silent or heading down the local highways by the end of the third quarter, the Green Bay Packers smashed the Falcons 48-21. Then came last season. The Falcons were just slight underdogs when they headed to New York to face the Giants. Instead, with Ryan and his offensive teammates vanishing for long stretches, the Falcons made the oddsmakers look silly with a 24-2 loss. When you combine the Falcons' recent and past playoff struggles with a historically shaky fan base that has a tendency to come and go (even during games) and with the appearances of all those ""somethings,"" this has been one of the NFL's most jinxed franchises. ""When you're growing up here, you're not conscious of that. You're not even thinking of that,"" said Terance Mathis, 45, a former NFL wide receiver who played 13 seasons in the league, including a franchise-record-filled eight for his hometown Falcons through 2001. ""After my junior year in high school, I had a chance to watch them practice in training camp, and then go through their locker room. ..."" Still, as has been the case for many around Atlanta, filled with transients and dominated by Southeastern Conference college football fans, the Falcons weren't Mathis' favorite team. Cowboys, Steelers, Raiders. ""That's where all the big superstars were from, so you gravitated to them, but I did watch the Falcons growing up,"" said Mathis, who particularly was fond of their teams during the late 1970s and early 1980s, which featured quarterback Steve Bartkowski and running back William Andrews. ""If you loved football, you loved players who played well, and they had guys on those teams who played very, very well."" Thinking fan's guide to the playoffs . It's just that, after a wretched start that lasted for more than a decade after the Falcons' debut in 1966, the Bartkowski-Andrews era featured the first of many horrors to come for the franchise. There were those come-from-ahead (and I mean WAY ahead) playoff losses to the Cowboys in 1978 and 1980, with relatively unknown quarterback White leading the way for Dallas. In both games, White kept finding his receiver, Pearson, in the clutch. Years after the Bartkowksi-Andrews era, there was Deion Sanders, the only Pro Football Hall of Famer in Falcons history, leaving with his Prime Time act for San Francisco as a free agent. There was Eugene Robinson, the Falcons' supposedly squeaky clean leader, going from saint to sinner on the day before the Super Bowl in 1999. He was arrested and accused of propositioning a female cop in Miami for oral sex, and the Falcons were flattened by the Denver Broncos in the game. Remember the Falcons' 2007 season? They wish to forget. That's when the Falcons spent most of their time discussing Michael Vick's (ahem) hobby with pit bulls instead of his ability to mesmerize opponents with his speed. That same year, Bobby Petrino didn't even finish his first and only season as the Falcons' head coach. After a controversial 3-10 start, Petrino bolted in the middle of the night with two games left to play to take over the University of Arkansas football team. Pig sooie, indeed. Now the Falcons hope to get it right this time. OK.","The Falcons host the Seahawks in the NFL's divisional playoffs Sunday .

"New York (CNN) -- David Ranta, who was released from prison a day earlier because of a wrongful conviction, suffered a heart attack Friday evening, according to his lawyer. ""My office is happy to report that he's been stabilized and is being treated in cardiac intensive care at a metropolitan hospital,"" Pierre Sussman said in a statement released Saturday. Ranta's second-degree murder conviction stemmed from the 1990 killing of a rabbi during a diamond heist. A witness two decades later came forward and said he had been coached to identify Ranta from a police lineup. After an investigation, prosecutors recommended that Ranta's conviction be tossed out. ""Mr. Ranta, to say that I'm sorry for what you have endured would be an understatement and grossly inadequate, but I say it to you anyway,"" Judge Miriam Cyrulnik said during an emotional hearing Thursday that left even the judge wiping her eyes. Hours after Ranta's release from prison, Sussman told CNN that his client intends to file a civil rights lawsuit against the city of New York and the New York Police Department. He said the accumulated trauma of being wrongfully convicted and incarcerated for 23 years had an immense effect on Ranta's health. ""David wants me to express appreciation to all of his supporters and well-wishers, not only from New York, but from around the world,"" Sussman said Saturday.

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- This could amount to some pretty pricey sushi. A giant bluefin tuna caught off the coast of northern Japan went for a record 32.49 million yen (about $396,000) at an auction Wednesday, the Tokyo Metropolitan Central Wholesale Market said. The price was the highest for a tuna since the market began keeping track in 1999. It all breaks down to about 95,000 yen per kilogram, or about $527 a pound, for the 342-kilogram (754-pound) fish. The bluefin, caught off Hokkaido in northern Japan, was ""an excellent quality"" said Yosuke Imada, the owner of the high-end Kyubei sushi restaurant in Tokyo. The catch will be split by Imada and Hong Kong's Itamae Sushi chain. ""It became a bit too expensive,"" Imada said answering questions after the record bidding. ""But the people would talk about it a while."" The New Year auction, the first of 2011, typically brings some of the highest prices of the year and is considered to be very symbolic. The record price reflects the increasing demand for high-quality fresh tuna, especially throughout Asia, with competition between Japanese and Chinese buyers intensifying in recent years.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A helicopter crashed in the outskirts of Nairobi on Sunday, killing the Kenyan internal security minister -- a man who once served as vice president and was a presidential contender in an upcoming election. Security minister George Saitoti, 66, was one of the most visible figures in the nation's politics. He was aboard the flight with five others, who also died in the crash: his deputy minister Orwa Ojode, two pilots and two bodyguards, President Mwai Kibaki said. ""The deaths of the six Kenyans is a devastating loss to our country,"" the president said in a statement. ""Minister Saitoti will forever be remembered as a hardworking and determined public servant who dedicated his time to the service of the Kenyan people."" Saitoti, an American-trained economist and mathematician, also worked for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. He served in various other positions, including minister of education. As security minister, he was among key officials who oversaw the incursion of Kenyan forces into neighboring Somalia to battle the terror group, Al-Shabaab. Kenyan trooops have been fighting the Somali-based terror group since late last year. ""It's a sad day for Kenya,"" said Najib Balala, a former minister, who blamed the crash on old helicopters used by government officials.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Temperatures were slowing warming Thursday across the South, where freezing rain glazed roads with ice, but a sprawling winter storm system remained in place across the upper Plains states. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings and advisories for more than a dozen states. The brunt of the system is poised to hit Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia, but several inches of snow are forecast for portions of Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee and North Carolina, as well as Minnesota and the Dakotas. Winter weather advisories stretched into Wisconsin and Minnesota. In Kentucky, up to a quarter-inch of ice could accumulate on roadways, the weather service warned, in addition to previously fallen snow. Three to six inches of snow were forecast for eastern Virginia. The low pressure system laid down an icy path across northern Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi on Wednesday. Scores of traffic accidents were reported Wednesday night and early Thursday. ""I personally slid through two intersections,"" one traveler said in Cherokee County northwest of Atlanta. ""I spun out a couple of times."" ""I grew up in Chicago, for God's sake,"" another driver said. ""This is an absolute disaster."" However, no significant power outages accompanied the wintry weather in Georgia. Fewer than 500 customers were without power as of about 11 a.m. Thursday, Georgia Power reported. Delays were reported at Washington's Reagan Airport and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Thursday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's flight status website. ""Winter weather in the Midwest and Southeast has impacted travel to, from, and through Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky,"" said an advisory Wednesday on the website for Delta Airlines, the largest carrier in Atlanta. AirTran Airways warned that the wintry weather could result in flight delays and cancellations, according to a company statement. AirTran passengers scheduled to travel either to or from Atlanta between 7 p.m. Wednesday and noon Thursday will be permitted to change their reservation without penalty as long as the travel is completed within three days of the originally scheduled departure date, the statement said. Up to a half-inch of ice was forecast to accumulate across Kentucky and Tennessee and into northern Mississippi and Alabama, raising the risk of downed power lines for residents across the region, the National Weather Service said. Two people died in a wreck on an icy bridge in Alabama on Wednesday, officials said, and another died in a car accident in Mississippi. Areas from Minnesota to Ohio to New York have seen more than a foot of snow in the past several days. The harsh weather stranded about 300 people in Canada on Tuesday after what a local official called the most brutal storm to hit the Ontario region in more than two decades. Some people had been stuck in their vehicles for more than 24 hours after blinding snow piled up so high that opening vehicle doors proved nearly impossible. By Wednesday, officials said everyone had been rescued. On Tuesday, record lows were set from Virginia to Florida. High temperatures were 30 degrees below average for this time of year. The cold air lingered again Thursday morning, with freeze warnings posted as far south as Boca Raton, Florida. But Florida's winter fruit and vegetable crops have so far survived the freezing temperatures without too much damage, industry officials said Tuesday.

"Beijing (CNN) -- An outbreak of polio has been confirmed in China for the first time since 1999, leaving one person dead and hospitalizing another nine, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The disease, a contagious viral illness that in its most severe form causes paralysis, difficulty breathing and sometimes death, broke out in the prefectures of Hotan and Bazhou in the country's western Xinjiang province. Among the ten cases confirmed, six are in children under three years old and four are young adults. The WHO said evidence indicates the virus is genetically linked to polio cases currently circulating in Pakistan, which borders Xinjiang. Pakistan has been affected by the nationwide transmission of the same WPV1 strain. It also warned the virus could spread beyond the current affected area. ""Although other areas in China or other countries are not immediately at risk due to the geographic distance to the affected province, the polio virus can travel great distances and find susceptible populations, no matter where they live,"" Helen Yu, from the WHO's Beijing office told CNN. According to China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Ministry of Health has dispatched a group of public health experts to the affected region to help treat the virus. It said the local government had launched a mass vaccination campaign starting in early September. WHO confirmed initial vaccination campaigns carried out by mid-September had reached over 3.5 million children -- children being particularly vulnerable to polio. Further vaccination campaigns will be conducted in the near future to ensure this outbreak is brought completely under control, according to the health ministry. ""No matter how long a country has been polio-free, as long as global polio eradication has not yet been achieved, the risk for importation remains and constant vigilance is required."" said Yu. Polio, also known as poliomyelitis, is usually transmitted through contaminated food and water. It invades the nervous system and often leads to permanent paralysis. It can be prevented by immunization. This is the first outbreak of polio in China since 1999, when a case was reportedly brought into the country from India.","Outbreak reported in western Xinjiang province, which borders Pakistan .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Embassies from more than two dozen countries have either closed down or moved operations to cities south of Tokyo since the March 11 earthquake and the resulting nuclear crisis in northern Japan, the country's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. ""There are 25 embassies which either temporary shut down or moved its function outside of Tokyo,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hidenori Sobashima told CNN. Seven of those 25 have moved to cities such as Osaka, Hiroshima and Kobe, Sobashima said. Those closing or moving included embassies from five European countries, including Germany and Switzerland; 14 African countries, including Kenya, Nigeria and Ghana; and four from Latin America. The news came as Japanese authorities reported that radioactive iodine had turned up in the capital's tap water at levels above those considered safe for infants. Tokyo's water agency said the likely source was the quake-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, 240 kilometers (150 miles) to the north. The news sparked a run on bottled water in Tokyo despite calls by government officials to avoid hoarding.

"(CNN) -- Frostbite has forced British adventurer Ranulph Fiennes to quit his attempt to cross the Antarctic in winter -- a challenge his team regarded as the coldest journey on earth. Tony Medniuk, the chairman of the expedition, said Fiennes' hand was frostbitten when he had to fix a loose ski binding with his bare hands in temperatures of around minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit). ""It is the last remaining great polar challenge,"" Medniuk told CNN. ""He was going to be on skis, in specially adapted clothing to withstand the temperatures, so that he would be the first person to actually ski across the Antarctic in winter."" Fiennes' evacuation has been delayed by a blizzard but he is expected to be transported by skidoo to the Princess Elisabeth Station about 70 kilometers (44 miles) away from his current position. From there he will be flown to Novo to get a connecting flight to Cape Town. The other five members of the expedition will continue the journey without Fiennes as their leader, Medniuk said. They plan to travel almost 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) through icy wilderness mostly in complete darkness and in temperatures as low as minus 90 degrees Celsius. The journey is expected to take six months. A Norwegian team recently completed a winter crossing of the Arctic but this is the first attempt to traverse the Antarctic. Fiennes has previously been the first person to reach both the North and South Poles by land and the first to cross Antarctica on foot. The team set sail from London in December and were building a base camp and supply depot inland from Crown Bay when Fiennes developed the case of frostbite. They are due to begin the polar crossing as scheduled on March 21. Before his latest adventure, 68-year-old Fiennes described polar exploration as a drug or addiction. ""Once you get bitten by polar records, you keep going for it,"" he told CNN. First woman to cross Antarctic solo: I've never felt so alone . Fiennes, who lost five fingers to frostbite on a previous expedition and also suffered heart problems during an attempt to climb Mt Everest, was sanguine about the risks of this adventure. ""I don't think about not coming back, because I mean, more people get killed on the roads here [London] than they do in Antarctica. I mean, I had a massive heart attack reading a magazine on an airplane. You don't need to go to Antarctica to pop it.""

"(CNN) -- A film poet and provocateur probably more famous for his bombed-out appearances on David Letterman, Harmony Korine made a name for himself in 1995 with ""Kids,"" Larry Clark's brutally unsentimental film about the teenage sex drive from a screenplay Korine had written when he was 18. Fast-forward nearly two decades. Korine, now 40, is no longer the enfant terrible. He's married, a father, and perhaps starting to chafe against the marginalization that comes with such willfully independent ventures as ""Gummo,"" ""Julian Donkey-Boy"" and ""Mister Lonely."" His last film, ""Trash Humpers,"" was a fake found-footage romp about the exploits of senior citizens, hooligans who roamed the slums at night causing mayhem. It appeared on several critics' best and worst films of the year lists but scarcely caused a blip on the mainstream cultural radar. Korine's new film, ""Spring Breakers,"" has already made a bigger splash and represents a rare potential intersection between the experimental art film and the multiplex. But it remains to be seen if fans of former Disney Channel starlets Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson will be thrilled or scandalized by what they see. Like ""Kids,"" ""Spring Breakers"" suggests that young people behave very differently among their peers than they do with adults. Although the Christian goody two-shoes Faith (Gomez) eventually demurs, her college classmates Candy (Hudgens), Brit (Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine, Harmony's wife) just say yes to any proposition that comes their way, no matter how sleazy. Time and again, Harmony Korine cuts between the saccharine platitudes Faith feeds to her grandmother over the phone about how spring break in Florida has proved a positive and empowering experience, and rather less salubrious footage of the rampant hedonism, drug and alcohol abuse, and orgiastic all-night parties the friends indulge in (some of which appears to be reality footage). Even before taking off for Florida, the girls stick up a restaurant to bankroll the trip. Hard to imagine Connie Francis putting on a latex face mask and yanking out an imitation automatic weapon back in her day. Part cautionary tale, part leering, lascivious walk on the wild side, ""Spring Breakers"" doesn't quite fit into a conservative ""crime does not pay"" mold, but when Faith resists the sweet advances dripped into her ear by James Franco's tattooed, gold-toothed, corn-rowed drug dealer, a silver-tongued Lucifer who calls himself Alien, there is a palpable sense that virtue is its own reward. Alien is a grotesque creation, a white rapper Tony Montana who bails the girls out of jail when he learns they have nothing more than the bikinis they're standing in. But in Korine's imagination these bored college kids are more debauched and dangerous than Alien dreams. Shot in hot lurid pinks and greens by Benoit Debie (""Enter the Void""), ""Spring Breakers"" has the quality of a fever dream, a narcotic nightmare in which voices loop and echo into a mantra or a dirge, and weird, stunted, self-contained scenes slip in and out of focus. It's a bad trip, but a trip with moments of blitzed out bliss -- like the odd, happy/sad communal moment around a grand piano, one of Alien's unexpected toys, when the dealer and his new entourage break into Britney Spears' ""Baby One More Time."" The scene perfectly encapsulates the perverse mixture of childish innocence and excess that interests Korine and which makes ""Spring Breakers"" something more than a subversive stunt -- an authentically cracked expression of the crazy, conflicting signals bombarding today's teenagers.","Harmony Korine made a name for himself as a writer for the controversial '90s film ""Kids""

"(CNN) -- A suspect has been arrested in the 1990 abduction and attempted murder of an 8-year-old Texas girl, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Houston, Texas, office said. Jennifer Schuett speaks at a news conference, urging other victims of violent crime to use their voices. The victim, Jennifer Schuett, is now 27. She recently shared her story with CNN in hopes of someday bringing her attacker to justice. Schuett fought tears as she spoke at a news conference in Dickinson, Texas. ""This event in my life was a tragic one,"" she said.  ""But today, 19 years later, I stand here and want you all to know that I am OK. I am not a victim, but instead, victorious.""

With determination and by using your voice to speak out, you are capable of anything."" Dennis Earl Bradford, a 40-year-old welder, was arrested at 6:50 a.m. Tuesday in Little Rock, Arkansas, authorities said. He was on his way to work, and his wife was in the car with him. DNA and other forensic testing led to him, authorities said. His DNA profile was in the FBI database due to a 1996 arrest in Arkansas.  Watch police announce the arrest » . Schuett was abducted from her bedroom, raped and left for dead August 10,1990. She spoke with CNN two weeks ago. CNN normally does not identify victims of sexual assaults. But Schuett decided to go public with her story -- and her name -- to increase the chances of finding and prosecuting her attacker. ""It's not about me anymore,"" she told CNN in September. ""It's about all the little girls that go to sleep at night. I know there are so many girls out there who have been raped and hurt. You have to fight back."" ""I remember everything; I've always wanted to remember everything so I can find the person that did this,"" Schuett said. ""If I had blocked this out of my memory, the investigation wouldn't have come this far. I'm a fighter."" Schuett says she was alone in her bed when a man crept in through a window. She remembers waking up in a stranger's arms as he carried her across a dark parking lot. She said he told her he was an undercover cop and knew her family. He drove her through the streets of Dickinson, Texas, pulling into a mechanic's shop next to her elementary school. ""Watch the moon. The moon will change colors, and that is when your mom will come to get you,"" she recalled him saying. ""Oh, it looks like she is not coming."" Schuett said he drove her to an overgrown field next to the school and sexually assaulted her. She passed out. When she regained consciousness, she was lying naked on top of an ant hill with her throat slashed from ear to ear, and her voice box torn. She was found at 6 p.m. on a hot August day after lying in the field for nearly 12 hours. She was rushed to a hospital in critical condition. ""Three days after the attack, I started giving a description. The doctors told me I would never be able to talk again, but I proved them all wrong,"" Schuett said. She believes she got her voice back so she could tell her story. Houston FBI Special Agent Richard Rennison is one of the lead investigators in the case, along with Dickinson police Detective Tim Cromie. Read the affidavit . Both men were discussing the case when Rennison received a memo from the FBI's Child Abduction Rapid Deployment (CARD) team seeking child abduction cases that had gone cold and could be retested for DNA evidence. Schuett's was one of the cases selected. Rennison, who has 10 years of experience in child abduction cases, said he has never seen a case like Schuett's. ""This is the only one that I can think of that the victim has suffered some traumatic injuries and survived,"" he said, ""The main reason the CARD team picked this case was because she was alive. In cases of child abduction, it is rare that the child is recovered alive. Frequently, you recover a body. And most times, you never find them."" The investigators found evidence collected 19 years ago, which was retested. It included the underwear and pajamas Schuett was wearing, as well as a man's underwear and T-shirt, which were found in the field where Schuett was left for dead. The clothes were tested in 1990, but the sample wasn't large enough for conclusive results. But now, modern techniques allow DNA to be isolated from a single human cell. They were still awaiting the results when CNN featured Schuett's story in late September.","Welder Dennis Earl Bradford, 40, arrested in Little Rock, Arkansas .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York City police officer accused of conspiring to kidnap, rape, torture and cook a number of women and eat their body parts has been arrested and charged in the case, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan said Thursday. Gilberto Valle, 28, a six-year NYPD veteran, was arrested Wednesday at his home in Queens. He is accused of illegally accessing a national crime database to locate potential targets, scouting some of them at their homes and workplaces and exchanging e-mails and instant messages with alleged co-conspirators about plans to target women, the attorney's office said. ""Gilberto Valle's alleged plans to kidnap women so that they could be raped, tortured, killed, cooked and cannibalized shock the conscience,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. ""This case is all the more disturbing when you consider Valle's position as a New York City police officer and his sworn duty to serve and protect. Our investigation is ongoing."" According to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation, Valle apparently discussed the plans with other men on a website for people who fantasize about cannibalism. Authorities have no evidence he planned to carry out any of the acts he allegedly plotted with others on the online fantasy website, the law enforcement source says. The source says Valle has a clean record. Appearing in a federal court in Manhattan on Thursday, Valle was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping and one count of illegally accessing and getting information from the National Crime Information Center database. He did not enter a plea and is being held without bail. At Thursday's court proceeding, his lawyer Julia Gatto said the alleged plans discovered by authorities on Valle's computer amounted to ""just talk."" ""At worse, this is sexual fantasies with people he knows,"" the defense attorney said. The NYPD has suspended him without pay, a department spokeswoman said Thursday. A criminal complaint filed in federal court says Valle was in contact with at least two women mentioned in his plans, though FBI spokesman J. Peter Donald told CNN the agency has ""no information to believe Mr. Valle harmed anyone at this time."" The investigation began in September when the FBI learned that Valle was sending e-mails and instant messages from his home computer, detailing his plans, the bureau said. A search of his computer revealed a database of ""at least 100 women and containing at least one photograph of each woman,"" according to a statement from Bharara's office. ""The computer also contained personal information about some of these women -- including relevant addresses, physical descriptions and photographs -- and electronic communications in which Valle and co-conspirators detailed their plans."" The FBI declined to say how it learned of Valle's electronic communications. A law enforcement source told CNN that Valle's estranged wife contacted authorities after finding pornography on his computer. According to the court documents, the computer contained a document that Valle allegedly created in July, containing an action plan to cook a certain woman that authorities identify as ""Victim 1."" The title, authorities say, was ""Abducting and Cooking [Victim 1]: a Blueprint."" The plan, which had information about the woman's name, date of birth, height, weight and bra size, has a section called ""Materials Needed,"" in which Valle allegedly wrote: . ""Car (I have it) Chloroform (refer to website for directions) Rope (Strongest kind to tie her up."" The court documents say Valle also exchanged online messages with an alleged co-conspirator about planning to abduct and cook Victim 1. In one of the exchanges, according to the court documents, Valle allegedly wrote, ""She does look tasty, doesn't she?"" ""You do know if we don't waste any of her there is nearly 75 lbs of food there,"" the other person replied, according to the court documents. The complaint also says Valle negotiated in February with a different person on a price for Valle to kidnap a different woman, whom the complaint identifies only as Victim 2. Valle wrote of kidnapping the woman for the alleged co-conspirator for $5,000, and resisted the co-conspirator's attempt to lower the price, the complaint says. ""Like I said this is very risky and will ruin my life if I am caught,"" Valle wrote, according to the complaint. ""I really need the money and I can't take under $5,000 for [Victim 2]."" The complaint also accuses Valle of illegally getting information about a third woman, Victim 3, from the National Crime Information Center database. The name of that woman matched a name that investigators found in Valle's alleged files of women on his home computer, the complaint says. The women in Valle's alleged database live in the United States and overseas, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. At least three of them know Valle, another law enforcement source said. Court documents show one of the alleged targets dined with Valle at a Maryland restaurant. The 100 women are in the process of being identified, then notified by federal and local authorities. CNN's Deb Feyerick, Ross Levitt and Jason Kessler in New York and Jason Hanna in Atlanta contributed to this report.","NEW: The defendant doesn't enter a plea and is being held without bail .
