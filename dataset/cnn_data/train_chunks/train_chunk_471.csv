"By . Sara Nelson . UPDATED: . 12:33 EST, 10 November 2011 . Thousands of Iraqi women and girls have been trafficked out of the country for sexual exploitation since the U.S. invasion in 2003 (file picture) Thousands of women and girls have been trafficked out of Iraq for sexual exploitation since the U.S. invasion in 2003. The findings, by the Social Change for Education in the Middle East (SCEME), say the victims are being transported to neigbouring Middle Eastern countries, most notably to Syria and Jordan, but also as far afield as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. A report entitled Karamatuna (Our Dignity) highlights the plight of young Iraqi refugee women and girls since the downfall of Saddam Hussein. While it remains unknown just how many female refugees have been subjected to sex trafficking, according to the Iraqi NGO the Organisation for Women’s Freedom in Iraq, 4,000 women, one fifth of whom are under 18, disappeared in the first seven years since the invasion. Clinical researcher Iman Abou-Atta acknowledges sexual exploitation existed in Iraq long before the invasion, but told a hearing at London’s House of Lords ahead of publication that the war and instability that followed ‘led to an environment where young women and girls became much more vulnerable to trafficking.’ As well as sex trafficking by criminal gangs, family members are also known to have become involved in the phenomena, with sales and forced marriages prevalent to overcome economic hardship, resolve disputes and pay debts. The downfall of Saddam Hussein created an environment where young girls and women became much more vulnerable to trafficking . The report suggests the majority of young girls and women are targeted while still inside Iraqi borders, many of whom have left their families because of fear, abuse, threats of forced marriage or violence. Kidnappings also take place with research revealing taxi drivers are often used to entrap victims with promises of help. It cites experiences by young Iraqi women, including that of 17-year-old Amira, who was ‘sold’ by her father to a man who offered the family $200 a month to supposedly take care of his handicapped wife. As well as housework, the teenager was forced to have sexual intercourse with the son, and friends of the man who hired her. The story of Nada, who was sold to an Iraqi gang by her prostitute mother after her father was killed, is equally harrowing, albeit with a happier ending. Kidnappings are common and trafficking women is a profitable business in Iraq . The 17-year-old was taken to Jordan where she was gang-raped by four men. She managed to escape and return to Iraqi where an Iraqi family helped her get a new passport from the immigration department. The report is critical of the fact Iraq has no procedures in place to identify and prosecute traffickers. Nor does it offer official protection to victims – many of whom find themselves punished for crimes committed as a result of trafficking, including forced prostitution. Hakary Dzayi, of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Centre (TraCCC) confirmed: ‘Those in power expedite the way for traffickers because trafficking in females has a big profit, the good bribes motivate them to not follow the cases of the trafficked women.’ In conclusion, the report calls for help from the international community and for more research to help put figures on the number of women and girls being trafficked out of the country. It welcomes the growing focus on women’s rights in light of the Arab Spring, but warns of the increasing instability across the region and its potential to exacerbate the problem. Pledging to further the cause of victims, it adds: ‘Trafficked and prostituted women and girls are victims of poverty, conflict and violence. 'They are not criminals and do not constitute a threat to society, and rather than being punished as offenders by unjust judicial systems, they must be protected. ‘Where laws exist to protect them, then officials must be trained because without a fundamental shift to full application of protective legislation, sex-trafficking will continue.","Fresh report highlights massive scale of phenomenon .

Inspiration: The hill-top holiday home of Charles Dickens, which sits on the sea front in Broadstairs, Kent, was the inspiration for Bleak House . Dickens was famed for weaving into his works the characters and events from his every day life. The names of Bill Sikes and Scrooge may have derived from real people linked to the famous writer. The thug in Oliver Twist, the famous Christmas Carol miser and the ghost of his deceased partner have all been associated with people who worked or lived near Dickens's first London home. According to the research, a trader named William Sykes lived in the same east Marylebone street as Dickens when the writer was a teenager. Many of his homes, the bricks and mortar, also found themselves as the setting of novels. 1812 February 7: Charles Dickens is born at 1, Mile End Terrace, Landport, .

Delighted: Genevieve Drinkwater was told by doctors she had less than a one per cent chance of conceiving naturally. But in December last year she gave birth to twins. She is pictured here with husband Robert and babies Florence and Beatrix . For many women, a thoughtful card from their son or daughter is enough to make them feel extra special on Mother's Day. But for one woman, just being able to call herself a mother is more than enough. Genevieve Drinkwater was told by doctors she had less than a . one per cent chance of conceiving naturally. But she is now celebrating her first ever Mother's Day - . as the proud mum of twins. With her husband Robert, the couple were told by doctors that it would be practically impossible for them to conceive naturally. They went through more than two years of tests at the Bristol Centre for Reproductive Medicine before they were stunned to discover Mrs Drinkwater was pregnant with twins. And in December last year, babies Florence and Beatrix arrived safely. The couple, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, had not been planning to start a family for a few years. But doctors told them that Genevieve had polycystic ovaries and, while her husband had a good sperm count, they were told it might need a little help in moving towards her eggs. They were told there was less than a one per cent chance of conceiving naturally. Once fertility treatment had been mentioned the couple decided that they should consider starting a family earlier. Mrs Drinkwater said: 'When you are younger you just assume that when you want a child you will have one, that you might try for a couple of months and will be pregnant. 'My husband and I said we would wait until we were 30 but then things were sped up a little bit. 'I am ever so glad that we found out because lots of people try for years and years before they realise.' Mrs Drinkwater was given drugs that might improve her fertility, but after a year the couple decided to try a procedure called intrauterine insemination (IUI). The procedure involved the business advisor being given hormones so they could be sure of when her egg would be released. The sperm is then prepared and inserted directly into the womb. Happy: The couple look on adoringly at their twin babies. They have told how grateful they are to the NHS for helping them start a family . They were told that they could have . three rounds of the treatment funded by the NHS and on the second . attempt she became pregnant with her twin daughters. She added: 'With the first round we had done everything to the letter. I gave up coffee didn't eat certain foods and when it didn't work it was quite disappointing. 'I started to resign myself to the fact we might not have any children and started to relax a lot more and then we heard in April.' The couple had gone on a cruise to take a break after all the journeys back and forth to Southmead for treatment and tests and did a pregnancy test while they were away. Mrs Drinkwater said the second round of insemination had almost been cancelled because they were not sure it would work so the news of her pregnancy was all the more special. The first scan was carried out at six weeks and the couple spotted what looked like 'two grains of rice' but would not believe they were their twins until further into the pregnancy . After the arrival of the twins the couple sent a thank-you card to the Bristol Centre for Reproductive Medicine thanking them for their efforts and the time that consultants spent talking through their options. 'The treatment was outstanding, from the communication through to the technical procedures,' Mrs Drinkwater said. 'We are really grateful for having the NHS.'",Genevieve Drinkwater is now the proud mother of Florence and Beatrix .
"By . Katherine Faulkner . UPDATED: . 03:50 EST, 22 February 2012 . A law student has won thousands of pounds in compensation from a Chinese restaurant after it sacked him for being white. David O’Neill had been working as a waiter to help pay for his degree but was sacked when workers were brought in from China. Unable to afford a solicitor, the 19-year-old – who has only just begun his studies – decided to represent himself in a tribunal. David O'Neill won his legal fight against a Chinese restaurant after claiming he had been sacked for being white . He has now won a £5,000 pay-out after it found he had been discriminated against. Mr O’Neill started working at the Ocean Dragon restaurant, in the centre of Birmingham, in May 2010. When a Chinese manager took over in October that year, he cut Mr O’Neill’s shifts from 25 hours a week to six – and eventually to nothing. The student asked for more work, but he was ‘fobbed off’ and told there was none. Signs inside the restaurant’s staff areas had been changed into Chinese so he could not understand them. The final straw came when he found out that one of the Chinese employees had racked up a  60-hour week. He was told by a fellow employee: ‘You’ve got no chance of getting any more hours – they’re all going to the new staff.’ The Ocean Dragon, in Birmingham's Chinese quarter, drastically cut Mr O'Neill's hours and handed his shifts to workers from China . Mr O’Neill, who studies at Staffordshire University, said: ‘I was quite happy to work alongside the Chinese staff even though I was the only non-Chinese employee. ‘But the manager obviously wasn’t happy working with me. ‘I felt I was being discriminated against because I was white. I was frustrated, angry and upset. They were treating me in a manner which was clearly racist.’ Mr O'Neill, pictured here at his home in Selly Oak, Birmingham, said he was forced to sell his car after losing the job . When he made a written complaint to the restaurant, it denied all knowledge of him ever working there. By this time the student had to sell his car because he was so short of money. ‘They seemed to completely disregard and push my grievances aside,’ he said. ‘I felt I had no option but to begin legal proceedings.’ Referring to his inexperience with legal matters, the student added: ‘I was improvising, really. I had no idea what I was doing. ‘My family were helping me through it, but I did keep thinking – is this really going to work? ‘At one point, I was almost ready to drop it, but my family told me to keep it up.’ Mr O’Neill’s hard work paid off this week when he was awarded compensation of £5,322.89 by a tribunal in Birmingham. The judgment stated that he had been ‘discriminated against’ and ‘subjected to less favourable treatment’ because of his race and had been ‘subject to an unfair dismissal’. The payout included £2,000 for injury to his feelings. However, the restaurant is refusing to pay up and a High Court-appointed bailiff is expected to be sent in to recover the money. Mr O’Neill said: ‘I have had no contact whatsoever from them since the judgment. ‘Some people seem to think they are above the law. ‘How can they still think it is fine not to pay the court?’ After his success in the case the student, from the Selly Oak area of Birmingham, has decided he would like to specialise in employment law. ‘I want to help other people in the same situation that I was in.’ No one from the restaurant was available for comment yesterday.",David O'Neill's hours dropped after new manager was brought in .

Charged: Rachel Farrell, 25, is alleged to have carried out an extended affair with an 11th grade pupil at Bangor Area High School in Pennsylvania . A former high school teacher has been charged with having sex with a 17-year-old student on 'numerous occasions'. Rachel Farrell, 25, is alleged to have carried out an extended affair with an 11th grade pupil she was teaching reading to at Bangor Area High School in Pennsylvania. She has since resigned and has now been charged with three counts of corrupting a minor. The case is the latest to concern a female teacher who has been jailed for, or accused of, having sex with a student. Police believe Farrell also had sexual relationships with up to three other 17-year-old students, Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said yesterday. She faces further charges should these teenagers decide to testify against her. Mr Morganelli said: 'This particular case was the case we could bring. This may be it. 'It may be that we just don't bring other cases for reasons of lack of cooperation from the alleged victims. 'Farrell forfeited her career. [Sleeping with an underage student] is just not right, it's wrong and it constitutes a crime under our crimes code.' Farrell taught at Bangor Area High School under her maiden name, Rachel Warner, but has been on administrative leave since December when the allegations first emerged. Mr Morganelli said she admitted to both police and her employers that she had slept with two 17-year-old students. She married in June 2010 and is accused of conducting an affair with the student between August of that year and January 2011. Police said the teenager, now 18, admitted having sex with Farrell at 'numerous times at many different locations' such as secluded parking spots. Their relationship is said to have begun after the pair began talking on Facebook and through text messages. Bangor . Area High School superintendent Patricia Mulroy said the district . confronted Farrell as soon it found out about the accusations against . her and that the matter was turned over to county prosecutors. Police believe Farrell also had sexual relationships with up to three other 17-year-old students at Bangor Area High School (pictured) Farrell, of Palmer Township, is free on $5,000 bail. She has cooperated with police, but the investigation is ongoing, Mr Morganelli said. The age of consent in Pennsylvania is 18 for the corruption of minors. Bangor Area High School is no stranger to controversy. A biology teacher fatally overdosed on heroin in 2009, while a male teacher's aide was jailed after admitting drug possession charges and of supplying drugs to students, one of whom went on to kill himself. In 2010, a nude photo of a female teacher's aide was circulated on students' mobile phones. Female teachers having sex with their students has dominated the headlines in recent weeks. Just yesterday, a mother-of-two was found guilty of having sex with a 15-year-old boy she taught tap dancing. Kimberly Sauto, 34, from North Ridgeville, Ohio, had denied having sex with the teenager in the back of her car in August 2011. On Monday, it emerged that a high school teacher has been accused of having 'intimate sexual relationships' with two of her students, kissing a third on the lips and exchanging inappropriate texts and emails with a third. Joanne Léger-Legault, from Ottawa, Canada, was stripped of her teaching permit and fired by the city’s public school board over the allegations. During last week alone, a Reno teacher who had sex with a student and oral sex with six others was jailed; a teacher in New York was sacked after she allegedly performed sexual acts with two pupils and gave them drugs and alcohol; Lousiana teacher was charged with having sex with one of her former pupils and sending him sexually explicit text messages; and an Arizona band teacher was sentenced to 15 years in prison for having a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old student.","Rachel Farrell, 25, is alleged to have carried out an extended affair with an 11th grade pupil .

In a four-minute video on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the outspoken actor urges Americans to boycott Ringling Bros and other circuses because of their inhumane treatment of elephants. He claims that elephants live very different lives than their wild cousins and from a young age are ‘stretched out, slammed to the ground, gouged with bull hooks, and shocked with electric prods.’ Scroll down for video . Outspoken: In a video on behalf of PETA, Alec Baldwin details the abuse circus elephants must endure . Horrific beginnings: Baldwin says elephants are 'broken' at a young age, and are pulled, prodded, and zapped . In the video, Baldwin describes the apparent horrors suffered by elephants in the circus. ‘Having worked with actors for many years, it’s hard to believe that anyone would have to be dragged kicking and screaming into show business,’ Baldwin begins. ‘But for the elephants for Ringling Bros and other circuses, that’s exactly what happens.’ The Emmy-award winning actor cites a 2009 PETA investigation first reported by the New York Daily News in which animal handlers are shown beating elephants moments before they appear in the ring. Shocking: One video shows circus trainers whipping the elephants and prodding them with bull hooks . Broken: The actor said elephants' spirits are broken for the brief amusement of circus-goers . Baldwin says the conditions in which these elephants live is deplorable, adding that the pachyderms are ‘kept chained and confined to cramped boxcars. ‘The lack of mental and physical stimulation results in severe frustration, and is the reason why you frequently see elephants in circuses swaying back and forth,’ he explains. A spokesman for Ringling Bros Barnum & Bailey condemned the video for rehashing old footage and distorting its meaning. ‘The health and vitality of our animals is something we can showcase at every Ringling Bros performance,’ Stephen Payne told the New York Daily News. ‘We invite families everywhere to come and see for themselves how all the animals are thriving at “The Greatest Show on Earth.”’ Cramped quarters: Elephants are also kept chained in less-than clean quarters with little mental or physical stimulation . However, Feld Entertainment – which owns the circus company – agreed to pay a $270,000 fine last November for allegedly violating the Animal Welfare Act. Though the company never admitted to any wrongdoing or violating regulations, it is still the largest AWA fine on record.Since the settlement, employees who work with animals must undergo AWAK compliance training.PETA is also in a battle against HBO’s now-cancelled series Luck.

University of Denver, and Craig Hospital. Spree: Thefts from public toilets were reported at 18 locations across Denver, but police suspect the 'Crapper Scrapper' hit even more places . The alleged ‘crapper scrapper’ was spotted by one business’ vigilant employee realized what Citron was allegedly doing. Ms Greaser said: ‘He watched the suspect walk in to the bathroom and leave with the parts from the toilet. 'And he walked outside and got a license plate number and it just went from there.’ Investigators say there are 18 known cases of the toilet theft, which include the Southwest Plaza Mall in the family restroom area, a Littleton Chick-fil-A, a Denver Taco Bell, King Soopers, and the Bowles Crossing cinema. But based on the number of trips to scrap yards, detectives suspect Citron has hit other businesses as well. Ms Greaser said: ‘We believe we’ve only hit the tip of what he’s done and we believe that there are several more that are not reported.’","Plumber, 48, accused of stripping lavatories of metal worth thousands of dollars .

An unemployed and mentally ill South Carolina mother pleaded guilty on Friday to suffocating her two toddlers and then leaving their bodies in car seats in a vehicle she dumped in a river. Shaquan Duley, 30, pleaded guilty to two counts of murder. She faces 30 years to life on each count when she is sentenced later this month, prosecutor David Pascoe said. Tearful: Shaquan Duley, 30, pleaded guilty to suffocating her two young sons . Gone too soon: Devan (left) was two and his brother Je'Van was 18 months . 'She accepted criminal responsibility for what she did,' Mr Pascoe said. The case was similar to that of another South Carolina mother, Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons, three-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alexander in a vehicle in 1994. Duley suffocated her two children, two-year-old Devean and 18-month-old Ja'van, in August 2010. Police said she snuffed out their lives by putting her hand over their mouths, then placed the bodies in a car that she pushed over an embankment into the Edisto River. Police at the time said she confessed after initially lying about the deaths and trying to make them look accidental. 'She was a mother that was unemployed. She had no means of taking care of her children,' then-Sheriff Larry Williams said in 2010. Culpable: The prosecutor today said she accepted responsibility for what she did as she broke down in tears . Now and then: Duley pictured arriving at a hearing in 2010 (left), and pictured today in court (right), heavily cuffed and wiping away tears . 'The responsibility of being a mom was a bit much for her. She was living with her mother. I believe she was fed up with her mother telling her that she couldn't take care of the children, or she wasn't taking care of the children. ‘She just wanted to be free.' Emotional testimony came from family members supporting Duley, a single mom who said she had been depressed. 'She snapped on August 15,' Pascoe said on Friday. 'There was no evidence that she had been planning this out.' A state-appointed forensic psychiatrist found last summer that Duley suffered from mental illness but that she knew right from wrong and knew what she was doing when she killed her children, Pascoe said. The father of Duley's children was never located, the Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office said.

Children whose mothers use crystal meth during pregnancy will be more prone to anxiety, depression and moodiness in later life, scientists have revealed. So-called 'meth babies' are also more likely to weigh much less when they are born and suffer from drowsiness and stress in their formative years. Researcher Linda La Gasse said the combination meant they were at higher risk of developing serious behavioural problems than other children. Study: Children whose mothers use crystal meth during pregnancy will be more prone to anxiety and depression . But while there was certain similarities to 'crack babies', whose mothers consumed crack cocaine while pregnant, 'meth babies' could be in greater danger. This was because, she said, meth has a strong effect on the brain and is therefore more likely to have longer-lasting effects in children. The first study to look at methamphetamine's potential effects was conducted by Brown University's Centre of the Study of Children at Risk and published online today in Pediatrics. Government data suggests more than 10million Americans have used meth, with around one per cent of users being pregnant women. Poison: Crystal Meth is the street name for methamphetamine, the most hyper-charged member of amphetamine family which is usually smoked through a pipe .

Midwest and West, areas where meth use is most common. Mothers were recruited shortly after . giving birth in Des Moines, Iowa; Honolulu, Los Angeles, and Tulsa, . Oklahoma. They were asked about prenatal meth use and newborns' stools . were tested for evidence of the drug. Effects in children exposed to the drug were compared with those whose mothers did not use meth. Both groups were high-risk children, with many living in disadvantaged homes. Mothers or other caregivers completed a widely used checklist asking how often children showed many kinds of troublesome behaviour. At three-years-old cores for anxiety, depression and moodiness were slightly higher in meth-users' children. These differences persisted at age five. The older children who had been exposed to meth also had more aggression and attention problems similar to ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Mothers were asked about symptoms, but not if their children had ever been diagnosed with behaviour disorders. More than half of the mothers who had used meth during pregnancy also used it afterwards. These women also were more likely to use other drugs during and after pregnancy and to be single mothers. But the researchers said accounting for those differences and others in the two groups' family lives did not change the results.

"By . Oliver Pickup . UPDATED: . 05:01 EST, 3 November 2011 . Mohammad Amir's claim that his cricket fixing was 'isolated' to just one game has today been thrown out by the judge who will sentence him and two teammates. The fast bowler and fellow Pakistani cricketers Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif were found guilty at Southwark Crown Court yesterday and face seven years behind bars. But Amir, who was 18 when a newspaper sting lifted the lid on the spot-fixing scandal after a number of no-balls were bowled against England at Lord's in August 2010, protested that he should be given a lenient sentence as that was the only Test in which he had cheated. Scroll down to see a video of how the match-fixing scandal was uncovered . Sentencing: Mohammad Amir, the 19-year-old Pakistani fast bowler, arrives at Southwark Crown Court yesterday . Unlike his two teammates, who were convicted of conspiracy to cheat at gambling and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments yesterday, Amir pleaded guilty to the charge, insisting that he was forced to bowl no-balls in that single match. However, Mr Justice Cooke dismissed his claims that it was 'an isolated and one-off event' and ruled that text messages sent from shadowy contacts in Pakistan suggest the young cricketer was also implicated in fixing during the Oval Test earlier in the summer. Amir's lawyers agreed a basis of plea with prosecutors when he admitted conspiracy to cheat and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments at a pre-trial hearing in September. This noted: 'The defendant's involvement was limited to the final Test match at Lord's on August 26 and 27. 'This was the defendant's first and only involvement, and was therefore an isolated and one-off event. 'The defendant only became involved as a result of pressure (not amounting to physical threats) and influence to the effect that if he did not become involved, he would suffer serious professional implications for his future career.' Cheat: The teenager is shown performing one of the no-balls that were found to be pre-determined when Pakistan played England at Lord's in August 2010 . Agent Mazhar Majeed (left), stung by the News of the World, arrives at Southwark Crown court in London yesterday, separately from Amir (right) But the judge told the court: 'I refuse to accept that basis of plea on the material I have seen. 'There are certainly texts and the like which suggest that Amir's first and only involvement was not limited to Lord's, it was not an isolated and one-off event. 'What I have in mind are the various texts relating to the Oval Test.' Amir plotted with Pakistan's former Test captain Butt, 27, fast bowler Asif, 28, and corrupt London-based sports agent Mazhar Majeed, 36, to bowl three deliberate no-balls in the Lord's Test as part of a lucrative betting scam, the court has heard. The trial of Butt and Asif heard that suspicious text messages were sent between Amir and associates in Pakistan on the eve of the Oval Test between August 18 and 21 last year. Just after midnight on August 17 Amir sent his bank details to a contact in Pakistan, whom he texted again in a panic after the match-fixing scandal broke on August 28 asking for details of his calls to be deleted. The teenage bowler also texted another Pakistan number before the Oval match, asking: 'How much and what needs to be done?' Another text confirmed: 'So in first three, bowl however you want, and in the last two, do eight runs?' A text from an Indian number to . Majeed in the early hours of the first day of the game appears to . implicate Amir in fixing 'brackets', a set period of a game on which . gamblers bet, for example, how many runs will be scored. Amir and Majeed also exchanged calls and texts on the morning of the third day of the Oval Test, the court heard. Mohammad Asif (left) scratches his head as he leaves Southwark Crown court during a break yesterday, and former Pakistan captain Salman Butt bites his lip before sentencing . The judge told Amir's barrister, Henry Blaxland QC: 'There is no evidence of a ""yes"" on his part, although you will accept I think that he was in regular and substantial contact with someone who was undoubtedly seeking to influence him to bowl brackets.' Mr Blaxland responded that Amir at a 'relatively early stage' did not return the large number of calls made to him. The judge asked whether Amir was claiming that more senior Pakistan cricketers - in particular his former captain, Butt - put him under pressure to become involved in fixing. Mr Blaxland replied: 'He takes responsibility for his own actions and he does not seek to shift responsibility to his co-defendants.' Aftab Jafferjee QC, prosecuting, said Amir at first denied delivering two deliberate no-balls at Lord's when he was interviewed by police on September 3 last year. 'His account was that he received no money for bowling either of the no-balls and that each of them occurred because of slippery conditions,' he said. Mr Jafferjee also applied for a compensation order to repay the £150,000 in cash that an undercover reporter from the News of the World paid to Majeed as part of an arrangement to rig cricket games, including the no-balls at Lord's. The three cricketers were mobbed by photographers and camera crews as they arrived at court this morning for the two-day sentencing hearing. Court 4 was packed with British and Pakistani journalists and cricket fans eager to find out the fate of the players. Four of the 12 jurors who found Butt and Asif guilty yesterday returned to the courtroom today to see sentence passed. The International Cricket Council imposed five-year suspensions on all three cricketers in February over the deliberate no-balls at Lord's. They are all appealing against the bans and sentencing is expected to conclude tomorrow.","Teenage fast bowler initially denied involvement then said he was pressured to bowl no-balls .

Peter Wilkes, 45, said he was unable to get out of the bath because he had a bad back - but he was caught racing his vehicle and pushing a car up a ramp. The fraudster, who hobbled into court today in a grey suit was filmed on six separate occasions racing his beaten-up stock car at Trent Raceway in Needwood, Staffordshire, between August 22 and October 17, 2010. Scroll down for video . Benefit cheat: Peter Wilkes, 45, is caught carrying two tyres - even though he said a back injury left him in excruciating pain and unable to work .

Today he escaped a jail sentence and was fined just £300. He was immediately able to repay the money because of an inheritance. Burton Magistrates Court was shown footage of Wilkes driving a red stock car with the number ‘39’ emblazoned on its side and a banner reading ‘Pete Wilkes’ plastered across the windscreen. Prosecutor Paul Kay told magistrates that Wilkes competed in up to three races each day at the fortnightly meetings. Wilkes was also caught on film climbing backwards out of a passenger window and walking around the raceway’s grounds. In one video he can be seen speeding around the circular course, his car bouncing up and down as it careers along the bumpy ground. He also posted his own videos on YouTube - which he wrote were filmed by his son. After several laps, Wilkes collides with another car and spins out before driving into a pit area in the middle of the track. He then unbuckles himself and clambers backwards out of the car with apparent ease. Accompanied by his son, he can also be seen walking around the raceway without a limp, laughing and joking with friends and buying hamburgers from a race-side vendor. The court heard that Wilkes, who damaged several vertebrae in a footballing accident in 1991, had no feeling below his left knee. On his latest Disability Living Allowance claim form, dated December 10, 2008, he claimed that he could not walk on uneven ground without stumbling, could not bend over and often struggled to dress himself without assistance. In interviews with Department for Work and Pensions officials in December 2010, Wilkes said that he was 'permanently in severe discomfort, every step hurts.' He fraudulently claimed £4,439 in Disability Living allowance between September 2009 and December 2010.

'Pain': Wilkes is seen getting into the vehicle - despite claiming he could not bend over and often struggled to dress himself without assistance . Today he was found guilty of failing to notify the DWP of a change in circumstances affecting his entitlement to benefits. Sentencing Wilkes, magistrate Andrew Nelson said: 'We have considered the defendant’s original claim for disability allowance to be genuine. 'The defendant was seen racing a stock car, getting in and out of it and even pushing it along with others. 'Therefore it is clear that while his doctor confirms the condition remains, it has improved and he failed to notify the Department for Work and Pensions of this.' Hard at work: The defendant bends over apparently with little difficulty. After being found guilty, he said he would do the same thing again . Guilty: Peter Wilkes, 45, arrives at court today where he was ordered to pay the money back and was given a fine. He says he has no income . John Walsh, defending, said: 'Because of an inheritance, rather than any saved income, he was able to repay it straight away.' Wilkes, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, was fined £300, and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £15 and costs of £250. Speaking outside court he called the decision 'completely unfair' and vowed he would do the same again. He said: 'I didn’t know in this day and age you needed to get permission to do something. 'I have no income, none at all, so what am I expected to use to pay this fine? 'When I went racing my son was my mechanic. Because of the experience he got there he now has a job as a mechanic.

Astronomers who scan the skies for dangerous asteroids – space rocks that might cross the Earth’s path – are in line for a huge funding boost from Nasa. The U.S space agency is awarding $4.1 million (£2.6m) to the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS), based at the University of Arizona (UA), to upgrade its search capabilities. Most will consider this money well spent, since some asteroids, were they to crash land on Earth, would be capable of causing global devastation. Ever watchful: The CSS's Schmidt Telescope scans the skies for dangerous space rocks . The money will be used to upgrade and operate the CSS telescopes through to 2015. The CSS program, part of the UA's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, has led the search for so-called near-Earth objects, or NEOs, since 2005. CSS consists of two wide-field survey telescopes and a dedicated follow-up telescope located in the Catalina mountains north of Tucson, Arizona. Sky's the limit: The Schmidt Telescope is located on Mt. Bigelow in the Catalina Mountains just north of Tucson, Arizona . In 2011 the CSS science team discovered 586 near-Earth asteroids, representing 65 per cent of NEO discoveries for the year. In addition to its record-setting searches for asteroids, the team was the first to observe an asteroid on a collision course with the Earth, allowing it to be tracked and eventually recovered as meteorites in the desert of Northern Sudan. Their large and growing data set has also found new relevance in the search for objects far beyond the solar system. With their new grant, CSS astronomers will be able to expand the power of their largest telescope four-fold, develop more sensitive software, and conduct their search more nights every month. ‘Nasa has recognised that over the last seven years, our program has constantly strived to improve its performance, and has collaborated with others to find new ways to exploit the nearly 1,000 images we take every night with our two telescopes in the mountains north of Tucson,’ said Edward Beshore, principal investigator of the Catalina Sky Survey. ‘I think NASA recognises the CSS as a valuable service to, well, humanity.’ To spot NEOs, CSS observers use two telescopes to take four images of selected portions of the sky, spaced about 10 minutes apart. Software then processes the images, looking for faint objects that appear to be moving across the sky in a straight line. Specialised software then removes known asteroids, applies filters to remove false detections and presents the results to the observer for final validation. Asteroids suspected of qualifying as NEOs are reported to the Smithsonian Institution for analysis and follow-up images are scheduled. It takes several hours of such observations to reveal whether an object is an NEO. Finally, objects whose orbits intersect with the Earth's are called out for additional study by amateur and professional astronomers around the world. A key element of the new grant, a more powerful camera will allow the project to cover more sky with the 1.5-meter telescope on the summit of Mt. Lemmon. CSS co-investigator Steve Larson, who designed the new camera, said: ‘When we began observing in 2000, our image sensor was 16 megapixels, which was large by any standard. Today, commonly available consumer digital cameras have surpassed that size, and we were reaching the limit of productivity with our current camera design.’ A few years ago, Spectral Instruments, a local vendor of scientific imaging systems, presented a sensor totalling 110 megapixels. Together with Tucson-based optical designer Richard Buchroeder, Larson developed a powerful new camera system that would increase the amount of sky it can cover each month by four times. Danger: Some asteroids have the destructive power of nuclear bombs . ‘We believe this will translate into a nearly proportional increase in the number of discoveries we make each month,’ Larson said. The grant will facilitate other enhancements too, such as support additional software development to improve the speed and sensitivity of the CSS software, and the addition of a new observer that will allow them to work more nights each month. The CSS program is not limited to the search for asteroids. A spinoff project called the Catalina Realtime Transient Survey makes further use of the data acquired for the asteroid survey. ‘We image the entire sky every month with our telescope on Mt. Bigelow,’ Beshore said, ‘in partnership with colleagues at Caltech who had developed software to search for changes in the stationary cosmic objects. Almost as fast as we can acquire the data, they are able to detect changes in the brightness of stars and galaxies that can reveal important clues about objects millions of times farther away than the asteroids we search for.’",The Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona found 586 near-Earth asteroids last year .

It is part of the same Costa Cruises fleet as the ill fated Concordia, which hit rocks last month leaving more than 30 people dead after partially sinking. Although no-one was injured in the latest incident, Costa Cruises was moving rapidly to deal with the situation as the 28,500 ton ship, carrying 1,049 passengers and crew, had been left with no power. Emergency generators are providing a small amount of light and working satellite phones. A helicopter has ferried in fresh food and new batteries for the Allegra as it was being towed by the French ocean going trawler Trevignon. Thirty one British passengers are among holidaymakers onboard and to combat the heat as air conditioning is not working, they have all been gathered on the outer decks of the ship.

Living the dream: Rebecca Thomas pictured in her dancer's costume (left) and enjoying drinks (right) Proud: Jayne Thomas, mother of Rebecca and James, poses with a picture of her children . This is the first picture of stricken Costa Allegra captain Nicolo Alba (right) The 48-year-old has been at sea for 20 years and was promoted to captain last summer, taking charge first of the Costa Marina before taking the helm of the Allegra. Captain Alba, who is from Monopoli near Bari in southern Italy, is in constant touch with coastguard officials in both Italy and the Seychelles. He is also in contact with the skippers of the tugs and trawlers sent to tow the Allegra back to port following the blaze that knocked out all onboard power. Today his wife Mariangela Mele said: 'The situation is under control, I am not worried but I have not yet had a chance to speak with my husband. 'The last time I heard from him was just before the fire. He called me as he always does at 9am in the morning and the fire started a couple of hours later. 'In our phone call he said that everything was fine and other than that I don't know anything else. I know as much as is in the papers and all my information is coming from Costa Cruises. 'I just want to hear his voice so that I know everything is OK and I hope that later this afternoon I will be able to speak with him - that's why I can't really speak on the telephone for long. I need to keep the line free.' In a statement Genoa based Costa Cruises . said they were 'all served a cold breakfast' while the Allegra's . captain Nicolo Alba was in constant touch with the Trevignon and . maritime authorities. Italian coastguard officials in Rome who are co-ordinating the rescue have said the Allegra is in no immediate danger and she is 'upright and floating', adding that weather in the area was calm with the odd shower passing through. Onboard the Allegra, which was a week into a month long cruise of the Indian Ocean, Red Sea and the Mediterranean, are nine Italian marines from the elite San Marco regiment, who are armed with Hecker and Koch submachine guns and who ready to defend the ship from possible pirate attacks. The area off the east African coast has been targeted by Somali pirates in the past and the marines are there as a deterrent - they are from the same unit which was involved in a shooting incident earlier this month, which left two Indian fishermen dead earlier after their trawler approached an Italian tanker. The ship had been due to make its way north through the Indian Ocean with stops in Mauritius, Madagascar and the Seychelles before heading to Oman, Jordan, Egypt and finally ending in the Italian port of Savona on March 17. Costa sources said the most likely cause of the fire was an 'electrical fault' and that it would be thoroughly investigated. The ship was originally built as a container vessel in 1969 and called the Annie Johnson before being sold by its Finnish owners to a Greek company and eventually Costa in 1990 where it under went a two year refit and was relaunched with its new name Allegra. It also emerged today that the three . Costa directors involved in dealing with the Allegra incident - Roberto . Ferrarini, Paolo Parodi and Manfred Ursprunger - are the same three who . are under investigation for their involvement in last month's Costa . Concordia tragedy. This morning, pictures showed passengers on the upper deck of the Costa Allegra . From an Indian Navy aircraft the waters appear calm around the cruise liner which will help with the rescue operation . Stranded: The Costa Allegra, which is 45 years old, has 1,049 passengers and crew on board including more than 30 Britons . The captain of the Concordia, Francesco Schettino, is also under investigation after he recklessly changed course so the ship could carry out a sail by salute of the Italian island of Giglio but it struck rocks tearing a 70 m gash in its hull and is now lying partly submerged on its side on rocks. Schettino is facing accusations of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, abandoning ship with passengers still onboard and failing to communicate properly with maritime authorities. On Saturday a preliminary hearing is scheduled to take place at Grosseto, north of Rome, with prosecutors taking over the town's theatre as a makeshift court room as dozens of passengers who were on the Concordia are expected to attend although the proceedings will be mainly technical. Blaze: Fire broke out onboard the Costa Allegra (pictured) when it was in the pirate-infested Indian Ocean . A tracking page on Costa Cruise's website shows where the Allegra is adrift off the Seychelles . Mark Thomas spoke of his disbelief at hearing his daughter is stranded on the Costa Allegra just weeks after his son was trapped on its doomed sister ship the Concordia. His son James, 19, was hailed a hero for forming a 'human climbing frame' to help terrified passengers escape from the Concordia when it hit rocks off the Italian coast in January. Yesterday the 48-year-old was told his daughter Rebecca, 23, was stranded on the Allegra.He said: 'We just can't believe it and are absolutely amazed that this has happened again. 'We can't put it into words. I was really worried when I heard because of what James went through. 'At least James was in a better situation with the Concordia because it was so close to the shore. 'But it's worrying because Rebecca is in the middle of the ocean and we don't really know exactly what is going on.' Stranded: Hannah McDermott is also among staff and passengers left adrift in the Indian Ocean on the Costa Allegra . At sea: Hannah McDermott has been working as a dancer on the Costa Allegra . Both James and Rebecca are employed by the Italian cruise firm as dancers. Mr Thomas, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, said he and his wife Jayne had spoken to an agent from Costa. They realised their daughter's plight when they heard about the ship's power failure, after a blaze in the engine room, on the television. Jayne, 48, added: 'I just can't believe it's happening all over again - it's like a nightmare.' And she revealed she had been in contact with her daughter three or four times a day, last speaking via mobile messenger service WhatsApp yesterday morning. Among the other Britons on board is Hannah McDermott, from Salford, Greater Manchester. Her mother Christine Hargreaves said: 'I know the ship is being towed away now so I feel quite relieved about that but I just want to know she is OK. As a mum, I just want to hear her voice. 'I last got a message from her at 8am yesterday but haven't heard from her since and both her phones are off.' Costa officials were last night locked in discussions over the compensation package that  would be offered to passengers. Last month it offered payouts of £9,319 to more than 3,000 passengers on the Costa Concordia. The total bill is expected to top more than £30million.

Terrifying 911 tapes from a home invasion have been released, revealing chilling screams as young students in the house are bound at knife point by their attacker. Eight women, aged 19 to 21, were in the house at the time of the attack in Seattle. One of them hid in her bedroom on the house's main floor and called 911, summoning police who arrested the man before any of the girls were injured. Convicted rapist: Robert Douglas Hitt (left) was arrested after holding eight girls captive in their student home, including Austen Beard, 19 (right) Excerpts from the 911 calls give an insight into the frightening home invasion: . Dispatcher: '911, what are you reporting? Caller: 'Hi, there is somebody in my house.' She told the dispatcher that she heard a scream and then fighting. Dispatcher: 'What`s going on?' Caller: 'He`s taping her.' Another student hiding in the corner bedroom of the same house also called 911. She too, told, the operator that a man was in her house and that he was threatening her roommates with a knife. Caller: 'He`s threatening though.' Dispatcher: 'What threats?' Caller: 'I'll stab you.' Caller: 'He`s taping her somewhere, I`m afraid he`s going to come find me.' Dispatcher: 'We`ve got several officers. We got about four cars outside the house, OK? What do you think he`s doing to her?' Caller: 'He`s taping her.' Crime scene: Rapist Robert Douglas Hitt broke into a student home in Seattle but police managed to arrest him before anyone was hurt . Dispatcher: 'She`s hearing someone screaming from what part of the house?' Caller: 'No, she only heard yelp. It sounds like he`s going around to all the different rooms and, like, yelling at people.' Within minutes of the first 911 call, police were outside. The frantic caller then told the dispatcher she heard someone at the door. Caller: 'My door`s open.' Dispatcher: 'Did someone open the door or did you open it?' Sound of women screaming... Caller: 'They`re screaming, should I go?' The screaming on the tape came as Seattle police officers stormed into the house. There they arrested Robert Douglas Hitt, 34. Attacker: Robert Douglas Hitt was released from prison in January, allowing him to break into the student home and threaten the girls at knife-point . For Hitt’s previous first-degree rape conviction in 2002, he received an 'indeterminate sentence' with a minimum of 9.75 years in prison and a maximum of life. Before the minimum sentences expire, certain sex offenders are required to be evaluated by the Indeterminate Sentence Review Board. An offender must be released unless the board determines the offender is more likely than not to commit another sex offence. In February 2011, the board determined that Hitt was more likely than not to commit another sex offence if released from prison and another year was added to his minimum sentence. However, six months later, the same board ruled that Hitt was releasable because he had completed a sex-offender treatment and 'worked hard to transform himself, his attitude and thoughts so that he won’t create another victim in the future,' according to the board’s decision. Hitt was released Jan. 10 and was under lifelong supervision by the state Department of Corrections. Now he is being held on robbery, burglary, kidnapping charges and unlawful imprisonment and for violating conditions of his release on his prior rape conviction. It is believed he entered the house after breaking a window, said Austen Beard, one of the women who lives there. Beard, a 19-year-old student, was awakened around 3:30 a.m. Monday, when the man burst into her second-floor bedroom, and Beard, figuring he was a friend of her roommates, yelled at him to get out. He did, and she locked her door, then heard him yell, 'Get everyone in the house! I'm going to kill everyone!' Moments later, one of her roommates knocked on her door and asked Beard to open it. She did and saw the man holding a knife to the roommate's throat, she said. He rounded up six of the eight young women who live in the house, forcing them into an upstairs bedroom and ordering them to lie facedown in a row. He bound the wrists of the first three girls with electrical tape, but ran out, Beard said. He then grabbed a table lamp and yanked out the cord, causing sparks to fly, in an apparent attempt to use the cord to tie up the remaining girls. In the dark, Beard — whose hands hadn't yet been tied — grabbed the serrated kitchen knife the man had left within reach and hid it under her body. As he searched for more tape, Beard was able to pass the knife to the last woman in the line. 'He was very amateur. He was messed up,' Beard said of the suspect, who she thinks may have been under the influence of drugs. 'Every single girl that was involved, I'm so proud of,' Beard said, explaining that everyone kept their cool and worked together to get the knife away from the suspect. One of the women was even able to wriggle out of the electrical tape while the others were cut free by officers. 'There will be some trauma for the next week, and people don't want to sleep in their own beds,' Beard said. 'But there's eight of us — we'll get through it.'","Eight women, aged 19 to 21, held at knifepoint .

Missing: Madeleine McCann vanished from the holiday apartment she was staying in almost five years ago . Scotland Yard’s review of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is on course to cost £2million in its first year. The team of 30 murder squad detectives has racked up a significant bill since Prime Minister David Cameron called in the force last May. They have made at least four trips to Portugal and Spain to gather evidence, including a file of leads from private investigators. The Metropolitan Police has already sent the Home Office a bill for £800,000 but the figure is expected to rise to £1.9million by the end of next month. The cost includes the salaries of the detectives, translation and interpretation fees, travel expenses and office staff. Senior figures warned the inquiry, called Operation Grange, could take years to complete and played down any hopes of a significant breakthrough. When the review was announced it sparked a row over the use of public funds as the Government was accused of interfering with police operations. Labour peer Lord Harris has said the case raises ‘very big questions’, adding: ‘There is clearly an issue about the resources being used.’ Pain: Kate and Gerry McCann mark the fourth anniversary of the disapparance of their daughter last year. As the book was released, David Cameron ordered Scotland Yard to review all the evidence in the case . But Kate and Gerry McCann, who personally asked Mr Cameron to intervene, have welcomed the renewed police inquiry. Madeleine disappeared from her parents’ holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on the Algarve in Portugal on May 3 2007. She vanished days before her fourth birthday as her parents dined with friends just a few short distance away. Since then the case has become one of the most infamous crime mysteries in modern history with hundreds of ‘sightings’ of Madeleine worldwide. Snatching: The apartment Madeleine McCann was snatched from in Praia de Luz, Portugal, in May 2007, while her parents were at dinner nearby - and coming back regularly to check on their children . The official police inquiry into her disappearance was shelved in July 2008 but private detectives employed by the McCanns continued the search. Holiday apartment: Portuguese police search the apartment that Madeleine McCann vanished from . Scotland Yard detectives, led by Detective Chief Inspector John Redwood, have met police and private investigators engaged in the original inquiry. They have also had reams of paperwork, including statements, police reports and forensic documents, translated. In December detectives met Spanish colleagues in Barcelona to check on reports that the toddler had been abducted and smuggled across the border. Private investigators in Spain also handed the Met police team 30 boxes of evidence which they claimed contained up to eight ‘important new leads’. A spokesman for the McCanns said: ‘They have always been very appreciative of the time and resources that the British police and Home Office have committed to the search for Madeleine and they are grateful that the review is on-going.’","30 murder squad detectives working on review ordered by David Cameron last May .

Syrian government forces launched a series of bloody attacks on opposition strongholds today, despite the official ceasefire, as the first U.N. peace monitors arrived in the capital Damascus. The ceasefire, part of a peace plan . brokered by international mediator Kofi Annan, looked increasingly under . threat throughout the weekend as the government vowed to crackdown on a . wave of 'terrorist attacks' in Syria. A Syrian official escorting the U.N. team at a . Damascus hotel said more observers were expected to arrive on Monday, . but offered no details. Mission: The team of U.N. monitors, tasked with overseeing the Syrian ceasefire,  leave their Damascus hotel shortly after arriving in the capital today . Under the U.N. plan, two dozen more observers . are due to enter Syria in coming days. However as the monitors prepared to embark on their mission, violence persisted on the ground. One activist said the city of Homs, one of the hotbeds of opposition to Assad, was bombarded on Sunday by government forces at a rate of 'one shell per minute'. Other activist sources said that six people had been killed on Sunday, and four bodies had been found. Casting . further doubt on whether the ceasefire would hold, Syria said it would . stop what it called 'terrorist groups' from committing criminal acts, . state television reported. Violation: Smoke and fire billows from a building as shells rain down in the flashpoint city of Homs yesterday . A Syrian soldier mans a checkpoint in the city of Zabadani, a bastion of the rebellion near the border with Lebanon. Government forces reportedly killed four civilians in shelling of rebel areas and clashes with gunmen yesterday . Casualty: A YouTube grab shows Syrians carrying an injured boy allegedly shot by troops loyal to the regime in the city of Aleppo . Annan, joint special envoy of the United Nations and Arab League, brokered the six-point peace plan in March as part of international efforts to stop 13 months of violence. The plan calls for the start of political dialogue, the delivery of humanitarian assistance, the release of prisoners including those involved in peaceful protests, freedom of movement for journalists to work throughout Syria. The U.N. Security Council authorised the deployment of up to 30 unarmed observers on Saturday in the first resolution on Syria the 15-nation council managed to approve unanimously since the uprising erupted in March 2011. Syria blames the violence on what it says are terrorists seeking to topple Assad. It has denied journalists access to the country, making it impossible to independently verify reports. Rubble: Smoke rises from buildings in the city of Homs. Government troops are reported to have shelled residential neighborhoods killing at least three people hours before the first batch of United Nations observers were to arrive in Damascus . Ruins: Bombed out buildings in a residential area of the city of Homs . Threat: Arabic graffiti on a Syrian army tank reads: 'The men of death: Either (we support) Assad or we burn the country' The U.N. estimates Assad's forces have killed more than 9,000 people in the uprising. Syria says foreign-backed militants have killed more than 2,500 soldiers and police. On Sunday, the Syrian state news agency SANA said a 'terrorist group' ambushed armed forces in Idlib province, killing a soldier and wounding three others. 'Since the announcement of an end to military operations, terrorist attacks have increased by dozens, causing a large loss of life,' SANA added. '(Security forces), based on their duty to protect civilians and the country, will stop terrorist groups from continuing their criminals acts and the killing of civilians,' SANA said. Dissent: Thousands gather in the town of Douma, near Damascus, to protest against government violence . Defiance: Syrian children hold anti-government placards during an anti-regime demonstration in the city of Rastan near Homs . U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was concerned about the shelling of Homs and urged the Syrian government to refrain from any escalation of violence. 'While we welcome the cessation of violence at this time I warn that the whole world is watching with sceptical eyes whether this will be sustainable,' he said. 'It is important the Syrian government takes all the measures to keep the cessation of violence.' Annan's spokesman said the mission could be expanded to 250 or more but that would require another resolution. Syrian government spokeswoman Bouthaina Shaaban said Syria could not be responsible for the safety of the monitors unless it was involved in 'all steps on the ground'. On the eve of the mission, Syrian forces pounded Homs, activists said. 'Early this morning we saw a helicopter and a spotter plane fly overhead. Ten minutes later, there was heavy shelling,' said Walid al-Fares, a local activist. Activist video footage, reportedly from Khalidiya, shows an explosion shortly after the sound of a missile flying through the air. Another whiz follows, and the cameraman, standing in a nearby building, pans across to show a ball of flames and smoke rising into the air.","Homs bombarded on Sunday at a rate of 'one shell per minute'

An alleged drugs gang stashed marijuana worth around $36m (£23m) under bogus tour buses and smuggled it into America in a massive trafficking ploy.

Police believe the notorious Los Zetas gang, one of the most violent and feared Mexican drug cartels, sourced the marijuana. Seized: £23 million worth of marijuana was stashed under bogus tour buses and smuggled into America. Police have now arrested 23 suspects in the U.S. Some 23 suspects have now been charged over the operation and face a 96-count indictment. The smuggling ring was uncovered when a motorist stopped by police in Colorado was found with narcotics in his possession and told detectives the name of his supplier. A Colorado judge then approved telephone wire taps of the suspected dealer, triggering a year-long investigation by federal and state law enforcement which led to a grand jury indictment. Suspects: Booking photos show 19 of the 23 people implicated in the 96-count indictment drawn up following the massive drugs bust in Colorado . This was handed up last month but remained sealed until as many arrests as possible could be made. Authorities assigned to the probe seized marijuana bricks - valued at $36 million in the U.S. -, along with two kilograms of cocaine valued at $64,000 (£40,000), 53 grams of methamphetamine, and $134,000 (£84,500) in cash.

The early history of civiilisation has been 'filled in' a little as scientists have found settlements up to 8,000 years old dotted across Syria. The area is thought to have been critical for the growth of civilisation - and thought to have been one of the first places where early man domesticated cattle. MIT scientists have created software that scans satellite images for towns and settlements - looking for telltalle lighter soil and mounds from the collapse of mud huts. The software has found 9,000 settlements - which Harvard Professor Jason Ur describes as a 'lifetime's worth'. The MIT software looks for signs of ancient settlements including earth disturbed by collapsing mud huts, and lighter areas of earth created by disturbed soil . The new sites might reveal clues to the earliest complex human societies - although the instability of the region might hinder investigation. Jason Ur, Professor of the Social Sciences at Harvard . University, worked with Bjoern Menze, a research affiliate in MIT's Computer . Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, to develop a system that . identified settlements. The software scans for telltale signs including soil . discolorations and the distinctive mounding that results from the collapse of . mud-brick settlements. Prof Ur used a computer to examine . satellite images of a 23,000 square-kilometre area of north-eastern Syria, and . turned up around 9,000 possible settlements, an increase of ‘at least an order . of magnitude’ over what had previously been identified. Prof Ur said: ‘I could do this on the ground, but it would . probably take me the rest of my life to survey an area this size. ‘With these computer science techniques, however, we can . immediately come up with an enormous map which is methodologically very . interesting, but which also shows the staggering amount of human occupation . over the last 7,000 or 8,000 years. The sofware looks for distinctive mounds created by collapsing huts, and uses the traces to identify likely settlements . ‘What's more, anyone who comes back to this area for any . future survey would already know where to go. ‘There's no need to do this sort of initial reconnaissance . to find sites. This allows you to do targeted work, so it maximizes the time we . have on the ground.’ The research was published in the Proceedings of the .

The deadliest strike hit the holy Shiite city of Karbala, where officials said two car bombs exploded in a crowded shopping and restaurant area. Thirteen people were killed and another 50 injured, said local provincial council member Hussein Shadhan al-Aboudi. Karbala, 50 miles (80km) south of Baghdad, is a destination for thousands of Shiite pilgrims from around the world who visit the golden shrines of two revered imams each day. Mr al-Aboudi immediately blamed the attacks on al-Qaeda, the terror network which officials believe is behind the recent violence with the aim of forcing the Arab League's summit in Baghdad next week to be cancelled for the second year in a row.

'The intention of these attacks is to destabilise the security situation in Karbala and other Iraqi cities and to shake the people's confidence on the government,' Mr al-Aboudi said. 'It seems that the terrorists want to abort the upcoming Arab Summit in Baghdad,' he added. 'The message is directed to the Arab leaders that Iraq is not safe enough to be visited.' Attacks today in five other cities - Baghdad, the northern city of Kirkuk and three southern towns - largely appeared to target police forces.

Three policemen were among those killed as bombings struck at security patrols in Baghdad and the town of Latifiyah, about 20 miles (30km) south of the Iraqi capital, local officials said. A car bomb also exploded outside a police headquarters in Kirkuk, 180 miles (290km) north of Baghdad, said Brigadier General Sarhad Qadir. A car bomb outside a restaurant of Hillah, about 60 miles (95km) south of Baghdad, killed two people and injured more than 20 others. And a roadside bomb exploded in a commercial area in Mahmoudiya, about 20 miles (30km) south of Baghdad, killing two and wounding seven. Officials have been braced for attacks in the run-up to the annual Arab League summit in Baghdad, where the government hopes to showcase Iraq's improved security and stability since the sectarian fighting a few years ago that almost pulled the country into civil war. The summit was initially supposed to be held last year but was postponed in part because of concerns about Iraq's security. Insurgents are seeking to belie Baghdad's better image, and officials expect more attacks as hundreds of dignitaries and journalists converge on the capital next week.","The deadliest strike hit Karbala, where two car bombs exploded in a .

"By . Nick Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 07:53 EST, 19 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:50 EST, 19 March 2012 . Killer: Suffolk Strangler Steve Wright was convicted of murdering five prostitutes in Ipswich . The News of the World was accused yesterday of jeopardising the hunt for the Suffolk Strangler by hiring former special forces soldiers to follow officers tracking suspects in the case. Dave Harrison, a retired officer with the Serious Organised Crime Agency, told the Leveson Inquiry that evidence in the 2006 investigation could have been lost and the prosecution case weakened as a result of the paper’s actions. He said the distraction of avoiding the now-defunct tabloid’s monitoring could have resulted in the killer being ‘lost’ by officers and going on to commit further murders. In December 2006, before anyone was charged in relation to the case, Suffolk Police asked Soca to provide surveillance officers to follow suspects as part of their investigation into the murders of five prostitutes in Ipswich. During a briefing, Mr Harrison and other Soca officers were told the News of the World had employed its own surveillance team, made up of ex-special forces soldiers, ‘to identify any suspects we were working on, and to identify us and our operating base’. He said their activities ‘jeopardised the murder inquiry’ and could have resulted in ‘tragic consequences’. ‘If our surveillance had been weakened by having to try and avoid other surveillance teams looking for us, if we had lost the subject, he may have gone and committed further murders because we were dealing with something else,’ he said. Asked how the paper knew that Soca officers were being sent to Ipswich, he said: ‘My opinion is it would have come from someone close to the investigation team, either the Suffolk inquiry or Soca. Surveillance: Dave Harrison, a retired officer with the Serious Organised Crime Agency, said the NotW jeopardised the official investigation into the killings . ‘We identified them because they were sat in the position that we would sit in if we were doing the same job.’ He added: ‘We were told that they were probably ex-special forces soldiers who would have a good knowledge of surveillance techniques.’ Later that month, Steve Wright was arrested and in February 2008 he was convicted of killing all five women and handed a whole-life sentence. Despite the successful outcome, the former investigator was critical of the newspaper, which was closed last July after it emerged staff had hacked murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s phone. Victims: Gemma Adams, 25, and  19-year-old Tania Nicol who were two of the five people killed by Steve Wright . In his witness statement, Mr Harrison . wrote that ‘many murderers revisit the scene of the crime’ and if caught . in the act by police surveillance, this can provide ‘extremely . important’ evidence to the prosecution. ‘In this case, if the suspect had . decided to re-visit the scene, to dispose of additional evidence, or to . move a body that had not yet been found and he realised he was being . followed, he may have cancelled or postponed his trip,’ he said. ‘He would not care whether he was . being followed by a “legitimate” surveillance team or one employed by a . newspaper. The evidence would be lost and the prosecution case . weakened.’ Murder probe: Forensic officers carry out an investigation into the death of one of the five prostitutes killed by Steve Wright in 2006 . Daily Express crime correspondent John . Twomey, who is chairman of the Crime Reporters’ Association, said the . NoW’s decision to use a surveillance team to follow police was . ‘shocking’. The inquiry also heard that the Sunday . Mirror used counter-surveillance techniques when it interviewed one of . the suspects in the case. Mr Harrison said officers observed the . man being ‘picked up and driven round by a team that carried out . anti-surveillance manoeuvres before dropping him off at a hotel to be . interviewed’.","Steve Wright convicted of murdering five prostitutes in Ipswich in 2006 .

"By . Rob Cooper and Rebecca Camber . UPDATED: . 02:35 EST, 21 August 2011 . Grieving Leroy James senior is comforted today as he visits the scene where his 14-year-old son was stabbed to death . A tearful father today visited the park where his 14-year-old son was stabbed to death close to a crowded playground. Leroy James's father, Leroy James Snr, was 'in bits' following the stabbing, friends said. The schoolboy's attackers left him to die in a park and despite paramedics sending an air ambulance to the park in Enfield, north London, he could not be saved. Two teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of murdering the teenager. The boys, aged 14 and 15, are being held in police custody following the stabbing of Leroy James, Scotland Yard said tonight. The teenager is the youngest of ten children to be murdered in the capital this year, . Horrified witnesses described the youngster as 'sweet' as they said Leroy's father was 'in bits'. Today he visited the scene as forensic officers carried out an investigation. With two further teenage stabbings on Oxford Street - Britain's busiest shopping area - last night, Scotland Yard moved to dismiss fears that London was in the grip of a wave of gang violence. Police officers arrived at the scene last night to find the victim slumped by a concrete wall lying in a pool of blood. Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Goode, the investigating officer, said: 'There's certainly no evidence or any intelligence at this time that this is a gang-related murder.' Roxy Bagun, 19, who lives on the other side of the park, said she saw Leroy's father at the park yesterday evening. She said: 'His dad was in bits, crying and crying and crying. I just didn't know what to say to him.' Miss Bagun said Leroy was a 'good lad' who used to play football and basketball with his friends in the park. 'He always used to come and play football,' she said. 'My friend saw it all. He told me how he saw Leroy lying there in a pool of blood.' Tragic: Leroy James was stabbed to death in Ponders End recreation ground last night. The victim was just nine-years-old when the picture, right, was taken . She added: 'He was a good lad. I . never saw him get into any trouble. They were sweet boys. He just hung . around with kids his own age. His friends are so sweet and innocent.' She said the killers have 'got no fear any more', adding: 'They had the guts to do it right in front of a police station.' Detectives said Leroy was in the park with his friends before when he was set upon and stabbed. Launching a hunt for his attacker, Ms . Goode said: 'We know from what witnesses have told us so far that Leroy . was in an altercation with at least one other boy. I'm completely . open-minded as to the motive at this stage. Murder investigation: A forensics tent is set up in Ponders End Recreation Ground close to a park, right, and some flats following the killing last night . 'Officers from the local borough . arrived very, very quickly and took control of this crime scene, and did . manage to speak to a number of people that were here. 'But we still need to talk to everybody that was present in the park yesterday. 'There were attempts to resuscitate . Leroy here in the park but sadly those were unsuccessful, and the air . ambulance played their part in trying to save Leroy's life.' Relatives are 'absolutely destroyed with the grief at losing their son', she added. Leroy James Snr watches as police conduct a search outside Ponders End Recreation Ground searching for clues into his son's killing . A forensic officer, right, searches a playground near where Leroy James was found dying by police. Friends had been laying flowers at the scene throughout the day . 'He was a 14-year-old young man who . didn't deserve to lose his life. He had his whole life in front of him. A . young man with hopes and aspirations, and that's been tragically cut . short.' Friends and schoolmates reacted with shock to the death as hundreds joined a Facebook page set up in his memory. 'Leroy you was like my little brother and i loved you with all my heart,' wrote one friend. 'Im . going to miss not seeing your face everyday and bussing bare jokes. I . felt i could talk to you about anything and i will always remember the . things you have done for me. I will never forget you and always love . you.'

"By . Richard Shears . UPDATED: . 09:46 EST, 12 September 2011 . It has been a costly mission to restore the world's most famous penguin to his ocean home. But all the efforts - and money spent - appear to have been vain as it seems Happy Feet may have ended up as a predator's lunch. The wandering emperor penguin had been nursed back to health after being found hundreds of miles from home on a New Zealand beach, desperately ill after eating sand he thought was snow. A human surgeon was even brought in to remove sticks and stones from his stomach. Far from home: Happy Feet washed up on Peka Peka Beach in New Zealand - 3,000 miles north of its native Antarctica . Happy Feet then had a GPS transmitter . attached to him so his progress back into Antarctic waters could be . tracked when he was released back into the ocean last week. But the device stopped working last Friday - about half way to his destination in the Southern Ocean. Experts said that while it is possible the device fell off and is sitting at the bottom of the ocean while Happy Feet continues safely on his journey, they fear he could also have met his fate in the jaws of a larger creature. Emperor penguins have a number of predators including sharks, seals and killer whales. In an early statement, Sirtrack, the company that attached the transmitter, told the New Zealand Herald that the lack of signal 'leads to the conclusion that either the satellite transmitter has detached or an unknown event has prevented Happy Feet from resurfacing'. A spokesman for the company said . there was 'a chance' the juvenile penguin had been eaten, adding: 'That's what . makes the world go round.' But as animal lovers expressed their . horror that Happy Feet had been . attacked and eaten, Sirtrack put out a new statement. Life-saving: A team of medics operate on Happy Feet  after he became sick after eating sand he mistook for snow. He underwent four operations in all . Mr Kevin Lay, speaking for the . company, said that the transmitter appeared to be in good working order . up to the time it stopped sending data and the most likely explanation . for the silence is that it had fallen off. The transmitter, he said, had been only glued on so that it would fall off in time. 'We hoped it would stay on for five or six months, but it appears in this case it's only stayed on for two weeks.' Mr Lay added that it was possible the penguin had been eaten, but he was doubtful. 'There are some species that will forage on emperor penguins but it's not likely that it has happened to Happy Feet because of the area he was in,' he told New Zealand's ONE . News. 'We firmly believe that the transmitter has become detached.' He said another possibility was that Happy Feet was underwater when the satellites that picked up the GPS signals were overhead. 'Maybe he's just spending a lot of time under water because he's found a good source of food,' said Mr Lay. F-f-f-f-Freezing: Happy Feet prepares to go back into the sea for the first time in two months . Gone: Happy Feet disappears for good, but his GPs tracker has now stopped giving off a signal . Vets at the Wellington Zoo and . experts who have been tracking the penguin's progress all agreed that . the next few days were critical. 'Hopefully, we'll all be pleasantly surprised,' said one official. Happy Feet was named after the 2006 animated feature about a tap-dancing emperor chick. He underwent four surgeries at . Wellington Zoo to remove sticks and stones from his stomach and then . spent two months in rehabilitation before being released into the ocean, . well short of his habitat. An international treaty prevents authorities from returning the penguin directly to Antarctica, so he was released in an area where other juvenile emperor penguins like himself are at play at this time of the year. Vet Lisa Argilla, who looked after . Happy Feet at Wellington Zoo, said she was pleased when he had been . released back into the Southern Ocean. She . said: 'He slid down his specially-designed penguin slide backwards, but . once he hit the water he spared no time in diving off away from the . boat and all those ""aliens"" who have been looking after him for so . long.' When Happy Feet had finally been given a clean bill of health, . he was placed in a specially-designed crate filled with ice and loaded . onto the research vessel Tangaroa. Sea . conditions were too rough for Happy Feet to be released by hand, so he . was placed on a tarpaulin slide running from the boat's ramp. 'He needed some gentle encouragement to leave his crate, but then the release went really well,' said Miss Argilla. A team from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research and the boat crew were all on deck to wave him goodbye. 'It's an indescribable feeling to see a patient finally set free,' said Miss Argilla. Voyage leader Richard O'Driscoll told Wellington's The Press newspaper that apart from giving the veterinary team a few nips at feeding time, the penguin had been a well-behaved passenger.","GPS transmitter stops sending signal about half-way through journey to Southern Ocean .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 13:15 EST, 25 January 2012 . It was the massacre which left 24 unarmed Iraqis dead and cast fresh shame on the American military, already reeling from Abu-Ghraib. But a military judge yesterday ruled that the final U.S. soldier to face charges over the notorious assault on Haditha will not be jailed. Instead, Staff Sergeant Frank Wuterich, who led the attack, faces no more than three months in confinement after admitting the least serious of three charges – negligent dereliction of duty. He had initially been implicated in 19 of the deaths. Among the victims were seven children and a 76-year-old man in a wheelchair. Three months confinement: Staff Sgt Frank Wuterich arrives at Camp Pendleton. He has escaped a jail sentence for the Haditha massacre . Denial: Wuterich claimed he was not a baby killer in a statement read to the military judge . The ruling by military judge Lietenant Colonel David Jones came after a surprise statement by Wuterich in which he claimed he was not a ‘cold blooded baby killer’ and had never fired his weapon at any women or children. He also apologised to relatives of the Haditha victims. 'Words cannot express my sorrow for the loss of your loved one,’ he said, in his first statement to the court since the case began last month. 'I know there is nothing I can say to ease your pain. I wish to assure you that on that day, it was never my intention [to] harm you or your families. I know that you are the real victims.’ He said he went to Iraq to do his duty, serve his country and do the best job he could. 'When my Marines and I cleared those houses that day, I responded to what I perceived as a threat and my intention was to eliminate that threat in order to keep the rest of my Marines alive,' he said. 'So when I told my team to shoot first and ask questions later, the intent wasn't that they would shoot civilians, it was that they would not hesitate in the face of the enemy.’ Death toll: The bodies of some of the 24 killed in the Haditha massacre in Iraq . Wuterich added that his guilty plea should not suggest that he believed his men behaved badly or that they acted in any way that was dishonourable to their country. The judge’s ruling, which took place in a court at Camp Pendleton, California, will now got the Marine Corps Forces Central Command for approval. But the decision has already sparked shock in Haditha, the Euphrates river town which was left devastated after the events of November 19, 2005. A survivor of the killings, Awis Fahmi Hussein, showed his scars from being hit by a bullet in the back. Mr Hussein said: 'I was expecting that the American judiciary would sentence this person to life in prison and that he would appear and confess in front of the whole world that he committed this crime, so that America could show itself as democratic and fair'. The Haditha assault – which has been compared to the My Lai massacre in Vietnam - began on the morning of November 15, 2005, after a roadside bomb killed one of the men in Wuterich’s squad. Prosecutors argued that the father-of-three lost control when he saw the body of his friend blown apart and led his men on a rampage in which they stormed two nearby homes, blasting their way in with gunfire and grenades. In the resulting carnage, 24 people were killed in 45 minutes. Young victims: Hind, a girl who survived the Haditha massacre (left) and Omer Chasib who lost his father in the attack in November 2005 . Shot dead: Rasheed Abdul Hamid Hassan Ali (left) was killed in the raid. His wife Hibba Abdulah survived . One of Wuterich’s men told the trial that he had joined his squad leader in a dark back bedroom of one of the homes where he saw small silhouettes. The bodies of women and children were later found among the dead. Wuterich, by his own admission, told his men to ‘shoot first and ask questions later.’ The order effectively over-ruled standard rules of engagement which required troops to positively identify their targets before raiding homes. 'I think we all understood what we were doing so I probably just should have said nothing,' Wuterich told the judge. The American military first attempted to downplay the killings and a full inquiry was only launched after an investigation by a Time reporter. Father of three: Frank Wuterich with his wife Marisol two of their children . Wuterich was the last of eight marines initially accused of murder or failure to investigate the Haditha killings to face trial. Six others had their charges either dropped or dismissed and one was acquitted. The staff sergeant eventually came before a court last month, six years after the deaths. He still faced nine counts of manslaughter which could have sent him to prison for 152 years. But only weeks after the long-awaited trial started, prosecutors offered Wuterich the plea deal that stopped the proceedings. He can now only be confined for a maximum of three months. Legal experts said the case was fraught with errors made by investigators and the prosecution that let it drag on for years. The prosecution was also hampered by squad mates who acknowledged they had lied to investigators initially and later testified in exchange for having their cases dropped, bringing into question their credibility. In addition, Wuterich was seen as taking the fall for senior leaders and more seasoned combat veterans, analysts said. Brian Rooney, an attorney for another former defendant, said cases like Haditha are difficult to prosecute because a military jury is unlikely to question decisions made in combat unless wrongdoing is clear-cut and egregious, like rape. Mr Rooney, who represented Lt Col Jeffrey Chessani, the highest-ranking Marine charged in the case. said: 'If it's a grey area, fog-of-war, you can't put yourself in a Marine's situation where he's legitimately trying to do the best he can'. He added: 'When you're in a town like Haditha or Fallujah, you've got bad guys trying to kill you and trying to do it in very surreptitious ways.' Carnage: The aftermath of the shooting in Haditha. A total of 24 people were killed, including women and children . Blast: The aftermath of the roadside bomb which triggered the Haditha massacre . The Haditha attack is considered among the war's defining moments, further tainting America's reputation when it was already tarnished after the release of photos of prisoner abuse by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison. It still fuels anger in Iraq today. Khalid Salman Rasif, a member of the Provincial Council in Haditha, said: 'We wonder about such a sentence issued against the defendant. ‘We called upon U.S. to be fair in passing sentences. Regrettably, we are disappointed about the issuance of such sentences'. Mr Rasif added that he would contact the lawyer for victims' families for an explanation. Kamil al-Dulaimi, a Sunni politician from the Anbar provincial capital of Ramadi, called the plea agreement proof that 'Americans still deal with Iraqis without any respect.' ‘It's just another barbaric act of Americans against Iraqis,' Mr al-Dulaimi told AP. 'They spill the blood of Iraqis and get this worthless sentence for the savage crime against innocent civilians.'","Sgt Frank Wuterich faced detainment of no more than three months after pleading guilty to lesser charges .

The bronze, life-size statue is on display in Budapest in Graphisoft's company headquarters. Graphisoft claims to have a relationship with the Apple founder which stretches back to the Eighties - when the company languished behind the Iron Curtain. The new Bronze Steve Jobs statue - the world's first - was unveiled in Budapest by a Hungarian firm who said Jobs helped them with 'cash and computers' in the Eighties . Jobs reportedly encountered Graphisoft at the CeBIT technology fair in Germany in 1984. Apple helped the company to market and distribute its architectural design software. 'Apple's support included cash and computers at a time when Graphisoft was a small company with limited resources, working within the economic and political confines of what was, at the time, communist Hungary,' founder Gabor Bojar, who commissioned the statue, told technology news site The Register. Graphisoft is now a global leader in architectural software. The statue dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs was ordered by the founder and head of software-maker Graphisoft Gabor Bojar.

"By . Gareth Finighan . UPDATED: . 11:51 EST, 22 April 2012 . The son of Bermuda's former Premier has been jailed for 12 years and eight months for a string of sex attacks on vulnerable women. Dr Kevin Brown, who ran a medical practice in Los Angeles, was found guilty of 21 charges including sexual battery by fraud, sexual exploitation by a physician, sexual penetration with a foreign object and committing a lewd act upon a child. He had pleaded not guilty to 30 felony counts including forcible rape. The attacks on nine patients - including a 15-year-old girl - took place at Brown's surgery during routine medical check-ups between 2003 and 2008. Predator: Kevin Brown, pictured during his trial in July, took advantage of women visiting his Los Angeles surgery . At today's sentencing, Brown was also . ordered to pay $18,000 in fines and penalties to his victims. He must . also register as a sex offender for life. During his trial in July, prosecutors said Brown, 40, ran his Crenshaw Boulevard practice as 'his personal playground' and viewed female patients as 'his prey'. The married father had faced similar charges in 2004 and 2006 but was acquitted on both those occasions. However, he was arrested yet again in July 2008 after assaulting an undercover police officer posing as a patient. The police sting operation had been launched a year earlier after detectives received yet another complaint against Brown. Playboy: Brown rubbed shoulders with celebrities at a charity poker tournament just weeks before his arrest . The female officer, who made an . appointment with Brown for an injured ankle, testified that Brown lifted . up her shirt and bra and fondled her breast during an examination. The . assault was recorded on monitoring equipment worn by the detective and . played back to the jury during Brown's trial. The trial jury also heard how other patients were given inappropriate pelvic and breast examinations. One victim who visited Brown to be evaluated for weight loss treatment said she had her breasts fondled and Brown also nuzzled his face in the breasts of another victim and sucked on her nipples, the court heard. Deputy District Attorney Ann-Marie Wise had estimated Brown could get a maximum term of 16 years and ten months in state prison for his crimes. 'I am extremely pleased with this verdict, and the women who came forward were very brave,' she said after Brown had been found guilty. Just weeks before his 2008 arrest, Brown - whose father Ewart Brown was Premier of Bermuda between 2006 and 2010 - organised a celebrity poker tournament at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles in support of his own charity, the Urban Health Institute. Actor Don Cheadle, reality TV star Khloe Kardashian and Playboy founder Hugh Hefner were among the celebrity guests, as was Brown's father. The charity, which has now been disbanded, later came under scrutiny after it was revealed that only a small proportion of its funds was ever spent on the needy. In the dock: Brown insisted he was innocent and his defence team claimed the authorities had a vendetta against him . Brown had to post $4million bail following his arrest because LA authorities were concerned that he could abscond to Bermuda while awaiting trial. He is now being probed by white-collar crime investigators over allegations that he defrauded a national health insurance scheme. Kevin Brown is the second of Ewart Brown's four sons to be jailed. Younger son Maurice Pitt, 29, is currently serving a ten-year sentence in California for armed robbery. Controversial: Ewart Brown's premiership was dogged by scandal . Ewart Brown - who attended the Criminal Court House in Los Angeles throughout his son's three-week trial -  also practiced as a doctor in the city, but returned to his native Bermuda in 1993 to pursue a political career. He eventually took over the premiership of Britain's oldest colony in 2006 and secured a third general election victory for the Progressive Labour Party in 2007. But his four-year premiership was beset by controversy. Bermuda's national debt ballooned from $300million to more than $1billion under his flamboyant and confrontational leadership and Brown was often accused of squandering taxpayer money. In one nine-month period he ran up bills of $265,000 on overseas travel alone, staying at exclusive resorts such as the seven-star Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai and travelling in limousines accompanied by crews of bodyguards and flunkeys. In 2007, leaked police documents revealed Premier Brown had been a focus of an investigation into multi-million dollar corruption at a government-run housing quango set up to provide affordable accommodation for the poor. Prosecutors later stated that they could find evidence only of  'unethical rather than illegal' behaviour, and no charges were filed. Brown later demanded that control of Bermuda's police service be transferred from the Crown to his own government. And the regime was constantly accused of cronyism and corruption - particularly when lucrative government contracts were 'awarded ' to associates rather than put out to tender, only to then run massively over budget. Hobnobbing: Despite being a fervent supporter of independence, Dr Brown hosted a state visit by the Queen in 2009 . Premier Brown's successor, Paula Cox, has promised to launch an inquiry into how one such contract was awarded, while the Auditor General's office has been granted fresh powers to investigate government contracts under Brown's premiership. Premier Brown - who was also held the Tourism Ministry portfolio during his leadership -  came in for further criticism after it was revealed he attended his son's 2008 charity poker tournament at the Playboy Mansion. Newspapers on the island claimed that Brown's Tourism Ministry had donated prizes for the charity event in the form of free holidays to Bermuda. The expose caused outrage on the deeply Christian and conservative territory, where gambling and pornography are illegal. And the controversial leader also survived a 2009 no-confidence motion - and a public demonstration outside Parliament - after personally negotiating an under-the-table deal with the White House for four Guantanamo Bay prisoners to be repatriated to the North Atlantic territory. The incident embarrassed Downing Street which is responsible for Bermuda's national security and foreign affairs. The Queen's representative on the island, Governor Sir Richard Gozney, was unaware of the deal until the plane transporting the four inmates touched down on the island. Three-times married Premier Brown, 65, a staunch advocate of independence, later claimed he had acted on humanitarian grounds, but critics argued the move was a calculated snub to Britain and, with his son awaiting trial in the U.S., a deliberate attempt to curry favour and influence with lawmakers in Washington. Always claiming that he would stand for just one term in office, Premier Brown quit politics last year and has remained largely out of the public eye ever since. He spends his retirement in lavish properties in Manhattan, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Martha's Vineyard and Bermuda. A petition requesting a Royal Commission of Inquiry 'into the numerous and various allegations and implications of Government fiscal impropriety and corruption' is now being circulated across the island. And in Britain, MP Andrew Rosindell - chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Overseas Territories - has written to the Foreign and Commonwealth office and Bermuda's governor calling for an investigation into corruption on the island.",Kevin Brown is second of former Bermuda Premier Ewart Brown's four sons to be jailed .

Difficult job: Detectives are asking members of the public if they recognise this man - who appears to be headless in this image - following a series of arson attacks in Harrow . When detectives find a picture of that vital person they need to speak too following a crime, it makes their job all the more easier. But the Metropolitan Police may find it difficult to track down this man. Officers are asking members of the public if they recognise him following a series of arson attacks in Harrow. There is just one problem - he appears to be headless. A source at the Metropolitan Police confirmed it was the best image they had of the man they want to speak too. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is not believed anybody has yet identified him. Detective Sergeant Andy Simpson, of . Harrow CID, who is investigating the fire, said: 'The quality of the . image is quite grainy, and the suspect is covering his face, however we . are releasing this image in the hope that someone may recognise this . person by the clothes he is wearing, his build or even his gait. 'It's often the case that a CCTV image of a person may appear . unrecognisable but can often be identified by someone they live with or . work closely with.' Police believe the man could hold vital information following a fire at Cedars Hall in Harrow Weald in January, which caused damage to a door and the roof of the building. Detectives think this incident could be linked to a series of arson attacks in the Harrow Weald area. This includes one in the early hours of .

'It's absolutely ludicrous - the funniest e-fit I have ever seen.' The same force was also criticised for issuing an e-fit of a boy believed to be just nine years old - below the age of criminality, meaning even if he was caught he could not have been prosecuted. The wanted boy was said to have knocked another youngster to the ground and kicked him in the head when he refused to let go of his toy in a park.

"Mystery surrounds last hours of victim who was known to frequent gay clubs in central London . By . Chris Greenwood and Lynn Davidson . UPDATED: . 10:12 EST, 4 November 2011 . Murdered: Property developer William John Saunderson-Smith was killed in his own home in West London . A man who was found brutally murdered in his house is a secretive multi-millionaire who stashed ‘mind-boggling’ sums of cash around his homes, police have said. Officers investigating the death of businessman William John Saunderson-Smith have been stunned by his mysterious lifestyle. Mr Saunderson-Smith was found bludgeoned to death in the attic bedroom of his £850,000 home in West Kensington, west London on the afternoon of October 21. Scotland Yard forensic teams have found wads of £20 and £50 notes stuffed in plastic bags as they strip the building bare in the hunt for clues about the killing. They have so far uncovered around £150,000 in cash at the reclusive property developer's home in Dewhurst Road, where his body was found, and also at a property on nearby Sedlescombe Road. No weapon has yet been discovered and no arrests have been made. Police believe Mr Saunderson-Smith used different identities to conceal a sprawling property empire that spanned London, Dorset and overseas. The 58-year-old is suspected of living ‘under the radar’ for decades, demanding cash from tenants and concealing his affairs from the authorities. Mr Saunderson-Smith was known to frequent gay clubs in central London but police, who admit details on the circumstances leading to his death remain 'sketchy', are not treating it as a homophobic crime. At first investigators suspected he may have been attacked by burglars as they searched the three-storey property for valuables. Appeal for witnesses: Mr Saunderson-Smith was attacked and killed at his home in Dewhurst Road, West Kensington . But a finger-tip search of the . property, which was being refurbished and split into flats, uncovered a . ‘mind-boggling’ amount of hidden cash. His car was littered with more than 80 documents, some dating back many . years, suggesting the victim may own yet more property. But despite his huge property portfolio and wealth, police can find little trace of him on official databases and records. They have yet to trace any relatives or business partners and have uncovered only a handful of acquaintances. Detectives have discovered Mr . Saunderson-Smith, who was known as ‘John’, used slight variations of his . name and different birth dates on official paperwork. Detective Chief Inspector Howard . Groves, who is leading the inquiry, said the key to finding his killers . may lie in unravelling his background. He said: ‘We are trying to establish . whether he could have fallen out with anyone and details about his . private life. This is an individual who has always been on his own. 'At present, details regarding Mr Saunderson-Smith's life, and the events leading up to his death, remain sketchy. 'Whilst local inquiries are ongoing, . we are now extending our appeals to anyone who knew Mr Saunderson-Smith . from his frequent visits to gay clubs in and around the Old Brompton . Road and Kennington areas. Secret life: He was known to frequent London gay clubs, similar to the one pictured . 'This could be crucial in assisting us to build a complete picture about his life. I must stress that we are not treating this as a homophobic crime. However, we are keeping an open mind as to the reasons behind his murder. 'We understand that Mr Saunderson-Smith had a number of people in his life through business and leisure interests. I am urging anyone who knew him to contact us.' He added: ‘There is an awful lot we do not know about him. We have a mountain to climb in establishing his business interests. ‘Then there are his family and . friends. Here is someone who has lived a lonely existence for many . years. He does not seem to have a large circle of friends or family. ‘It would appear he has got a large property portfolio and it is one that extends beyond these shores. ‘We have spent a week going through . his property. We have recovered a significant amount of cash – it is . mind-boggling, it beggars belief.’ Mr Saunderson-Smith died from a series . of savage blows to his head sometime between the evening of Thursday . October 20 and the following afternoon. Police found a window at the Dewhurst . Road house was unlocked but are not sure if the killer broke in or came through the front door. Forensic officers have spent more than . a week scouring the property which is full of building debris, . construction materials and junk. The victim told some people he had inherited ‘a lot of money’ but police are not convinced this is true. Mr Saunderson-Smith bought the property where he died in 1981 and let it out to dozens of tenants over the past 30 years. He also owned six £300,000 flats at a development in Wimbledon as well as rental homes in Dorset. Police said he was a ‘meticulous’ landlord who only rented his properties to employed professionals and kept detailed records. Tenants said their landlord was . ‘untraceable’. One said: ‘It will be a struggle to find him. We simply . don’t know anything about him.’ The victim represented himself at a . series of tribunal hearings in which residents complained about the size . of their rents and his refusal to pay other charges. Police have been unable to trace Mr . Saunderson-Smith’s family, but believe he is originally from the . Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire areas. They suspect someone may come forward as a result of publicity around the size of his personal fortune. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said no-one has been arrested over the murder and a weapon has not been recovered. • Anyone . with information was urged to contact the incident room on 020 8247 . 7821, or, if wishing to remain anonymous, Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.","Officers continue to find wads of £50 notes in plastic bags as they strip buildings bare in their search for clues .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 07:58 EST, 17 July 2011 . Legal action: Jude Law says he and his personal assitant's phones were hacked when he arrived at JFK airport . Rupert Murdoch's News Corp empire could face charges in America over phone hacking scandal after it was claimed that The News of the World hacked into Jude Law's phone while he was in the United States. It is the first specific case of hacking on U.S. soil leaving the company open to prosecution under federal law. The alleged hacking of Law and his personal assistant Ben Jackson took place shortly after they arrived at JFK airport, meaning their phones were operating in U.S. mobile networks. Prosecutions and costly law suits could be launched in the U.S. regardless of where the hacker was based. The company is already facing investigations by the FBI and Attorney General over claims the relatves of 9/11 victims were hacked. Murdoch's American empire is also said to be 'exploding and unravelling' as he faces the threat of losing control of his Fox and other cable networks if found guilty of breaching anti-corruption laws. One of the tycoon's most senior deputies Les Hinton has already quit  as CEO of Dow Jones, which published the Wall Street Journal. He was  chairman of the UK subsidiary News International when the hacking took place. He said he had no knowledge of the hacking. Law, 38, who is also suing the News of the World's stablemate The Sun, claims that the Sunday tabloid hacked into his phone and used the messages for four articles in 2005 and 2006. The hacking is alleged to have taken place when he was staying in New York en route to Canada to film I Heart Huckabees. The story claimed that Law had sent his personal assistant ahead when he arrived at JFK to check for waiting photographers and ring him if it was safe to emerge. A News of the World reporter watched Law arrive at the airport. Crumbling empire: Rupert Murdoch has alreadty seen Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton, right, resign amid claims he could lose control of his U.S. cable networks . The News of the World story said: 'The star ... refused to leave the baggage reclaim hall until Ben had spent 20 minutes scouring the arrivals lounge. Ben rang Jude on his mobile to confirm the coast was clear.' It also detailed where Law was staying and how much his hotel bill came to. The story went on to give details of Law's arrival at The Carlyle Hotel that evening. It also gave the number of the room where Law was staying and how much he spent on room service. Brian Kabateck, a Los Angeles lawyer who has represented victims of phone hacking in the U.S. told the Daily Telegraph: 'If phones or messages were hacked while these individuals were here in the US, this would clearly be a criminal offence under the federal wiretap acts. 'The authorities take this very seriously here. As well as being an offence under federal status, the victims would also have the right to bring a civil damages case.' Splash: Front page of the August 1, 2007 edition of the Wall Street Journal reporting that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp will purchase Dow Jones & Co . As well as civil cases in the U.S., News Corp could face prosecution under the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which makes it illegal for American firms to bribe foreign officials after the company allegedly paid British police officers for information. Salt was rubbed into the wound by . comments  from John Podesta, president of the Centre for . American Progress, a liberal think tank, and the man who helped Obama's . transition to the White House in 2008. He told the Globe and Mail: 'This is . not one rogue editor. This is an empire that was built on a set of . journalistic ethics that's beginning to explode and unravel. 'They . were routinely bribing public officials. We've called attention to the . fact that this story is going to go on for a while, this is not a . two-week story, I don't think.' He is one of a number of senior Democrats hoping Murdoch's U.S. empire will fall in the wake of the scandal. The White House has long fought with Fox News, owned by News Corporation, and boycotted the channel for a time. Now there are increasing signs . Murdoch could lose control of all his cable channels in America, which . include National Geographic and FX as well as Fox. Under federal law, holders of television and radio stations . licences have to undergo character tests to show they are fit and . proper to be media owners. Probe: Attorney General Eric Holder is . considering launching a formal investigation into claims News Corp, for . which John Podesta, of the Centre for American Progress, predicts a dire . future . Murdoch seems unlikely to pass those . tests if Wall . Street’s fierce regulator, The Securities and Exchange Commission, . seeks to enforce the part of the foreign bribery law that requires . companies to keep accurate books, according to the Los Angeles Times. If . it is proven that a company violates this and U.S anti-bribery . provisions, there is a penalty of up to $2m, and if convicted, employees . could face up to five years in prison. Julius . Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, . reportedly said this week the allegations should be investigated, but . did not say whether his organisation would launch such a probe. Yesterday Mr Holder confirmed the . Department of Justice is responding to calls from lawmakers to . investigate claims News Corporation hacked into the phones of 9/11 . victims. At a press conference in Sydney, he . said: 'There have been serious allegations raised in that regard in . Great Britain; there is an ongoing investigation. 'There have been members of Congress . in the United States who have asked us to investigate those same . allegations. And we are progressing in the regard using the appropriate . federal agencies in the United States.' He also confirmed reports yesterday that the FBI has launched its own informal probe into the allegations. Jeopardised: Any convictions against News Corporation could make obtaining television licenses for broadcasting programmes difficult . It . comes as senior Democrats questioned whether Murdoch's American papers, . such as the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal, may also have . engaged in telephone hacking. The Democratic Senate Campaign Committee has already launched an online petition to demand the truth from Murdoch. It . reads: 'It's time for Rupert Murdoch to come clean and immediately tell . the American people whether his company targeted any American's here at . home. Sign our petition to demand the truth.' Representative Peter King wrote: ‘If . these allegations are proven true the conduct would merit felony charges . for attempting to violate various federal statues related to corruption . of public officials and prohibitions against wiretapping. ‘Any person found guilty of this purported conduct should receive the harshest sanctions available under law.’ A spokesman for News International denied the new claims against the Sun, Britain's best selling daily newspaper. The company issued a statement saying: 'We believe this is a deeply cynical and deliberately mischievous attempt to draw The Sun into the phone-hacking issue.' 'By their own admission, News . International have misled the police, parliament and the public for . nearly five years about the extent of the wrongdoing by their . journalists and executives. Some in the business world think Murdoch’s days are numbered at the helm of News Corporation. Porter Bibb, managing partner at . Mediatech Capital Partners, was reported as saying: ‘It is very likely, . there will be at some point... an entire new management. ‘It’s . a fine company, it has great assets and a terrific future but Murdoch’s . influence despite his de facto ownership is going to being diminished.’","Actor says his phone was hacked on arrival at JFK airport .

Mr Cooley told MailOnline: 'Even though it was several years ago, it has been rough, to lose your best friend like that.' When Mr Cooley took his fiancee's body to her home in Florida to lay her to rest, her family, whom he had never met, turned on him inexplicably. He said: 'Paulette's parents asked me if I had a drug addiction or had been in rehab and I had no idea where it came from. I asked them if they wanted a background check and her father said he would. 'I was so upset, I called my sister and she told me lies that I was a pervert were all over the Internet. I was devastated and went back to the cemetery to spend time with Paulette.'

Defamatory: It was on this website Topix that a host of anonymous users were able to throw a slew of accusations around about Mr Cooley, calling him a pervert and a drug addict . On a forum for his hometown of Blairsville in Georgia, numerous users had spread accusations  calling Mr Cooley a drug user and a pervert. There were also posts saying he should . be kept away from children and even that he was an accomplice in his . fiancee's murder. The family were so convinced from what they read about their daughter's fiance, they barred him from her funeral. Even when a sheriff told the family that Mr Cooley's record was clean and the allegations were untrue, they still asked the grieving man to leave. Mr Cooley said: 'These people were going to be my in-laws and they were kicking me out. Later, they changed their minds but it was too late - the damage had been done. 'Two days after my fiancee's funeral, I slept in a rental car on the beach in Florida.' Because of the seriousness of the allegations against him, Mr Cooley lost his job as a barber and hair stylist. Mr Cooley told MailOnline: . 'Blairsville is a small community, maybe a mile square and it doesn't . take long for news to travel from one side to the other. 'Because of my job I was well-known, . I would say hello to everyone. I was fired because of the rumours and . gossip and shunned out of the town.' Moving on: Mr Cooley has now moved back to Blairsville to be with his first two sons, has a job and new friends. He is trying to make libelous Internet attacks a crime . To escape the unwarranted attention in Blairsville, which has a population of around 700, Mr Cooley moved 200 miles away to Augusta where a friend Bruce Petett offered to take him in and help him start his life over. A while later he sought the advice of an attorney, Russell Stookey - who knew little about Topix but agreed to take on the case.

Once he had the IP addresses in his possession from Topix, Mr Stookey was able to find out who the anonymous posters were - as each one is backed up by a telephone number and address from where the Internet was accessed. Although there were more than one, the most poisonous posts were traced back to one woman - Sybil Denise Ballew. Mr Cooley told MailOnline: 'I had no idea who she was. 'When we went to trial, I even said good morning to her and her husband sitting outside court because I didn't recognise them - before she went in and took the stand.' They later figured out Ballew had worked with Mr Cooley ten years before at a general store and had taken a disliking to him. Mr Cooley said: 'I also found out that she worked as a dishwasher at a restaurant Paulette and I would often go to but I didn't know her name. He continued: 'Sybil Ballew is a person with hate in her heart. I have no idea what I did so terrible to tick off this person but I wasn't the only one. I had dozens of calls after the trial from people saying she had done the same to them. She even taunted an ex-boyfriend for ten years.' In January 2010, more than two years after Paulette Harper's death, Ballew was tried on defamation charges. I was fired because of the rumours and . gossip and shunned out of the town. Gene Cooley . She claimed she wanted to get revenge on Mr Cooley for inappropriate behavior towards her when they worked together and to protect Ms Harper's daughter from being around him after her murder. When asked why she thought he was a pervert, she told the court: 'I watched him, and I can tell a pervert. 'Every time a pretty girl . walked by, he would look at them. I get a feeling.' Mr Cooley was eventually awarded $404,000 in civil court but said that he was not motivated by money but to restore his reputation and to protect those vulnerable to Internet hate campaigns and cyber bullying. More importantly, Mr Cooley did it for Stephanie, now 13, who would have been his stepdaughter. He has not seen the girl since her mother's funeral in 2008. He said: 'I did it for Stephanie to show her how much I love her and her mom. 'I also wanted to show Paulette's family that I am not the person I was made out to be.' Mr Cooley and his lawyer were now campaigning to make libelous internet acts a crime. 'My ultimate goal is to save a life - if I can stop someone being slandered and this sort of thing ruining people's lives,' the father-of-two said. 'On other sites you have to register your details before you can make comments. It's disgusting that on Topix anyone can go on anonymously.

Tolles declined to be interviewed, but in a statement to ABC's 20/20,  said: 'Topix pre-filters user commentary' and 'cooperates with law . enforcement ... while being as respectful as possible with our user's . privacy.' Since the tragic events which shattered his life, Mr Cooley has moved back to Blairsville to be with his two sons and tries to move forward. 'All you can do is keep the faith and keep going.

"By . Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 14:24 EST, 18 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:42 EST, 20 March 2012 . For the second time during the primaries, Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum has made a blunder about Puerto Rico. On the day Puerto Ricans head to the polls to cast their votes for the nation's next president, Mr Santorum referred to the archipelago as a ‘Spanish-speaking country.’ In fact, Puerto Rico is not a country at all, but an unincorporated territory of the United States. Last week, the former Pennsylvania senator told a Puerto Rican newspaper that the territory’s admittance as the America’s 51st state was contingent on its residents speaking English as its official language. OK by me in America: Today, Santorum slipped and called Puerto Rico a Spanish-speaking country . Claim to fame: Rick Santorum (left) claims he'll win the GOP nomination if he can beat Romney (right) in Illinois this Tuesday - despite estimates that he trails Romney by some 240 delegates . Puerto Rico's residents cannot vote in general elections, but are set to award 20 delegates in their Sunday Republican primary. Turnout appeared light around the . island, and officials predicted about 150,000 people would cast ballots . in the Republican primary. Among them was Francisco Rodriguez, a . 76-year-old pro-statehood architect who was supporting Mr Romney, in . part because the former Massachusetts governor had secured the . endorsement of Gov. Luis Fortuno and other leading politicians. 'He has a stronger connection to . Puerto Rico and that will help us in the process of becoming a state,’ Mr Fortuno told the Associated Press. He had kind words for Mr Santorum, . describing him as a 'person of faith, a good Catholic,' but thinks the . former senator hurt himself with his statements that English should be . the official language. 'In Puerto Rico, we get along fine with both languages,' he said. On Saturday, Mr Santorum boldly claimed he’ll garner the Republican nomination if he wins Tuesday’s primary in Illinois. Speaking . yesterday in the state, he said: ‘If we’re able to come out of Illinois . with a huge or surprise win, I guarantee you, I guarantee you that we . will win this nomination.’ However, . rival Mitt Romney rebutted by asserting that his prospects look the . sunniest, saying: ‘I bet I’m going to become the nominee.’ X marks the spot: Puerto Rico's Governor Luis Fortuno shows his ballot to the press after marking it with an 'X' under the photo of Mitt Romney during the Republican presidential primary election . Mr Romney’s claim seemed much more suited, as he currently leads Mr Santorum by an estimated 243 delegates; Illinois will only award 69. 'If we're able to come out of Illinois . with a huge or surprise win, I guarantee you that we . will win this nomination.' -Rick Santorum . However, recent polls show the former senator is favoured by conservatives in the state’s southern areas. The former Massachusetts governor told Fox News Sunday: ‘I can’t tell you exactly how the process is going to work,’ referring to the rest of the Republican primaries, which run through June 26. He continued: ‘I sure hope I’m going to become the nominee, and if I am, I’m going to be a strong nominee.’ Rally for Rick: Yesterday, Illinoisans gathered to support Rick Santorum at John Boos and Co. in Effingham, Illinois . He faces brighter prospects in Tuesday’s primary, as Illinois is generally seen as friendly territory. In addition, Mr Romney has a big edge in delegates, campaign cash and organizational resources. Odds aside, Mr Santorum appears resolute. He told CNN's State of the Union that 'we're in this to win' and that there's too little difference between Mr Romney and President Obama to satisfy conservative Republicans. Mr Santorum says conservatives want a chance to nominate a conservative to take on the Democratic incumbent and 'we're going to give them an opportunity.' The former Pennsylvania senator hasn't qualified for the ballot in all the states on the election calendar and sometimes has had trouble fielding full slates of delegates in some states. But he says he's doing pretty well with scarce resources, compared with the deep-pocketed Romney campaign. The Midwestern state's Republicans are relatively moderate and on paper should give Romney a boost after he lost to Santorum in Alabama and Mississippi this week. Illinois is Democratic President Barack Obama's home state and is expected to vote for Obama in the November 6 presidential election over the Republican challenger. But many Republicans believe he needs more than just delegate math and must produce some big wins in the state-by-state campaign to prove he is a worthy front-runner. 'If Romney wins Illinois, people will say he is sealing the deal as a front-runner candidate,' Republican strategist Ron Bonjean told Reuters. Delicious dish: Romney attended a pancake brunch at the American Legion Post in Moline, Illinois . Reason to smile: Current estimates place Romney miles ahead of any of the other GOP hopefuls . 'If he loses, then they're saying he still has a lot of work to do and he's relying on delegate math and that he may win by the numbers but he also has to win by momentum to generate enthusiasm.' Forces loyal to Romney are pouring money into Illinois. Romney and his backers are believed to be spending more than $4 million there, while Santorum's outside group announced a $310,000 effort. Word on the street was that Romney came under pressure to win Illinois from some of his financial backers during a day of fundraising in New York on Wednesday. 'The money guys made it clear that you've got to win Illinois,' said a veteran Republican strategist, who asked to remain unidentified. Mr Romney campaign sources cast doubt on the comment and said they were not aware of any such demand. 'I don't think anything big happened or I would've heard about it,' said one. Mr Romney has already had big victories this year when his back was against the wall. He won Florida decisively after losing South Carolina to Gingrich, and turned back Santorum in Michigan and Ohio.","Called Puerto Rico 'Spanish-speaking country' though territory is actually unincorperated U.S. commonwealth .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:30 EST, 21 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:35 EST, 21 March 2012 . A woman has been accused of offering a friend 'with a past' $25,000 to kill her husband after he failed to give her money from the sale of a house. Doreen Dufresne, 50, from Port Orange, Florida, has been released on bail after confessing to the plan, which she claims she regrets making. Police added that they had no plans to probe the death of her second husband, who died after he swallowed anti-freeze in 2001. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Police said Doreen Dufresne, 50, . admitted to asking a friend to kill her estranged third husband for . cash. The pair had fallen out over money . The death, which occurred after Lawrence Blackwood consumed the poison over an extended period of time, was classed as a suicide. Dufresne asked her friend Brandon Parrish, who had a criminal history, if he could 'take care of' her estranged third husband, Neil Suchy, 70. She told the fellow nurses aide she would be willing to give him the entirety of her husband's $25,000 life insurance policy, ABC News reported. Horrified, Parrish told her he would find someone to act as a hit man - in order to stall Dufresne so he could alert police. Honest: Dufresne asked Brandon Parrish, pictured, as he had a criminal history and she thought he would take up the offer - but he alerted police . 'I just didn't want to go the rest of my life knowing I could have . prevented someone from being killed,' Parrish told WFTV. Dufresne had allegedly intended to kill her husband after he had sold their home for $72,000 but did not split the money with her as promised. Parrish said she had told him that her husband of two years had hit her and molested her granddaughter. She gave Parrish detailed instructions of where to find Suchy, what his truck looked like and directions to his home, Parrish told police. Parrish immediately called Suchy, who then went to the police station. Past: Police said Dufresne (pictured) will not be quizzed over her second husband, whose death was classed as suicide after he ingested antifreeze . Public records show he married Dufresne, whom he had known for more than 20 years, two months after his wife had died, ABC reported. He claimed Dufresne had complained they had separate bank accounts and that he did not help support her daughter and two-year-old granddaughter. When police visited her for questioning, Dufresne claimed she hadn't heard from her husband before changing her story to say she she had. When police asked her about these contradictions, she said: 'Neil and I have been fighting a lot lately.' She admitted she had asked Parrish to kill Suchy, police said, and was arrested on March 14 and charged with solicitation to commit murder. Intentions: Dufresne, who lives with her daughter and granddaughter (above), allegedly gave Parrish detailed plans about where to find her husband . Dufresne told police she had asked Parrish for help as he was convicted of a sex crime in 1995 and she thought he would accept the offer. It comes 11 years after Blackwood, Dufresne's second husband, was found dead in their home in New Hampshire. An autopsy found he had died from consuming antifreeze 'over a period of time' and the death was ruled as suicide. 'Nothing suspicious in nature was found,' Robert Browne, a spokesperson for the Goffstown Police Department, told ABC News. He added there were no plans to reopen the case.

"Authorities allegedly missed chances to catch suspect cashing cheques . By . Mark Duell and Louise Boyle . UPDATED: . 16:42 EST, 19 October 2011 . Twelve young people - some of whom were feared to be dead - have been found by authorities investigating the horrific ‘house of horrors’ basement where four disabled victims were kept in chains. The eight children and four young adults are said to be related to victims or suspects in the case in Philadelphia. The FBI and police are trying to locate up to 50 victims in the alleged kidnapping ring. The young people, who showed signs of abuse and malnutrition, have been taken into protective care - and police believe the ring spanned Texas, North Carolina, Florida, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Horror chamber: The dark and filthy basement in Philadelphia where four disabled people were kept chained to pipes and made to use buckets as toilets . It's the latest twist in the . extraordinary story of the filthy basement where the victims were kept . chained to a boiler, which reeked of waste from the buckets they used to . relieve themselves. Linda Ann Weston, 51, her boyfriend . Gregory Thomas, 47, her daughter Jean McIntosh, 32, and Eddie Wright, 50, allegedly locked up Derwin . McLemire, 41, Herbert Knowles, 40, Tamara Breeden, 29, and Edwin Sanabria, 31. Authorities believe the alleged theft . scheme involved more victims and the gang were keeping the four mentally . disabled adults in squalor while wresting control of their Social . Security cheques. A 19-year-old found among the young people is Beatrice Weston - niece of the alleged ringleader. She was missing for two years and is said to have been . physically abused. Police said she has burn marks suggesting she was scolded with a hot spoon and had . pellet gun wounds. Vile: Makeshift beds and dirty blankets filled the sub-basement which was home to four vulnerable individuals who were being robbed for their social security cheques . The case could be among the first of its kind prosecuted as a federal hate crime. The law was recently expanded to include victims with disabilities and the FBI is taking a broad look at the complex case, an official said. The 2009 Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr Hate Crimes Prevention Act is named for two victims of notorious hate killings and expands earlier federal hate-crimes law to include sexual orientation or disability and other things. The law has been used sparingly since its passage. The first to go to trial was the case of Frankie Mayberry, of Green Forest, Arkansas, who was convicted in May of attacking a car last year with five Hispanic men inside it. ‘She is in very, very poor condition,’ Philadelphia Police Lieutenant Ray Evers told WPVI. ‘She has lost a lot . of weight. She has newer injuries, definitely some older injuries, a . lot of scarring.’ Two of the children recovered are . believed to have been those of Ms Breeden and they are anticipated to be . reunited with the mother later this week, reported WPVI. Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey . described a ‘very complicated case’ and a ‘very sad story’. ‘It makes no . sense,’ he said. ‘When you look at the kids, the psychological trauma . is pretty apparent.’ Earlier on Tuesday it was revealed a . teenage girl missing since July - from an area in Florida where . neighbours said the suspects had come from earlier this month - . was located in Philadelphia. Found: Benita Rodriguez, 15, who was missing since July 4 from West Palm Beach, Florida, has also been located by Philadelphia police. Her boyfriend's father is one of the four suspects - Gregory Thomas . Three of the four victims spoke out of . their horror at being locked up in a low-ceiling, dank room that . contained a mattress with bedding and a flat board with a pillow and a . boiler. 'She has lost a lot of weight. She has newer injuries, definitely some older injuries, a lot of scarring . Philadelphia Police Lieutenant Ray Evers on Beatrice Weston . The squalid conditions of the . sub-basement were revealed behind a locked door under apartments in the . city's Tacony neighbourhood. There were a few water bottles but no food. And on Tuesday it was revealed Benita . Rodriguez, 15, who was missing since July from West Palm Beach in . Florida, where neighbours said the group had come from, was found by . police. The girl's mother said the 15-year-old . had been friends with one of the suspect's sons, Gregory Thomas Jr, and . was reportedly found by Philadelphia police on Monday with three of the suspects. Victims: Tamara Breeden, Derwin McLemire and Herbert Knowles (left-right) speak after being rescued . Miss Rodriguez was not in the basement . and details surrounding her connection to the case are sketchy, with . police not yet sure how much she knew about the 'house of horrors'. Held captive: Herbert Knowles went missing from his home in Norfolk, Virginia three years ago . The identity of one of the four . disabled victims was revealed earlier this week as Herbert Knowles, 40, . who went missing three years ago from his home in Norfolk, Virginia. The family of Mr Knowles said he moved . in with a girlfriend and her mother - the suspect Weston - three years . ago. That was the last time they heard from him until he was rescued at . the weekend. His niece Tiffany Davis told Wavy TV: . They describe him as if he was some kind of animal. You got him chained . in the basement. All the lights are out. There are buckets for him to . use the bathroom.' Derwin McLemire, 41, another victim, . told KYW: 'That was real dirty of you. That was wrong.' The North . Carolina man said he unsuccessfully tried to escape from Weston's home . ‘so they got me'. Mr McLemire had forgotten what day it . was. 'I got a birthday coming up Friday and I didn’t even know it was . coming up,' he told CBS Philly. He said of Weston: 'She wouldn’t let me . do nothing.' A third victim was identified by . Tamara Breeden. She alleged to KYW that she was hit in the head by . Weston and 'all this was bleeding and everything'. The fourth victim was Edwin Sanabria, 31. Locked in: There are fears that the four found in Philadelphia are just some of many across the country being kidnapped for money and held captive . Ms Breeden, 29, was reported missing . six years ago - but the case was reportedly closed by police last year . in Philadelphia even though detectives had not found her, reported . myFOXphilly.com. 'That was real dirty of you. That was wrong' Victim Derwin McLemire . The four suspects have been charged . with kidnapping and other related offences, and Weston, Thomas and Wright are all being held . on $2.5million bail each. Those three were arrested on Monday. McIntosh was arrested on Wednesday. Lieutenant Ray Evers said: 'Without a . doubt. This is just the beginning of this investigation. We think she's . been doing this for quite some time.' Authorities in at least two states missed opportunities to help the disabled adults. Weston was legally disqualified from cashing the victims' government disability cheques because of her criminal past. But she apparently did anyway - enabled in part by a lack of accountability and follow-through by government agencies and police in Philadelphia and West Palm Beach, Florida. Grim discovery: Sgt. Joseph Green walks down the steps leading to the sub-basement where four weak and malnourished adults, one chained to a boiler, were found at the weekend . The 'dungeon', as it was described by officials, was littered with bottles, blankets and clothing items. The . four captives, who are said to have the mental age of a ten-year-old, . were taken to Frankford Hospital and have since been discharged to a . group home, where they were being looked after. 'Without a doubt. This is just the beginning of this investigation. We think she's been doing this for quite some time' Philadelphia Police Lieutenant Ray Evers . Police said they were malnourished and some had bruises and bed sores. At least one was kept chained to a pipe in the room. They are thought to have been held captive for more than a year. It was also revealed that Weston, the . alleged ringleader of the gang, had previously served eight years for . starving someone to death. She . was convicted of starving Bernardo Ramos, 25, to death after he refused . to support her sister's unborn child, the Philadelphia Inquirer . reported. Meanwhile police in Virginia confirmed they investigated the 2008 death of a woman living with Weston, who cleared out of the Norfolk home hours after calling police about the death. A death certificate says Maxine Lee, 39, died of meningitis but also suffered from a wasting disease. Vicious crime: Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey stands by the entrance to the dank basement room where four people were held against their will . Police said while officers were in the . basement of the eight-unit apartment building, they heard a noise . behind a locked steel door that sounded like a dog. 'This case just makes you shake your head; it's despicable and unspeakable' Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner Richard Ross . The . door was opened to reveal four people in a room not tall enough for an adult to stand up straight in. It was not clear how the suspects know the victims. On Saturday night, evidence . technicians carted out several feet of chains from the basement of the . apartment building. One emergency responder overheard some of the captives say they were handing over their government cheques to a caretaker.

A JetBlue Airways captain accused of disrupting a flight when he left the cockpit screaming about religion and terrorists plans to use an insanity defense at his trial. An attorney for Clayton F. Osbon has filed a motion outlining plans to argue his client was insane at the time of the incident on a March 27 flight from New York to Las Vegas. Osbon remains in jail in Texas awaiting a court-ordered psychiatric exam to determine his competency for trial and whether he was legally sane when witnesses say he left the cockpit and ran screaming through the plane's cabin about Jesus and al Qaeda. Scroll down for videos . Fit for trial? JetBlue captain Clayton Frederick Osbon, pictured being escorted by FBI agents, plans to plead insanity after being indicted on one count of interference of a crew on a flight from New York to Las Vegas . Clayton Osbon, pictured right after being removed from the flight in restraints, and left, in his hometown, lost his father Ronald in a plane crash in April, 1995 . The veteran pilot, pictured, who has been a JetBlue captain for 12 years, started flying as a teenager with his father Ronald . Passengers wrestled him to the floor and he was subdued until the plane's co-pilot made an emergency landing in Amarillo. Prosecutor Christy Drake declined to comment on the filing yesterday. Earlier court documents show Osbon has been indicted on one count of interference of a flight crew. Passengers aboard flight 191 watched . in horror as  the 49-year-old ran through the aisle screaming 'say . your prayers' and banged on the cockpit door after being locked out by . his co-pilot Jason Dowd. Witnesses say Osbon ran through the cabin yelling about Jesus and al-Qaida, before four passengers wrestled the captain to the floor. Outnumbered: The captain was subdued thanks to the help of passengers on the flight 'packed with burly men' heading to the 2012 International Security Conference in Las Vegas . Lost control: Osbon, 49, screamed 'say your prayers, say your prayers' at horrified passengers after running up and down the aisle shouting 'Iraq, al-Qaeda, terrorism, we're all going down' Ranting: Clayton Osbon filmed here screaming at passengers on the flight from JFK to Las Vegas . They . restrained him with seat belt extenders and zip tie handcuffs while the . first officer diverted the flight to land in Amarillo. Osbon is undergoing a court-ordered psychiatric exam to determine whether he was legally sane and can stand trial. Under . federal law, a conviction for interfering with a flight crew can bring . up to 20 years in prison. The offense is defined as assaulting or . intimidating the crew, interfering with its duties or diminishing its . ability to operate the plane. Investigators . say Osbon told his co-pilot, 'things just don't matter', and rambled . incoherently about religion shortly after the flight departed from New . York. His behavior became more erratic as the flight wore on, . prosecutors say, and ended with the tense struggle in the cabin. Unplanned stop: This maps shows the route the Las Vegas bound flight 191 took after taking off from New York's JFK at 7.28am on Tuesday . Passengers . said the pilot seemed disoriented, jittery and constantly sipped water . when he first stormed from the cockpit and marched through the cabin. Then, they said, he began to rant about threats linked to Iran, Iraq and . Afghanistan after crew members tried to calm him down at the back of . the plane. The prosecution . motion that sought the psychiatric exam said the events of that day . ""establish a likelihood that Osbon may be suffering from a mental . disease or defect."" A flight attendant's ribs were bruised while trying to restrain Osbon, but no one on board was seriously hurt. A day after the incident JetBlue suspended Osbon pending a review of the flight. The veteran pilot started flying as a . teenager with his father Ronald who was killed after crashing his small . plane while enroute to look for treasure in Fort Lauderdale, according . to a 1995 story in the Washington Island Observer. His friends and family say there had been . no signs Osbon, who lives with his wife and son Richmond Hill, Georgia, may suffer from a break down. In custody: The unidentified captain is removed in restraints from the flight to a waiting ambulance . Outburst: Passengers said the pilot lost it after he went back to the cockpit and realized he had been locked out by his co-pilot . Osbon has been married to his wife Connye since 2005, according to the pilot's Facebook page. But witness accounts tell of a . disturbed man, who about three hours into the flight, began behaving . erratically, randomly talking with passengers on his way back to the . cockpit before discovering he had been locked out after Dowd changed the . security code behind him. When he went back to the cockpit and realized . he had been locked out, a passenger told ABC News Osbon began screaming 'let . me in'. Mark Sellouk told CBS: 'He's banging . on the door, yelling at the first officer, I think his name is Steve, . 'Bring the throttle to idle! Bring it to idle! Bring it to idle! We're . going down, we're all going to die! Pray to Jesus. Open this goddamn . door!' Tony Antolino, a 40-year-old . executive for a security firm, said the captain seemed disoriented and . agitated, then began yelling about an unspecified threat linked to Iran, . Iraq and Afghanistan. 'They're . going to take us down, they're taking us down, they're going to take us . down. Say the Lord's prayer, say the Lord's prayer,' the captain . screamed, according to Antolino. Antolino, who said he sat in the 10th . row, said he and three others tackled the captain as he ran for the . cockpit door. The passengers pinned the captain and held him down while the plane landed at . Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport. The flight had been packed with heavily built men . heading to the 2012 International Security Conference in Las Vegas held for professionals working in ‘law enforcement, border . protection and campus security’.

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 11:11 EST, 22 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:11 EST, 22 March 2012 . Payments: Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime . minister, took nearly 210,000 euros in secret . payments while in office and lied about them . Former Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern took at least 209,779 euros (£174,764) in secret payments while in office and repeatedly lied about them under oath, an inquiry has found. In a long-awaited end to an investigation into payments to politicians in the Republic, three judges also found two other former Fianna Fail lawmakers guilty of corrupt acts. They stopped short of finding Ahern guilty of corruption because they found no evidence the veteran politician gave favours to any of his cash donors. While the report itself was a fact-gathering effort and not a direct finding of any criminal wrongdoing, Prime Minister Enda Kenny referred its contents to prosecutors. Potential offences include corruption, obstruction of justice and tax evasion. No Irish politicians have been convicted of corruption as a result of the past 15 years of investigations into the bribery culture at the heart of Irish property development. Prosecutions are hampered, in part, by the fact that the government passed no credible anti-bribery laws until 1996, leaving tax evasion as the only readily proven offence. Ahern, whose often bizarre and implausible 2007 testimony enraptured the nation, denied doing anything wrong but resigned from office in 2008 after 11 years in power. He was not at his Dublin home today but issued a brief statement saying he was reading the report. His longtime accountant and personal friend, Des Peelo, conceded that Mr Ahern's testimony had been hard to swallow, but said the judges couldn't prove the former PM was lying. 'The fact that something is bizarre does not make it untrue. Some aspects of his finances were bizarre,' Mr Peelo said. Ahern's former special adviser in government, Gerry Howlin, described the findings as 'far worse than anything I expected or believed possible.' 'He told me he was telling the truth,' Mr Howlin said. 'His narrative is not believed, and it is damning and it is serious. ... His reputation has been very seriously damaged.' Several lawmakers in Fianna Fail called on its current leader, Micheal Martin, to expel Ahern from the party as punishment. Mr Martin has called a meeting of party officials to discuss the matter tonight. Padraig Flynn, left, a former Cabinet minister and European Union commissioner, and another Fianna Fail lawmaker, Liam Lawlor, right, another former lawmaker, were both found to have received corrupt payments . Voters last year ousted Fianna Fail from power and decimated its parliamentary ranks, a historic defeat driven by Ireland's humiliating negotiation of an international bailout. Ahern, 60, did not seek re-election. Interest in the judges' final 3,211-page report - the product of a 15-year investigation expected to cost taxpayers more than 200million euros (£167million) - was so great that the investigators' Web site repeatedly crashed. 'Much of the explanation provided by Mr Ahern as to the source of the substantial funds identified and inquired into in the course of the tribunal's public hearings was deemed by the tribunal to be untrue,' the judges found. They accused Ahern's government, which founded the original fact-finding tribunal in 1997, of launching a sustained attack on their work once the target of their investigation turned out to be Ahern himself. During his 15 days of testimony in 2007, Ahern admitted keeping most of the money in personal safes at his office and home from 1992 to 1994. He also admitted failing to keep a personal bank account during much of the time under investigation and paying no tax on any of the cash until the investigators uncovered its existence. Ahern testified that undocumented cash payments he received while in Britain were all unsolicited gifts, while identical payments he received in Ireland were loans. Under tax law at the time, overseas gifts and domestic loans were not taxable. Ahern made no repayments on the 1993 'loans' until the investigators discovered them in 2007. He ultimately negotiated a tax settlement for the unearthed funds. The judges repeatedly dismissed Ahern's explanations for the source of myriad Nineties cash payments in Irish pounds, British pounds and U.S. dollars that eventually were deposited into accounts in the name of his then-girlfriend, Celia Larkin, and his two daughters. He claimed to have won much of the money betting on horses. They rejected testimony provided by Ahern and several business friends who claimed to have raised money for him without his consent at a pub event in December 1993. The judges instead accepted as truthful the testimony of a senior Dublin stockbroker whom Ahern had identified as one of those friends. The stockbroker said he barely knew Ahern and had been asked by Fianna Fail to make a 5,000 euro (£4,166) political donation in a check made out to Ahern, which he did. The judges said they could not prove or rule out allegations by an Irish property developer, Tom Gilmartin, that a rival developer paid Ahern two bribes in 1989 and 1992 totaling more than 100,000 euros (£83,328). Mr Gilmartin testified that he bribed Padraig Flynn, a former Cabinet minister and European Union commissioner, and another Fianna Fail lawmaker, Liam Lawlor, as part of his unsuccessful effort to develop a Dublin shopping center. The judges accepted that Mr Gilmartin paid Flynn about 63,500 euros (£52,913), which the EU commissioner used towards buying a farm in his wife's name. They found that the businessman paid Lawlor £75,000 (91,000 euros), and that both payments were corrupt. Lawlor was briefly imprisoned several times for obstructing the tribunal's work and was killed in a Moscow car crash in 2005 while on a personal trip to buy properties. Personally popular: In his 2007 testimony to the Mahon Tribunal, Ahern admitted keeping most of the cash in safes and not paying any tax on the money . Ahern, who cultivated a persona as an affable and plain-spoken Dubliner, was personally popular while in office and credited with leading a frugal personal life. He was Fianna Fail's fund-raising director in the early Nineties and a protege of former Prime Minister Charles Haughey, who was found guilty by a previous tribunal of receiving more than 10million euros (£8.3million) in secret payments from many of Ireland's top businessmen while in office. Haughey faced no criminal charges, paid taxes and penalties of 6.5million euros (£5.4million), and died in 2006.","Two other former Fianna Fail lawmakers are found guilty of corruption .

He stands accused of a string of murders, but mob boss Thomas Gioeli's reputation could be put in jeopardy if the jury in his trial is shown a picture of him with the Sopranos cast, his lawyer claims. Gioeli, 59, is on trial for organising six killings in the 1990s to rise to the top of the Colombo crime family, including an off-duty cop who was gunned down for marrying a former mafia wife. The prosecution asked the judge yesterday to allow a photo of Gioeli posing with actors of the HBO mob series to be submitted as evidence. Reputed Colombo crime family boss Thomas Gioeli is led for arraignment in New York City . Gioeli is on trial with Colombo soldier Dino Saracino (right),  who is accused of taking part in three of the six killings . But his lawyer, Adam Perlmutter, protested, claiming: 'To connect Mr Gioeli with 'The Sopranos' television show is extraordinarily prejudicial.' 'It's a television show about organised crime.' he said, reports the New York Post. The 2007 photo, taken at a fundraiser at Mirage nightclub in Westbury, reportedly shows the mobster with a number of unidentified actors and former Columbo family captain, turned informant, Reynold Maragni . Judge Brian Cogan has yet to rule on whether or not the photo can be submitted. Former Bonnano underboss, turned informant, Salvatore Vitale, gave evidence at the trial yesterday . Also known as ‘Tommy Shots’, Gioeli is on trial with Colombo soldier Dino Saracino, 39, aka ‘Little Dino’, who is accused of taking part in three of the six killings. They are also accused of extortion, racketeering and other offences. The two men are said to have been operating during the 1990s when the New York-based Colombo crime family descended into a civil war. Former Bonnano underboss, turned informant, Salvatore Vitale, also known as 'Good Looking Sal' took the stand against the men yesterday where he painted a colourful picture of mob life and the internal chaos that blighted the Columbos. He said the family's power struggle was so destructive that the four other crime families called an intervention and organised for the New York Mafia Commission to hold a secret sit down. 'Bodies are all over the street, and legitimate people are getting killed. We can't go on like this,' a Genovese mobster said at the meeting, according to Vitale reports the Post. 'When it's all over the news, all over the newspapers, it's bad for business.' Vitale said during his four hours on the stand, according to the New York Times. The prosecution asked the judge yesterday to allow a photo of Gioeli posing with actors of the HBO mob series, The Sopranos . Prosecutor Christina Posa said that Gioeli and Saracino stuck with the family boss and set about executing those deemed to be traitors with ‘horrific acts’ which they planned meticulously. Targets would be trailed for days on end to assess their movements before they made their moves, the court heard. Miss Posa said: ‘As professional killers, that was their specialty - committing murder and getting away with it - until today’. William 'Wild Bill' Cutolo was lured into Saracino's apartment, where he was shot in the head from point blank range . Underboss William ‘Wild Bill’ Cutolo  was deemed to be a threat in 1999 because he was wealthy and influential, so Gioeli supposedly organised a kill squad including Saracino to get rid of him. The court heard Cutolo was lured into Saracino’s apartment where he was shot in the head from point blank range. The body was then wrapped in plastic and dumped in a remote location outside of New York where it was buried and covered in quicklime to help with the decomposition. The remains were undiscovered for 10 years until the FBI went looking and noticed the tip of Cutolo’s Italian loafers poking out of the ground. Vitale recalled the moment that he realised Cutolo was dead at a meeting held between the bosses of the Bonannos and Columbos in ana apartment in Brooklyn. He said he knew something was wrong when he saw that the seat that should have been taken by Cutolo was empty, reports the Times. When asked about the absences, another mobster boss from the family had said: 'You can't take in this life what's not yours,' Vitali recalled. 'I realized then that Wild Bill was dead,' he told the court. The most well known killing was that of NYPD cop Ralph Dols in 1997, the court was told. He was executed for marrying Kim Kennaugh who had previously wed three mobsters including consigliere Joel Cacace. Cacace allegedly took offence at being ditched for a policeman and ordered the cop dead, so turned to Gioeli who ambushed him outside his home in Brooklyn, New York. Gioeli is accused of supervising the hit squad in the killing of the officer as he and his wife and their baby daughter were outside their home in Gravesend, reports the Post. A 2007 photo, taken at a fundraiser at Mirage nightclub in Westbury, reportedly shows the mobster with a number of unidentified Sopranos actors and former Columbo family captain Reynold Maragni . Miss Posa said: ‘(Cacace) wanted Ralph Dols dead and he turned to that man to get it done’, pointing at Gioeli. The other alleged murders were Frank ‘Chestnut’ Marasa in 1991 to avenge the death of a Colombo family member. Gangsters John Minerva and Michael Imbergano were killed in 1992 because the former did not stand with the Colombo boss during the civil war. Mobster Richard Greaves was executed in 1995 for trying to leave the family. According to the New York Times, Gioeli’s lawyer Carl Herman dismissed the case and said that the FBI were ‘desperate’ having pursued him for two decades. Saracino’s lawyer Samuel Braverman said there was no physical evidence tying him to the crimes and that the witnesses were unreliable. He said: ‘I’m not here to tell you Dino is a choirboy. He isn’t. ‘I’m not here to tell you he didn’t commit the murders because he’s a nice guy. I’m telling you he didn’t commit the murders because he didn’t commit the murders.’ The trial at Brooklyn’s Federal Court continues.","Thomas Gioeli's lawyer claims pictures of the mobster with the HBO mob series actors will damage his case as the show is all about 'organised crime'

Attack: Anthony Teagle, 38, lured Anthony Morris to his home in Bristol, Avon, using his wife's phone and battered him on the doorstep . A jealous husband battered a PCSO who was having an affair with his wife after luring him to their home with messages he sent from her mobile, a court heard. Anthony Teagle, 38, sent two texts to PCSO Anthony Morris urging him to come to her home in Bristol, Avon. Teagle flew into a rage when Morris . replied with sexually explicit texts - detailing what he wanted to do . with Vanessa Phelps - and he attacked the officer as he arrived at the marital home . in Bristol. The defendant had initially contacted the PCSO to warn him off his wife, Vanessa, 35, who had been in a relationship with Mr Morris several years ago. Mr Morris suffered two black eyes, a broken arm and numerous cuts to his head, body and arms during the assault on February 19. Teagle, from Bristol, was later arrested and admitted causing actual bodily harm at Bristol Magistrates Court. James King, prosecuting, told the court Vanessa had previously been in a relationship with Mr Morris but their relationship ended when Teagle warned him off. But they met up again last December and began having an affair when Vanessa told Mr Morris she and Teagle were getting a divorce. Mr King said: 'On February 19 he (Mr Morris) left the police station having finished his shift. 'He says he had a text from Vanessa Phelps inviting him to an address. 'He went to the address, knocked on the door and it was answered by the defendant who proceeded to assault him.' In a statement read to the court Mr Morris said: 'I thought he was going to speak to me but he threw a volley of punches, using both his hands, into my face. Hospitalised: PCSO Anthony Morris was rushed to Bristol Royal Infirmary after being attacked by Anthony Teagle, 38, on the doorstep . 'I recall falling to the floor and landing on my back. I attempted to crawl away from Tony but he repeatedly stamped on my head, arm and face. I looked up and he was using both feet to stamp on me. 'I crawled backwards and was in the back corner of the driveway near the road. He was using a wooden fence so he could use both feet to stamp on my head. 'I was holding both arms up to block his feet and to protect my head. I would say he stamped on my head approximately four times.' Mr Morris was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary suffering from two swollen black eyes, cuts to his nose, neck, back, torso and head and a broken right arm. Police arrested Teagle and he admitted sending two text messages to Mr Morris asking him to come to the house. Mr King added: 'He had been angry and upset by Mr Morris’s responses which suggested he wanted to do something sexual to Vanessa. 'He said he had gone to the door with the intention of warning him off but became enraged and punched him in the head. He denied stamping on his head or arm.' Katy Welch, defending, said Teagle only accepts that he caused Mr Morris actual bodily harm on the basis that he repeatedly punched him. Magistrates adjourned the case to Bristol Crown Court for sentencing and a hearing for a judge to decide whether Teagle did stamp on Mr Morris’s head and arms. Teagle was released on unconditional bail and will appear at Bristol Crown Court next month.","PCSO Anthony Morris was having an affair with Vanessa Phelps who was divorcing her husband .

'I made a mistake': British scientist James Lovelock has admitted his previous claims about the deadly impact of climate change were too 'alarmist' Environmental scientist James Lovelock, renowned for his terrifying predictions of climate change's deadly impact on the planet, has gone back on his previous claims, admitting they were 'alarmist'. The 92-year-old Briton, who also developed the Gaia theory of the Earth as a single organism, has said climate change is still happening - just not as quickly as he once warned. He added that other environmental commentators, such as former vice president Al Gore, are also guilty of exaggerating their arguments. The admission comes as a devastating blow to proponents of climate change who regard Lovelock as a powerful figurehead. Five years ago, he had claimed: 'Before this century is over billions of . us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in . the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable.' But in an interview with msnbc.com, he admitted: 'I made a mistake.' He said: 'The problem is we don’t know what the climate is doing,' he told  'We thought we knew 20 years ago. That led to some alarmist books – mine included – because it looked clear cut, but it hasn’t happened. 'The climate is doing its usual . tricks. There’s nothing much really happening yet. We were supposed to . be halfway toward a frying world. '[The . temperature] has stayed almost constant, whereas it should have been . rising - carbon dioxide is rising, no question about that.' After two books - Revenge of Gaia: Why the Earth Is . Fighting Back and How We Can Still Save Humanity, and The Vanishing . Face of Gaia: A Final Warning: Enjoy It While You Can - he is writing a third. Drastic: Lovelock had previously claimed London would be threatened by rising sea levels by 2040 . Claims: While Lovelock would not go back on anything he said in his first book, published in 1979 (left), he admitted he should have exercised more caution in his second, in 2009 (right). He is writing a third . It will not go back on climate change, he said, but will admit he had been 'extrapolating too far'. It will suggest how people can change their habits to co-ordinate with the Earth's natural systems. Lovelock . said he is not the only one who got it wrong, suggesting other . environmental commentators, such as Al Gore and Tim Flannery, also . thought the impact would have been seen sooner. Now he admits: 'We will have global warming, but it’s been deferred a bit.' A long-time advocate of nuclear power, he suggested we should cut back on burning fossil fuels. James Lovelock developed the Gaia theory in the 1960s while working with NASA. It claims that all of the organic . and inorganic components of Earth are closely integrated to form a . single and self-regulating system. This living system has automatically . controlled global temperature, atmospheric content, oxygen, ocean . salinity, and other factors. In summary, it posits 'life maintains conditions suitable for its own survival'. The independent scientist, who is based . in south west England and has conducted research at Yale and Harvard . universities, has been a respected member of the academic . community for decades. He discovered the presence of harmful chemicals - CFCs - in the atmosphere in the 1960s. In 2007, Time magazine named him as one 13 leaders and visionaries in an article on Heroes of the Environment. In 1990, he became a CBE, presented to him by Queen Elizabeth II, and in 2003, she awarded him a Companion of Honour for his achievements in science. Peter . Stott, head of climate monitoring at the U.K.’s Met Office Hadley Centre, told msnbc.com he agreed Lovelock . had been too alarmist. But he added that Lovelock has 'had a lot of good ideas and interesting thoughts'.

Respect: In 2003, Queen Elizabeth II awards Lovelock a Companion of Honour for his achievements in science . 'I like the fact he’s provocative and provokes people to think about these things,' Stott said. The world’s average temperature has risen by around 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. By 2100, it will rise by another 2 to 11.5 degrees, it predicts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration added that data collected by satellites and sensors 'continue to show that the average global surface temperature is rising'. It added that extreme weather - such as heat waves and heavy rain - were becoming more frequent and that there had been decreases in snow and glaciers.

It weighs a pound and a half (700 grams) and is nine inches (25 centimeters) long. Dr Carlos Astocondor, of the medical team at Las Mercedes Hospital in the northern port of Chiclayo, says the condition occurs in about one of every 500,000 live births. Identical twins form when an egg splits in half after fertilisation. Anxious wait: Mr Pacunda carries his son on his shoulders at Las Mercedes hospital in Chiclayo, Peru, where the three-year-old was due to undergo surgery . But conjoined twins or foetus-in-foetu siblings, as in the case of Isbac, occur when the egg fails to fully separate. Dr Jonathan Fanaroff, a neonatologist at Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, said some conjoined twins can survive as 'parasites', but not when one twin absorbs the other. He told ABC News that the operation to remove Isbac's twin was likely to be far easier than attempting to separate two living conjoined siblings.",Surgeons planning to remove partially formed foetus from Peruvian toddler .

The family of Thomas Kinkade, the successful painter who died earlier this month, has filed a restraining order against his live-in girlfriend. They want to stop her from breaching a confidentiality agreement she signed more than a year ago. His ex-wife Nanette fears Amy Pinto-Walsh will attempt to sell her story and could release private family photographs. Battle: The 'painter of light' Thomas Kinkade, one of America's most popular artist, died at the age of 54 after struggling with alcoholism, a family member said . Family: The artist's wife Nanette, pictured right with their four daughters, said her husband provided his family with a 'wonderful life' Kinkade was one of the most . successful artists in the U.S., but he struggled with alcoholism before . his death at the age of 54, and split from his wife Nanette in 2010. The so-called 'Painter of Light' used to estimate that around one out of every 20 homes in America.

Its attorneys argue that the . painter's mistress, who is still living in his mansion in Monte Sereno, . California, is planning to disclose information which would breach a . confidentiality agreement signed in February 2011. Struggle: The devout Christian had battled through a divorce and bankruptcy in recent years while also facing needling critics, his brother said . The restraining order would ban Ms . Pinto-Walsh from saying or doing anything which would make Kinkade, his . wife or his business 'appear in a negative light or false light'.

Success: Mr Kinkade's works were popular, but his battle with alcoholism led him to an arrest for DUI (right) While it is not clear what exactly . prompted the legal battle, the suit alleges that Ms Pinto-Walsh told a . family friend that she intended to sell the story of her relationship . with Kinkade and release unseen photographs of the painter. The suit continues: 'The release of . these items would be personally devastating not only for Mrs Kinkade, . but also for the family's four daughters, who are grieving the sudden . loss of their father.' The family also fears that Ms . Pinto-Walsh could jeopardise Kinkade's business empire, which relied on . the production of prints and reproductions as much as original . paintings. They say she had access to 'trade . secrets' such as the artist's painting techniques and computer . programmes, and could try to sell them on to others. Father: Mr Kinkade, pictured here drawing his daughter Winsor, was said by his brother to have been cleaning himself up to remain in his children's lives .

"Accused of killing 17 civilians, including nine children, in Afghan village . Charges come one day after second 2008 assault revealed . Was accused of 2002 assault at casino . Married Staff Sgt Bales has 'memory problems' lawyer said . PUBLISHED: . 14:05 EST, 23 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:44 EST, 23 March 2012 . Robert Bales faces the death penalty after being charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder . U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales was charged on Friday with 17 counts of premeditated murder, a capital offense that could lead to the death penalty in the massacre of Afghan civilians, the U.S. military said. The 38-year-old soldier is accused of walking off a U.S. military base with his 9mm pistol and M-4 rifle, which was outfitted with a grenade launcher, before dawn on March 11, killing nine Afghan children and eight adults and burning some of the bodies. It was the worst allegation of civilian killings by an American and has severely strained U.S.-Afghan ties at a critical time in the decade-old war. It's unclear what prompted the killings, but the case has drawn new attention to the debate over mental health care for the troops, who have experienced record suicide rates and high incidences of post-traumatic stress and brain injuries during repeated deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Six other Afghans - a man, a woman and four children - were wounded in Panjwai district of Kandahar province, the spiritual birthplace of the Taliban. Bales also was charged with six counts of attempted murder and six counts of assault in those cases, according to Col. Gary Kolb, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan who disclosed information from the charging document. Bales, a married father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was officially informed of the 29 charges just before noon local time at the U.S. military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he is confined. His civilian attorney, John Henry Browne, said Friday that he believes the government will have a hard time proving its case and that his client's mental state will be an important issue. Bales, a married father of two, was on his fourth tour of duty in Iraq and had been injured his lawyers say. The charge of premeditated murder means prosecutors believe the massacre was pre planned . Bales was on his fourth tour of duty, having served three tours in Iraq, where he suffered head and foot injuries. The decision to charge him with premeditated murder suggests that prosecutors plan to argue that he consciously conceived the killings. A military legal official for U.S. forces in Afghanistan who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the case, noted that premeditated murder is not something that has to have been contemplated for a long time. The maximum punishment for a premeditated murder conviction is death, dishonorable discharge from the armed forces, reduction to the lowest enlisted grade and total forfeiture of pay and allowances, Kolb said. The mandatory minimum sentence is life imprisonment with the chance of parole. Legal experts have said the death penalty would be unlikely in the case. The military hasn't executed a service member since 1961 when an Army ammunition handler was hanged for raping an 11-year-old girl in Austria. None of the six men currently on death row at Fort Leavenworth was convicted for atrocities against foreign civilians. The charging document did not provide details about the killings, leaving the timeline unclear. The dead bodies were found in Balandi and Alkozai villages - one north and one south of the base. Members of the Afghan delegation investigating the killings said one Afghan guard working from midnight to 2 a.m. saw a U.S. soldier return to the base around 1:30 a.m. Another Afghan soldier who replaced the first and worked until 4 a.m. said he saw a U.S. soldier leaving the base at 2:30 a.m. It's unknown whether the Afghan guards saw the same U.S. soldier. If the gunman acted alone, information from the Afghan guards would suggest that he returned to base in between the shooting sprees. Tears of grief: An Afghan youth mourns for his relatives, who were allegedly killed by the U.S. service member . Horrific: The bodies of an elderly Afghan man and a child killed in the Alkozai village of Panjwayi district are shown wrapped in blankets . It also is not known whether the suspect used grenades, Kolb said. The grenade launcher attachment is added to the standard issue M-4 rifle for some soldiers but not all, he said. Bales was assigned to provide force protection at the base. The pre-dawn shooting spree has further frayed ties between U.S. troops and President Hamid Karzai as the two nations are negotiating agreements for America's military footprint in Afghanistan after most international combat forces withdraw by the end of 2014. After the shootings, Karzai reiterated his demand that foreign troops leave posts near Afghan villages and pull back to larger bases. The killings also have fueled anti-American sentiment in a country where violent protests raged for nearly a week last month after Muslim holy books and other Islamic texts ended up in a garbage burn pit at a U.S. base. 'By the laws of Islam, the soldier should be hanged,' Dost Mohammad, a shopkeeper in Kandahar, the provincial capital, said Friday. 'While other countries' laws say that this individual should be given a life sentence, from our point of view and that of other Muslims, this guy should be hanged.' Afghan officials and villagers maintain that 16 civilians were killed. The U.S. military never announced a death toll, but said Friday that investigators had collected enough evidence to charge Bales with killing 17 civilians. U.S. officials are working with Afghan officials to compensate relatives of the victims, money that likely would be disbursed to the eldest male of the family. Eleven of those who died were from one family. Empty: The couple's Bonney Lake, Washington home was put on the market . for $229,000. Bales' wife and two children have been moved to Joint Base . Lewis McChord in Tacoma . Bales' lawyer, who is based in the state of Washington, has said that his client remembers very little or nothing from the time the military believes he went on the rampage. Browne told CBS' 'This Morning' on Friday that his client's memory problems predate the shooting spree. Browne said Bales had earlier suffered a 'serious' concussion that was not treated 'for a variety of reasons,' which Browne did not explain. Browne said he thinks the U.S. government will have difficulty proving its case against Bales because 'there is no crime scene' and a lack of important physical evidence like fingerprints. Two military defense attorneys also have been assigned to his case. Browne has said that he wants to visit Afghanistan. U.S. military officials said they would do what they can to protect Bales' legal team in the event of such a visit but warned the shootings have heightened tension between U.S. troops and villagers in the area, and decisions about where the legal team could safely travel would have to be on a case-by-case basis at the time of any visit. The charges launch what is likely to be a lengthy legal process. Disarray: Boxes on the porch of Bales's home after his family was moved to a military base for their protection . Bales was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, of the 2nd Infantry Division, which is based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. The U.S. Forces-Afghanistan has sent the charges to a special court-martial convening authority, the 17th Fires Brigade, an artillery unit based in Fort Lewis, Washington. Lewis-McChord spokesman Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield said Friday that officials at that base will have the legal responsibility of trying and managing the case against Bales, but it was not clear where the proceedings will actually take place, noting that Fort Leavenworth has the most updated security. The commanding officer of that brigade has several options ranging from taking no action to ordering an Article 32 investigation, which is comparable to a preliminary hearing or grand jury process in U.S. civilian courts. During the investigation, the defense will have an opportunity to see evidence and cross-examine government witnesses. An investigating officer will issue a report at the end of the probe in which he can recommend a court-martial; and add, delete or modify the charges. A mental assessment for Bales also is expected to be ordered. He could be charged with other offenses later, according to the legal official. On Friday, a senior U.S. defense official said Bales was drinking in the hours before the attack on Afghan villagers, violating a U.S. military order banning alcohol in war zones.","Accused of killing 17 civilians, including nine children, in Afghan village .

Big spender: European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, pictured today, who is presiding over huge budget rises while Britain and other countries cut back their own . British taxpayers face paying millions of pounds more for ‘pointless’ EU quangos after Brussels planned a massive budget increase of 33 per cent over two years. Overall, the cost of 52 agencies and committees – such as the Community Plant Variety Office – is set to rise to £2.17billion if the European Commission plan is approved. And because Britain pays 13 per cent of the budget, taxpayers in this country would therefore be hit with a bill of £298million this year. The news came as UK Treasury Chief . Secretary Danny Alexander announced that government departments at home . will have to find even more cuts. Pawel . Swidlicki, a research analyst for the Open Europe think-tank, said: 'While some of these EU quangos perform valuable work, many others serve . no practical purpose whatsoever apart from soaking up taxpayers’ money. 'Ironically, . many of these bodies would never have survived the type of austerity . programmes that the EU is now drawing up for member states as Europe . fights through its worst crisis in a generation.' The think-tank has identified at least ten agencies that serve no unique purpose and ought to be abolished. It claims that many others are duplicating work and suggests that the remaining 42 agencies have their budgets cut by 30 per cent. This would save EU member states just over £566million every year, with Britain keeping an extra £82million to spend on more worthwhile causes. The number of quangos has rapidly grown from just three in 1990 to 52 today. The number doubled in just seven years alone from 2004 to last year. Boom: The graph shows the rise of EU quangos from there being just three in 1990 to 52 today . Soaring cost: The rising cost, measures in million euros, of quangos since 2005 . The total cost to European taxpayers now stands is set to rise 3.4 per cent from last year and a massive 33.2 per cent compared with 2010, if the Commission’s budget is approved. Over 90 per cent of the cost comes from the 27 EU member states – with Germany’s contribution of £400million the highest, followed by France (£315million) and Britain. The rest of the budget is made up from non-EU member states such as Norway. Open Society pointed out that there are currently two EU agencies specifically dedicated to human rights in addition to similar bodies in member states, the Council of Europe, the ECHR, a specific EU Commissioner for 'fundamental rights' and a range of NGOs. The think-tank also claims in its report that there is no evidence that the £105million-a-year Economic and Social Committee, an “advisory” body that has existed since the 1950s, has actually altered the outcome of an EU proposal in recent years, and yet it remains in place. As an evaluation for the European Commission concluded, the system of EU agencies also “creates an indirect but powerful incentive for spending” taxpayers’ cash. For example, the European Environment Agency (EEA) paid a consultancy firm £200,000 in order to assess its own media coverage. The EEA also spent £250,000 on a ‘living map’ of Europe, created from 5,000 plants affixed to the outside wall of its headquarters in Copenhagen in order to promote biodiversity. The facade stayed up for around five months in 2010. On its website, the EEA said it wanted to 'illustrate the significance of vertical gardens'. Bureaucratic behemoth: The EU Commission building in Brussels, which cost taxpayers £1.1billion . Each board meeting of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) – whose mandate already overlaps with that of another EU agency, and whose board only consists of 15 people – costs €92,630 on average, working out at €6,175 per member. In another study, the Economic Research Council pointed to the Community Plant Variety Office, which is given a £10million-a-year grant, as one of the most pointless . A report explained that: ‘This agency effectively licenses and manages Intellectual Property rights to new types of plants and crops across the EU. ‘Protecting IP is important, but there’s no good reason why this role could not be performed by national IP agencies (like the the UK’s Intellectual Property Office), which could even compete with each other to bring down costs – currently between €1,200 and € 2,400 per examination fee per plant.’","Cost of running EU quangos now costs taxpayers £2.17billion a year .

A cancer sufferer has become the first person in the UK to benefit from a robotically-constructed bladder. Ken Harries, 61, was diagnosed with . bladder cancer last May and became the first to undergo the pioneering treatment in October. Surgeons at Southmead Hospital, in Bristol, used a robot to remove Mr Harries' cancerous bladder through tiny incisions before replacing it with a substitute created from his own bowel tissue. The operating team at Southmead Hospital with the Da Vinci Robot: It can perform far less invasive surgery . The manufacturing manager, from Downside, near Bath, has now successfully recovered from the UK-first operation. Mr Harries said: 'Immediately after the operation I . was actually out of bed the following day, not for long, but I was up, . and each day you did a bit more. 'I suppose I was a little bit shocked when they said I’d be the first but that soon disappeared and after discussions with the wife it was a very simple choice. 'The only way I could look at the cancer was to say ‘I am going to beat this’, and I am so glad I decided to go through with the operation.' Following an operation to remove some of the cancerous tumour that was preventing his bladder from working properly, Mr Harries was referred to a consultant at Southmead Hospital. Nimble: The Da Vinci robot is so sensitive is can peel a grape . He was told he would have to have an operation but was given the option of undergoing keyhole surgery and having the neo-bladder created. 'Thinking it through, I will be honest, my initial reaction was to go for the tried and tested route, as at the time I was also told I would be the first one to have this procedure in the UK,' he said. 'But the reason I changed my mind was because the team at Southmead just filled you with confidence. 'When you consider what the team did, robotically, taking away a complete bladder and other bits and pieces and then re-building it - it sounds almost science-fiction, but now I feel as though nothing has changed.' Five small incisions were made to Mr Harries - the largest of which was just two inches long. The father of two said: 'You can hardly see a scar or anything, it’s unbelievable, but that’s the whole idea of the robotics - it’s far less invasive and the amount of time you need to heal up generally, to me, well, within a couple of weeks there was nothing left really. It was an unbelievable scenario.' Mr Harries, who returned to work in January, said the advances in medical techniques were 'amazing'. 'The strides that are being made, this is the way forward, and I was fortunate to have this service right here in Bristol,' he said. Pioneering: Patient Ken Harries (left) agreed to the treatment because the urology team led by Consultant Edward Rowe (right) filled him with confidence . The procedure used to be performed manually in open surgery by surgeons creating a new bladder for cancer patients who had to have the organ removed. But now Southmead Hospital is making neo-bladders robotically from the patient’s own bowel tissue inside their body which function much as a normal bladder does. The keyhole surgery is less invasive because the hospital’s Da Vinci robot has greater precision and the procedure as a whole has a faster recovery time for patients. The £1.5 million surgical robot - which a surgeon controls from a nearby console - is so precise it can even peel a grape. The procedure is being carried out by Southmead’s consultant urologists Edward Rowe and Anthony Koupparis. Mr Rowe said: 'This is the first time in the UK the whole procedure is performed through keyhole surgery using the Da Vinci robot system. 'Having removed the bladder containing the tumour, we reconstruct a new bladder from the patient’s own bowel and attach this internally to the patient’s urethra, allowing them to pass urine normally. 'Traditionally this is a major operation with a large incision but we hope that by using this minimal access route we can decrease the trauma to the patient, enabling them to obtain a faster recovery and return to normal activity. 'Patients can be home from hospital following this type of surgery within four to seven days and in six to eight weeks they can return to a normal quality of life. 'Our abilities to carry out urological procedures robotically is expanding all the time and we are developing a real expertise in this area.' The robot was used in Southmead Hospital in 2008 when it became the first hospital in the South West to use a Da Vinci robot to carry out prostate removal for cancer patients. Since then the hospital has carried out more than 600 of these prostectomies. It is now being used for radical cystectomy and partial nephrectomy - the removal of small kidney tumours.","The bladder was constructed from the patient's own bowel tissue .

Instead of printing pages it 'unprints' them, turning out pristine, clean sheets which can even be reused. The device uses a green laser to heat up toner particles attached to fibres in the paper, causing them to evaporate. Microscope image of a printed page where the text has been removed with a laser. The laser works by quickly heating up toner particles attached to fibres in the paper, causing them to evaporate . This means the paper can be reused - creating a massive boost for the environment by reducing carbon emissions and deforestation. Early estimates predict the pioneering research could lower emissions in the paper and pulp industry by a staggering 50 per cent. Dr Julian Allwood, who is leading the study at Cambridge University, tested dozens of lasers to discover the perfect frequency, speed and energy. Dr Allwood said: ‘What we need to do now is find someone to build a prototype. ‘Thanks to hand-held scanners and laser-jet printers, the feasibility for reusing paper in the office is there. ‘Material recovery through reusing eliminates the forestry step from the life cycle of paper and eradicates emissions arising from incineration and landfill dumping.’ The deletion process at work.

Scientists developing the tool believe by removing toner and reusing paper help cut the four steps from the paper production cycle - forestry, pulping, paper making and disposal by incineration or landfill. Skipping these four steps would result in a whopping 95 per cent reduction in emissions per tonne produced from the production of office paper alone. Toner removal is 19 per cent more effective than recycling which only lowers omissions by 76 per cent.

A former nursing student accused of killing seven people in a Christian college shooting rampage has gone on hunger strike in jail. One Goh, 43, is suspected of gunning down seven people at the small Oikos University in Oakland, California. But following his arrest, the mass shooting suspect, who was said to have felt 'disrespected' by fellow students, has not eaten since his arrival at Santa Rita jail in Dublin, California. Goh, who has a history of violence, has lost 20lbs (9kg) since arriving at the jail on April 3, and has now been moved to its infirmary. The South Korean has been charged with seven counts of murder and three of attempted murder following the devastating rampage which left six students and a receptionist dead. Goh, who also left three others wounded after the spree, has yet to enter a plea following the charges. Police believe that Goh had been looking for a female administrator who expelled him earlier this year, when he carried out his plan to 'inflict pain' on the school. The coroner's office named the victims as Judith Seymour, 53, of San Jose; Lydia Sim, 21, of Hayward and 33-year-old Sonam Chodon of El Cerrito. Grace Kim, 23, of Union City; Doris Chibuko, 40, of San Leandro and male victim Tshering Rinzing Bhutia, 38, of San Francisco, also died. The school's receptionist Kathleen Ping, 24, of Oakland, was also shot and killed, her family said. Goh allegedly arrived at the school on the morning of Monday April 2 with a .45 caliber handgun looking for the administrator.

Victim: Grace Eunhae Kim, 23, was killed in the shooting at the Christian college in Oakland, California . Smiles: Originally from Newark, California, Ms Kim was one of the six women killed in the Oakland shooting . When he discovered that she was not in the building, he went into an acupuncture class and forced the students to stand up. He told them: 'Get in line and I'm going to kill you all.' According to authorities, Goh opened fire when people would not listen to his instructions. 'Not everyone was cooperative, and that's when he began shooting,' said Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan. Police said that none of the victims were the ones who teased Goh. Lost mother: Kathleen Ping, 24, was killed in the school shooting. She leaves her four-year-old son Kayzzer . 'He was upset that students in the past, when he attended the school, mistreated him,' Howard said. Second victim: Lydia Sim, 21, was also killed in Monday's attack and she was a nursing student at Oikos University . 'They disrespected him, laughed at him. They made fun of his lack of English speaking skills. It made him feel isolated compared to the other students. 'He was having, we believe, some behavioral problems at the school and was asked to leave several months ago.' The suspect sprayed bullets randomly at his classmates before he went through the entire building systematically shooting people. A professor who taught Goh said the nursing student used to brag about violence. Professor Romie John Delariman met Goh at the beginning of his nursing course at Oikos University. The professor said Goh repeatedly told a story about beating up someone who tried to mug him in San Francisco. Goh also added that when he was bored, he would go to the park and pick fights. The school has since tried to move on from the horrific slayings, as students at the Christian college returned to class yesterday. Oikos University, which still has a memorial banner displayed, along with wreaths and flower bouquets, held a single English-as-a-second-language class three weeks after the shooting rampage which killed seven. The small school in an industrial area of the city has been busy preparing to resume operations by replacing carpeting and removing bloodstains and bullet scars. Lucas Garcia, who taught Monday's class, was in the building at the time of the shootings. He has been spending time getting in touch with students since the attack and believes it's important to come back to campus and move on. 'They feel very scared and are dealing with a lot of emotions about what happened,' Garcia said. 'They're dealing with symptoms of a very traumatic experience.' Wrong place: Sonam Chodon was in the acupuncture class when the shooter began firing indiscriminately on Monday morning .

Windsor Castle trespasser: Robert Pennefather scaled an eight foot gate while drunk, the court heard . A lorry driver was today banned from drinking in pubs for a year after he drunkenly scaled an eight-foot gate to get into the grounds of Windsor castle . Robert Pennefather, 32, came within 20 yards of the Queen's private apartments in the early hours of the morning. The Irish truck driver admitted trespassing at the historic palace after drinking with workmates in the town. He triggered a series of alarms and . officers from two different forces descended on the historic residence, . Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. He claimed he had 'got lost' on his way home. At 3.34am on November 6 police on duty at the castle spotted him on CCTV cameras inside the grounds, 'staggering' around along Cambridge Drive, around 150 yards from an entrance named Cambridge Gate. Zoe Martin, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Pennefather was then identified on CCTV and he was seen staggering towards the area known as South Lawn.' When challenged by armed police to . produce his security pass, he replied, 'what pass?', before admitting: . 'Yes, I should not be here.' 'I was with my two mates but they left me outside - they've gone,' he said. Ms Martin added: 'He said he couldn't . remember how he had got into the castle grounds, and appeared to . maintain it was possible just to walk in. 'He said he didn't see any signage and said when officers came he was actually trying to get out. 'At that stage he was approximately 20 . metres from the Queen's private apartment, though the Queen wasn't in . residence at the time.' Ian Brownhill, defending, said the . episode had been simply a 'case of drunken folly', and his client had . been trying to return to his cab to sleep. 'Mr Pennefather, that evening, was incredibly drunk,' he said. 'He quite frankly had had too much, and he found himself stumbling on the way home through Windsor Castle. Intruder: Robert Pennefather, 32, came within 20 yards of the Queen's private apartments in the early hours of the morning . 'In fact, what he had thought he was doing was taking a shortcut. 'There was nothing sinister in this . whatever, and there was nothing suggesting Mr Pennefather caused any . harm whatever to the royal family.' He added that the married driver, who . earns £600 per week, wanted to apologise 'to the Queen herself and to . the Duke of Edinburgh.' Chief magistrate Howard Riddle gave him a 14-day prison sentence suspended for 12 months. Pennefather trespassed in the grounds of the royal residence in Berkshire in the early hours of November 6 last year. Senior District Judge Howard Riddle said he was satisfied that he posed no risk to anyone and had no intention of actually entering the castle. The Queen was not in residence at the time. But he added: 'This is a very serious matter as you must indeed be aware. 'There was a significant breach of security. 'It must have caused very significant alarm and distress to those in the castle and those whose job it is to protect those who live in the castle. 'It was not only alarming, it of course caused a deployment of police officers to deal with you when they could have been used in another way.' Pennefather was also fined £1,000. He was also ordered to pay £85 towards prosecution costs and a £15 victim surcharge.","Robert Pennefather, 32, came within 20 yards of Queen's private apartments .

But it looks like Cheryl Cole is determined to make her name Stateside after landing her first Hollywood film role. In a rare glimpse of the singer, she was spotted looking slim and toned on the set of What To Expect When You're Expecting in Atlanta, Georgia. Ready, Hollywood? Cheryl Cole looked confident and slim on set in Atlanta, Georgia yesterday (left) compared to her anxious appearance at the X Factor USA auditions in May (right) After months of hitting the gym near her Los Angeles apartment, the 28-year-old showed off the results in a tight black Emilio Pucci lace dress and Christian Louboutin heels as she made her way to film her first scenes. Her sleek and confident look is a far . cry from her cute, but unsure appearance in a polka dot outfit at the X . Factor USA auditions in May. The . film – whose cast also includes actors Dennis Quaid, Chris Rock and . Matthew Morrison - chronicles the lives of four couples as they prepare . to become parents. Stylish: The 28-year-old looked incredible in a black lace Emilio Pucci dress and Christian Louboutin heels . And, in what could be construed as a side-swipe at Simon Cowell after she was sacked from X Factor USA, Cheryl will play a TV talent show judge for her cameo role in the film. Cameron plays Jules who auditions in an X Factor-style contest in front of the TV talent show judge - Cheryl's character. Cheryl . is said to have initially impressed Hollywood film bosses during a . four-day appearance at the Cannes Film Festival in May. A . film source revealed to the Daily Mail earlier this year: ‘This is a . bit of fun for Cheryl. She will film the scenes imminently and is really . looking forward to it. Cooling down: Cheryl, who changed into silver sandals to walk to the set, enjoys an iced drink between takes . Under fire: Cheryl was criticised for her too-long trousers and big hair at her first X Factor USA auditions . 'It doesn’t mean she suddenly wants to become an actress.

"By . Reuters Reporter and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:54 EST, 22 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:39 EST, 22 March 2012 . Asians are the fastest growing race group in the United States, reflecting a surge in immigration from the entire region over a decade, according to the Census Bureau. Data from the 2010 Census shows that the number of people who identified themselves as Asian alone, and not mixed race, grew by 43.3 per cent from a decade earlier. That was more than four times faster than the rate of growth for the overall U.S. population, which grew 9.7 per cent in the same period to 308,745,538. Breaking it down: The circles on each state in the map above provide a visual to show how many Asians are in each state relative to one another. The colors show the country of origin of the majority of the Asians in the given state. Hmong, the pink shading, is an ethnic group that exists in China, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand. Some 14.7 million people- the equivalent of 4.8 per cent of the country’s total population- identified themselves as Asian alone. Another 2.6 million, or 0.9 per cent, said they were Asian in combination with another race group, most commonly white. In spite of the documented growth, Asians still don't make the top three biggest ethnic groups in America: whites are first with 72.4 per cent, then Latinos with 16.3 per cent and African Americans are third with 5.6 per cent. ‘Net international migration is the biggest component of the change in the Asian population,’ said Elizabeth Hoeffel, a Census Bureau spokesman. Breakdown by self-identification: The pie charts shows how people defined themselves when asked to explain their origin by the 2010 Census (right) and how that changed since 2000 (left) For statistical purposes, the United . States defines an Asian as someone ‘having origins in any of the . original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian . subcontinent.’ Those who identified themselves as either Asian alone or Asian mixed with another race grew by at least 30 per cent in all states except Hawaii, where they already made up a majority of the population. Across the board, every state had an increase in growth of their Asian population. States with the fastest rate of Asian growth were Nevada (116 per cent), Arizona (95 per cent) and North Carolina (85 per cent). New York had the biggest Asian population with 1.1 million, followed by Los Angeles (484,000) and San Jose, California (327,000). A map provided by the Census Bureau shows that while Asians from different home countries have spread throughout the country, it also shows that they tend to move to states near one another. The fact that Asian Indians tending toward the south and Filipinos gravitating towards the West coast is not surprising as it is comforting to be in an area with a large community of your peers. The only home country whose descendants spread in a seemingly random manner was that of the Chinese; New York has by far the largest population of the ethnic group, but then their only other appearances are in Oregon, North Dakota, Utah and Colorado. A larger minority: Asians now rank as the fourth highest ethnic group in the U.S. The types of jobs available in . certain regions are thought to be one of the most significant . explanations for the continued growth of Asian populations in areas like . San Francisco and Silicon Valley. 'There . is a constant need for highly skilled workers here, and you have . excellent universities with high-tech concentrations in India and China . that feed that,' said David Lee, the San Francisco Census steering . committee chair. 'There . are also needs in the pharmaceutical, biotech and health industries . that fuel Asian immigration, much in the same way the agricultural . industry fuels Latino immigration,' he told The San Francisco Chronicle. The quality of education is also a factor, as Asians are one of the best-educated ethnic groups. 'There definitely is a connection Asian people have to education and raising your children well - just as all Americans strive for,' Mr Lee said. Chinese was the largest of all Asian groups (four million, including 700,000 who identified as mixed race), followed by Filipinos (3.4 million) and Asian Indians (3.2 million). TOTAL number of Asians in America: 17,320,856American population overall: 311,591,917Asian Indian: 3,183,063 Largely concentrated in the Southeast section of the country, Asian Indians have become much more visible in American politics in recent years. The governors from both South Carolina and Louisiana are of Indian descent. Aside from the south, there are also large Indian populations in New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.Chinese: 4,010,114The largest population of Asians of Chinese descent is unsurprisingly in New York, as New York City alone is home to 445,145 Chinese. The city's Chinatown district is said to be the oldest enclave of chinese outside of mainland China and it dates back to the 1840s.  Filipino: 3,416,840The Census map shows that the Filipino population is largely concentrated in the West coast. Tellingly, Los Angeles County has more Filipinos than any other place int the country. Daly City, however, in the San Francisco Bay area, holds the title for the largest number of Filipinos in one city,  Hmong: 260,073Hmong is an ethnic group tat comes from the mountainous regions throughout Vietnam, China, Laos, and Thailand. Their origin dates back 2,000 years and started in China but began to migrate south in the 18th century because of political instability. America has the largest population of Hmong people outside of Asia, and even beats out Thailand for the title. Vietnamese: 1,737,433Concentrated in the center of the country and the gulf coast, the states with the most significant Vietnamese populations are Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska. Immigration from the south Asian country spiked dramatically in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam War, though the immigrants faced harsh, poor conditions on their arrival.","Number of people who identified as Asian and not a combination of ethnicities went up by 43.3 per cent from 2000 to 2010 .

The crocodiles are seen to surround the helpless bird the reptiles' poorly-kept enclosure, before the chicken or duck is attacked and 'ripped to pieces' by one of the famished predators. Many of the bloodthirsty tourists who take part in the ghoulish feeding frenzy are Britons, while several others film the sickening display on cameras and phones. One 21-year-old backpacker frmo Sheffield, who was at the farm with a friend, told the Sunday Mirror he had queued up to buy a bird before throwing it to its death. He then yells with glee as the chicken is thrown into the enclosure, adding: 'Did you see that big ­crocodile storm over? He wasn’t messing about – he ripped it apart. One of the legs is still lying there!' Cornered: The helpless chicken is captured and eaten alive by one of the hungry crocodiles, who appear to be kept in squalid conditions .

Ashley Fruno, a senior campaigner for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, told holidaymakers to boycott the sick attraction near Angkor Wat Temple, one of Cambodia's most popular tourist sites. She said: 'Even China has banned live feeding. Cambodia needs to take the same step.

"By . Tom Gardner . UPDATED: . 09:39 EST, 28 February 2012 . A killer who boasted of being 'judge, jury and executioner' after knifing a friend of his girlfriend in a jealous rage has been jailed for life. Wesley Isherwood beat and stabbed former insurance agent Brian Gavigan, 48, at his home in Prestwich, Manchester. Mr Gavigan had been volunteering as a 'Good Samaritan' at a hostel where Isherwood was staying, when he struck up an entirely innocent friendship with the thug's girlfriend Adele Eckersley. Brutal: Vulnerable victim Brian Gavigan, left, was subject to a sustained and savage attack by callous killer Wesley Isherwood, right . But the relationship sparked a murderous rage in Isherwood - a man 'driven by obsessive sexual . jealousy' - who had a history of violent offending. Hours before killing vulnerable Mr Gavigan, Isherwood, 28, told him to stay away from his girlfriend. He then stole a phone and a set of knives from his victim before returning to his home later that night in September, last year, with one of the blades. He savagely beat his defenceless victim, then attempted to strangle him, before cutting his throat and stabbing him in the abdomen. While awaiting trial for murder, Isherwood made a chilling boast in a letter to Miss Eckersley from his prison cell. He wrote: ‘I don't feel a damn thing for him or his family... The truth is I'm glad he's dead. He committed a crime that was punishable by death. 'I live my life by my own rules, my own laws. When people break them, I become judge, jury and once again in this case I became executioner as well. ‘I haven't lost a minute's sleep since it happened... you know me, I'm a highly violent and volatile person.’ Murder scene: Killer Isherwood returned to his vulnerable victim's home and brutally attacked him . Isherwood, of Prestwich, looked stunned and he was told he must serve 24 years and 192 days behind bars, after pleading guilty to the murder. Sentencing, Judge Andrew Gilbart QC . said the crime was aggravated by Isherwood's record for violence, the . planning that went into it and the fact he had regarded his victim as . vulnerable. He said: ‘It . was a sustained savage attack by a man driven by obsessive sexual . jealousy. 'You inflicted a terrible and savage beating upon (Mr Gavigan), . which left him screaming before you finished him off.’ Screams: Manchester Crown Court heard how the killer 'inflicted a terrible and savage beating upon Mr Gavigan, which left him screaming before he was murdered . Mark Ford, mitigating, told the court that his client's behaviour in the immediate aftermath of the crime showed remorse. He said the murderer had difficulty coming to terms with what he had done and had been 'seeking to disguise' his feelings in the damning letter. Following sentencing, senior investigating officer Andy Tattersall, said: ‘I hope this sentencing provides the victim's family and friends with some sense of justice although they will never be able to fill the hole in their hearts that has been left following his untimely death.’ At the time of his murder, his family said: ‘His untimely death will leave a big hole in the hearts of all his family and friends. Brian should not have died in these circumstances and he will be greatly missed.’","Thug boasts from prison cell: ‘I haven't lost a minute's sleep since it happened'

The wrong house: Furious Bob Sadler came home to find his home covered in unwanted scaffolding .

Mr Sadler said: ‘It has been ridiculous for a while.

Another resident on the street, who asked not to be named, said she had been mistakenly threatened with action from bailiffs. The fed-up mother said that she and her neighbours have had beds, mattresses and electrical goods wrongly delivered to their houses. ‘I’ve had more than enough now - we are all just sick of it,’ she said. ‘It’s just got to the point where we don’t know what to do. I just want this to be sorted out. But the problem is that a lot of people are using sat navs these days. And as they are not programmed to accept that new address everything comes here instead.’ The correct address: Windmill Close in Bassingbourn, where the scaffolding was supposed to go in the first place . The Royal Mail said the problem lay with individual companies and sat nav providers. A spokesman said that all the details, including postcodes and road names, were correct on its database, which was also accessible by visiting its website. He said: ‘Unfortunately, not everybody updates their own records. It would be their responsibility to do so.

They know who they are and we thank them all most sincerely. 'Chris would have been proud to know that every effort was made to try and bring him home.' Mr McManus, a contract worker for the construction company B.Stabilini, was kidnapped by a 'horde of gunmen' in May last year. Raiders stormed his apartment in Birnin-Kebbi, in the north-west of the country, and captured him along with Mr Lamolinara. The men were in the city to build a bank. In December a Nigerian group calling itself Al Qaida in the land beyond the Sahil announced it had captured Mr McManus. It . released a hostage video to a news agency claiming it had kidnapped the . Briton and showed a blindfolded and bearded man in an orange vest. It . was reported that the man pictured in the video called for the British . Government to respond to the demands of the group, so they would spare . his life. The Government said those demands were never coherent. Violent end: This is the house where Chris McManus and Italian Franco Lamolinara were killed by their captors when British-backed Nigerian troops surrounded their compound in the Nigerian city of Sokoto . Resistance: Gun shot holes can be seen surrounding a doorway at the house . Grim: Youths look out from the compound where the two hostages were being held. The barred windows are marked with large bullet holes . The bid to rescue Mr McManus and Italian co-worker Franco Lamolinara was . apparently brought forward because the kidnappers became aware that . the net was closing around them. There were reports of a fierce firefight after a house in the north-western town of Sokoto was surrounded. The men's bodies were found by the . troops in a room at the rear of the compound. They are believed to have . been shot by automatic gun fire from their captors. Britain . and Italy announced plans yesterday to set up a joint counter-terrorism . group to improve co-operation in light of the incident. Among those present at today's service was Mr McManus's boss at B.Stabilini. Mourners were told of the quantity surveyor's love of his home football team, Oldham Athletic, and also listening to music and reading. Among the hobbies listed in his order of service were 'learning to play the guitar' and 'not interested in cooking but loved to eat'. Hymns sang were Do not be afraid; I watch the Sunrise and Walk with me O my lord. His girlfriend, Katy Bailey, gave a reading of David Harkins' 'Remember Me'. Music played was 'Teardrop' by Massive Attack and 'Here Comes The Sun' by The Beatles. People were asked to donate to Amnesty International - Mr McManus's chosen charity - as they left the service.

Dr Ogeil said the drug – often taken in pill or powder form – leaves ‘lasting effects and that the body clock is involved.’ Sleepless nights? A new study claims that using ecstasy only once or twice can reset the body's internal clock at the wrong time . The study, published in a recent issue of Psychopharmacology, springboards on past research endeavours that have found up to 70 per cent of ecstasy users reported sleep disturbance. Dr Ogeil said that most ecstasy users partake of the drug recreationally. ‘They take one or two pills once a month or less,’ he said. In his study – the first of its kind, ABC Science in Australia notes – Dr Ogeil and his colleagues injected 72 lab rats with the equivalence of one to doses of MDMA, the active ingredient in ecstasy. The scientists then examined the effect of the drug on the rat’s ‘internal clocks’ – the parts of the body that regulate sleep. Sleepless nights: Researchers said those taking MDMA sometimes reported weeks of restless nights . Researchers found that ecstasy in their systems modified two specific genes – the Per1 and Per2. MDMA, also known as 3,4 methylenedioxy methamphetamine is a psychoactive drug that releases serotonin in the brain – the chemical that is responsible for affecting mood, sexual activity, and sensitivity to pain. Often taken in pill, capsule, or tablet, MDMA evokes feelings of euphoria, intense feelings of love and emotional warmth, and an increase in tactile sensitivity. However, the drug can also produce confusion, depression, and sleep problems. Other symptoms include nausea, blurred vision, chills, sweating, and teeth clenching. Dehydration is a serious risk to those who have taken the drug. Both are directly involved in maintaining the body’s natural cadence, including sleep cycles. Dr Ogeil said: ‘MDMA was able to induce these genes, or turn them on when they should be off.’ While external factors such as light and caffeine constantly keep internal clocks in flux, Dr Ogeil noted that taking ecstasy resets the body’s natural rhythm at the wrong time. He said that some users suffer from irregular sleep or poor quality of sleep for months after they take MDMA. In another study published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, Dr Ogeil and his team of researchers looked into how taking ecstasy disturbed sleep patterns. The study asked for the help from flatmates and partners in monitoring the sleep patterns. Most reported obnoxious snoring and leg twitching. Both, Dr Ogeil said, ecstasy users may not be aware of. In another report by Frédéric N. Brière, from the Université of Montréal, the study found that teens who used methamphetamine and MDMA were more likely to show depressive symptoms in the future.","MDMA is a stimulant and disrupts sleep cycle for weeks, new research shows .

Probe: Police are investigating claims Marjorie Simpson, pictured, attacked the mayor at Yarm Town Council . Police were today investigating claims a veteran councillor and grandmother punched a mayor in the face in a row over parking charges. Grandmother-of-two Marjorie Simpson is alleged to have landed a 'right hook' on the Conservative chairman of Yarm Town Council Jason Hadlow as they clashed in the council chamber. Mr Hadlow, 48, claims the farmer's wife, an independent, threatened that her husband would beat him up, then spat in his face before she threw the punch. Mrs Simpson, who had opposed council plans to fight the imposition of parking charges in the town, denied the claims. She insisted she only tried to push Mr Hadlow away, acting in self defence, because he was shouting in her face. Cleveland Police confirmed they were investigating the incident in Yarm, Stockton-on-Tees, last month. Mr Hadlow said town councillors had banned Mrs Simpson from speaking at meetings until the criminal investigation is over. The entrepreneur, who runs the Simply Dutch furniture and antiques shop in Leeming Bar, North Yorkshire, said he was 'stunned' to be attacked. He said today: 'She is completely out of touch with her electorate. 'When I pointed this out she became very aggressive. She spat in my face and hit me with a closed fist punch to the face, which was hard enough and unexpected enough to knock me off balance . 'I was absolutely stunned. I thought hang on, this is assault and I immediately shouted out because I wanted everybody to witness it. 'I telephoned the police then went to the station to make a statement. When I got back she had scarpered. Shocked: Council chairman Jason Hadlow, 48, claims he was spat on and punched in the meeting . 'To be frank, when you get hit, punched, and spat at, you think enough is enough. I want a restraining order. 'She is way out of touch with those who elected her and it's about time she was retired from the council chamber altogether. Hopefully, the police will do just that.' Mrs Simpson said she had been interviewed by police in connection with the incident and denied lashing out. She said she raised one hand to ward off Mr Hadlow, who she claimed was stood nose to nose with her and goading her, in a rage. 'I tried not to let him see I was frightened,' she told the Northern Echo. 'It is a good job I have done ballroom dancing all my life, because if I hadn't been used to going backwards, I would have fallen over.' She said when she pushed Mr Hadlow away he shouted 'assault, assault'. She said: 'I was quite surprised when I went to the police station and they said I had punched him. 'He verbally abused me for what seemed like a long time and I just tried to get him away from me.' At a Yarm Town Council meeting last week, councillors voted 5-4 in favour of Mrs Simpson being banned from speaking at meetings until the criminal investigation was over. The alleged assault came just days after a public meeting in Yarm about the possible introduction of parking charges by Stockton Borough Council. Mrs Simpson had argued that plans to mount a legal challenge to the charges could end up costing tens of thousands of pounds. A Cleveland Police spokesman said: 'Police are investigating an alleged assault on a 48-year-old man that occurred on Tuesday 13 March in the Yarm area. 'Inquiries are ongoing.'","Police investigating alleged attack in Yarm Town Council chamber .

A man accused of becoming an Al Qaeda operative discussed bombing New York City movie theaters, Grand Central Terminal, Times Square and the New York Stock Exchange before settling on the city's subways, a court has heard. Adis Madunjanin allegedly plotted against the high-profile targets with two of his former high school classmates from Queens. The men ‘were prepared to kill themselves and everyone else around them — men, women and children,’ said Assistant U.S. Attorney James Looman in opening statements on Monday. The extraordinary case has seen attempted shoe bomber Saajid Muhammad Badat released from prison early in exchanging for testifying against his alleged fellow jihadist. Revealing the plan: Zarein Ahmedzay (right) testifies in the trial of Adis Medunjanin (left) Defence attorney Robert Gottlieb . accused the government of using ‘inflammatory rhetoric’ about al Qaeda . and terrorism to prevent jurors ‘from seeing the truth about this case.’ ‘The truth is that Adis Medunjanin is not a terrorist,’ he countered. There's no dispute that Medunjanin and his two former classmates travelled together to Pakistan in 2008. But federal prosecutors say the three . were homegrown Muslim extremists who, under al Qaeda's tutelage, came . back to the United States and hatched a foiled plot to attack the New . York City subways as suicide bombers. Medunjanin, 27, has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, and providing material support to a terrorist organization among other charges in what U.S. officials have described as one of the most chilling terror conspiracies since the September 11, 2001 attacks. On trial: Adis Medunjanin, seen in a 2010 court appearance, is accused of planning to bomb the New York subway system . Childhood friends Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay have admitted in guilty pleas that they wanted to avenge U.S. aggression in the Arab world by becoming martyrs. Both have been called by the government to testify against Medunjanin. 'Adis agreed to be one of the suicide bombers,' said Ahmedzay, who was called as the first prosecution witness. Medunjanin had 'no hesitation' and 'was committed' to the plan, Ahmedzay said. 'I remember him saying he would mention he was doing the suicide mission of his own choice,' the witness added. 'And that he loved death more than he loved life.' But Medunjanin backed out of the plot, Gottlieb countered in opening arguments. He was a 'serious, studious and sincere' young man who balked at joining his friends in the 'martyrdom operations,' Gottlieb said. 'Adis Medunjanin made his decision, and he decided not to be a terrorist, not to be a suicide bomber.' Another possible witness is Bryant Neal Vinas, a Long Island man who joined al Qaeda around the same time as the other men. Officials have credited Vinas with providing key intelligence about the terror group since his capture in 2008. They are also expecting to get valuable information from Saajid Muhammad Badat who is due to testify against Medunjanin. Court appearances: Najibullah Zazi, shown in a court sketch and outside of the Denver FBI office, is childhood friends with Adis Medunjanin . Badat, who was jailed in Britain in . 2005 for his role in a 2001 plot to down an American Airlines flight . from Paris to Miami with explosives hidden inside shoes, has had his . jail term cut from 13 years to 11 years in a ground-breaking deal. In an extraordinary secret court . hearing, the Islamic fundamentalist was released following a private . discussion between a judge, his solicitor and prosecutors. That bargain means he has already been released, rather than having to wait until 2013 to request parole. The details of his release were not . made public until this week, when they were revealed as part of the . announcement that he would be testifying in Medunjanin's case. 'This . trial is the first time a UK convicted terrorist has agreed, under the . terms of our agreement, to give evidence in the United States,’ said Sue . Hemming from the British Crown Prosecution Service. 'Badat has helped with investigations . in this country, he continues to co-operate and has agreed to testify in . other trials if called upon.’ Caught: Police raid the Denver home of Zazi, who got as far as cooking up explosives and setting out by car for New York City in September 2009 to carry out the attack . Badat was an accomplice of so-called shoe bomber Richard Reid, who is serving a life sentence in the United States. 'We considered very carefully the . merits of entering into this agreement with a convicted terrorist, and . we believe that the administration of justice internationally benefits . from such an agreement,’ Ms Hemming said. Deal: Terrorist Saajid Muhammad Badat, pictured, had his 13 year sentence cut to 11 after the agreement with prosecutors . Jurors . also are expected to hear evidence that following his arrest, . Medunjanin told the FBI he had become a more devout Muslim about four . years before the plot was exposed after he and childhood friend Zazi . began spending time together at a local mosque, FBI reports say. He also recalled being influenced by tapes of U.S.-born extremist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, they say. In . 2008, Medunjanin and his friends decided to join the Taliban and fight . U.S. soldiers in retaliation for the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal, . the FBI reports say. The three instead were recruited by al Qaeda operatives, who gave them weapons training in their Pakistan camp and asked them to become suicide bombers, they say. Medunjanin told his al Qaeda handlers ‘he had prayed but still wasn't sure if he was ready to be a martyr,’ the reports say. He was later sent home on his own, the reports add, after he told them ‘the best thing for him to do ... was to return to the U.S. and provide financial support’ for the terror network. Medunjanin was arrested in early 2010 after attempting to crash his car into another vehicle in what prosecutors have described as a failed suicide attempt. Prosecutors have presented recordings of 911 emergency calls in which they say Medunjanin identified himself, made jihadist statements, and declared 'We love death' immediately before the crash. At the time he was under surveillance by federal agents. Gottlieb said the statements were an expression of desperation from a man whose home had just been raided by federal agents and who was overwhelmed with the possibility of being branded a Muslim terrorist. Zazi, after relocating to the Denver area, got as far as cooking up explosives and setting out by car for New York City in September 2009 to carry out the attack. He was arrested after abandoning the plan and fleeing back to Colorado. The FBI reports say Medunjanin denied knowing what Zazi was up to. And the defence has claimed he spoke to the FBI under duress. In a sworn statement, the defendant accused agents of making veiled threats against his family and denying him access to his attorney for 36 hours. Federal authorities insist his statements were voluntary.","Adis Madunjanin 'loved death more than life', according to former friend .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 04:58 EST, 18 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:05 EST, 18 April 2012 . Jamie Moyer is headed to the Hall of Fame. Well, maybe his uniform anyway. Or perhaps even his glove. Cooperstown has asked for some sort of memorabilia from Moyer to commemorate his record-setting night as the 49-year-old left-hander became the oldest pitcher to ever win a major league contest. And whatever the Hall of Fame decides it wants, Moyer said he will certainly deliver after throwing seven efficient innings to help the Colorado Rockies beat the San Diego Padres 5-3 on Tuesday. Star performer: Colorado Rockies starting pitcher Jamie Moyer showed no signs of slowing down as he throws against the San Diego Padres in their Major League Baseball game in Denver . ‘To have your name mentioned with great players of the past or Hall of Fame players, it's pretty special,’ Moyer said. For Moyer (1-2), making history was nice. But stopping the Rockies' two-game skid was just as rewarding. Moyer was effective all evening as he picked up his 268th career win, tying him with Hall of Famer Jim Palmer for 34th on the career list. He relied on a cutter the Padres couldn't get good wood on and a 78-mph fastball that danced all over the place. Moyer gave up just six hits and two runs – both unearned – as he kept the Padres hitters off balance and guessing. ‘Today, for me, just like it's been my previous two starts – going out and trying to give my best effort,’ Moyer said. That's a tried and true formula for success, one that's worked well for Moyer over a career that has stretched nearly a quarter century and included 689 games. Moyer earned that elusive win for the ages in his third start of the season. He is 49 years, 150 days old. Third time lucky: Moyer, 49,became the oldest winning pitcher in Major League Baseball at his third attempt . That's important to note since before Moyer's effort the oldest pitcher to win a game in the majors was Jack Quinn of the Brooklyn Dodgers on Sept. 13, 1932, when he was 49 years, 70 days old. Moyer doesn't know all that much about Quinn. He wishes he did, though. ‘As players, we should know more about the game, the history of the game,’ Moyer said. ‘You need to respect the game and the people that came before you.’ He's definitely a part of baseball's lore now. But this milestone win was far from easy. Rafael Betancourt struggled in the ninth as he surrendered a solo homer to Nick Hundley and put two more runners on before striking out Yonder Alonso to close out the game. About the only flaw to the night were two more errors by smooth-fielding shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, giving him six already this season. The Gold Glove winner had six all of last year. Power: Despite the fearsome force and strain pitcher Jamie Moyer has placed his body under during near 25 year career, he's still able to deliver a devastatingly quick ball . His fielding error in the seventh proved quite costly and nearly spoiled Moyer's place in the record books. With two on and one out, Tulowitzki had a routine double play ball go right through his legs, leading to a run. Jason Bartlett brought in another with a sacrifice fly to right to cut the lead to 3-2. Moyer ended the threat by getting pinch hitter Jeremy Hermida to ground out to second on a 76-mph cutter. That was vintage Moyer. With streaks of gray in his hair, Moyer looks like a player who will turn 50 in November. But once he steps on the mound that youthful exuberance returns. He's transformed into a kid again, sprinting out to the mound after each inning. On this night, he looked more like a spry rookie than a veteran nearing retirement – or at least his AARP card. ‘It's a great night for the Rockies, as far as winning a baseball game. But it's an historic night for one tremendous human being,’ Rockies manager Jim Tracy said. ‘It couldn't happen to a better guy. A more professional person I don't know I've been around.’ Eyes on the prize: Starting pitcher Jamie Moyer ranks along side Hall of Famer Jim Palmer for 34th on the career list after notching up his 268th career win . The aged wonder used his wealth of experience to his advantage against the young Padres, six of whom weren't even born when Moyer made his major league debut in 1986. That included Anthony Bass (0-2), a pitcher half Moyer's age who went five innings and gave up three runs. Mark Kotsay's first plate appearance of the season was a single in the opening inning. Kotsay was activated off the disabled list on Monday after missing the first 10 games with a strained right calf muscle. That his first hit should be against Moyer hardly comes as a surprise since the 36-year-old Kotsay has a .583 lifetime average against Moyer. They even exchanged friendly grins after each of Kotsay's two singles. Record breaker: Moyer became the oldest pitcher to win a major league game at 49 years, 150 days, in his team's win over the Padres . ‘He wears me out. He knows it. I know it,’ Moyer said. ‘We joke in the offseason.’ Kotsay also has tremendous amount of respect for Moyer. ‘It says something about how much he loves to compete and his willingness to work, and at 49, to go out and throw the ball and have success,’ said Kotsay, who faced the veteran for the first time since June 13, 2006, when Kotsay was with the Oakland A's and Moyer a member of the Seattle Mariners. Padres manager Bud Black certainly appreciates Moyer's longevity, marveling from the dugout at the lefty who went to spring training without a guaranteed roster spot and performed his way onto the team. He missed all of 2011 as he recovered from a surgically repaired ligament in his elbow. ‘It's a great story,’ Black said. ‘It's wonderful that he's continued to get the results needed to stay in the major leagues. This is a performance-driven game and the last 15 years of his career have been outstanding.’","Colorado Rockies left-hander  Moyer picks up 268th career win .

Christopher Bingley was caught speeding four times in 2010 and 2011 in his wife Joanne's Jeep Cherokee car, but had the points credited to Mrs Bingley's licence, it is alleged. Mr Bingley, 44, who set up a charity in memory of his wife, is alleged to have named Mrs Bingley as the driver during the offences, even though she committed suicide several months earlier. Charged: Christopher Bingley, left, is accused of using the name of his late wife Joanne, right, on four speeding offences . Mrs Bingley, 39, was killed when she threw herself in front of a train near Huddersfield in April 2010 following a battle with post-natal depression. Bingley blamed his wife’s death on post-natal depression (PND) and set up a charity to highlight the illness in February last year. Huddersfield Magistrates Court heard father-of-one Mr Bingley continued to drive his late wife's Jeep Cherokee car and when caught speeding had the points credited to her licence. The first count against Mr Bingley alleges that on April 14, 2011, Bingley falsely completed speeding notices addressed to his wife regarding offences on February 20, 2011 and April 9, 2011. The widower was also accused of the same offence for a speeding ticket on August 2, 2010 and the third count relates to speeding on August 6, 2010. Huddersfield Magistrates Court heard Mr Bingley used his dead wife's name after being caught speeding four times in Huddersfield in 2010 and 2011 . No indication of plea was made and the case was adjoured to Bradford Crown Court on March 28. Mr Bingley, a management consultant, has spoken about how his wife struggled with severe depression following the birth of their baby daughter Emily. He launched the Joanne (Joe) Bingley Memorial Foundation to highlight the illness and support those affected by it and also produced a leaflet to outline international guidelines on PND as he claimed local guidance was inadequate. He said he blamed health professionals for Joanne’s death and said she could have been cured if she had been admitting to hospital.

The Leveson inquiry has become a mixture of ‘show trial, seminar and truth commission’, according to a former ambassador. Sir Christopher Meyer said there was a ‘whiff of totalitarianism’ about the inquiry into press standards and warned of the dangers of censoring newspapers. The attack from the former head of the Press Complaints Commission is the strongest so far from an influential name outside the newspaper trade. He said the tribunal’s remit was too ambitious and suggested that Lord Justice Leveson had already made up his mind to abolish the PCC and replace it with a new system of regulation. The inquiry, set up by David Cameron last July in the wake of allegations that the News of the World hacked into the phone messages of murder victim Millie Dowler, is charged with examining the culture, practices and ethics of the press. Sir Christopher, who served as UK ambassador in Washington, said: ‘Is there any proposal for press regulation which has come before Leveson, short of appointing a commissar in every news room with X-ray eyes and telepathic powers, that would have nipped phone-hacking in the bud?’ In a speech to the Worshipful Company of Stationers he said: ‘The Leveson inquiry, with its elements of show trial, seminar and truth commission, is a curious beast. ‘It runs in parallel with at least three police investigations looking into similar matters. No wonder there are anxieties among the police and those arrested that the proceedings of the inquiry might damage or prejudice their respective interests.’ Evidence: James Murdoch appears before the Commons Culture Committee inquiry into phone hacking for a second time last November . The PCC strengthened its rules for journalists after two News of the World employees were jailed over phone hacking in 2007. But it did not uncover the extent of hacking at the newspaper. In a speech to the Worshipful Company of Stationers Sir Christopher said that the PCC ‘has been roundly and wrongly condemned’ for not having police powers to investigate wrongdoing. But he said such powers would amount to ‘utterly objectionable’ state regulation. Sir Christopher said: ‘As a formal judicial inquiry, it eclipses in legal standing the unfinished Chilcot Inquiry into the origins and conduct of the Iraq War, a much more important subject.’ Sir Christopher said Lord Justice Leveson (pictured) had made it 'pretty clear' that something new is coming . He added that Lord Justice Leveson ‘has . made it pretty clear that something new is coming’ and that ‘the . fundamental premise of the proceedings is that the current system of . regulation is broken, has lost the confidence of the public and needs to . be replaced.’ The PCC gives satisfaction to more than 80 per cent of those who use it, Sir Christopher said. It should be strengthened, not abolished. But, Sir Christopher said, ‘when I sought to make some of these points in Court 73, I have to say that there was a glazing of the eye from the inquisitor, a flare of irritation from the bench.’ He added: ‘We cannot wish away the Leveson Inquiry. After the expenditure of huge sums of public money, it will be expected to come up with a result, and that result will be a hugely important moment for our freedoms and for our democracy, already under multiple pressures.’ The inquiry had become a hot-house for debate about the media and society, Sir Christopher said. ‘A thousand flowers, and not a few weeds, bloom in the rich haul of witness statements. ‘Here and there a whiff of totalitarianism arises from the foliage. Some witnesses appear animated by the idea that here is such a thing as Truth with a capital T. There may well be, but we humans have only the most partial and imperfect access to it. In reality we live in a world of fiercely competing ideas and “truths”.’ Sir Christopher said that one of the great strengths of British democracy was the ‘campaigning partisanship of its newspapers’. He advised Lord Justice Leveson: ‘Beware those who, flying the flag of objectivity, want to impose their version of the truth. That would cast open the door to the enemies of the open society.’",Sir Christopher Meyer claimed there was a 'whiff of totalitarianism' about the inquiry into press standards .

That is when U.S. authorities shut down the Megaupload site and worked with authorities in New Zealand to have its founder, Kim Dotcom, arrested. U.S. prosecutors are seeking Dotcom's extradition from New Zealand, where he remains under house arrest. They accuse him of racketeering by facilitating millions of illegal downloads of copyrighted material on the site. Justification: Megaupload says many of its users are legitimate and storing important files on the site . Warning: Users trying to access the Megaupload website get this message from the FBI . Megaupload says many of its users are legitimate and storing important files on the site. Earlier this month Kim Dotcom, said the site's legal team was 'negotiating' with the US Department of Justice to allow people access to personal files. In January, Carpathia said it would work with a nonprofit group, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to try to preserve the data. Megaupload leased 1,103 servers located in both the U.S. and Canada from Carpathia. In its court filing, the company said it had so far refrained from deleting the data given the interest from so many parties in keeping it. Among those asking for the data to be saved is the Motion Picture Association of America, which wants it kept for possible civil action. Fight: U.S. prosecutors are seeking Dotcom's extradition from New Zealand, where he remains under house arrest. They accuse him of racketeering by facilitating millions of illegal downloads of copyrighted material on the site . Carpathia said another reason it . can't delete the data at the moment is because it would 'risk a claim by . a party with an interest in the data.' It . is asking the court to either have others take possesion of the data, . ensure that Carpathia be paid until the completion of the case or let it . delete the data after allowing users access for a brief period for . selective copying. Carpathia is seeking a court hearing on the motion next month. A . few weeks ago Kim Dotcom claimed that 'a large number' of US government . officials are members of his file-sharing website and said he hoped he . would soon be able to give them permission to access their accounts. Leniency: Dotcom is now allowed up to 60,000 New Zealand dollars ($49,000) per month from his frozen bank accounts to pay for his living expenses as he prepares his defence. He is also allowed the use of one of his cars, a 2011 Mercedes Benz . Speaking to the Torrentfreak blog this week, Dotcom said: 'Guess what – we found a large number of Mega accounts from US Government officials including the Department of Justice and the US Senate. 'I hope we will soon have permission to give them and the rest of our users access to their files.' Dotcom's comments sparked speculation he may be prepared to name the officials when the case comes to trial. In another development in the case, a judge in New Zealand on Thursday released a ruling that Dotcom be allowed up to 60,000 New Zealand dollars ($49,000) per month from his frozen bank accounts to pay for his living expenses as he prepares his defence. He is also allowed the use of one of his cars, a 2011 Mercedes Benz. New Zealand authorities in January seized Dotcom's assets, which included 10 million New Zealand dollars ($8.1 million) worth of bonds and a fleet of luxury cars.","Carpathia Hosting wants to delete files saying it is costing them $9,000 a day to host the data .

"By . Lyle Brennan . PUBLISHED: . 17:55 EST, 22 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:19 EST, 22 March 2012 . Addiction: Wilkie turned to online poker while depressed and suspended from work . A high flying headmaster who stole £53,000 of school funds to finance his gambling addiction was jailed for 16 months today. A court heard how father of three Andrew Thomas Wilkie, 41, became depressed after he was suspended over a child's accusation of sexual misconduct. Following a full police investigation no action was taken against him, and he was allowed to return to school. But, the court heard, the police . probe had taken its toll and he secretly turned to online poker, often . playing into the early hours of the morning. He . blew the family’s £90,000 savings, then the £70,000 he got by . remortgaging the family home without his wife's knowledge, and finally . turned to the school's fund. Mold Crown Court, sitting at Chester, heard how Wilkie knew that the charitable fund was operated within the school and not subject to LEA auditing. After he gambled away the funds a proposed extension to the school hall at Southdown Primary School, in Buckley, had to be put on hold. Two anonymous letters were received by Flintshire LEA and following the tip-off Wilkie - at the school for 17 years, the last three as headmaster - was told an emergency audit would take place. He cleared his desk and went home to confess to his pregnant wife what he had done and that they were in financial ruin, explained prosecuting barrister James Coutts. Wilkie then sent a text to the chair of governors, Martin Bradley, asking him to come around urgently. In a second text he said: 'It is very big. I have done something very wrong that is going to have big consequences for you and for the school.' Mr Bradley went to see him that evening and was left in a state of shock and disbelief. Suspended: Southdown Primary School, in Buckley, Flintshire, Wales. The school's head teacher David Wilkie stole from its funds to finance his online poker habit . Wilkie, who was immediately suspended, apologised and said that he wanted to pay the money back. Mr Coutts said: 'He unburdened himself to Mr Bradley and said it began about a year earlier, following a criminal investigation into the defendant. He was unable to sleep and turned to school funds after he exhausted his own finances.' 'He did not tell anyone about his gambling addiction and did not get any help because he was embarrassed.' The headmaster had been so trusted that other signatories signed blank cheques. He photocopied one and made up a legitimate reason for spending it, while the real cheque was paid into his own account. He had also used school computers to transfer money to himself. Arrested and interviewed last October, he said that he used poker websites in the early hours or when home alone. Mr Bradley had since taken him to Gamblers Anonymous. Wilkie admitted two theft charges with eight similar offences taken into consideration, amounting to £53,438. Defence barrister Patrick Williamson said Wilkie had been a highly successful headmaster and that the school performed well in inspections. 'He was extremely dedicated to his work - and it may be at the expense of his family life,' he said. Wilkie was suspended after an allegation of sexual misconduct in July 2010, and for ten days he was even banned from returning home to see his own children. When he returned that December, his accusers were still in school and his requests for help from the LEA fell on deaf ears. 'He became more mistrustful and withdrawn. There was a tangible difference between the Andrew Wilkie who was headmaster before he was suspended and the one who returned to school,' Mr Williamson said. Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said that it was a very sad but a very serious case. 'The most significant aggravating feature is that you were in a position of trust. Given your role as headmaster it was a high degree of trust,' the judge said. 'The funds that ought to have been used for the benefit of pupils have been lost and there has been an impact on both staff and pupils at the school. 'I also take into account the impact the unproven allegations had on your health and which, it is said, led indirectly to you gambling large amounts of money.'","Andrew Wilkie turned to online poker while suffering from depression .

"By . Nick Enoch . UPDATED: . 13:12 EST, 11 January 2012 . Nick Heywood, 45, who acted as a Mr Fix It when an illicit loan was taken out in the name of lottery winner Keith Gough, has been jailed for 12 months . A senior lawyer who was . involved in a callous fraud in which a £9million lottery winner was stripped of his . winnings was behind bars today. Nick Heywood, 45, acted as a Mr Fix It . when an illicit loan was taken out in the name of Keith Gough - a vulnerable . client who was being swindled by a conman. Mr Gough, 58, was duped out of £700,000, which he handed over to a fraudster who claimed he was investing in his . business ventures. The former baker, who blew most of his fortune on gambling, later drank himself to death after claiming . the lottery win had ruined his life. Police who investigated the fraud . discovered Heywood, a partner and head of property at Betesh Partnerships in . Manchester, had transferred a £13,750 share of the £225,000 loan to his own . account. He also tried to block a police . investigation into another client who was convicted of money laundering. Keith Gough, 58, and his wife Louise, from Bridgenorth, Shropshire, won £9m in a Lotto windfall in 2005. But the couple, who were married for 27 years, separated two years later after Mr Gough quit his job and began drinking heavily . Mr Gough is seen here shortly before his death in 2010 after suffering a heart attack. Heywood had acted for him in the run-up to his death and during the period he was being defrauded by conman James Prince, who persuaded him to invest in bogus business schemes . At Chester Crown Court, Heywood, of High Bank Lane, Bolton, Greater Manchester . pleaded guilty to money laundering, perverting the course of justice and . prejudicing a money laundering investigation. He was jailed for 12 months . and now faces disciplinary action from the solicitors' regulation authority. Mr Gough and his wife Louise of Bridgnorth, Shropshire won . £9million in 2005 and splashed out on a top-of-the-range BMW, racehorses and an . executive box at Aston Villa Football Club. But the couple, who were married for 27 . years, separated two years later after Mr Gough quit his job and began drinking heavily out of 'boredom'. He moved to Cheshire where he rented a . £1million home and hired a chauffeur and a gardener on annual salaries of . £25,000 and £15,000 respectively. In 2009, James Prince was jailed for three years and four months after he admitted fraud and money laundering . But as well as losing much due to gambling, he was conned out of more than £700,000 by fraudster James Prince, who persuaded him to . invest in bogus business schemes. He met the conman while he was being . treated for alcohol dependency in the Priory rehabilitation clinic in . Birmingham. In 2009, Prince was jailed for three years and four months after he . admitted fraud and money laundering. Mr Gough died in March 2010 after . suffering a heart attack brought on by drinking and stress. He left nearly . £800,000 in his will. Cheshire Police said Heywood had acted for . Mr Gough in the run-up to his death and during the period he was being defrauded . by Prince. A spokesman said: 'Sadly Mr Gough had . alcohol-related health problems for quite some time, which along with the fact . he had access to large amounts of money presented him as a vulnerable . person. 'Unfortunately, he died prior to Heywood pleading guilty in this . matter. 'The offence for which Heywood stands convicted relates to a loan made . to Gough [without Gough's knowledge] as a result of Prince's activity. Part of the loan, £13,750, was . transferred by Heywood to himself.' Heywood was also investigated over his . association with longstanding friend and client Duncan Adamson who was . convicted of money laundering in September 2007. During this investigation, police sought a . number of conveyancing files from Heywood's law firm but he failed to produce . two key files. Although he later produced one file, it . was significantly altered. The second file was hidden until discovered by . police. Adamson, a property developer, is himself currently in custody after . failing to pay a £1.3million confiscation order. After the case, Det Insp Tim Dean of . Cheshire Police said: 'Heywood abused his trusted position as a solicitor with . the deliberate intent of frustrating a police investigation and justice itself. 'Heywood very nearly succeeded but through . sheer tenacity officers in the case uncovered the truth resulting in his . conviction. 'I cannot think of a more damning . condemnation of a solicitor other than to pervert the course of justice and . launder money. 'His actions have undermined the public . trust in all solicitors. As such I feel sure all solicitors including his old . colleagues would totally condemn his actions.'","Nick Heywood helped launder money after illicit loan was taken out in name of lottery winner Keith Gough .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 15:36 EST, 7 February 2012 . Bread and rolls are the No. 1 source of salt in the American diet, accounting for more than twice as much sodium as salty junk food like potato chips. That surprising finding comes in a government report released Tuesday that includes a list of the top 10 sources of sodium. Salty snacks actually came in at the bottom of the list compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sodium soaked: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has listed bread and rolls as the worst offender in Americans' sodium diet composing 7 per cent of the recommended daily intake . 'Potato chips, pretzels, and popcorn – which we think of as the saltiest foods in our diet – are only No. 10,' said CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden. Breads and rolls aren't really saltier than many of the other foods, but people tend to eat a lot of them, said Mary Cogswell, a CDC senior scientist who co-authored the report. Salt is the main source of sodium for most people, and sodium increases the risk of high blood pressure, a major cause of heart disease and stroke. Health officials say most Americans get too much salt, mostly from processed and restaurant foods – not added from the salt shaker. Too much: Dietary guidelines recommend no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day, equal to about a teaspoon of salt which is more often than not hidden in prepared meals . Experts have known that the sodium in breads and certain other foods can add up, but even CDC officials were amazed that just 10 foods are responsible for 44 percent of the sodium consumed. 'It's possible to eat a whole bunch of . sodium without it seeming salty,' noted John Hayes, an assistant . professor of food science at Penn State, who was not involved in the . report. According to the CDC, breads and rolls account for about 7 percent of the salt that the average American eats in a day. Next on the list: cold cuts and cured meats; pizza; fresh and processed poultry; soups; fast-food hamburgers and sandwiches and cheese. Rounding out the list – and accounting for about 3 percent each – are spaghetti and other pasta dishes; meatloaf and other meat dishes and snacks like potato chips and pretzels. Dietary guidelines recommend no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day, equal to about a teaspoon of salt. Certain people, such as those with high blood pressure, should eat even less. But average sodium consumption in the U.S. is around 3,300 milligrams, the CDC study found. Only 1 in 10 Americans meet the teaspoon guideline. The amount of sodium in food types can vary. For example, a slice of white bread can have between 80 and 230 milligrams of sodium. Last place: Potato chips or crisps, as well as other snacks, came in last on the list of top foods composing about 3 per cent of American's daily recommended salt intake . A cup of canned chicken noodle soup has between 100 and 940 milligrams and 3 ounces of luncheon meat has between 450 and 1,050 milligrams. A small 1 ounce bag of potato chips ranges from 50 to 200 milligrams. The new CDC report is based on surveys of more than 7,200 people in 2007 and 2008, including nearly 3,000 children. Participants were surveyed twice, each time answering detailed questions about what they had eaten over the previous day. Researchers then broke down what they ate into categories, and assigned sodium amounts. No ban: The CDC stops short of advising Americans eat less bread but encourages more vegetable and fruits instead . Salt reduction has become a recent focus of public health campaigns, and some major food makers have taken steps or announced plans to gradually reduce sodium in their products. CDC officials – who have long encouraged people to eat more fruits and vegetables – stopped short of advising people to lay off the bread. But they are encouraging consumers to read labels and, for example, buy brands of bread that have lower sodium. 'People can choose how much salt to add to their food at the table. They can't take it out once it's there,' Frieden said. There's another way to consume less sodium. 'Eat smaller portions,' Hayes said.","Nine out of 10 Americans consume too much salt claims report .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . UPDATED: . 06:20 EST, 23 March 2012 . A swinging couple who sprayed bear repellent into the face of a man after a sex session went wrong have been ordered to pay their victim £400 in compensation. Stephen Barclay, 36, and his lover Leanne Reid, 31, had been spending a drug-fuelled weekend at their home with total stranger Owen Greenan, whom they met on the internet. But the session turned ugly when Mr Greenan refused to let Barclay . take a picture of him sitting on the toilet in the early hours of the Sunday morning. Swingers: Steven Barclay, left, and Leanne Reid, right, (both pictured outside court in January) admitted assault after spraying bear mace at Owen Greenan when their consensual sex session turned nasty . Reid handed her partner a can of Sabre Wild Max Bear Attack deterrent spray and he released the chemical into Mr Greenan's face. He fled the house in agony and was found running down a road by a lorry driver and the police were called. Officers later arrested Reid and Barclay and charged them with a string of offences. Earlier this year, Barclay and Reid both admitting assaulting Mr Greenan at their cottage in  Glespin, Lanarkshire, Scotland, on March 27 last year. Isolated: The couple invited Mr Greenan to their cottage in Glespin, Lanarkshire, for the weekend for sex after meeting him online . Yesterday, both were ordered to pay their victim £400 and given 18-month community orders. Barclay was also instructed to carry out 240 hours of community service and was placed on a restriction of liberty order for three months. Neil McShane, representing Barclay, said his client had believed he was hallucinating after consuming drugs during the sex session. He said: 'The position is he had been taking a substance towards the end of the weekend. There was then a minor disagreement over a mobile telephone with the complainer. Bear repellent is similar to the pepper spray sold as 'mace' in the United States, used for fending off attackers. Sabre Wild Max – one of the most popular Canadian brands – uses hot pepper plants as an ingredient and is extremely powerful. The manufacturers warn that it is not for use on humans, as it can cause intense pain if sprayed into the eyes. A normal canister is designed to spray a heavy fog up to 40 yards away – so if it is fired too close  to a human eyeball, the force of the  discharge can cause pressure injuries. The spray itself also works by irritating the mucous membranes of the eyes, causing pain and the production of tears. It also causes coughing and sneezing. The only treatment is to  seek fresh air immediately and blink repeatedly to cleanse the eye. 'He has since told the social work department in the reports he felt he was hallucinating and not in his normal manner. 'In regards to the spray, he had bought this a number of years before in Canada. He accepts his guilt in regards to this. 'It's . clear from both reports that the attention this has attracted has . caused difficulties for him in that his family are now aware of his . lifestyle and do not approve. 'He is remorseful for the impact this has had on the complainer's life. It's simply a weekend that went wrong.' Archie . Hill, mitigating for Reid, added: 'She did not know what she was . fetching when asked for the spray and did not know what it was. She was . aggressive towards the complainer and she accepts that.' Sentencing the pair, Sheriff Nikola Stewart said the ordeal had terrorised Mr Greenan. She added: 'Against that, I recognise you both have either a limited record or no record and the responsibility you have for others. 'Mr Barclay, you are clearly in need of assistance and that is best delivered with a Community Payback Order.' In January, prosecutor Gary Dow told the court that the weekend 'had gone well' before matters escalated. He said Mr Greenan had been woken up on the couch at 4am by Reid who invited him into the couple's bedroom for a smoke. But on arriving there, he found Barclay sitting in a hot tub drinking a can of beer. Mr Dow said: 'The complainer sat on the toilet seat and Mr Barclay held a phone out to take a photo. 'He told the complainer, ""smile for the camera."" 'He went to get up and Leanne Reid said ""f****** smile"". She also had said that she was going to get a knife to stab him. 'Mr Barclay then said to the complainer, ""Do you think you can come here all weekend, **** my wife and nothing will happen?"".' Barclay then instructed Reid to give him the repellent, which he told police he had bought in Canada, before he sprayed it on his victim. Mr Dow added: 'The complainer then ran out of the house leaving his belongings.' Mr Greenan was later taken to Wishaw General Hospital where he was treated for his injuries and held in a contamination room before being released. Mr McShane told the court that drugs had played a part in the weekend's events. He said: 'This occurred at a time when parties had been taking ketamine. Mr Barclay had been up with very little sleep from Friday to Sunday.' Barclay also pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of cannabis worth up to £7,650 and the canister of the Sabre Wild Max Bear Attack deterrent. Reid's not guilty plea to a charge that she had wasted police time by alleging that Mr Greenan had raped her was accepted by prosecutors and the charge was dropped. Charges that Barclay and Reid had possessed and supplied amphetamine and ketamine on the same date were also dropped.","Stephen Barclay, 36, and Leanne Reid, 31, recruited stranger on internet .

Rescue crews began their search again today and were focusing along the riverbanks of the 900-acre, Kia Kima Boy Scout Camp in Fulton County, northeastern Arkansas. Desperate search: Caleb Linn, four, has been missing since Saturday from a boy scout camp in Arkansas . Search teams have been using thermal . detecting technology and a helicopter and divers joined the search for the . missing child today. Caleb, whose fourth birthday is . next month, was among 11 children on the bridge at the camp, about 120 . miles northeast of Little Rock. The children were not affiliated with the Boy Scouts but staying at the main campsite about half a mile from the bridge. When five older children left to return to . their cabins before noon, Caleb, from Springdale, asked leaders if he could try to catch up with . them and he hasn't been seen since. Wooded area: The four-year-old boy was last seen by family members who were helping at a clean-up project on a bridge near the Kia Kima Boy Scout Camp in Fulton County . Foul play was not suspected at this time, according to the examiner.com. The Fulton County Sheriff's Office said state police, local law enforcement and volunteers were scouring the area near the Missouri border along the Spring River.

Paedophiles, violent thugs and drug dealers were among more than 4,000 offenders who applied to become teachers last year despite having almost 10,000 criminal convictions between them. Criminal records checks revealed four convictions for child sex offences, including one for a sex attack on a girl under 13, as well as three convictions for assaulting or neglecting a child. The Criminal Records Bureau said that, to date, checks had helped to stop more than 130,000 unsuitable people from working with children. Barred: A vetting process has prevented thousands of criminals from entering classrooms as teachers . The figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that the 263,477 checks carried out on applicants for teaching posts in 2011 identified 4,098 with 9,493 convictions between them. These included more than 50 sex offences, 11 for arson, and two for making threats to kill. Some 830 violent offences were highlighted overall, along with more than 550 drugs offences and 11 for causing death by reckless driving. Separate figures showed that sex offenders and hundreds of violent criminals applied to work in nurseries last year. Siobhan Freegard, co-founder of parenting website Netmums, said: ‘Parents will be appalled at these figures.

Workers at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port factory in Merseyside are facing an uncertain future after reports from Germany indicate that the manufacturing plant has been earmarked for closure. The news, which could mean the loss of up to 2,100 UK jobs, is understood to come from an internal General Motors ‘strategy document’ obtained by the German magazine Der Spiegel. In an attempt to turnaround the financial fortunes of Opel - the German sister branch of Vauxhall - bosses are believed to be considering closing the plant and moving production to ‘low-cost’ countries. According to Der Spiegel, the document states that GM may expand production capacity in countries where costs are cheaper while closing both the Ellesmere Port site and the Bochum plant in Germany. Slowing down: Workers at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port factory in Merseyside face an uncertain future with owners potentially moving production to 'low cost' countries . GM Europe lost 527 million euros ($700 million) last year and company officials have expressed their determination to turn around the Opel and Vauxhall brands. If vehicle sales rise, according to Sunday's article, GM will look to build up to 80 per cent of additional cars in countries such as Poland, Russia, China, India, Mexico and Brazil, ’ The magazine said the document entitled  ‘Global Assembly Footprint.’ was presented at a GM business conference where it was announced that the company plans to export an additional 300,000 vehicles to the European market from plants in Mexico, Korea and China by 2016. Changing times: Workers on the assembly line in General Motors' Shanghai plant. Opel could move production from the UK to cheaper countries such as China . A spokesman for GM in Europe said: 'No decision has been made in this regard for Opel's car production.’ A spokesman for GM's Opel unit said GM would always seize the opportunities the global automotive market offered, but declined to comment further comment. Difficult decision: Head of General Motors' European operations . Karl-Friedrich Stracke is reported to be considering moving manufacturing operation to . lower-cost countries . Opel chief executive Karl-Friedrich Stracke was quoted by German paper Bild saying he ruled out plant closures and job cuts in the ‘near term’, but added there were ‘no taboos’ in its efforts to become more profitable in the future. The statements came after the German WAZ group of newspapers cited Government sources as saying that Stracke had informed the German government about plans to close the Opel plant in Bochum, adding that a meeting between Stracke and the workers union was scheduled for today. Referencing Stracke's comments a spokesman for Germany's Economy Ministry said factories were safe at least until the end of 2014 when production of existing models ends. He said: 'We are following the situation closely and we are in contact with the management of Opel.’ GM is the world's largest car-maker with 2011 sales of just over 9 million vehicles, up 7.6 percent from 2010. It last held the top spot in 2007 before it was surpassed by Toyota. While GM's fortunes in North America have improved substantially since its 2009 bankruptcy, it is still struggling to become profitable in Europe. Analysts say the restructuring plan must include job cuts and plant closures to address excess industry capacity across Europe, where sales are also falling.

"By . Will Stewart and Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 07:07 EST, 26 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:57 EST, 28 March 2012 . A Moscow oligarch whose attempted killers were allegedly fingered by the banker shot in London has claimed Russian 'terrorism' has arrived on Britain's streets. Alexander Antonov spoke out in support of German Gorbuntsov, 45, now in a coma after being gunned down in a suspected contract killing attempt last Tuesday. Shortly before the attack the wounded banker had given evidence implicating his own associates in an earlier mafia-style assassination bid against Mr Antonov, a key figure in the Converse Bank empire. Coma: German Gorbuntsov (left) was repeatedly shot outside a block of flats near Canary Wharf in an attempted assassination. There are now also fears for the safety of Larisa Gorbuntsov (right) who flew to her husband's bedside in London . At one point, the Russian authorities . regarded Mr Gorbuntsov as a possible suspect because of an alleged . $106million debt owed by Mr Antonov to Gorbuntsov. Yesterday, 61-year-old Mr Antonov claimed that he and Mr Gorbuntsov had 'normal' and even 'friendly' relations. 'He was not a part of the . assassination attempt. He had some information about how it was . prepared, and wanted to pass it on, that's it,' he said. Asked why Mr Gorbuntsov had been . targeted, he said: 'Perhaps because the people who did it were very . scared of this information getting publicly known, specially given that, . as I understood, German was adamant in his decision to make it public. 'So they went as far in the centre of . the legal world - I consider London to be the capital of the legal world . - in prime time, to carry out this slaughter.' He stressed: 'My personal attitude to . it is that it simply beggars belief, it beggars belief. How can you sort . business issues by such methods? It is terrorism. It is simply . terrorism. Shooting: German Gorbuntsov, 45, was attacked on the Isle of Dogs close to Canary Wharf . 'But I think the fact that it happened . in London does give hope to believe that Russian and British law . enforcement systems would together discover who did it, and get the . b******s.' Asked if he agreed that the two men . named by Mr Gorbuntsov to Russian prosecutors - Pyotr Chuvilin and Sergei . Mendeleyev - as being behind the Mr Antonov assassination attempt, were . indeed involved. 'I'm scared to give the positive . answer to that, is it up to the investigation and the court to establish . it. But they can be somewhere there. Nearby. ' Asked if Russians were behind the crime, he said: 'I agree.' Asked whether he would now feel safe coming to London, he said: 'Well, what do you do? You've got to keep living. ' Gun blast: German Gorbuntsov is pictured here being carried into ambulance after being shot in Canary Wharf . Gorbuntsov's testimony appeared to give the missing link in establishing who ordered the attack against Antonov. Gorbuntsov's lawyer Vadim Vedenin has . admitted in the Mr Antonov case that his client was initially 'suspected in . organising this attempt on his life', because he was present at the . meeting where property claims to the Antonov family were talked about . and where the Antonovs were threatened. 'This is true, he was present there, . we do not deny it. But still he is not in anyway related to the attempt . on his life itself.' Alexander Antonov, father of former Portsmouth FC owner Vladimir Antonov, lost the use of an arm after a 2009 assassination bid in Moscow. Three Chechen men were convicted of attempted murder and sent to prison on long sentences a year later, but police never identified the mastermind. The same gang was convicted of killing Ruslan Yamadayev, rivals to hardman Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's Kremlin-backed president. Ex-Russian MP Yamadayev was gunned down in his car close to the British Embassy in Moscow in September 2008. His brother Sulim, a Kadyrov enemy, was shot dead in Dubai in March 2009 by men using a gold-plated pistol. In November 2006 Russian dissident Alexander . Litvinenko (pictured above) was murdered in London. British . prosecutors have named his fellow ex-KGB agent Andrei Lugovoy as the . main suspect in his poisoning with radioactive polonium-210. However, the Russian authorities have repeatedly refused to send him to face trial in the UK.' The lawyer stressed: 'He clearly said he had nothing to do with the attempt on Antonov's life.' It has also emerged Mr Gorbuntsov was preparing to claim political asylum in Britain for himself and his family. The financier's business visa, which had allowed him to live here legally since 2008, expires next year. It is thought the 45-year-old feared he would be forced to return to Russia and into the clutches of his many enemies. He said recently: ‘If I go back to . Russia, they will kill me.’ Last night Mr Gorbuntsov was under armed . guard in hospital after being hit up to six times. With . the would-be assassin still on the loose there were fears for the . safety of Mr Gorbuntsov’s wife Larisa, 46, and son. Mrs Gorbuntsov flew . to London to be at her husband’s bedside while their 25-year-old son . Vladislav is seeking a visa to come to Britain. Scotland . Yard yesterday appealed for a taxi driver who may have witnessed the . shooting to come forward. Mr Gorbuntsov was shot after being dropped off . by taxi at his apartment block next to Canary Wharf on Tuesday evening. The . banker, who had been at a business meeting in Bishopsgate in the City . earlier that evening, hailed the hackney carriage at 7pm. He had just . stepped out of the car at 7.30pm when he fell in a hail of bullets. The . hooded gunman, described as white, 6ft tall and slim, fled on foot. A . young blonde woman, reported to be Mr Gorbuntsov’s mistress and the . mother of his second child, was at his side as emergency services . arrived. Mr Gorbuntsov's lawyer also said the banker had been planning to submit a . political asylum request to stay within days. A successful asylum claim . would have helped him fight off attempts by Moldova to extradite him on . allegations of embezzlement. There . was also an apparent financial wrangle with state-controlled Russian Railways, . whose president is an ally of Vladimir Putin. An estimated £415million . was allegedly not repaid after being deposited by the business into a Moscow bank . whose ownership later passed to Mr Gorbuntsov and his associates.","German Gorbuntsov, 45, was seeking political asylum in the UK .

"Thailand authorities said it is unclear whether Bangkok's explosions were linked to the New Delhi attack . By . Mail Today Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:30 EST, 14 February 2012 . An Iranian man carrying grenades blew off his own legs and wounded four civilians in a series of blasts that rattled Thailand's capital, Bangkok, on Tuesday. The explosions came a day after an Israeli diplomat car was bombed in India, an attack Israel blamed on Iran. Thailand authorities said it's unclear whether Tuesday's Bangkok explosions were linked to the New Delhi attack, but Israeli defence minister Ehud Barak accused Iran of being behind the series of blasts in Bangkok. A Thai Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) official examines a backpack that was left on the bomb site by a suspected bomber . 'The attempted attack in Bangkok proves once again that Iran and its proxies are continuing to act in the ways of terror and the latest attacks are an example of that,' said Barak, who is currently in Singapore but had spent several hours in the Thai capital on Sunday. 'Iran and Hezbollah are uninhibited sources of terror, they are a danger to the stability of the region and a danger to the stability of the world,' he said, in remarks released by his Tel Aviv office. Thai security forces found more explosives in a house where the Iranian man was staying in Bangkok, but it was not known what targets they might have been meant for, police Gen. Pansiri Prapawat said. Pansiri said a passport found at the scene of one of the blasts in Bangkok indicated the assailant was Saeid Moradi from Iran. Authorities in Tehran could not immediately be reached for comment. Tuesday's violence began in the afternoon when a stash of explosives apparently detonated by accident in Moradi's house. Police said two foreigners quickly left the residence, followed by a wounded Moradi. 'He tried to wave down a taxi, but he was covered in blood, and the driver refused to take him,' Pansiri said. A taxi was destroyed by a hand grenade thrown by an Iranian man who was believed to have been part of a bomb making ring operating out of a house in central Bangkok . Thailand authorities said it's unclear whether Tuesday's Bangkok explosions were linked to the New Delhi attack . This photograph taken by a passerby on an iPhone showing bomber Moradi lying on the ground with his legs blown off . He then threw an explosive at the taxi and began running. Police, who had been called to the area, then tried to apprehend Moradi, who hurled a grenade to defend himself. 'But somehow it bounced back and blew off his legs,' Pansiri said. Photos of the wounded Iranian showed him covered in dark soot on a sidewalk strewn with broken glass. He lay in front of a Thai primary and secondary school. No students were reported wounded. A dark satchel nearby was investigated by a bomb disposal unit. Pansiri said police found Iranian currency, US dollars and Thai money in the bag. Another Iranian was detained on Tuesday night at Bangkok's international airport as he attempted to leave for neighbouring Malaysia, police commander Winai Thongsong said. Authorities were interrogating the man, but it was not yet known whether he was involved in Tuesday's blasts. Last month, a Lebanese-Swedish man with alleged links to pro-Iranian Hezbollah militants was detained by the Thai police. He . led authorities to a warehouse filled with more than 4,000 kg of urea . fertilizer and several gallons of liquid ammonium nitrate.

"By . Daniel Bates . UPDATED: . 13:22 EST, 11 January 2012 . A shocking new advert is warning people not to drink soda - in case they might lose a limb. The posters from New York City's Health Department warn the public that they might have to have an arm or leg amputated if they consume too many fizzy drinks. Such an unhealthy habit can cause diabetes which in extreme cases can lead to amputations. Big controversy: A grim new advertisement to fight obesity created on behalf of the New York City Department of Health links amputations to sugary sodas . The adverts have already been attacked by soda makers for painting an 'inaccurate picture' of what the drink does to the body. But New York health chiefs - and the city's mayor Michael Bloomberg - insist it is a necessary shock tactic. City officials have put up 1,000 of the posters on the subway which show a man with Type 2 diabetes who has lost his right leg sitting behind a chart showing how soda portions have gradually got bigger. Mayor Bloomberg has defended the controversial ads, saying, 'What do you want to do? Do you want to have people lose their legs?' The caption reads: 'Portions have grown. So has Type 2 diabetes, which can lead to amputations'. Stefan Friedman, a spokesman for the American Beverage Association, said the campaign was over the top. He . said: 'Instead of utilizing scare tactics, the beverage industry is . offering real solutions like smaller portioned containers and new . calorie labels' But in a press conference Mr Bloomberg said: 'What do you want to do? Do you want to have people lose their legs? 'Or do you want to show them what happens so that they won't lose their legs? Take your poison. Which do you want?' America's obesity crisis shows no sign of abating. Around one-third of U.S. adults are obese as are 17 per cent of children and adolescents aged between two and 19. This . has in part explained how 25.8 million children and adults in the . United States - 8.3 per cent of the population - now have diabetes. Whilst most cases can be managed with insulin injections, around 65,000 people each year have to lose a limb due to the illness. New York City is one of the most draconian places in America when it comes to policing the health of its citizens. Another ad shows an obese woman dragging herself up a set of stairs as she clings to the handrailing over a graphic of how much bigger portions of french fries have become . Too fat to walk: The third ad shows an obese pedestrian crossing on a motor scooter and links the obesity epidemic to the massive size increase in a standard hamburger . Mr Bloomberg is reportedly considering a crack down on the number of licensed premises and has already banning smoking in public places like parks and beaches. Adverts already running on the subway show how many miles a person would have to walk to work off the calories from fatty kinds of coffees. New Yorkers have also been forced to look at an anti-obesity advert showing people drinking a glass full of human fat to dissuade them from eating junk food. Atlanta also recently sparked controversy when it put posters up warning about the dangers of childhood obesity with the slogan: 'Big bones didn't make me this way, big meals did' Another poster with a picture of an overweight girl read: 'It's hard to be a little girl if you're not'. New York's Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said: 'The portion sizes (of soda) that are marketed are often much more than humans need. 'We are warning people about the risks of super-size portions so they can make more informed choices about what they eat.'","'Do you want to have people lose their legs?

After 76 days, Gabor Rakonczay - isolated and incommunicado for nearly 50 of those after his canoe capsized - has become the first person to paddle across the Atlantic Ocean from Europe to the Caribbean. Mr Rakonczay, who began his adventure in Lagos, Portugal, on December 21, and stopped for several days in the Canary Islands for rest and supplies, reached the island of Antigua on Sunday, he told The Associated Press in a phone interview from the Caribbean nation. When his 24.61 feet canoe capsized at sea, the Hungarian adventurer said he managed to save it but his communications equipment was damaged and he had not been in contact with his family since February 6. Record-breaker: Gabor Rakonczay has become the first person to paddle across the Atlantic Ocean from Europe to the Caribbean . Mr Rakonczay, 30, made the journey without a satellite tracking system which would have allowed him to signal that he was all right. So his wife, who stayed behind in Hungary, could only hope for the best. 'The supplier raised the price at the last minute and I decided to leave without one because it was not possible to postpone the trip,' Mr Rakonczay said from Nelson's Dockyard in southern Antigua. 'This trip was the first time I didn't have a tracking system and the first time I really would have needed one.' During the nearly seven weeks he was out of reach, Viktoria, his wife, gave no indications that she was anything but totally sure that her husband was alive and that only equipment failure was to blame for their lack of communication. Solitude: Rakonczay said that he often thought about what his loved ones were going through, and was heartened by the faith and confidence of his family in his abilities during the long silence . She kept posting entries on their web . page nearly every day, speculating about Gabor's position and how the . weather conditions were affecting his voyage on the canoe nicknamed . 'Vitez,' which means 'valiant' in Hungarian. Mr Rakonczay said that in his solitude he often thought about what his loved ones were likely going through, and was heartened by the faith and confidence of his family in his abilities during the long silence. 'I was positively surprised in those at home ... because everyone was certain that if I run into any difficulties, I'll be able to solve them,' Mr Rakonczay said. 'It was a great relief to reach port because it meant completing the journey and because my family could finally know for sure that I was OK.' While he lit smoke flares on three separate occasions to signal ships passing nearby, he was not able to communicate with any of them. Status unknown: Rakonczay made the journey without a satellite tracking system which would have allowed him to signal that he was all right . 'Some slowed and even changed direction . as they likely picked me up on their radars,' Mr Rakonczay said. 'But I was . often surrounded by waves 12 feet high and the canoe is less than one . meter high, so it's most likely that they simply weren't able to see . me.' The uniqueness of Mr Rakonczay's crossing was confirmed by the London-based Ocean Rowing Society International, which adjudicates such feats for the Guinness World Records. Atlantic crossings have been made in rowboats and kayaks, but not a canoe, in which a paddle with a single blade is used. 'We were disappointed he had no satellite tracking on board,' said Tatiana Rezva-Crutchlow, editor-in-chief of the society's website. 'We are very pleased to hear that he has arrived'. In 2008, Mr Rakonczay and his wife successfully rowed across the Atlantic together, but this solo challenge had been in the works for a long time and he reached his destination some 20 days faster than planned. 'I was very interested in discovering what it's like to be all alone on a ship in the ocean,' Rakonczay said. 'It was my childhood dream.'","Gabor Rakonczay made most of the journey without communications equipment, which was damaged when his canoe capsized .

Sir Philip Green, the owner of Arcadia Group, has responded to a 40 per cent drop on the company's profits by announcing the closure of 250 stores. Arcadia, which owns Miss Selfridge, BHS, Burton and Evans as well as Top Shop, reported underlying pre-tax profits of £133.1million compared with £213.1million last year, as like-for-like sales including VAT fell 1.8 per cent. Sir Philip blamed the weather in part, saying that the unseasonably warm autumn had dented sales of winter clothing and suggested that as the chain tries to cut spending it could end up closing around 250 shops. The company, which currently has . 2,507 stores across its brands, saw margins squeezed by 1.8 per cent as . it took a £53million hit to avoid passing its higher spending on to . customers. He told the BBC that 'extremely . challenging' conditions would force the chain to shut around half of its . stores which have a lease expiring in the next three years, saying: 'I . would expect us to close 250, 260.' He added: 'Additionally, the warmest October and November on record have made autumn trading much tougher.' Although the winter collections were . released more than a month ago, temperatures in may parts of the UK have . barely dropped in to single figures. The results came on the day the . Office of National Statistics confirmed that the UK's GDP rose by just . 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2011. Dixons Retail, owner of Currys and PC World, also fared poorly as it revealed losses of £25.3million between April and October. Top Shop: The shop's owner Arcadia has suffered from the warm weather . Currys: Rioters targeted the electronics stores in August's unrest . Network Rail's net debt has risen to £25.74billion, the rail infrastructure company announced today. The figure - for the 12 months ending March 31 - is an increase on the £25.05billion figure for the previous 12 months. But NR, which has no shareholders and is a not-for-dividend company, said its net debt remained 'at an expected level'. The figure was released alongside NR's results for April-September 2011, which showed that it made a £136million profit in that period - only half of its gains last year. In autumn 2008 NR was set the challenge by the Office of Rail Regulation of cutting costs by 22 per cent between 2009 and 2014. The company said today that by the end of last year an estimated 13 per cent had been saved and in the last half-year efficiencies had contributed to further savings of more than £300million. However, its performance in the UK is . an improvement on last year, with a loss of £3.9million compared with . £10.7million in the same period of 2010. The figure includes a one-off hit of . £4million from the losses sustained in the August riots, when the . expensive goods in the company's shops proved a particular target for . many looters. Like-for-like sales were down eight . per cent, but this was better than expected as sales of both white goods . and tablet computers held up well. Dixons' losses came as its . international markets, which include the debt-laden economies of Greece . and Italy, dragged on overall performance. The company's shares have lost . two-thirds of their value over the past two years after it shocked . markets with a series of profits warnings. Arcadia's programme of closures will . follow the likes of Mothercare, HMV and Thorntons, which have all shut . stores amid the economic gloom. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG . Index, said: 'Store group Arcadia reminds everyone that the British . consumer is still generally AWOL, with no likelihood of a quick return.'

We are going to have a great working relationship and I think we'll have a lot of fun together.' Coach Rex Ryan, general manager Mike Tannenbaum and owner Woody Johnson were not at the Jets field house. They were down at the NFL meetings in Palm Beach, Florida, far away from the wild scene at the team's headquarters. Teamwork: Tebow said he was 'excited' to work with head QB Mark Sanchez . Birds eye view: The media crowds were at least six deep . While Ryan and Tannenbaum insist Sanchez is entrenched as the first-string quarterback, Tebow will also see plenty of time on the field and certainly much more of the spotlight. Ryan suggested on Sunday that Tebow could be used at a position other than quarterback. He kept referring to Tebow as a 'football player,' his ability not limited to quarterback. 'I don't see Tim just holding a clipboard,' Ryan told a group of reporters while in Florida for a meeting of NFL team owners. 'He's going to be playing for us. There is no doubt.' Ryan added: 'There won't be a better wildcat quarterback in the game. Is that his only role? I don't believe that. We'll see.' Tebow said first and foremost he's a quarterback, and that's his hope and dream, but 'however I can help the team, I am open to it.' The newest Jet has already helped his team get some attention. While the club claims the trade for Tebow was a football-related move, it was also marketing gold as the polarizing QB has occupied the back - and, in some cases, the front - pages of the New York-area tabloids. And that's just weeks after the Giants won their second Super Bowl in four years. Legions of fans have been snatching up Tebow's green and white No. 15 jersey. The famed Carnegie Deli in Manhattan already has a sandwich named after him, and Jockey has a digital billboard ad outside the Lincoln Tunnel - on the New Jersey side - with the underwear company saying it supports 'Tebow & New York.' Tebowing: Tim Tebow, known for his famous position of prayer, was traded by the Denver Broncos . Leader of the pack: Mark Sanchez was drafted by the Jets in 2009 . It's been a whirlwind of a few weeks for Tebow, who just last month was declared Denver's starting quarterback going into this summer by John Elway. Not long after that, Peyton Manning was suddenly in town and Tebow was told he could get traded. So much for 'Timsanity' in Denver. Well, it has hit Broadway in full force, making 'Linsanity' and the New York Knicks' sensational Jeremy Lin seem like a distant memory. Manning was introduced as the Broncos' newest quarterback last Tuesday, and just over 24 hours later, Tebow was on the move, surprisingly headed to New York. And then, he wasn't. A snag in the deal held things up between the Jets and Broncos, the delay centred on a salary advance due Tebow. Jacksonville, once considered one of the favourites to land their hometown star, jumped back in the hunt. But eight hours later, the Jets finally completed the trade, agreeing to pay half of the $5million Denver owed Tebow. There was yet one more delay before the trade became official, as a technicality required Tebow to sign a rewritten contract which kept him on the Broncos' salary cap until Saturday afternoon. But now Tebow is here, a member of the Jets. And they intend to make things work with him and Sanchez, who was given a contract extension that included $20.5million guaranteed less than two weeks ago. Bucking Bronco: Seen left to right, Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, new quarterback Peyton Manning and General Manager John Elway . Leader: Manning, number 18, was traded from the Indianapolis Colts . He hasn't commented publicly on the deal yet, but training camp up in quaint Cortland, N.Y., might be a pretty hot spot - especially if Sanchez struggles and restless fans push for more Tebow, creating a quarterback controversy that could last all season. Jets fans have been decidedly mixed on the trade, with many wondering why the team would add a monster distraction to a locker room that had serious issues last season and was partly to blame for an 8-8 finish. Sanchez's leadership and confidence were questioned by some players, speaking anonymously in newspapers reports, and the addition of Tebow could cut into the starting quarterback's ability to regain the room. Joe Namath ripped the trade, calling it 'a publicity stunt,' and cornerback Antonio Cromartie wondered on Twitter why the Jets would even need a guy like Tebow. He later reversed course, saying he supported Tebow and the team, but there have been plenty of other critics who have made it clear that they think the Jets made the wrong move. While Tebow took Denver from 1-4 to AFC West champions last season, the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner hit fewer than 50 per cent of his passes and often seemed more comfortable running than passing. Throw in Tebow's public displays of faith - he is a devout Christian - and he quickly has become a player who triggers a strong reaction from fans. But whether anyone likes it or not, Tebow is part the New York sports scene. Now the Jets must figure out how to make it a winning addition.

"By . Arthur Martin . UPDATED: . 03:04 EST, 14 September 2011 . A builder living on Europe's largest illegal traveller site is secretly backing a lavish 33-home property development in Ireland, it emerged yesterday. Michael Quilligan, the son of a traveller worth £24million, is among the 96 families who claim they will be made homeless when they are removed from Dale Farm in Essex. However, planning records show that Mr Quilligan is the mastermind behind a multi-million-pound development in the town of Rathkeale, the spiritual home of travellers in the west of Ireland. Under construction: The multi-million pound development of large detached homes in Rathkeale in the west of Ireland . The large detached and semi-detached houses - worth up to £400,000 - are close to completion and are near to the local equivalent of millionaires' row, where other substantial gated properties can be found. Mr Quilligan is thought to have sold some of the properties to other travellers. It is unclear whether Dale Farm residents are among the buyers but one local report yesterday claimed that a dozen of the families facing eviction have bought homes in Rathkeale. Members of Basildon Council, which is responsible for clearing the Dale Farm site, are calling for an urgent investigation. This latest twist in the saga blows apart the travellers’ claims that there is nowhere ‘culturally sensitive’ for them to go if they are evicted. Their links with Rathkeale – where around half of the town’s properties are owned by travellers – prove they have a perfect retreat in their native land. Battle: Police will start to remove families from the Dale Farm site in Essex on Monday . Evictions: The 10-year battle to remain at Dale Farm was lost earlier this month . It also emerged yesterday that Basildon Borough Council had paid housing benefits for some of the Dale Farm travellers directly to a landlord based in Rathkeale. John Flynn, 55, bought the former scrapyard at Dale Farm for £120,000 ten years ago and owns about five caravan pitches on the site. The council admitted it paid money directly to Mr Flynn at an address in Rathkeale to cover the rent of his tenants, who were allowed to claim housing benefits, despite living on an illegal site. Many of the homes in Rathkeale remain boarded up apart from a few months a year and at Christmas when a cavalcade of UK-registered Range Rovers, Mercedes, BMWs and Porsches roll into the town, pulling caravans behind them. Extravagant traveller weddings and christenings in the local Roman Catholic church add to the carnival atmosphere over the Christmas period. Defiant: Travellers living at the Dale Farm site in Essex have vowed to remain there . Mr Quilligan, a father of four, runs a business called Michael Quilligan Building Contractor and is the son of Rathkeale’s wealthiest traveller, Simon ‘Sammy Buckshot’ Quilligan, an antiques dealer. John Dornan, a Tory councillor in Essex, said: ‘I have long called for an inquiry into the funding of the site. ‘This new information needs to be looked at by the council to compare it with any homeless applications and housing benefits claims. ‘I do not want to prejudice any investigation, but if any of the same people are involved, it would have huge implications.’ Dale Farm, built on green belt land near Basildon, came to the attention of planners around ten years ago when illegal plots started springing up around a smaller approved site. Time to move: The Dale Farm site covers 52 plots and has a 400-strong community . Since then it has grown into a 400-strong community of travellers who have built roads and connections to electricity. Bailiffs and police are planning to start removing travellers on the illegal camp from Monday after the council won a High Court battle to evict them. Another traveller, Richard O’Brien – an uncle of Dale Farm spokesman Richard Sheridan but not from the site himself – is developing 44 houses near his home in Rathkeale, called the Castle Park estate. A third housing estate of 18 properties, again linked to members of the Sheridan clan, is also thought to have been built. Last night Mr Sheridan, who is president of the UK Gipsy Council, said: ‘This is all rubbish. I wouldn’t know anything about this.’ Len Gridley, 52, whose home backs on to the Dale Farm site, said: ‘This proves it is not just about people with nowhere to go. People have been making money out of this by renting out illegal properties.'","Saga blows apart travellers’ claims there is nowhere for them to go .

Suicidal: Laura Johnson, 20, leaving court today where she told jurors she has self-harmed since 14 and tried to kill herself six times . A millionaire's daughter accused of . driving looters around while they robbed people at knifepoint in last . year's riots was 'obsessed' with the drug dealer she claims forced her . to be his getaway driver, a court heard today. Laura Johnson, 20, was 'part and . parcel' of the criminality of last summer's riots even though she had . the chance to call the police and drive away from four men who had . 'effectively kidnapped' her, it is alleged. But the straight-A university student . behaved as she did because she was 'obsessed' with Emmanuel Okubote, 20 . and had 'fallen for him hard', a jury was told. Johnson had gone to pick up her friend . Okubote, known as T-Man, from Curry's, in Bromley Road, Catford, south . east London, when he and three other men wearing hooded tops, bandanas . and balaclavas, got into the back of her car and ordered her to drive. Sandy Canavan, prosecuting, told Inner . London Crown Court that even when Johnson found out crack dealer ‘T . Man’ had been to prison it still did not put her off. The student had begun a close . friendship with Okubote during the summer after being introduced to him . by a friend she met while a mental health unit outpatient. Phone records revealed that straight-A . university student Johnson, made 80 phone calls to ‘T Man’ in the two . weeks leading up to August 8th - dubbed the worst night of London’s . riots last summer. Johnson, who the jury has heard . previously tried to kill herself, says she was too frightened to report . the men or flee during their rioting on August 8. The defendant denies being a willing . participant in the gang as they drove around the Catford, Hither Green . and Charlton areas of London while the men got in and out of the car to . loot and rob people. Miss Canavan said the student was making things up as she went along in her defence. Johnson was in possession of mobile . phones during her effective 'kidnap', which meant the four men believed . she would not report them, the barrister said. Miss Canavan said: 'The only reality . is you were left with the phones as they (the men) were absolutely sure . they weren't at any risk of you having access to those because you were . very much part and parcel of what was taking place.' Describing the calls Johnson is said to have made to Okubote, Miss Canavan told Johnson: ' Family home: Johnson has been bailed to her parents' large, detached house in Orpington . Looking at the phone records it looks like you did all the running. Frankly, it looks like you are almost obsessed with him. 'You are constantly ringing him and if you don’t get through you’ll ring again and again determined until you succeed.' Johnson, who suffers from mental health problems and has tried to kill herself seven times, replied: 'I disagree. 'When you are suicidal you do anything you can to get out of that mentality.' The court heard Johnson, who claims . she was raped by two men last July - a month before the riots - and had a . mental breakdown over that and the break up with her ex-boyfriend, even . exchanged flirty texts with ‘T Man’ the day they allegedly went on a . looting spree. Frenzy: Johnson's trial heard how hundreds of rioters scurried 'like wild rats' around Stone Lake Retail Park in Charlton (above) The prosecution claim Johnson, then . 19, was one of hundreds of teenagers who scurried like ‘wild rats’ around an under-siege retail park in south east London. A witness claims he saw the grammar . school student loading a flatscreen TV into the boot of her car amid the . mayhem as her accomplices ran back and forth with stolen goods. The defendant entered a petrol station alone that evening to pay for fuel and could have raised the alarm, Miss Canavan said. 'If you had the phones with you, you could have called the police yourself,' she said. Johnson says looters threatened her and made her drive them around as they robbed people and shops during the summer riots . 'I could have, yes,' answered the defendant. 'You could have texted anybody to indicate you were in trouble,' Miss Canavan added. 'I could have, yes,' replied Johnson. 'The reality is you would have got in touch with somebody to say 'I am in trouble, help'.' The defendant answered 'No I wouldn't', and agreed with the barrister's suggestion that she was 'terrified'. Johnson, from Orpington, south east . London, denies three counts of burglary and three alternative counts of . handling stolen goods.","Miss Johnson claims she was forced to drive car for four looters last summer .

Jersey Shore star Jenni 'JWoww' Farley decided the best way to have a tasteful reminder to her grandmother who passed away recently would be to have a tattoo put on her back in her memory. She showed off the artwork, which seemed to show the name Oma, on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon this weekend. Scroll down for video... Here it is: Jenni Farley shows off her tattoo in memory of her late grandmother on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon this weekend . Close-up: Jenni's tattoo appears to have the name Oma written in black ink which is the German term for grandmother . Tribute: JWoww got the tattoo during her recent trip to Florence to film the fourth season of Jersey Shore . She said she had the tattoo done during the cast's trip to Italy earlier this year. She said:  'My grandmother's birthday, her 90th, would have been when I was out there, and I wanted to get her on me somewhere, I didn't know when and I didn't know how. 'My grandmother passed away in February and her 90th would have been in May, so I was filming there and I found a perfect Florence artist to put my grandmother on me.' Oma is the German term for grandmother. Slimline: Jenni Farley flaunted her new skinnier look on Jimmy Fallon's popular talk show . In another development her co-star . Deena Cortese has revealed she went under the knife and had a nose job . in a bid to artificially bolster her image. The 26-year-old spoke out in support of . fellow cast member JWoww, who caused a flurry of speculation she had . more plastic surgery after debuting a new slimline figure. But the reality star said she would back Jwoww if the speculation proved to be true. She said: 'If she did, more power to you. I actually had a nose job.' Smell of success: Deena Cortese has revealed she had a nose job in a bid to improve her looks and become a star . Double act: Deena and Snooki both flaunted their curves when they attended the magazine launch . The news is sure to come as a surprise to fans, who see the brassy Italian American as a style icon. However her unnaturally angled nose bears all the hallmarks of a surgically enhanced beak. The speculation about Jenni was . sparked by the show's new season premiere on August 4, in which she . debuted her new slimline look. Bombshell? Deena struck Marilyn Monroe's famous pose but the jury is out on whether she looked as good . She . has been very open about having breast implants, so many assumed she . had additional work done to achieve her more slender figure. However Jenni responded to the rumours . on Twitter, writing, 'Flattered I'm the topic of tabloids. Funny what . people assume when you lose weight and  tone.' The Jersey Shore girls in the show are proving to be unlikely icons to hordes of teenagers, so the news they are happy to go under the knife to enhance their looks is sure to spark fears it could encourage more youngsters to go down a similar path. And their outrageous hard partying behaviour has also raised concerns they are unsuitable role models. However it seems to be paying off for the cast of the show. Fully booked: Snooki could hardly raise a smile as she plugged her money-spinning new book . Put your hand up if you are a literary genius: Snooki gets ready to sign copies for her legion of fans . The girls are featuring on the cover of this month's YRB magazine, and celebrated by attending a swanky party in New York.

The star, real name Nicole Polizzi was recently named one of the top 10 earning stars on TV, with her $100,000 per episode placing her alongside the likes of Simon Cowell and David Letterman. She cashed in further by taking part in a book-signing to promote her tome A Shore Thing yesterday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 06:51 EST, 27 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:33 EST, 27 March 2012 . The Government’s controversial Health and Social Care Bill became law today, after a tortuous 14-month passage through Parliament. Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle's announcement in the House of Commons that the Queen had granted Royal Assent to the bill was greeted by cries of 'shame' from opposition Labour MPs. The proposals were first tabled in . Parliament in January 2011, but were subjected to an unprecedented . 'pause' last year as Health Secretary Andrew Lansley struggled to secure . the support of healthcare workers. Health workers demonstrating outside Parliament last week against the NHS reforms. The Health and Social Care Bill became law today . The reforms were then amended more than 1,000 times during a lengthy passage through the House of Lords. The new rules mean the Government can create GP commissioning groups to buy healthcare for patients and scrap Primary Care Trusts (PCTs). Labour has bitterly opposed the passage . of the new law, insisting it threatens the foundation of the NHS and . paves the way for private services to get too heavily involved. Testing times: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley faced a huge backlash from doctors' unions . A draft risk register leaked today showed that ministers were warned 18 months ago of the risk that the reforms could lead to a loss of financial control, reduced productivity and emergencies being less well managed. The Department of Health, which refused to comment on today’s leak, has resisted a ruling from the Information Commissioner that it should release the final version of the risk register in response to a freedom of information request from Labour. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said today’s document published in The Guardian showed that ministers were warned before they launched the Bill that it was 'likely to cause major damage to the NHS'. The document was produced on September 28 2010, and it is not known what changes were made before the completion of the transition risk register on November 10. The Bill, which will devolve 60 per cent of the NHS’s budget to new GP-led consortia, has changed fundamentally since that date, with more than 1,000 amendments during its passage through Parliament. Identifying 43 separate areas of potential risk, the draft register rates each on a scale of one to five, where a rating of one means little likelihood and very low impact and five means almost certain to occur and very high impact. The likelihood and impact figures are multiplied together to give an overall risk rating, with a maximum score of 25. Among 13 areas given a risk rating of 16 - with likelihood and impact each assessed at four out of five - were: . Other dangers, considered to have a . lower rating of 12, included the risk that 'NHS role in emergency . preparedness/responsiveness is more difficult to manage through a more . devolved organisation, and so emergencies are less well . managed/mitigated'. The risk report warned NHS emergency care could be more difficult to manage through a more devolved organisation . Staff concerns and union action over the reforms could lead to 'deterioration in relations, lower productivity in the Department of Health/NHS and delays in programme', the document said. And there was a warning that strategic health authorities and primary care trusts might lose “good people” who then have to be re-employed to run the new system. Mr Burnham said: 'Now we know why David Cameron refused to publish the risk register before the Bill was through Parliament - it’s because civil servants were telling him his reorganisation was likely to cause major damage to the NHS. 'David Cameron will never be forgiven for knowingly taking these risks with the country’s best-loved institution.' A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We do not comment on leaks. We have always been open about risk and have published all relevant information in the impact assessments alongside the Bill. 'As the latest performance figures show, we are dealing with those risks, performance is improving - waiting times are down and mixed-sex wards are at an all-time low - and we are on course to make the efficiency savings that the NHS needs to safeguard it for the future.'","The NHS reform proposals were first tabled in Parliament in January 2011 .

Shock waves from comets bombarding the Earth may have helped to build proteins and set the stage for life, scientists have learned. Comets, giant snowballs of ice and dust, are known to have carried organic chemicals and water to the early Earth. But just what caused life to spring out of nowhere on a barren and desolate planet billions of years ago remains a mystery. Rock on: It's thought that comets were responsible for kick-starting life on Earth . Now scientists may have part of the answer. Laboratory experiments have shown that amino acids - organic molecules that are the building blocks of proteins - would have survived violent comet impacts. What is more, the shock of a large comet impact would have provided the energy needed to start bonding amino acids together to make proteins. Proteins provide the raw material that allows all living things, from microbes to humans, to exist and function. Their creation by comets may explain how life appeared so quickly at the end of a period 3.8 billion years ago called the ‘late heavy bombardment’. During this turbulent time the Earth was showered by both comets and rocky asteroids, leaving crater scars that are still seen on the Moon. Dr Jennifer Blank, who led the U.S scientists from the Nasa/Ames Research Centre in Moffett Field, California, said: ‘Our research shows that the building blocks of life could, indeed, have remained intact despite the tremendous shock wave and other violent conditions in a comet impact. ‘Comets really would have been the ideal packages for delivering ingredients for the chemical evolution thought to have resulted in life. We like the comet delivery scenario because it includes all of the ingredients for life - amino acids, water and energy.’ Dr Blank described the experiments at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego, California. The first traces of life began about 3.5billion years ago, but it was 375million years ago that fish crawled out of the water . Her team set out to simulate conditions that existed when Earth was repeatedly struck by amino acid-carrying comets, some of which were 10 miles or more in diameter. One study used powerful gas guns to fire supersonic blasts of gas at capsules filled with amino acids, water and other materials. Despite the heat and shock of the simulated collisions the amino acids did not break down. Instead, they began forming the chain-like ‘peptide bonds’ that link amino acids together to make proteins. Intense pressure from the impact offset the intense heat and supplied the energy needed to create the peptides. Other experiments used computer models to simulate conditions as comets ploughed into the Earth's atmosphere. Both comets and asteroids may have brought multiple deliveries of the ‘seedlings of life’ to Earth, said Dr Blank.",Earth was pounded by asteroids 3.8billion years ago .

But somewhere in the world, this kind of thing is happening to an animal every few seconds on average. The difference is, it’s normally hidden. We need to remind people it is still going on.' Scientists have long used laboratory animals for medical and drug testing and continue to do so. 'But although animal testing for . cosmetics was banned in the EU three years ago, it is still legal in . Britain to sell products animal-tested in other parts of the world, . including the USA and Canada. In China, such testing is a legal . requirement. Humane Society spokeswoman Wendy . Higgins said it was ‘morally unthinkable’ that cosmetic companies should . continue to profit from animal suffering, adding there could be ‘no . justification for subjecting animals to pain for the sake of producing . lipstick and eye shadow’. Dr Chris Flower, director general of the Cosmetics, Toiletries and Perfumeries Association (CTPA), said: 'People may have been understandably shocked by the publicity stunt arranged by Lush in their Regent Street shop window recently. 'It may give the misleading impression that cosmetic products are tested on animals for sale in Europe whereas the testing of cosmetic products on animals was banned in Britain in 1998 and throughout Europe in September 2004. 'It has been established by the European Commission's scientific expert committee that the safety of a finished product can be determined by knowledge of its ingredients. Testing the product on animals is not necessary. 'The cosmetics industry has been at the forefront of the search for alternatives and has led to the development of many non-animal safety tests that are now routinely used for its ingredients. 'It is the cosmetics industry that is now promoting the use of these alternatives in countries that currently require animal testing. 'It is a pity that Lush chose to run this campaign in a country where the testing of cosmetic products on animals is banned and which has the strictest animal welfare provisions regarding the use of animals for scientific purposes anywhere in the EU. 'It is a pity the campaign is directed at an industry that has done more than any other to develop and promote the use of alternatives.'","Jacqueline Traide force-fed and given injections at Lush's Regent St store .

Venus will be visible as a blot against the Sun in June in a rare 'transit' in front of the star - the phenomenon is so uncommon that the next one will be in 2117. The transits of Venus in front of the sun to calculate the distance from Earth to the sun in 1769 - using a method proposed by astronomer Edmond Halley, after whom the comet is named. On 5 and 6 June, Venus will appear as a small black dot on the Sun's surface in a rare transit, taking six hours to complete its journey. Venus transits in front of the sun in 2004: The orbits of the two planets are angled oddly, so the next transit won't be until 2117 . Transits of Venus occur only on the very rare occasions when Venus and the Earth are in a line with the Sun. At other times Venus passes below or above the Sun because the two orbits are at a slight angle to each other. Transits occur in pairs separated by eight years, with the gap between pairs of transits alternating between 105.5 and 121.5 years – the last transit was in 2004. In 1716, Edmond Halley proposed using a transit of Venus to predict the precise distance between the Earth and the Sun, known as the astronomical unit. As a result, hundreds of expeditions were sent all over the world to observe the 1761 and 1769 transits. A young James Cook took the Endeavour to the island of Tahiti, where he successfully observed the transit at a site that is still called Point Venus. Transits of Venus only occur when Venus and the Earth are in line with the Sun, as normally it passes below or above the Sun because the two orbits are at a slight angle to each other, reports journal Physics World. The journey usually occurs in pairs separated by eight years, with the gap between pairs of transits alternating between 105.5 and 121.5 years. The last transit happened in 2004. Massachusetts scientists are hoping the transit will confirm their theory about a phenomenon called 'the black-drop effect' - a strange, dark band linking Venus's silhouette with the sky outside the Sun that appears for about a minute, starting just as Venus first enters the solar disk. They will concentrate on observing Venus's atmosphere as it appears when the planet is only half on to the solar disk, believing observations will help astronomers who are looking for extrasolar planets orbiting stars other than the Sun. Jay Pasachoff, an astronomer at Williams . College, Massachusetts, said: ‘Doing so verifies that the techniques . for studying events on and around other stars hold true in our own . backyard. In 1769, teams of astronomers around the world used the transit of Venus to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Sun . ‘In other . words, by looking up close at transits in our solar system, we may be . able to see subtle effects that can help exoplanet hunters explain what . they are seeing when they view distant suns. 'We are fortunate in that we are truly living in a golden period of planetary transits and it is one of which I hope astronomers can take full advantage.’","Rare phenomenon will not be seen again for more than a century .

Authorities narrowed their focus to the water late Tuesday and called off the ground search for three-year-old Caleb Linn who disappeared over the weekend. He had tagged along with his aunt and several other children to help clear storm debris from a bridge at the 900-acre Kia Kima Boy Scout Camp, which his aunt was looking after while the regular caretaker was away. Desperate search: Caleb Linn, four, has been missing since Saturday from a boy scout camp in Arkansas . When five of the children left to go back to the cabin area around lunchtime, Caleb asked if he could follow. His aunt told him he could, but that he had to stick to the road, Fulton County Sheriff Buck Foley said. The last she saw of him before she turned around to resume her work, he said, Caleb was standing at the end of the bridge. Caleb's great-grandmother Carolyn Truex said: ‘You want them to find him, but you don't want them to find him if he's in the water.’ Hundreds of volunteers have turned out since Monday to help in the search, and divers cleared debris and took underwater photographs beneath the bridge. The weather since Saturday has been dry and unusually warm for March, lending hope to Caleb's chances of survival. Relatives led the search, fighting their way along sandy trails and through thorny branches that would snap back with a thwack as the small group charged on. Wooded area: The four-year-old boy was last seen by family members who were helping at a clean-up project on a bridge near the Kia Kima Boy Scout Camp in Fulton County . At one point, they came across the tattered rim of a baseball cap near a wet patch that looked like a child's footprints. They called for help, careful not to touch what might provide answers about Caleb's whereabouts. Word came a few minutes later: He wasn't wearing a hat. One of Caleb's uncles, Joey Dawson, swam to a small island in the middle of the river, just in case Caleb was stranded there but found nothing. Caleb, whose fourth birthday is . next month, was among 11 children on the bridge at the camp, about 120 . miles northeast of Little Rock. The children were not affiliated with the Boy Scouts but staying at the main campsite about half a mile from the bridge. The Fulton County Sheriff's Office said state police, local law enforcement and volunteers were scouring the area near the Missouri border along the Spring River. Sheriff Buck Foley said crews were clearing a log jam in the river near where Caleb was last seen. The sheriff said: 'He was on the concrete slab of the bridge at the last place they saw him.' Growing concern: Caleb Linn, four, was in the company of an aunt and uncle when he ran after older boys in his group to catch up and disappeared . Authorities had set a net downstream in case the boy had fallen into the river. However it was possible the body could have passed that point before the net was put up, said Major Todd Smith, the assistant chief of enforcement for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. 'It's like looking for a needle in the haystack,' Smith said. 'There's no way to search the whole river.' Smith said the river is clear but moving swiftly with water temperatures in the lower 60s. Caleb is three foot, six inches tall and . weighs about 41 pounds. He has short brown hair and was wearing an . orange jumper, orange short-sleeve T-shirt, blue jeans and . black trainers.","Caleb Linn 'ran after older boys and hasn't been seen since'

Police in Panama and the United States haven't identified Brian Brimager as a suspect as they investigate the case of Yvonne Baldelli, who was reportedly dating Mr Brimager. But Panama national police official Alexis Munoz said Sunday that Mr Brimager had raised investigators' interest. Panama police said Mr Brimager left Panama for Costa Rica and the United States some 10 days after last being seen with Ms Baldelli in November on the Bocas del Toro islands. Ms Baldelli's family reported her missing in January. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lovers in paradise: Ms Baldelli moved to Panama with Mr Brimager who used to be a Marine .

Munoz said witnesses reported the couple had a 'violent' relationship and frequently fought and argued. Panamanian officials said Mr Brimager was between the ages of 35 and 40 and had brought Ms Baldelli to the islands. Panamanian investigators and FBI . agents searched a hostel in Panama Friday for blood traces or other . signs of a California woman last seen there several months ago, an . official said. Searches on . land and by divers off the coast have turned up no sign of Ms Baldelli, 42, of Laguna Niguel, California.

Toro archipelago, a popular tourist spot where Ms Baldelli was last seen . on November 26. Authorities said they were looking for signs that Ms Baldelli may have been a victim of violence in the hotel. Ms Baldelli and her partner stayed at . the two-story hostel for about two months. Munoz said Ms Baldelli's family . had lost any contact with her at the end of November, 'which makes us . think that there may have been some crime against her.' Unresponsive: Ms Baldelli's parents last heard from her in November and became concerned when her boyfriend said she ran off to Costa Rica with another man . Together: Mr Brimager has since been named a 'person of interest' in her disappearance . The pair rented an apartment together on the Panamanian island of Carenero and Mr Brimager played guitar in local bars. Ms Baldelli's parents last heard from her by email in the end of November, but then nothing since. Mr . Brimager said that she had run away to Costa Rica and taken up with . another man, but her passport records do not register any travel to the . neighboring country. Her . family became concerned when Mr Brimager stopped answering their calls . and returned to California in December, shortly after her disappearance. Her sister Michelle Valenzuela said that she sensed that something bad was going to happen when she sister headed off to Panama, telling CBS that she had an 'ominous' feeling. Aside from her senses, the first tangible clue they had was when the weekly emails stopped coming. Making music: While in Panama, Mr Brimager played guitar in local bars . New beginning?

All cattle are descended from as few as 80 animals that were domesticated from wild ox in the Near East some 10,500 years ago, according to a new genetic study. An international team of scientists from University College London (UCL), the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) in France and the University of Mainz in Germany, were able to conduct the study by first extracting DNA from the bones of domestic cattle excavated in Iranian archaeological sites. These sites date to not long after the invention of farming and are in the region where cattle were first domesticated. Moo-st interesting: The ancestors of these Devon Friesian cows have been traced to Iran . The team examined how small differences in the DNA sequences of those ancient cattle, as well as cattle living today, could have arisen given different population histories. Using computer simulations they found that the DNA differences could only have arisen if a small number of animals, approximately 80, were domesticated from wild ox, or aurochs. Dr Ruth Bollongino of CNRS, France, and the University of Mainz, Germany and lead author of the study, said: ‘Getting reliable DNA sequences from remains found in cold environments is routine. ‘That is why mammoths were one of the first extinct species to have their DNA read. But getting reliable DNA from bones found in hot regions is much more difficult because temperature is so critical for DNA survival. This meant we had to be extremely careful that we did not end up reading contaminating DNA sequences from living, or only recently dead cattle.’ The number of animals domesticated has important implications for the archaeological study of domestication. Professor Mark Thomas, a UCL geneticist and an author of the study, said: ‘This is a surprisingly small number of cattle. We know from archaeological remains that the wild ancestors of modern-day cattle, known as aurochs, were common throughout Asia and Europe, so there would have been plenty of opportunities to capture and domesticate them.’ Professor Joachim Burger, an author of the study based at the University of Mainz, Germany, said: ‘Wild aurochs are very different beasts from modern domestic cattle. Study: DNA samples were taken from archaeological sites in Iran . ‘They were much bigger than modern cattle, and wouldn’t have had the domestic traits we see today, such as docility. 'So capturing these animals in the first place would not have been easy, and even if some people did manage to snare them alive, their continued management and breeding would still have presented considerable challenges until they had been bred for smaller size and more docile behaviour.’ Archaeological studies on the number and size of prehistoric animal bone have shown that not only cattle, but also goats, sheep and pigs were all first domesticated in the Near East. But saying how many animals were domesticated for any of those species is a much harder question to answer. Classical techniques in archaeology cannot give us the whole picture, but genetics can help - especially if some of the genetic data comes from early domestic animals. Dr Jean-Denis Vigne, a CNRS bio-archaeologist and author on the study, said: ‘In this study genetic analysis allowed us to answer questions that – until now – archaeologists would not even attempt to address. ‘A small number of cattle progenitors is consistent with the restricted area for which archaeologists have evidence for early cattle domestication 10,500 years ago.’ The study is published in the current issue of the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution.",The samples were found in Iranian archaeological sites .

For the first time, that distinction belongs to a 13-year-old Chinese company called PetroChina. The Beijing company was created by the Chinese government to secure more oil for that nation's booming economy. PetroChina announced Thursday that it pumped 2.4 million barrels a day last year, surpassing Exxon by 100,000. The company has grown rapidly over the last decade by squeezing more from China's aging oil fields and outspending Western companies to acquire more petroleum reserves in places like Canada, Iraq and Qatar. It's motivated by a need to lock up as much oil as possible. PetroChina announced Thursday that it pumped 2.4 million barrels a day last year, surpassing Exxon by 100,000 . PetroChina's output increased 3.3 percent in 2011 while Exxon's fell 5 percent . The company's output increased 3.3 percent in 2011 while Exxon's fell 5 percent. Exxon's oil production also fell behind Rosneft, the Russian energy company. PetroChina's rise highlights a fundamental difference in how the largest petroleum companies plan to supply the world as new deposits become tougher to find and more expensive to produce. Every major oil company has aggressively pursued new finds to replace their current wells. But analysts say Western oil firms like Exxon Mobil have been more conservative than the Chinese, mindful of their bottom line and investor returns. With oil prices up 19 percent in 2011, they still made money without increasing production. Analysts say Western oil firms like Exxon Mobil have been more conservative than the Chinese . PetroChina Co. Ltd. has a different mission. The Chinese government owns 86 percent of its stock and the nation uses nearly every drop of oil PetroChina pumps. Its appetite for gasoline and other petroleum products is projected to double between 2010 and 2035. ""There's a lot of anxiety in China about the energy question,"" says energy historian Dan Yergin. ""It's just growing so fast."" While PetroChina sits atop other publicly traded companies in oil production, it falls well short of national oil companies like Saudi Aramco, which produces nearly 8 million barrels a day. 20111: PetroChina Co. Ltd. (China)2: Rosneft (Russia)3: Exxon Mobil Corp. (USA)4: Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Brazil)5: BP PLC (United Kingdom)20101: Exxon Mobil Corp. (USA)2: BP PLC (United Kingdom)3: PetroChina Co. Ltd. (China)4: Rosneft (Russia)5: Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Brazil) And Exxon is still the biggest publicly traded energy company when counting combined output of oil and natural gas. PetroChina ranks third behind Exxon and BP in total output of oil and natural gas. PetroChina is looking to build on its momentum in 2012. ""We must push ahead,"" PetroChina chairman Jiang Jiemin said in January. PetroChina has grown by pumping . everything it can from reserves in China, estimated to contain more than . 6.5 billion barrels. It drilled thousands of oil wells across vast . stretches of the nation's northern grasslands. Some . of those fields are ancient by industry standards, dating close to the . beginning of China's communist government in the 1950s. The . commitment to aging fields distinguishes PetroChina from its biggest . Western rivals. Exxon and other major oil companies typically sell their . aging, low-performing fields, or they put them out of commission. PetroChina . also has been on a buying spree, acquiring new reserves in Iraq, . Australia, Africa, Qatar and Canada. Since 2010, its acquisitions have totaled $7 billion, about twice as much as Exxon, according to data provider Dealogic. Several other Chinese companies have become deal makers around the globe as well. Total acquisitions by Chinese energy firms jumped from less than $2 billion between 2002 and 2003 to nearly $48 billion in 2009 and 2010, according to the International Energy Agency. More times than not, the companies are paying above the industry average to get those deals done. It's making some in the West nervous. In 2005, for example, CNOOC Ltd., a company mostly owned by the Chinese government tried to buy American oil producer Unocal. U.S. lawmakers worked to block the deal, asking President Bush to investigate the role the Chinese central government played in the process. Chevron Corp. eventually bought Unocal for $17.3 billion. ""There's a resistance to Chinese investment in (U.S.) oil and gas,"" Morningstar analyst Robert Bellinski says. ""It's like how Japan was to us in the 1980s. People think they're going to take us over. They're going to buy all of our resources."" PetroChina has been on a buying spree. Since 2010, its acquisitions have totaled $7 billion, about twice as much as Exxon . That's unlikely to happen. It doesn't make economic sense to export oil away from the world's largest oil consumer. But the Chinese could make it tougher for Big Oil to generate returns for their shareholders. China's oil companies have been willing to outspend everyone and that drives up the price of fields and makes it more expensive for everyone to expand. ""You now have to outbid them,"" says Argus Research analyst Phil Weiss. ""If you can't, you're going to have access to fewer assets."" Longer term, Chinese expansion globally will bring benefits to the U.S. and other economies. By developing as many oil wells as possible — especially in Africa, Iraq and other politically unstable regions — China will help expand supply. ""Frankly, the more risk-hungry producers there are, the more oil will be on the market, and the cheaper prices are,"" says Michael Levi, an energy policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. Despite its swift expansion, PetroChina and other Chinese companies still have much to prove to investors, analysts say. PetroChina's parent, China National Petroleum Corp., for example, has spent millions of dollars in Sudan to provide highways, medical facilities and shuttle buses for the elderly. Oil companies typically don't do that. All of that increases the cost of business and minimizes the returns for shareholders. In 2009 and 2010, PetroChina's profit margins for its exploration and production business were only about two-thirds that of Exxon Mobil's. Its stock price has climbed less than 1 percent, in the past year, compared with a 3.7 percent rise in the stock of Exxon Mobil Corp. ""You have to ask yourself: What is the purpose of PetroChina?"" Bellinski says. ""It is to fuel China. That's it. Although they're a public company, I'm very skeptical that they have any interest in shareholder value creation.""","PetroChina surpases Exxon oil production by 100,000 barrels .

Jailed: Zack Thompson, 20, maintained his sleepwalking defence for two-and-a-half years before finally admitting he raped the girl at a Portuguese holiday resort in 2009 . A rapist who claimed he was sleepwalking when he carried out a sex attack was finally jailed yesterday after admitting his defence was untrue. Zack Thompson, 20, had maintained for two-and-a-half years that he had no recollection of raping a fellow holidaymaker in Portugal in 2009. He finally changed his plea to guilty after psychologist Dr Mark Pressman, a U.S. expert in sleep-related disorders brought in to examine the evidence and interview Thompson, concluded his amnesia was down to the effects of excessive drinking and not sleepwalking. It is thought to be the first time a sleepwalking defence has been successfully challenged in a sex case dealt with by UK courts. In several cases, juries have cleared a defendant on the basis that he was sleepwalking (see panel below). Jailing Thompson for six years yesterday, Judge John Milmo QC said his crime had a devastating effect on the victim, who was 17 at the time of the attack. ‘She said “I did nothing wrong”, and she was absolutely right,’ added the judge. ‘I only hope today will mark an occasion when she can go back to being the happy young girl she used to be.’ Nottingham Crown Court heard Thompson attacked the girl in the early hours of a September morning after they had been drinking in the Algarve town of Albufeira, where they were on holiday. The victim, now 19, flew home the next day and reported the attack to her local police. Thompson, 18 at the time, handed himself in to police at his local station in Newark, Nottinghamshire, when he returned to the UK. He claimed the pair had been drinking and were both ‘wobbly’ and he ‘couldn’t remember’ what had happened. He did not deny committing the act, but refused to take criminal responsibility because he said he was sleepwalking and had no memory of what had happened. Nottinghamshire Police, who agreed with their counterparts in Portugal that they would lead the investigation because both victim and suspect were back in the UK, spent months seeking expert advice about Thompson’s sleepwalking defence. The National Policing Improvement Agency eventually put lead investigator DC Paula Winfield in touch with Dr Pressman at the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research in Pennsylvania. Holiday from hell: Prosecutor Dawn Pritchard said Thompson raped the girl while they were both on holiday in Albufeira, Portugal on September 12, 2009 . Guilty: Thompson finally pleaded guilty to the rape at a hearing at Nottingham Crown Court earlier this month after maintaining he had been sleepwalking and then 'insane' when he carried out the act . He found Thompson’s behaviour was not . consistent with that normally displayed by sleepwalkers, and concluded . his memory loss was likely to have been the result of excessive alcohol . consumption. Thompson withdrew the sleepwalking defence, but then claimed he was insane at the time of the attack. He finally pleaded guilty earlier this month after a psychiatrist rejected his claim of insanity. He was placed on the sex offenders . register for life. The court heard the victim, who was present to see . him jailed, was on anti-depressants and had put her ambition to become a . midwife on hold. After the hearing, she and her family . said in a statement that while they had often felt like dropping the . case through frustration and exhaustion, ‘we knew there was no other . option if we were to achieve justice and prevent the same thing from . happening to someone else in the future’. DC Winfield said: ‘We hope this . conviction sends out the message that sleepwalking can no longer be a . safe defence in cases of rape.’","Zack Thompson finally withdrew the sleepwalking defence after it was successfully challenged .

Sinangele Asuza, 78, was struck by a light aircraft on Monday as it came in to land in the town of Ermelo in South Africa's eastern Mpumalanga province. Police said they believed she was one of three women who had scaled a perimeter fence to collect wood from around the airfield. Tragic: An elderly woman was sliced in two when she was hit by a Mooney light aircraft, similar to this one, as she tried to take a short cut across a runway in Ermelo in South Africa's eastern Mpumalanga province on Monday . Spokeswoman Carla Prinsloo said the pensioner died instantly after being sliced in half by the plane's left wing. She said: 'It was a totally awful incident. The women live nearby and were apparently collecting wood from close to the airfield when the three decided to take a shortcut over the runway. 'The plane was coming in to land at the same time and the women thought they could get across in time. 'However, the old lady misjudged the distance and was struck by the plane's wing. 'She was literally sliced into two and died at the scene.' Officials are today probing the horrific accident, which happened in broad daylight at 11.30am on Monday. Captain Prinsloo said experienced pilot Malcolm Wushard was approaching the runway when he spotted the three women near the runway. She added: 'The pilot did all he could to avoid the collision but sadly there was little he could do.' Mr Wushard was not hurt in the incident but is believed to be suffering from shock. His aircraft was badly damaged on its left wing and wheel. Location: The pensioner died instantly after being struck by the plane's left wing . It is thought the trio misjudged their distance from the Mooney light aircraft as they tried to dash across the tarmac. Officials confirmed Mrs Asuza's family had been informed of the tragedy and had identified her body. Captain Prinsloo said police believed local people regularly use the airfield as a short cut. She said: 'This is first time that we have ever had a tragedy like this, but people often use the runway as a short cut to the village. 'This sadly goes to show how dangerous it can be to do so.

"By . Matt Blake . UPDATED: . 16:36 EST, 7 March 2012 . A 'thoroughly deceitful' benefit cheat . was jailed today after he was secretly filmed playing golf - despite . claiming he could barely walk. Robert Cave told the Department of . Work and Pensions that a degenerative condition meant he struggled to . carry out minor tasks such as lifting pans from the cooker to the sink. But a court heard that in reality, the . 50-year-old was enjoying rounds of golf two or three times a week at . his £600 per year club, regularly taking part in competitions, and had . got his handicap down to an impressive 15 - on a 3.8-mile golf course. Cave first applied for disability benefit in 1996 he said walking was extremely painful and it took him two minutes to walk 10 yards. He also claimed it took him 10-15 minutes to lever himself out of bed. Scroll down for video . Cheat: Robert Cave has been warned by a judge that he faces jail after he was secretly filmed playing golf while claiming disability benefit . Energetic: Cave, 50, looks like he has the perfect swing as he goes to hit the golf ball. He had previously claimed that walking was extremely painful and it took him two minutes to walk 10 yards . Good shot: A court heard that Cave played golf two or three times a week, had a handicap of 15 and regularly played in competitions . In 2007 he reported he could not walk more than 50 metres without stopping and found it hard to lift pans from the cooker to the sink. But following a tip-off, Department of Works and Pensions investigators began to monitor Cave. That led to him being secretly filmed playing at the 18-hole Norwood Park golf course, Southwell, Nottinghamshire, in October, 2009. A video played in court had showed him hitting balls on the driving range and on the third hole of the course, which is  3.8 miles in length. Ninety per cent of the time he used a buggy to get round the course. Judge Andrew Hamilton, sentencing, said the case was one of the worst he had dealt with. He added: 'He is thoroughly deceitful . and dishonest man. You don’t get a golf handicap of 15 overnight. He . must have been playing regularly over a long period of time to do that. 'I think this is a most flagrant . breach. I can’t imagine a more flagrant breach. I can imagine the public . annoyance and fury at the disgraceful dishonesty of this man. It is . utterly appalling.' Leisure time: Cave was secretly filmed playing at the 18-hole Norwood Park golf course in Nottinghamshire. The entire course is 3.8 miles in length . Cave, 50, earlier pleaded guilty at . Nottingham Crown Court to failing to notify an improvement in his . capabilities between April 2006 and January 2010. During that time he pocketed £12,500 in disability living allowance. Judge Hamilton also poured scorn on . Cave’s claim that his condition was causing his elbows to crumble, . adding: 'A golf club requires considerable use of an elbow, both of . them.' Cave was also filmed lifting garden fence panels outside his home in Mansfield and carrying flattened boxes to his car. Judge Hamilton also poured scorn on . Cave’s claim that his condition was causing his elbows to crumble, . adding: 'A golf club requires considerable use of an elbow, both of . them.' And he hit out at the sentencing . guidelines for the scale of offending in Cave’s case, describing them as . 'horrendously low'. Judge Hamilton said the maximum sentence he would . have bee able to impose was 26 weeks in jail, with a 10 percent . reduction for a guilty plea. John Hallissey, prosecuting, told the . court that since making his original claim, the DWP asked Cave every . year if there had been any change in circumstance that might affect his . entitlement to benefits. However, he failed to tell them that . his condition had improved thanks to the use of physiotherapy and . steroids. In 2007, he filled in a new claim form in which he said he . could walk for no further than 10 yards. In the dock: Cave pleaded guilty at Nottingham Crown Court, pictured, for failing to notify an improvement in his capabilities between April 2006 and January 2010. He pocketed £12,500 in disability living allowance during this time . The DWP launched a covert . investigation into Cave two years later following the tip-off. In August . 2009, he was seen at his home in Mansfield, Notts, lifting boxes and . fence panels, and loading a golf trolley into his car boot. Then, weeks later, he was secretly recorded at Norwood Park Golf Centre near Southwell, Notts. Mr Hallissey said: 'He was filmed . removing a golf cart from the boot of his car. He was filmed initially . on the driving range practicising his swing and then on the third tee . standing on one leg, bending over, and picking up his tee after making . his shot.' After his arrest Cave, a married father of two, admitted he played golf and competed regularly. He pleaded guilty to failing to notify . the DWP to a change in his circumstances between April 2006 and January . 2010. During that time he claimed £12.604. Laura Pitman, defending, said there was medical evidence Cave’s condition had worsened, and he hadn’t played golf for two years. She added that he now admitted he should have told the DWP that his illness had previously improved. Speaking after the case Sian Fellowes, . a senior benefit fraud manager at the DWP, said: 'We will be looking at . recovering the money through seizure of his assets and that will . include his house and any money he may have.' A confiscation hearing will be held in May. At the time of Cave’s guilty plea last . month, Welfare Reform Minister Lord Freud said: 'It’s cases like these . that show us why welfare reform is needed. 'We have a duty to the taxpayer and our customers to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them. 'Benefit fraud takes money away from . the most vulnerable. It is a crime and we are committed to stopping it . by catching criminals at the front line and making sure our reforms make . the benefit system less open to abuse.","Robert Cave claimed walking was 'extremely painful' and it took him 10-15 minutes to get out of bed .

"By . Laura Clark . PUBLISHED: . 23:25 EST, 28 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:47 EST, 29 March 2012 . Thousands of well-qualified students face being denied places at popular universities as deep cuts are announced in the numbers they are allowed to recruit. Three quarters of universities face losing up to 900 first-year undergraduates compared with last year. The recruitment limits for courses beginning in the autumn were announced as the Coalition battles to rein in the soaring costs of offering student loans to cover tuition fees of up to £9,000-a-year. Cuts: Thousands of students face missing out on places at their chosen university . University bosses condemned the squeeze on places at a time of soaring youth unemployment and warned that talented students now face missing out on places at sought-after universities. Figures published yesterday by the Higher Education Funding Council suggest that 98 out of 129 universities face a cut in their first-year student numbers this autumn. Some 34 institutions face losing at least 10 per cent of their numbers compared with last year, including the University of East London with 12.6 per cent. Universities have an opportunity to counter the projected cut in student numbers by targeting applicants with AAB grades or better at A-level. This is because ministers have relaxed recruitment quotas for applicants with these grades, allowing universities to give places to as many as they can attract. But only the most elite institutions are expected to gain significant numbers of students in this way. University of East London is set to lose 12.6 per cent of it's student intake in September . Many leading institutions currently stand to see a drop in their first-year intake unless they aggressively recruit students with AAB grades or better. These include some in the prestigious Russell and 1994 groups of institutions, such as Liverpool, with an estimated cut of 6.4 per cent, Leeds with 5.1 per cent, Newcastle with 4.9 per cent and Manchester with 4.6 per cent. Under a Coalition policy aimed at driving down student fees, about 10,000 places have been redistributed to local further education colleges. The Oxford and Cherwell Valley College, for example, will see a massive 1,867 per cent increase in places. But fears were raised last night that bright applicants who miss the AAB grade threshold could find it more difficult to win places. Universities are thought to be making fewer initial offers at these lower grades. All offers that have already been made will be respected but institutions will have less leeway to help borderline candidates who just miss their conditional offers. Universities can counter the projected cut in student numbers by targeting applicants with AAB grades or better at A-level . Professor Michael Farthing, vice-chancellor of the University of Sussex, said: 'The information released today rubber stamps the fact that many excellent students will be denied places at their first choice universities.' He criticised a 'push to cut-price education' after 20,000 degree course places were stripped from universities and diverted to institutions charging the lowest fees. 'Furthermore, with uncapped student places restricted only to applicants with A-level grades of AAB or above there is every chance that some excellent institutions will lose further places,' he added. 'There are only so many AAB students to go around and they are likely to be snapped up by a few self-declared ""elite"" institutions, able to rely on historical brand prestige to attract applications. 'Any university losing AAB students will not be allowed to take on students with different grades, such as two Bs and an A, to take their place. 'This means that many talented students will be denied places at highly regarded universities.' Minister for Universities and Science The Rt Hon David Willetts MP has defended the policy . Professor Farthing, who is chairman of the so-called 1994 group of institutions, added: 'Restricting competition only to self-selecting elites and cut-price providers reduces the level of choice available to the vast majority of students.' In total, there will be 10,910 fewer places available in universities and colleges than in 2011. The forecast student numbers for 2012 assume universities maintain their share of students with AAB grades, or the equivalent for other qualifications. Institutions face even more severe cuts if they lose these top students to rivals seeking to shore up their own numbers. Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol, Durham and Imperial College London are among those estimated to see an increase in places. This is partly because they have been granted a share of 1,000 places aimed at poorer applicants who miss out on top AAB grades. Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: 'At a time when record numbers of people are out of work, the government should be making it easier for people to access education. 'Axing grants for college students, tripling university fees and slashing teaching budgets and student places is exactly what the government should not be doing.' Universities Minister David Willetts said: 'We want a student-focused higher education sector, more choice over where to study and a renewed focus on the quality of the student experience. 'That's why we're freeing up centralised number controls, improving information for prospective students and driving a new focus on the academic experience.' Recent figures suggest that taxpayers will be burdened with £191billion of debt as the Government subsidises student loans to cover fees of up to £9,000-a-year and living costs. Officials have estimated that the amount lent to students will balloon to record levels by 2047 before the Treasury starts to recoup the losses from graduates.","98 out of 129 universities face a cut in their first-year student number .

Resignation: Mr Phillips will step down to make way for a full-scale reshaping of his troubled organisation, the Equality and Human Rights Commission . The chief of the state equality quango, former Labour politician Trevor Phillips, is to leave his job this summer, it was revealed yesterday. Mr Phillips will step down to make way for a full-scale reshaping of his troubled organisation, the Equality and Human Rights Commission. A report from the Commission confirmed that it is to get a new leader whose task will be to ‘increase our impact and deliver better value for money.’ The departure of Mr Phillips, who earns £112,000 a year for a three-and-a-half day week, is likely to ease tensions between the quango and Coalition ministers. In recent months Home Secretary Theresa May has published a highly critical report about the Commission, stripped it of its right to make its own grants of state money, and made severe cuts to its funding. The 58-year-old chair of the EHRC was chosen by Tony Blair to head Labour’s newly-created equality superquango in 2006. Mr Phillips was re-appointed to the Commission three years later by then Equality Minister Harriet Harman, despite growing controversy over the style of his leadership. In recent years a number of commissioners have quit alleging management failings and there have been a series of concerns over the way money has been spent. The Commission has also been troubled by clashes between the different interest groups it is supposed to represent. Criticism: In recent months Home Secretary Theresa May has published a highly critical report about the Commission . Christians in particular have been angered by the way it has backed legal test cases which campaigners say erode the right to abide by Christian beliefs. Notably the . Commission backed a same-sex couple who successfully sued a Christian couple for refusing them a double room in their guest house. Mrs May published a report last year which said the Commission had given away £10 million a year in grants to equality groups without knowing where much of the money went, and that it ran an advice helpline that helped just 73 people in a year at a cost of £5,000 each. She said of the organisation: 'Unfortunately, since its establishment the Commission has struggled to deliver against its remit and provide value for money.’ Mr Phillips is expected to quit when his contract runs out in September. Ministers are understood to have been engaged in attempts to identify and recruit a successor. A report from the Commission yesterday said that in future it will have to operate on little more than a third of the money Labour lavished on it when it was launched as a successor to three separate earlier equality quangos. It will have £26.8 million a year to spend by 2015 as opposed to a £70 million a year budget under Labour. After the 2005 London bombings he warned that the country was 'sleepwalking towards segregation' The ‘strategic plan’ published yesterday said: ‘During 2012, we will see the Government’s conclusions to their consultation on reform of the Commission, including possible legislative changes to our powers and functions, the appointment of a new chair, and possible other changes to the board.’ Mr Phillips became a Labour politician and then a front man for Tony Blair¿s government as it tried to deal with ethnic and religious tensions . It added that the changes will ‘provide space for the Commission’s new leadership to return to the strategy and complete the picture.’ In future ‘building productive relationships with a range of government bodies will be a priority,’ the report said. ‘Learning from the past, we have not sought to be all things to all people in this strategy. Our decision to focus on doing fewer things well will mean we should increase our impact and deliver better value for money.’ Mr Phillips is a former television executive who became a Labour politician and then a front man for Tony Blair’s government as it tried to deal with ethnic and religious tensions. A anti-racist campaigner once linked with multicultural ideas – a report from a charity linked to Mr Phillips once suggested the word British was racist – he became a Labour politician in London. However he dropped his ambitions for a political career, with one possible reason being antipathy in the Labour Party to his decision to send his two daughters to an independent school. He became head of the Commission for Racial Equality in 2003 and went on to the EHRC. Mr Phillips was a central figure in the retreat from multiculturalism – the left-wing doctrine which encouraged migrants to keep their own culture rather than integrate into British ways. After the 2005 London bombings he warned that the country was ‘sleepwalking towards segregation.'","The departure of Mr Phillips is likely to ease .

"By . Andy Dolan . UPDATED: . 19:50 EST, 2 March 2012 . Losing a camera on holiday is bad enough – but at least it can be replaced. What is more distressing for most of us is the loss of all the precious images it contains. Holidaymakers Mary Stallard and Andrew Sully certainly thought they would never again see the 100 or so pictures on their digital camera when it sank in a French river. Minutes before disaster struck: The couple's daughters Joanna, 15, front left, and Cerys, 12, back right, canoeing down the Dordogne before their camera was lost in the river . Happy memories: One of the last family pictures taken before they lost their camera in the river Dordogne . But the husband and wife, both vicars, . had reckoned without the intervention of scuba diver Kevin Quirin who . chanced upon the device in the murky depths of the river a fortnight . later. The Frenchman not only recovered the . £100 camera from the bed of the Dordogne River but, in a remarkable . piece of detective work, used clues in the pictures on the undamaged . memory card to reunite them with their owners. Super sleuth: Kevin Quirin who managed to track the couple down by viewing the pictures on their lost camera memory card . Mr Quirin, 23, a maths student, managed to track down the couple after downloading and studying their photos. He deduced 44-year-old Mr Sully’s surname after finding two pictures of him next to signs bearing the word ‘Sully’. He also found pictures of him at the end of a London to Paris charity bike ride last July. Mr Quirin, from Rennes, Brittany, . searched the event on the charity donation website JustGiving and found . the name of Andrew Sully, with contact details. He emailed the family: ‘I think I’ve found your camera’, and then forwarded the 100 holiday photos. The vicars, from Llangollen near . Wrexham, North Wales, lost their camera when the canoe they were . paddling down the river with children Joanna, 15, and Cerys, 12, . capsized. Mrs Stallard, 45, a school chaplain, . said: ‘Not only did Kevin find our camera but then he managed to track . us down. What he did was quite amazing. We are delighted we have got our . photographs back.’ After Mr Sully completed his charity . bike ride in Paris, the family travelled south to the Dordogne but . during a leisurely afternoon on the river, their hired canoe rolled over . after hitting a bridge at Pinsac. The first clue: Kevin surmised that Andrew's surname was Sully after viewing this picture of him and his two daughters next to Pont Sully in Paris . Second clue: And if Kevin had any doubts, this second picture of Andrew at the Sully wing of the Louvre in Paris proved he was on the right track . Third clue: After seeing this picture of Andrew's charity bike ride to Paris, Kevin checked the justgiving website for the surname Sully and found his donation page, providing the final link needed for him to contact the vicar . Andrew and Mary Sully, pictured with their daughters Joanna and Cerys in Paris, thought they would never see their holiday photos again . Mrs Stallard said: ‘Andrew dived down . to see if he could retrieve the camera but he couldn’t see anything . because the water was  murky. There was also a strong current so he gave . up quite quickly. ‘We returned home after a few days and . then, out of the blue, we received an email a couple of weeks later . from a guy in France saying he had found our camera.’ Mr Quirin had been enjoying a barge . holiday with friends when they decided to go scuba diving in the river. Two of the images that helped him identify the camera’s owners were . snaps of Mr Sully posing in the Sully wing of the Louvre gallery and on . the Pont de Sully over the River Seine in Paris. Mr Quirin said: ‘I was scuba diving when I saw this shiny thing and grabbed it. ‘The camera didn’t work but the card was OK and after I dried it out I put it into my PC.’","Camera sank to the bottom of the Dordogne after family's boat capsized .

Clayton Frederick Osbon, pictured being escorted by FBI agents, has been indicted on one count of interference of a flight crew - the same charge he's been held on since shortly after the March 27 incident on a Las Vegas bound flight . Clayton Osbon, pictured left after being removed from the flight in restraints, and right, in his hometown, lost his father Ronald in a plane crash in April, 1995 . The veteran pilot, pictured, who has been a JetBlue captain for 12 years, started flying as a teenager with his father Ronald . Witnesses say Osbon ran through the cabin yelling about Jesus and al-Qaida, before four passengers wrestled the captain to the floor. They . restrained him with seat belt extenders and zip tie handcuffs while the . first officer diverted the flight to land in Amarillo. Osbon is undergoing a court-ordered psychiatric exam to determine whether he was legally sane and can stand trial. Under . federal law, a conviction for interfering with a flight crew can bring . up to 20 years in prison. The offense is defined as assaulting or . intimidating the crew, interfering with its duties or diminishing its . ability to operate the plane. Investigators . say Osbon told his co-pilot, 'things just don't matter', and rambled . incoherently about religion shortly after the flight departed from New . York. His behavior became more erratic as the flight wore on, . prosecutors say, and ended with the tense struggle in the cabin. Passengers . said the pilot seemed disoriented, jittery and constantly sipped water . when he first stormed from the cockpit and marched through the cabin. Then, they said, he began to rant about threats linked to Iran, Iraq and . Afghanistan after crew members tried to calm him down at the back of . the plane.

Osbon has been married to his wife Connye since 2005, according to the pilot's Facebook page. But witness accounts tell of a . disturbed man, who about three hours into the flight, began behaving . erratically, randomly talking with passengers on his way back to the . cockpit before discovering he had been locked out after Dowd changed the . security code behind him.

Politicians will be able to put the tablet computers on expenses if they give up one of their old pieces of computer kit in return. Around 350 MPs who sit in the House of Commons on select committees will be offered the devices without having to trade. Must-have: The Commons commission says MPs on select committees need Apple's flagship gadget to save paper and cut costs . Buying an iPad for every single MP in the Commons could cost as much as £430,000 – not including monthly subscription charges to access the internet on the move. But the House of Commons commission, led by Speaker John Bercow, insisted the move would cut costs and save paper. Modernisation: Speaker John Bercow led the commission that ruled around 350 MPs should be given the tablet computers for free . The Commons authorities changed the rules . last year to allow MPs to use iPads and BlackBerrys in the Commons . chamber so that they can surf the web and check emails during debates. In October, David Heath, deputy leader of the Commons, became the first minister to use an iPad at the despatch box. Freedom of Information requests have revealed that 70 MPs have already claimed on their expenses accounts for the devices, which sell for between £400 and £660. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which is in charge of allowances, originally turned down the request, but backed down on appeal. Early last year, some 16 MPs began a  trial to find out whether using iPads could improve Parliament’s way of working. Last month, the Commons Administration Committee concluded that the devices would reduce paperwork and even end up saving the taxpayer money. It recommended the ‘rapid roll-out of suitable mobile tablet hardware’ to all 650 MPs. Early adopter: Deputy Leader of the House of Commons David Heath became the first minister to use an iPad in the despatch box in October . The House of Lords is also considering similar moves to give free iPads to its members. Ten peers have taken part in a similar trial, at a cost of more than £4,900. The Commission insisted the scheme would save money while reducing ‘expenditure on paper and reprographics and improve environmental performance’. The body also said the move to allow MPs to exchange their laptops for an iPad would save £50,000 on the cost of replacing laptops for other staff. It added: ‘Further work would be . undertaken to ascertain the level of additional savings which could be . realised by wider use of iPads for MPs. 'These measures would be kept . under review to assess the impact on parliamentary effectiveness and . value for money.’ But Emma Boon, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘With the public finances in such a mess, the last thing taxpayers want is to fork out for a new toy for MPs. 'It might start with those on select committees but it’s bound to be rolled out across the Commons soon. ‘It’s a perfectly good intention to want to modernise Parliament, save paper and cut costs, but an iPad is a premium product, which means it comes with a premium price tag. ‘It’s good to see an initiative to get members to swap laptops for iPads, so taxpayers don’t pay for both, but there is no reason not to look at other, cheaper alternatives.’","Commons commission led by Speaker John Bercow insists the move would cut costs and save paper .

Historically, 191 has proved to be a tragic flight number, a blogger at the Wall Street Journal points out.

Six years earlier, American Airlines retired the same flight number after one of its DC-10s crashed shortly after take-off from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, killing 271 aboard and two people on the ground. Until the September 11 terrorist attacks, it was the deadliest air disaster in U.S. aviation history and led to the grounding of all DC-10s until technical problems were resolved.

Edward Wright, 52, was jailed for repeatedly sexually abusing three boys worked with vulnerable children . A pervert jailed for sexually abusing three boys worked with vulnerable children for six years after police checks failed to spot he had been convicted of spanking children. Edward Wright, 52, received a caution for indecently assaulting youngsters aged 12 and 16 by smacking them in 1993. But the incident was not reported in a police Criminal Records Bureau check. The sex attacks should have seen Wright immediately rejected by Westminster's Youth Service in central London. But the CRB check came back clear and the sexual predator was able to work with children aged as young as seven until he was arrested last year. Police and former work colleagues now fear Wright may have abused more children in his care and urged any victims to come forward. The Metropolitan Police has blamed 'human error' for failing to spot Wright's caution. A Met Police spokeswoman said: 'Though the record of the caution was located during the vetting process, it was not passed to the disclosure team for further consideration.' Wright was caged for six-and-a-half years yesterday for repeatedly assaulting three little boys between 1986 and 1994. All three of the paedophile's victims, including two brothers, went on to become drink and drug abusers, while one of them is now serving a life sentence for murder, the Old Bailey heard. Wright, of Streatham, south London, was convicted of three counts of buggery, having already admitted possessing a 'large number' of pornographic images of children. There are no formal allegations of child abuse during his time working for Westminster between 2005 and 2011. But the council said Wright was officially cautioned for inappropriate behaviour after he offered a child a lift outside of work hours. Wright's sex attacks should have seen him immediately rejected by Westminster's Youth Service in central London, but they were not picked up in his CRB check . One of his former colleagues at Westminster said he feared he may have abused other youngsters. The outraged man, who did not want to be named, said: 'My worst fear is that he has done things to young people that we knew and Westminster allowed it to happen. 'We raised concerns about his inappropriate behaviour but they were swept under the carpet. 'A lot of us didn't trust him around young people but he was still able to take children on trips away.' Westminster's director of family services, James Thomas, said the council acted promptly to suspend Wright in February 2011 and was 'deeply shocked to learn of the allegations against him'. Mr Thomas said 'no Westminster young person has been identified as a victim' but the council continues to work closely with police. A police spokeswoman said 'refresher training' had been introduced for staff. Detective Inspector Justin Armstrong said: 'It is possible he may have committed further crimes.'","Edward Wright's sex attacks should have seen him immediately rejected by Westminster Youth Service .

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 10:07 EST, 2 February 2012 . A decorated RAF Chinook pilot sexually assaulted a woman in bed after a Christmas party, a court heard today. Squadron Leader Kai Mcnaughton, 42, who has completed seven tours of duty in Afghanistan, went into the woman’s bedroom as his wife and her husband were downstairs at the party, Winchester Crown Court heard. The jury were told he put his hand under the covers to touch her intimately before she performed a sex act on him - wrongly believing it was her husband. Sex assault: Kai Mcnaughton (left) touched a woman inappropriately at a Christmas party while his wife Claire (right) was asleep upstairs, a court heard . When the alleged victim, aged in her 40s, realised it was not her partner who had been in the room she punched the Squadron Leader. The woman and her husband packed up and later called the police. The alleged victim told the court today she did not consent to the man's advances and denied she had flirted with him during the evening. Fearing his wife Claire would kick him out, Mcnaughton initially told her and the police that he had gone into the room but had only performed a sex act on himself. Only later did he confess that he touched the woman - and he said she had touched him voluntarily, the court heard. Mcnaughton, who has been in the RAF for 20 years and has been mentioned in dispatches for his service, said he thought she was awake and had consented to the activity because they had two 'drunken snogs' earlier. Decorated pilot: Squadron Leader Kai Mcnaughton, 42, pictured today with his wife Claire, denies sexually assaulting a woman at a party. The court was told the couple had an unhappy marriage and they have since split up . The court was told that Mcnaughton, who is based at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, has now separated from his wife. He told the jury he had danced and been flirting with the woman at the party in December 2010. 'I said she looked great, she had lost some weight. I said she looked hot, those were my words, and she liked them, smiled and carried on dancing,' he told the jury. He said the woman kissed him 'all over his face' while their partners were in the room. The two then decided to leave their other halves downstairs and go to separate bedrooms to sleep, Mcnaughton said. He told the jury that he went into the woman's room to hand her a glass of water. Mcnaughton . said: 'I went to give her a goodnight kiss and a long hug turned into a . long kiss. Not open-mouthed - a drunken snog is what I would call it. Veteran: Squadron Leader Kai Mcnaughton, 42, was based at RAF Odiham, in Hampshire, pictured. he has completed seven tours of duty in Afghanistan . Accused: Squadron Leader Kai Mcnaughton, who is on trial at Winchester Crown Court, claims the victim consented to his advances and denies any wrongdoing . 'I asked her if she wanted a back massage. She said, ""No, we’d better not"". I read from that she didn’t want to do anything on that occasion in terms of a back massage. 'She gave me a gentle prod good-naturedly. 'I was very pleased. I felt she was attracted to me sexually. I was thinking we could potentially have an affair with each other. I felt it was something we could take further. I was unhappy in my marriage.' However, he told the jury he later went back to the room as he went to investigate 'noises' he heard in the house. He told the jury: 'I felt we could continue our drunken dalliance and I moved towards her bed. I could hear them talking downstairs.' He touched the woman inappropriately before leaving the room and returning a third time. Mcnaughton added: 'I intended to talk to her and to find out whether we could take our dalliance further. 'She went absolutely mental. She started screaming and shouting at me. I was stunned. I was absolutely in shock. She said ""You f*****, you bastard. You were on top of me"".' He went on: 'I’m a decent person. I wouldn’t go into someone’s room. I was speechless. I could not believe why she was being like this. I backed out of the room immediately. I was in complete shock.' His wife and the woman’s husband came straight up and the woman punched Mcnaughton, he told the jury, and then tried to kick him - forcing her husband to restrain her. 'She was being violent and aggressive to me, shouting and screaming,' he told the court. Mcnaughton denies sexual assault and causing the woman to engage in sexual activity without consent.

The England football team was plunged into a fresh racism row last night as caretaker manager Stuart Pearce's family links to the BNP resurfaced . Dennis Pearce, the current England U-21 boss's brother, is a BNP supporter who stood as a Parliamentary candidate for the far-Right party. And the appointment of Pearce, 49, has again brought into the spotlight racial controversy he himself was embroiled in as a player in 1994. He was forced to apologise to black footballer Paul Ince for allegedly racially abusing him during a Premier League game. A surprised Adrian Bevington, managing director of Club England, yesterday dismissed questions over the caretaker manager's sibling. He said: ‘Stuart has made it clear in the past that he is not involved in his brother’s political beliefs.’ Speaking in 2009, Pearce said: 'My brother's political views are his own and are not in anyway reflected in my own views.' Dennis added: 'I don't discuss politics with Stuart. I'm close to my brother. We both believe and vote in a democracy. 'Our family has got different views and respect other people's views. We don't dictate to each other what we should think.' With regard to the incident with Ince, Mr Bevington said yesterday: ‘I certainly can’t talk about the comment you’re raising there.’ The clash between the footballers prompted the Professional Footballers' Association — which was running an anti-racism campaign at the time — to intervene. Pearce allegedly made the comments to Manchester United's Ince — an England colleague — during a Premier League game at Old Trafford in 1994, when he was playing for Nottingham Forest. PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said . at the time: 'Stuart will be ringing Paul to apologise. Stuart regrets . what he said. It was said in the heat of the moment.’ Pearce will take charge of the national . team for the friendly against Holland on February 29 after Capello's . resignation was sparked by another race row surrounding John Terry.

The U.S. is looking to release several prisoners from Guantaamo Bay as it seeks to build a relationship with the Taliban on the back of last night's announcement on withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. 'Operational steps' have been put in motion by the Obama administration to move up to five prisoners in the hope it will further peace talks with the Afghan Taliban, according to a senior congressional official.

Meanwhile the Taliban have dismissed reports they are preparing to talk peace with the Afghan government, and a leaked NATO report has shown captured insurgents full of confidence they will seize power after international troops leave. While both developments yesterday were setbacks to President Hamid Karzai's quest to broker peace with the Taliban, his government got a big boost from Pakistan's top diplomat who declared her nation's support for an Afghan-led reconciliation process. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said she was visiting Kabul to deliver the strong message that Pakistan would stand behind any peace initiative that was widely supported by all ethnic groups in Afghanistan.

Less than 25 per cent of 16 to 19-year-olds holds a job, down 10 per cent from just five years ago, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, the lowest it has been since 1984. With summer around the corner, teenagers might have a better chance at landing a seasonal job, though prospects are still shaky. For those who think young: Less than 25 per cent of U.S. teens are currently employed, the lowest rate since 1984 . On the lookout: One reason why teens may be struggling to find work is because older job seekers are taking jobs once filled by younger people . According to msnbc.com, around 40 to 50 per cent of teenagers across the U.S. held down a job throughout the 1980s and 1990s. While the number was gently sloping downwards during the aughts, teenage employment took a steep plunge during the recession as others scrambled to fill what would normally be considered teenager’s jobs. However, those aren’t the only reasons why more teens aren’t working. Some teens – for whatever reason – are not actively seeking employment, while others have simply given up what they think is a fruitless search. The search, to many, is disheartening, and a blow to many young workers’ resolve. The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell last week by the most in nearly a year. The figure was a hopeful sign that hiring could pick up in coming months. The Labor Department said Thursday that weekly unemployment aid applications fell 27,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 365,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, ticked up to 383,500 last week. Applications are a measure of the pace of layoffs. When they fall below 375,000, it generally suggests that hiring will be strong enough to lower the unemployment rate. Last month, applications jumped after steadily declining since the fall. At the same time, hiring slowed. Those figures sparked concerns that the job market was worsening after strong gains during the winter. But some economists said temporary layoffs stemming from the spring holidays might have inflated benefit applications. Last week's drop reversed the increase during April. Applications are now roughly back at their level four weeks ago. -AP . ‘There's no replacement for the dignity that comes with earning your first pay check,’ said Secretary of Labour Hilda Solis in a statement yesterday. In 2011, the number of young people . looking for but unable to find summer work increased by 745,000 to 4.1 . million in July, which is typically the peak of youth employment. Also yesterday, the White House pledged to help lower-income youth find summer jobs in a move likely to appeal to younger voters crucial to President Obama's re-election campaign. The initiative is in partnership with the cities of Philadelphia, Chicago and San Francisco and is meant to add 110,000 jobs, internships and mentorships to the 180,000 summer work opportunities for 16-24 year olds that Mr Obama has promised to create for 2012. Under the new program, companies such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, Johnson & Johnson, and UBS, as well as non-profits and federal agencies such as the Department of Education will offer paying jobs as well as mentorships and other training programs. Last summer marked the lowest rate of youth employment for the month of July since 1948, according to the labour bureau. The problem is exacerbated by socioeconomic status – the children of unemployed parents or poor families are less likely to find work. Andrew Sum, the Director of the Centre for Labour Market Studies at Northeastern University, told msnbc.com that the phenomenon is caused because many teens find work through word of mouth, often through friends and family. Sharp increase: In 2011, unemployment for those aged 16-24 hovered around 17.4%; the number has only grown since . Spiking: According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, unemployment in teens and young adults is the highest it's been in decades . The odds are against them, he noted, in part because they may not have role models to look up to, or they may have other obligations, such as no access to public transportation or a car to get them to and from work. He also found that teens were more likely to find a job if they already had one. Jobs early in life serve more purpose than a pay check – oftentimes, it helps a teenager or young adult decide what they may want to spend the rest of their lives doing. A low percentage of citizens in the labour force present a multitude of problems, including a drain on Social Security and tax revenues, as well as increasing income inequality, according to CNN Money. The website also notes that the jobless numbers hurt U.S. growth in general.","Less than 25% of teens aged 16-19 are employed .

A grandfather is facing manslaughter charges after allegedly feeding his one-year-old grandson juice containing crushed morphine and Benadryl. Gregg Busby, 59, told police that he gave Antonio Garcia-Lazarski the juice to ‘calm him down and make him feel better.’ When Antonio’s grandmother went to check on him later that night, the baby was unresponsive and pronounced dead at the scene. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Greg Busby, 59, was charged with manslaughter after giving his one-year-old grandson juice laced with morphine and Benadryl . Fatal dose: Antonio Garcia-Lazarski was already on medication for a chronic condition; he was pronounced dead at the scene . Busby, who has an extensive criminal record, was arraigned by video yesterday as a fourth-time offender. He was looking after Antonio while his mother, Casey Lazarski, was out of town. Kent County Sheriff’s Dept Undersheriff Jon Hess told Grand Rapids Press that the boy’s father was ‘not in the picture.’ The infant had a hereditary disease, and was taking medication for chronic granulomatous. The disease, which affects the heart and lungs, is an inherited disorder and occurs when immune cells are unable to kill certain harmful bacteria. Busby told police that he gave Antonio the medicine to calm him down – however, neither the morphine nor the Benadryl - an over-the-counter allergy medication - were part of Antonio’s pill regimen. Babysitting: Busby was watching Antonio at his mobile home in Grand Rapids . In fact, the morphine belonged to Antonio’s grandmother, who also lives at the mobile home in Gaines Township. She has not been charged in her grandson’s death. Mr Hess said that it was unclear if the medicine was prescribed. Mr Hess told wzzm13.com about the order of events: ‘The grandfather had taken some morphine and some Benadryl, crushed it, and put it in juice hoping to calm the one-year-old. 'The one-year-old subsequently died from that mixture.’ He added: ‘It’s hard for any of us to understand.’ According to wsbt.com, Busby was released from jail last October after serving a 20-year sentence for counterfeiting and check fraud. He also tried to escape from prison in 1992. Busby, whose first name is sometimes spelled with only one ‘G,’ was charged with manslaughter, and held on a $50,000 cash bond. His preliminary exam is scheduled for April 9. Fatal combination: An autopsy revealed Antonio had both Benadryl, an allergy medication, and morphine  in his system . Priors: Busby has a string of previous arrests, and had just served a 20-year sentence . According to Russ Martin, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections, Busby told authorities about the drugs only after Antonio’s autopsy results came back on March 6. The medical examiner had found traces of both drugs in the boy’s system. First responders arrived at Busby’s mobile home in February after they reported that little Antonio wasn’t breathing. According to a police affidavit, Antonio was ‘cold to the touch’ when paramedics arrived. They found the boy’s grandmother, Dawn Lazarski, administering CPR. Hess told mlive.com that it is ‘for the courts to decide’ whether or not Busby had malicious intent. He added: ‘Any of us standing here would have to really, consciously think what the purpose was.’ Watch video here: .","Gregg Busby, 59, allegedly gave Antonio Garcia-Lazarski juice laced with morphine and allergy medicine .

"By . Richard Shears . UPDATED: . 02:08 EST, 29 June 2011 . Deported and banned: Actress Michelle Yeoh . A former Bond girl who is starring in a new film about pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been banned from Burma. Michelle Yeoh, who starred with Pierce Brosnan in 1997's Tomorrow Never dies, was deported from the country this week. She was trying to visit Burma for a second time - but had been blacklisted for meeting Suu Kyi last December. The former Miss Malaysia is believed . to have angered the hard-line regime - who did not even let her past the . airport when she arrived on June 22. Reports . from the capital Rangoon revealed airport officials sent her back to . Thailand, where she had flown from, on the next available flight. When . Yeoh was chosen to play the role of Suu Kyi, she flew to Burma and . spent time with the 66-year-old to get a feel for the part she was going . to play in the Luc Besson movie The Lady, which is set to be released . later this year. Yeoh - who . played the role of a beautiful, but tough, Chinese spy in the Bond . movie - said she hoped her portrayal would raise awareness about the . Novel peace prize winner's story. Suu Kyi's opposition to the regime has kept her mostly under house arrest for the past 20 years. She was released last year, days after an election that her party boycotted. Tomorrow Never Dies: Michelle Yeoh (right) starred in the 1997 James Bond film alongside Pierce Brosnan (left) Pro-democracy: Aung San Suu Kyi . A Burmese official who confirmed that . Miss Yeoh had been deported said: 'She did not have the chance to enter . Myanmar (Burma) again. 'She was deported straight away on the first flight after arriving at Yangon (Rangoon) International Airport.' Another official said: 'She's on the blacklist now.' Officials did not reveal why she had been blacklisted. But Burma's repressive government has routinely rejected visa requests by journalists and others who have been seen as critics of the regime. A spokesman for Miss Suu Kyi - who was formerly married to British academic Michael Aris, who died of prostate cancer in 1999 at the age of 53 - confirmed Miss Yeoh had been deported but said he had no further details. Although the military junta handed power to a civilian government in March, critics say little has changed and the new government is just a front for continued, repressive, rule by the army, which has been in power for the past 49 years.

"By . Tom Gardner . UPDATED: . 04:00 EST, 2 March 2012 . This is the aircraft that will be on the frontline in the mission to protect spectators and athletes from terrorism during the Olympics. The Boeing E-3 Sentry has helped the military carry out thousands of missions in war zones across the globe, including Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. But now, this state-of-the art aircraft,   is set for a crucial role closer to home, guarding against threats during this summer's London Games. The £179m plane, which features an all-seeing radar housed in the distinctive dome, enables armed forces to find, target and neutralise threats from land, sea or air from hundreds of miles. Defence chiefs have drafted the fearsome aircraft in to help orchestrate the enormous task of keeping the public safe from all form of attack. Scroll down for video . Keeping a watch: A British Royal Air Force E-3D Sentry AEW aircraft has the distinctive dome. The unpressurized dome is 30 feet in diameter, six feet thick at the center, and is held 11 feet above the fuselage by two struts. It tilts down at an agle of 6° at the front to reduce its air drag during take-offs, and while flying endurance speed. The dome uses both bleed-air and cooling doors to remove the heat generated by electronic and mechanical equipment. The hydraulically-rotated antenna system spins six times per minute above the fuselage and houses pulse-Doppler detector enabling it to pick up dozens of air and land threats from hundreds of miles . Control centre: The normal 18 man crew comprises four flight-deck crew, three technicians and an 11-man mission crew. The mission crew comprises a tactical director, a fighter allocator, three weapons controllers, a surveillance controller, two surveillance operators, a data-link manager, a communications operator and an electronic-support- measures operator . The RAF operates seven E-3D Sentry . aircraft in the airborne surveillance and command-and-control role. The . aircraft are based at RAF Waddington, in Lincolnshire, where they are operated by number 8 and 23 Squadrons. Engines: Four CFM 56 2A-3 turbofans . Thrust: 24,000lbs each . Max speed: 460kts . Length: 46.68m . Max altitude: 35,000ft . Span: 44.98m . Aircrew: 18 . E- 3D has been extensively employed in the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) role. The . E-3D Sentry, known to the RAF as the AEW1, is based on the commercial . Boeing 707-320B aircraft, which has been extensively modified and . updated to accommodate modern mission systems. Mission endurance is approximately 11 hours or more than 5,000 nautical miles without the need to refuel. But . the E-3D is the only aircraft in the RAF’s inventory capable of . air-to-air refuelling by both the American ‘flying-boom’ system and the . RAF’s ‘probe-and-drogue’ method. Yesterday, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond visited the base to observe an air security training exercise . and meet members of the armed forces who will be providing airborne . security throughout the summer. During the visit he stressed that security plans have been put in place . for the Olympic Games to make sure the UK is ‘prepared in every respect’ to deal with any threats. Philip Hammond said the potential of . any outside threat or danger at this summer's Games was ‘hopefully very . unlikely’ but said a huge operation was ready to deal with anything that . might go wrong. He said: ‘Part of this exercise is making anyone with ill intention aware of the layered air defence that will be in place. ‘We've . got no specific threat to the Olympics at all and certainly no specific . threat of any kind of airborne threat, but we want the world to know we . will be prepared in every respect so that we will be able to ensure . that the London Olympics are safe and secure.’ He added: ‘Ever since 9/11 we've had a routine plan in place to deal with the possibility of a rogue airliner. ‘What we're doing for the Olympics is . lifting the profile of that and adding additional layers of defence to . the routine air defence strategy that we have in place 365 days a year.’ Mr Hammond sat with General Sir Nick . Parker and E-3D Sentry personnel in the mission crew area and viewed a . scenario in which a rogue aircraft headed towards a target area and RAF . Typhoons were scrambled from Coningsby in Lincolnshire, as well as a . helicopter and sniper who could either ‘take out’ the pilot or the rogue . aircraft's engine. Mr . Hammond said a ‘number of ministers’ would be involved in the . decision-making process if such action was needed and was confident . military personnel could deal effectively with all scenarios. Yesterday's exercise was also to provide reassurance to ‘friends and allies’ who were sending teams to the Games, he added. Eye in the sky: The aircraft’s mission systems can separate, manage and display targets . individually on situation displays within the aircraft, or it can . transmit the information to ground-based and ship-based units using a . wide variety of digital data link. This data can be displayed, interpreted and acted upon within seconds . Friend or foe: The plane is equipped with six colour display screens displaying radar and Identified Friend or Foe ground and aircraft, in real time, to the crew. This is processed and overlaid onto geographical maps to provide crew with a 3-D layout of the battle field and where the enemy and friendly troops and aircraft are operating . Briefing: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, front left, gets talked through the two-hour test run of the exercise, codenamed Taurus Mountain, over Leamington, Dishforth, by crew members on the E-3D Sentry aircraft . Crucial role: The highly trained 18 man crew, seen leaving the one of seven E-3D Sentry aircraft at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, have carried out countless hours of training in preparation for their vital job during the Games this summer . The . E-3D Sentry carried out a two-hour test run of the exercise, codenamed . Taurus Mountain, over Leamington, Dishforth and the east coast of the UK . yesterday morning. The . plane's Northrop Grumman AN/APY-2 high-performance, multimode lookdown . radar is able to separate airborne and maritime targets from ground and . sea clutter. One E-3D flying at 30,000ft can scan at distances of over 300 nautical miles. It . can detect low-flying targets or maritime surface contacts within 215 . nautical miles and it can detect medium-level airborne targets at ranges . in excess of 280 nautical miles. The . multi-mode radar provides lookdown surveillance to the radar horizon . and an electronic vertical scan of the radar beam provides target . elevation and beyond-the-horizon operation for long-range surveillance . of medium and high-altitude aircraft. These attributes allow it to determine the location, altitude, course and speed of large numbers of airborne targets. Flight . Lieutenant Craige Curry said the plane and crew acted as the ‘eyes in . the sky’ for areas where low-level radars could not reach and fed data . back to the ground so a full security picture could be seen. He . said: ‘We've been involved in supporting numerous Olympics events over . the years,’ he said. ‘We call them 'high visibility events', which the . Olympics is this year. ‘We're reasonably well-practised in terms of this kind of operation.’ Flt Lt Curry said the crew would be looking for anything and everything in the air during the Games. ‘Anything that flies we'll be trying to build a picture of,’ he said. Aircraft . and ground units will be part of the multi-layered air defences for the . Games, including RAF Typhoon interceptors, RAF E-3D Sentry and Royal . Navy Sea King surveillance aircraft. Sniper-carrying . RAF Puma and Navy Lynx helicopters, as well as RAF radar systems and . air defence missile systems, will all be in place. Once . the flight had finished and landed back at RAF Waddington Mr Hammond . viewed a number of military aircraft and met personnel. Air . Vice Marshal Stuart Atha said the principles that underpin air security . plans for the Olympics meant extra assets were able to be brought in, . and ‘rapid and appropriate’ decision making was the same as on any other . day of the year. Asked if . he was confident air crews could manage and maintain security, he said: . ‘That's what today's about - it's about exercising. ‘It's just like Olympic athletes are preparing for the Games - well so are we. ‘We're . preparing for the Games to bring all these different assets together so . that we can be prepared to deliver a safe and secure Olympics, but also . doing it from the air in a way that preserves the spirit and the . culture of the Games. ‘Hopefully you won't see us, we will be above and beyond your awareness.’ Drill: Aircraft and ground units will be part of the multi-layered air defences for the Games, including RAF Typhoon interceptors, RAF E-3D Sentry and Royal Navy Sea King surveillance aircraft . Defence Secretary Philip Hammond stands in front of a Rapier System ground-to-air missile launcher. The Rapier is the British primary anti-aircraft weapon. The surface-to-air missile was developed for the British Army and Royal Air Force. It is designed to be able to strike against longer-range and higher-altitude targets as well as close, low flying threat and will be deployed at strategic locations across London . Strike force: Two British Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4 aircraft fly over RAF Waddington near Lincoln, will form part of the force to counter terrorist threats during the Olympics. The £125m twin-engine Typhoon are the RAF's multi-role fighter meaning they can carryout air-to-ground bombing raids as well as engage other aircraft in a dog fight . The armed forces have been keen to show off their capability to counter terrorism in the build up to the Games. Around 100 marines and 50 officers . rehearsed a string of high-speed drills amid fears attackers could use . the waterways to launch onslaughts on London landmarks, earlier this . year. About 50 marine police officers in . rigid inflatables and fast response boats were joined by up to 100 . military personnel and a Royal Navy Lynx helicopter for the exercises. The Thames runs directly past the O2 . Arena, which will be known as the North Greenwich Arena for the purpose . of the Games, when it will host events including gymnastics.  The river . will also be used to transport tourists between venues via water buses . and a new cable car. Typhoon jets and HMS Ocean, the . largest ship in the Royal Navy’s fleet, will eventually be deployed to . protect the London 2012 Games along with up to 13,500 military . personnel.","RAF's fearsome Boeing E-3D Sentry takes part in two-hour test run - codenamed Taurus Mountain - as forces gear up to combat terrorist threats .

Tourists flocking to some of  London’s most famous landmarks during the Olympics are to be treated to a new attraction – tents full of rowdy drunks. Scotland Yard is setting up shelters near Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square to offer help to inebriated revellers. In an attempt to tackle drunken violence, policemen and nurses will be on hand to offer drunks cups of tea, medical treatment and advice on how to get home. Sobering experience: Tents like this one will be set up across central London to deal with drunken revellers during the Olympics this summer . The booze tents, which the Met prefer to call ‘departure zones’, will be open every Thursday, Friday and Saturday for the next six months between 6pm and dawn. It is part of a crackdown on violence which will see the West End flooded with up to 400 extra officers to prevent outbreaks of trouble on so-called ‘red days’. The move comes days after the Prime Minister unveiled plans to ban cut-price alcohol as part of a  war on binge drinking. But critics have questioned the timing of the makeshift tents when the eyes of the world will be on the capital for the Olympics and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. They fear the spectacle of drunken Britons staggering into all-night shelters will tarnish the image of the UK abroad. Yesterday Scotland Yard said Operation Trafalgar, its biggest-ever crackdown on anti-social behaviour in the West End, would improve safety in the capital. As well as 400 extra officers in the area, six podiums will be set up to allow the police to spot troublemakers and to provide reassurance to the public. Violent drunks who start brawls, drug dealers, pickpockets, unlicensed minicabs and dangerous rickshaw drivers are also being targeted, with the latter facing prosecution under an archaic law from 1839 that prohibits ‘cycling furiously’. On yer bike: Dangerous rickshaw drivers could be prosecuted under an archaic 1839 law that prohibits 'cycling furiously' Westminster police Chief Superintendent Simon Ovens said that if the temporary tents proved successful, officers would consider looking for business sponsorship so the scheme could be expanded. He said: ‘It’s somewhere you can go to, or be sent to, where you can be looked after, get a cup of tea, bus advice and train advice as well as medical support.’ But yesterday London mayoral candidate Jenny Jones, who was a Green Party member of London’s Police Authority for 12 years, compared the unsightly tents to the Occupy protest at St Paul’s Cathedral. She said: ‘It seems like Occupy are having a tent for people to stay all night. It seems a bit overblown quite honestly. ‘I am a big fan of tents but erecting one for drunks in Trafalgar Square when the eyes of the world are on London, it does not seem like a good idea to me.’","Policemen and nurses will offer tea, medical treatment and advice on how to get home .

"By . David Williams . UPDATED: . 21:03 EST, 1 February 2012 . The Taliban is set to return to power in Afghanistan when British and Coalition forces end their combat role in 2014, a damning leaked confidential report reveals. Despite 10 years of fighting by NATO forces and their huge sacrifices - 397 members of the British military alone have been killed and thousands wounded - the report says that in the past year there has been unprecedented interest, even from within the Afghan government, in joining the Taliban. And it points accusingly at Afghanistan's neighbour Pakistan, a key ally of NATO, where powerful elements in the security and intelligence services support the Taliban and describes how insurgent leaders maintain homes within the heart of the capital Islamabad. Scroll down for video . Sacrifice: Jack Sadler was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan in 2007 . Trooper Jack Sadler was repatriated to RAF Lyneham five days after his death in December 2007 . Poised: A Taliban militant holds a grenade launcher in Herat. A secret U.S. report claims the insurgent movement is poised to regain control of Afghanistan when NATO troops withdraw . Unbowed: The document claims Taliban fighters are being supported by Pakistan intelligence services across the border . Based on 27,000 interviews with over . 4,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners, the detailed report effectively . questions the Coalition’s own assessment that it is winning the war in . Afghanistan. The report - The State of the Taliban - . was described as ‘devastating’ yesterday (W) by former soldier Ian . Sadler, whose son Jack, a 21-year-old reservist serving with the . Honourable Artillery Company, died in a roadside bomb blast in Helmand . in December 2007. 'It has been a waste of time operating . in the way that the British have,' he said, 'Hearing details of the . report makes me wonder why our soldiers were sent there in the way they . were and the cost that has been paid.' The report compiled by U.S. forces . describes how weapons and vehicles given to Afghan forces have in turn . been passed on to the Taliban and says that Pakistan's feared . Inter-Services Intelligence Agency (ISI) is actively colluding with the . insurgents by actually directing attacks. Attacks: An explosion after an airstrike in Nanagarhar, Afghanistan. The report, based on interrogation of insurgents, claims Taliban fighters are being given weapons and training by Pakistan-backed militants . Cost: The remains of Private First Class Cody R. Norris arrive at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. More than ten years after the U.S.-led conflict in Afghanistan, the Taliban are poised to regain control . 'Pakistan knows everything,' the report states, 'they control everything. The Taliban are not Islam. The Taliban are Islamabad. 'ISI officers tout the need for continued jihad (holy war) and expulsion of foreign invaders from Pakistan. 'The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban. 'ISI is thoroughly aware of Taliban . activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban personnel. Senior . Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on . strategy and relay any pertinent concerns of the government of . Pakistan.' Those questioned, including senior . Taliban commanders, told how Islamabad uses a complex network of spies . and intermediaries to provide strategic advice to aid the Taliban in . fighting the coalition. Explaining why new recruits are . turning in large numbers to the Taliban, fighters said : 'When the . Karzai government was established, we thought there was a chance of . something good. The harassment, corruption and abuse are unbearable. We . chose to fight. We chose the Taliban.' No confidence: An Afghan border police officer receives his graduation certificate. There are concerns that the police, security forces and Afghan army will not be able to maintain order in the country when NATO forces leave . Unpopular: The Taliban is playing on public opinion of President Hamid Karzai's government . In a bleak conclusion, it paints a . picture of Al Qaeda’s influence diminishing but the Taliban’s influence . increasing, stating : 'Afghan civilians frequently prefer Taliban . governance over the Afghan government, usually as a result of government . corruption.' The report has evidence that the . Taliban are deliberately hastening NATO's withdrawal by reducing their . attacks in some areas and then initiating a comprehensive . hearts-and-minds campaign. The findings could heap further . pressure on David Cameron, and U.S. President Barack Obama, as they face . strengthened calls to withdraw troops before the 2014 deadline. It could also reinforce the view of . Taliban hardliners that the group should not negotiate peace with the . U.S. and President Hamid Karzai's unpopular government while in a . position of strength. Significantly, the Taliban yesterday . said that reports they were about to begin talks with the Karzai . government in Saudi Arabia were untrue. 'The unfortunate reality is that this . is a failure of the allied strategy in Afghanistan. They have not been . able to achieve the goals they set out to achieve,' said Mahmud Durrani, . a former Pakistan army general and ambassador to Washington. Fresh accusations of Pakistani . collusion with the Taliban are likely to further strain ties between . Western powers and Islamabad, which has long denied backing militants . seeking to topple the U.S.-backed government in Kabul. Critics say Pakistan uses militant . groups as proxies to counter the growing influence of rival India in . Afghanistan. The belief that Pakistan supports the insurgents is widely . held in Afghanistan. Pakistani fighter jets bombed the hideouts of two militant commanders along the Afghan border today, killing up to 31 insurgents. One of those killed was reported to be a Pakistani Taliban leader in the Orakzai region, Moin ud Din. The strikes followed clashes between soldiers and militants over a strategic mountain in Kurram last week, in which more than 60 people were killed. In recent years, the Pakistani military has launched a series of offensives against militants in the border regions - which are only nominally controlled by the central government. Large areas remain under the effective control of extremists, who use the region to plan attacks in Pakistani cities and Afghanistan. Gunmen also attacked a Pakistan paramilitary checkpoint in the Marwah area of Baluchistan province last night, killing six troops. And the bodies of seven unarmed men were discovered near the checkpoint. Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina . Rabbani Khar on a one day visit to the Afghan capital Kabul, dismissed . the claims which she said were not new and could be disregarded. 'This is old wine in an even older . bottle. I don’t think these claims are new. These claims have been made . for many, many years,' she said. In Brussels, a NATO official said the . prisoners also claimed that the Taliban retain wide public support . throughout Afghanistan, particularly in the countryside. The official, however, cautioned that . the document was not based on any intelligence analysis of the situation . on the ground, but is a summary of thousands of interrogation reports. 'It's a very lopsided perspective because some of them are motivated to portray the picture in their favour,' said the official. The extent of Taliban support from . within local forces was underlined yesterday when an Afghan soldier shot . and killed a NATO service member in southern Afghanistan. It was the sixth report since December . of an Afghan soldier turning his weapon on the international troops . working to train the Afghan security forces. Two weeks ago, an Afghan soldier . killed four French soldiers prompting President Nicolas Sarkozy to speed . up the exit of French troops from Afghanistan said it would ask NATO to . hand over all combat operations to Afghan forces in 2013 instead of by . the end of 2014. At least seven British soldiers have . been killed by so-called trusted 'colleagues' while there have been at . least 35 attacks on international troops since 2007 by Afghan soldiers, . police or insurgents wearing their uniforms. The number rose sharply . last year to 17, up from six in 2010. Tory MP John Baron, a member of the . Foreign Affairs Committee and a long-term opponent of the Government's . policy on Afghanistan, said: 'This confirms what a number of us have . suspected for some time. 'The Taliban insurgency is intact, it . is supported by local people and it is getting help from the Pakistani . intelligence services. This proves that the Taliban will not be beaten . and recent offers of talks should be positively responded to and taken . up by the U.S. and UK. 'It is possible to talk and fight at the same time - we proved that in Northern Ireland.' Mr Baron, who believes it is vital to . find a political solution in Afghanistan, said the military campaign had . become bogged down in 'mission creep' because it did not have clear . goals.","Report compiled by U.S. forces claims Pakistan security agency is assisting Taliban attacks against NATO forces .

"By . Barbara Jones . UPDATED: . 06:13 EST, 19 October 2011 . Britons are being advised to stay away from Kenyan coastal areas near the Somali border after a French woman was kidnapped by pirates following a fierce gun battle. Disabled Marie Dedieu was snatched from a beach resort in the Lamu archipelago, northern Kenya, by ten heavily armed Somali militants after a gunfight with local police. On September 11, Briton David Tebbutt, . 58, was killed and his wife Judith, 56, abducted by armed gunmen from a . resort near the popular tourist town of Lamu. Snatched: Disabled French woman Marie Dedieu was abducted from this house which she rented for half the year at Ras Gitau, in Manda, part of the Lamu archipelago . Ms Dedieu's Kenyan boyfriend John Lepapa, 39, said the gang marched the staff off at gunpoint, then one man lifted the 66-year-old on to his shoulders and carried her to a motorboat . The foreign office statement read: 'We advise against all but essential . travel to coastal areas within 150km of the Somali border, following two . attacks by armed gangs in small boats against beach resorts in the Lamu . area on 11 September and 1 October 2011. 'This advice will be kept under review. Both attacks were on beach-front . properties, with two Westerners kidnapped and one murdered. 'Beach-front accommodation in that area and boats off the coast are vulnerable.' Briton David Tebbutt was shot dead by gunmen who abducted his wife Judith . The Tebbutts, from Bishop's Stortford, were the only guests at the . Kiwayu Safari Village, 25 miles from the Kenya-Somalia border. Security forces yesterday tracked down . and surrounded the pirate boat believed to be carrying the French . hostage. Several of the masked Somalis were . wounded in the battle, which followed their boat being surrounded by . coastguard vessels and an aircraft in a stand-off as France and Kenya . tried to save Dedie. The FCO said its travel advice is 'under constant review in the light of the situation on the ground'. 'Travel advice is based on objective . assessments of the risk to British nationals, whose safety is our main . concern,' said the statement. Last night two aircraft were pursuing . the kidnappers into Somalia as fears grew for Ms Dedieu, who now has no . medication to combat her illness. The kidnap took place 30 miles from the beach near the Kenyan-Somali . border where Briton Judith Tebbutt, 56, was seized by gunmen last month. She was taken by six men who burst into her beach-front . bungalow which she rents for half the year on Manda Island at 3am. The island is located across the channel from the tourist town of Lamu. Her Kenyan boyfriend John Lepapa, 39, . said the gang marched the staff off at gunpoint, then one man lifted . 66-year-old Ms Dedieu on to his shoulders and carried her to the gang’s . motorboat. The couple had returned two days earlier from France, where . they spend part of the year. Hotel worker Kenyan Ali Babitu Kololo, was arrested and charged over the abduction of Judith . Tebbutt . Mr Lepapa said the gang fired assault rifles into the air as they came . ashore and shouted: ‘Where is the foreigner? Where is the foreigner?’ as . they burst into her sleeping quarters. He said: ‘She pleaded with them to take things, even money, and spare . her life. But they would not listen.’ He said he and Ms Dedieu, who uses . a wheelchair, had planned to marry. Three weeks ago social worker Judith Tebbutt, from Bishop’s Stortford, . Hertfordshire, was snatched in a speedboat by Somali pirates who shot . dead her husband David, 57, a publishing finance director. Mrs Tebbutt . is now believed to be held in the northern Amara area of Somalia. No . contact has been established with her kidnappers and no ransom demanded. Last night, Kenyan authorities said that despite a gun battle, pirates . had escaped into Somalia with Ms Dedieu. Several of the abductors were . wounded. ‘They’ve crossed the border into Ras Kamboni. There are two aircraft on . top of them monitoring their position,’ said Kenyan tourism minister . Najib Balala. ‘We can see that a few of the kidnappers are injured. They are 15 miles from our border.’ Armed guard: In the days after Judith Tebbutt's abduction the Kiwayu . Safari Village (pictured) was closed off . The UN has ruled that foreign military forces can pursue pirates in . Somalia. Before the gunfight, Mr Balala said two coastguard vessels had . surrounded the pirates’ motorboat carrying Ms Dedieu and a military . aircraft was circling overhead. ‘Our fear was that if we drowned the boat, we would also drown the woman,’ he said. Locals on Manda Island and nearby Lamu, exclusive holiday destinations . for wealthy Euro¬peans, said they believed Ms Dedieu was specifically . targeted. Abdallah Satilli, the owner of her rented house, said she had been using . it as a holiday home for eight years. H . She said: ‘I was woken by gunfire, . maybe two shots. At first I prayed and then I tried to go back to sleep . but there was such a commotion across the water that I took a boat over . there and realised she was gone.’ Kidnapped: Manda Island (pictured), from where Marie Dedieu was taken is 30 miles from the beach where  David Tebbutt was killed and his wife Judith abducted . Taken: David Tebbutt was shot dead inside one the cottages, similar to the one pictured, in Kiwayu Safari Village -his wife Judith was kidnapped . France said it was ‘working with the Kenyan authorities, which have . mobilised significant air and sea resources in order to free our . compatriot’. Colonel John Steed, in charge of the UN’s counter-piracy unit in . Nairobi, said: ‘Now it is dark it is next to impossible to continue to . follow – the moment is lost. It reverts to normal kidnapping . negotiations.’ The UN’s envoy to Somalia, Augustine Mahiga, warned last week of a . growing link between Somalia’s pirates and militants. Much of southern . Somalia is controlled by the Al Qaeda-affiliated al-Shabaab group. ‘Al-Shabaab gives the pirates their required speed and safe passage,’ he . said. ‘Judith Tebbutt’s abduction illustrated this. She had been taken . to the al-Shabaab stronghold port of Kismayo and then driven up to the . pirates’ area in the north.’",Raid comes after Briton was killed and wife abducted at safari resort .

Former News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck will not be prosecuted over allegations of intimidating a witness in Scotland Yard's phone-hacking inquiry. Thurlbeck, 50, will not be charged after four files relating to the investigation were handed over by detectives. Allegations of harassment and witness intimidation related to a blog posted by Mr Thurlbeck, who remains on bail in relation to voicemail interception allegations. He said today: 'I am pleased that the CPS has advised the police that no further action should be taken with regard to an allegation concerning one of my blog postings on nevillethurlbeck.com. 'I would like to thank my family, friends and colleagues in the industry for their unswerving loyalty, support and continued belief in me. 'And my lawyer Henri Brandman for his wise counsel.

Mr Thurlbeck wrote the blog on March 7, criticising executive Will Lewis, who is on News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee, and giving Mr Lewis' address in North London and naming the security firm protecting his home. The road name - which can be found on the publicly available electoral roll - was subsequently removed from the post. Alison Levitt QC, the top legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions, said the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed one of the four files referred to Mr Thurlbeck. She said: 'Having applied the full test set out in the code for Crown prosecutors the CPS has concluded that no prosecution should take place. 'Given that the journalist in question remains on bail for further offences we do not intend to give any further information at this point. 'Mr Thurlbeck remains on police bail on suspicion of offences under Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.' Lawyers for Mr Lewis had threatened an injunction, accusing Thurlbeck of carrying out surveillance on his home, invading his privacy and publishing libels about him. His lawyers also claimed the reporter had libelled News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee, formed to clean up the company – which published the now defunct Sunday tabloid – following the hacking revelations. Police probe: Will Lewis is on News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee, formed to clean up the company following the phone hacking scandal . As a key member of the MSC, Mr Lewis has become a central figure in a civil war in Rupert Murdoch's empire. The committee's co-operation with . Scotland Yard has caused fury among journalists after internal emails . and details of suspected illegal activity were handed to detectives, . which resulted in the arrests of several reporters and senior executives . from The Sun. Thurlbeck was one of the first suspects questioned by detectives from the Yard's hacking probe, Operation Weeting, last April. Blog post: News Corporation's Will Lewis was criticised by Thurlbeck who also published his street name . Last month he was arrested by police . on suspicion of witness intimidation after turning up for a pre-arranged . appointment at a central London police station. Writing after he was bailed, Thurlbeck said the events 'really didn't feel like England'. He wrote: 'Clearly, my blog has upset someone. 'So much so, one minute I was sitting . penning a new post. The next, I was in the police station, having DNA . mouth swabs and my fingerprints and police mugshot taken. 'A complaint had been made and acted upon very swiftly indeed. 'It really didn't feel like England today.' After thanking his lawyer, family and friends, he said he vigorously denied the allegations of any wrongdoing. Mr Thurlbeck was arrested the day . after former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks, her husband Charlie, and four . other suspects were arrested over allegations of cover-ups surrounding . the phone-hacking inquiry. Thurlbeck has said detectives asked him to become a prosecution witness after seizing documents from his home. Evidence taken from his property after . his first arrest last April indicated that he warned senior colleagues . two years ago about hacking, he said. Former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks, pictured with News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, was arrested in connection with the phone-hacking scandal in a dawn raid on her Oxfordshire home . Thurlbeck said detectives hoped he would become a key witness in return for potential immunity from prosecution. But he said he had turned down the offer. He said in November: 'I have informed . Scotland Yard that while I fully understand and respect the reason for . their request of me to give evidence for the Crown in any prosecution . arising from Operation Weeting, it is my opinion that a detailed and . forensic inquiry into my working methods by what is a highly . professional police unit will fully exonerate me. 'So, on that basis, I have declined their offer.' Sunderland-born Mr Thurlbeck was . behind stories including disclosures about ex-Formula 1 boss Max .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:13 EST, 30 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:13 EST, 30 April 2012 . Heartbreak: Aileen Dannelley holds her newborn baby, Savannah, who is slowly being weaned from prescription methadone . Less than a month old, Savannah Dannelley scrunches her tiny face into a scowl as a nurse gently squirts a dose of methadone into her mouth. The infant is going through drug withdrawal and is being treated with the same narcotic prescribed for her mother to fight addiction to powerful prescription painkillers. Disturbing new research says the number of U.S. babies born with signs of opiate drug withdrawal has tripled in a decade because of a surge in pregnant women's use of legal and illegal narcotics, including Vicodin, OxyContin and heroin, researchers say. It is the first national study of the problem. The number of newborns with withdrawal symptoms increased from a little more than 1 per 1,000 babies sent home from the hospital in 2000 to more than 3 per 1,000 in 2009, the study found. More than 13,000 U.S. infants were affected in 2009, the researchers estimated. The newborns include babies like Savannah, whose mother stopped abusing painkillers and switched to prescription methadone early in pregnancy, and those whose mothers are still abusing legal or illegal drugs. Weaning infants from these drugs can take weeks or months and often requires a lengthy stay in intensive care units. Hospital charges for treating these newborns soared from $190million to $720million between 2000 and 2009, the study found. The study was released online Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Savannah is hooked up to heart and oxygen monitors in an Oak Lawn, Illinois, newborn intensive care unit. Spike: This graph shows the steady rise in the rate of mothers using opiates between 2000 and 2009 . In a pink crib, she sleeps fitfully, sometimes cries all night, and has had diarrhea and trouble feeding - typical signs of withdrawal. Some affected babies also have breathing problems, low birth weights and seizures. It nearly breaks her young mother's heart. 'It's really hard, every day, emotionally and physically,' said Aileen Dannelley, 25. 'It's really hard when your daughter is born addicted.' Doctors say newborns aren't really addicted, but their bodies are dependent on methadone or other opiates because of their mothers' use during pregnancy. Priorities: Aileen Dannelley is now staying clean and is in nursing school, but visits her daughter in the hospital every day . Small methadone doses to wean them . off these drugs is safer than cutting them off altogether, which can . cause dangerous seizures and even death, said Dr Mark Brown, chief of . pediatrics at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor. Newborn drug withdrawal is rampant in Maine, Florida, West Virginia, parts of the Midwest and other sections of the country. Dr Stephen Patrick, the lead author of the study and a newborn specialist at the University of Michigan health system in Ann Arbor, called the problem a 'public health epidemic' that demands attention from policymakers, as well as from researchers to clarify what long-term problems these infants may face. University of Maine scientist Marie Hayes said her research suggests some affected infants suffer developmental delays in early childhood, but whether those problems persist is uncertain. It's the 21st century version of what was known as the 'crack baby' epidemic of the 1980s. Disturbing trend: Children of drug-addicted moms is reminiscent of the 'crack baby' epidemic of the late 1970s and early 1980s where children underwent narcotic withdrawal . Some experts say that epidemic was . overblown and that infants born to mothers using crack cocaine face no . serious long-term health problems. Newborns addicted . Some think the current problem is being overblown, too. Carl Hart, an assistant psychiatry . professor at Columbia University and a substance abuse researcher at the . New York Psychiatric Institute, noted that only a tiny portion of the . estimated 4 million U.S. infants born each year are affected. Hart also said the study probably includes women who weren't abusing drugs during pregnancy, but were taking prescribed painkillers for legitimate reasons. He said he worries that the study will unfairly stigmatize pregnant women who are 'doing the right thing' by taking methadone to fight their addiction. Doctors pushing powerful painkillers 'like candy' contribute to the problem, said Arturo Valdez, who runs the Chicago substance abuse program that Aileen Dannelley attends. Patients at his West Side clinic include men and women who are prescribed opiate painkillers for legitimate reasons, such as car accident injuries, and find themselves addicted when the prescriptions runs out. Some turn to street drugs, which can be cheaper and easier to obtain, Valdez said. In some states, mothers of newborns with drug withdrawal are arrested and jailed, but Valdez said addiction is a brain disease that should be treated like other illnesses, not stigmatized. Aileen Dannelley said she started abusing drugs after an adult neighbor introduced her to crack when she was 14. She said she would 'never have touched it' if she had known how addictive drugs can be. She said she has abused Vicodin, which a doctor gave her to treat back pain from sitting all day at an office job, as well as other prescription painkillers and heroin. Dannelley was still abusing drugs early in her pregnancy but decided in December to quit, vowing: 'I'm not going to go back to that lifestyle. There's a baby inside me.' Alarming: The number of babies born with signs of opiate drug withdrawal has tripled in a decade due mostly to a surge in pregnant women's use of legal and illegal narcotics, including Vicodin and OxyContin . Now she is trying to get her life back on track. Estranged from her husband, she is living with her parents and just signed up for nursing classes at a local junior college. She visits Savannah every day. The baby has been in the hospital since she was born in early April, and her mother hopes to take her home soon. 'I am doing so good for the first time in my life,' Dannelley said.","More than 13,000 U.S. infants were affected by opiate drug withdrawal in 2009 .

"By . Christopher Leake . UPDATED: . 20:55 EST, 19 November 2011 . Plans for a new airport in the Thames estuary have won political backing from senior figures close to David Cameron. Steve Hilton, the Prime Minister’s strategy chief, and Chancellor George Osborne are said to have swung behind the scheme as the best way of tackling a crisis in airport capacity. Big sell: The Thames Hub will have a high speed railway station under it running across the UK and into Europe . In July, The Mail on Sunday revealed Mr Hilton had joined forces with London Mayor Boris Johnson to persuade Mr Cameron to drop his opposition to plans for an airport off the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, nicknamed ‘Boris Island’. Now senior Government sources have confirmed that although no formal discussions have been held, support for the £40 billion hub – which would replace Heathrow  as the UK’s largest airport – is gathering pace. A separate £50 billion Thames airport scheme has been drawn up by architect Lord Foster for the nearby Isle of Grain in Kent. Until recently, the Isle of Sheppey idea was viewed as a bizarre plan backed only by Mr Johnson but now the Chancellor is said to have warmed to the idea. Support: Norman Foster designed the new Wembley Stadium, and he is looking to create something similarly distinctive at the Thames Hub - with new Transport Secretary Justine Greening thought to be an ally . Philip Hammond, who did not back the scheme, was last month replaced as Transport Secretary by Justine Greening, who is seen as an ally of the project. She previously campaigned against expansion at Heathrow. Mr Johnson is due to launch a policy paper tomorrow calling for more runways to be built. All airports in the South East are expected to be at full capacity by 2030, which has led to growing concern among business leaders about future airport provision. The Department for Transport is due to produce a report on aviation in 2013. A spokesman said: ‘The concept of a Thames airport forms a useful contribution to the debate and will be considered alongside all other responses.’ The four-runway airport which will be located sparse strip of land on the Isle of Grain, in Ken was designed by architect Lord Norman . Foster – who created the new Wembley Stadium. The airport would be a . modern-day feat of British engineering built on reclaimed marshland. It . would include the UK’s busiest railway station, handling 300,000 . passengers a day. Planes would fly in from the . north-east, primarily over water, greatly reducing the number of homes . that would be affected by aircraft noise. However not everyone has leant their support. Councillor Rodney Chambers, leader of . Medway Council in Kent, said: ‘The Isle of Grain is home to one of the . world’s largest liquefied natural gas terminals, with a fifth of the . UK’s gas supply offloaded by container ships and stored there. ‘We have looked at Lord Foster’s plan . and he appears to want to place his fantasy Isle of Grain airport on . top of the LNG plant and a power station. It beggars belief.’ Lord Foster said: ‘We need to . recapture the foresight and political courage of our 19th century . forebears if we are to establish a modern transport and energy . infrastructure in Britain for this century and beyond. We can do it . here.’ Huge: Foster and Partners artist impression of the Thames Hub, a four-runway Thames Estuary airport capable of handling 150 million passengers a year . Danger: Medway Council say mixing the Liquefied Natural Gas import facility on the Isle of Grain, pictured, with a new airport would be a recipe for disaster . Lethal: The liquid gas for the area comes via the container port at the Isle of Grain, which protesters also say makes the area the wrong choice for an airport .","Chancellor George Osborne has apparently changed his mind on the move and is now in favour of the project .

Drop in at the French Embassy, Shanti Path, this weekend, and you could be the lucky one. The two-day Campus France Admission Tour 2012 opens on Saturday with the promise to offer admission to the brightest students in just 20 minutes - and the good news is that knowledge of French is not mandatory to make the grade. Campus France is a public policy initiative of the French government to promote higher education abroad and the Admission Tour 2012 will see as many as 25 top French institutions hitting the road (from Delhi they'll got to Bangalore and Mumbai) to spot the right candidates and make admission offers to them. Candidates will be selected on the basis of their academic merit and indepth interviews by the visiting university officials. 'We have plenty of options for every student, from engineering to management, language studies to hospitality,' says Bedojyoti Bhattacharjee, National Coordinator, Campus France India. Though in the public eye France is famous for its haute fashion and gastronomy, the admission tour will focus on the strengths of French institutions in such specialist areas as nanotechnology, aeronautics, embedded systems, water management and pure sciences. 'France has achievements to show in a number of little-known but important areas and we want to promote them,' says Renaud Viley, Deputy Attaché for University Cooperation at the Embassy of France in India. 'The French institutions sending their top officials to India are keen on recruiting the best Indian students to enhance their intellectual capital,' Viley adds. To make the invitation sweeter, the attaché points out that most of the management, business and technical programmes in French institutions of higher learning are conducted in English. Students also can avail of a number of higher education scholarships offered by the French government via the embassy. 'We give away 362 scholarships in 2011,' says Viley. 'This year too we will disburse around the same number of scholarships.' Campus France expects around 300 students from the Capital to attend the recruitment drive. And similar numbers in Mumbai and Bangalore before the delegation heads back to France on February 13. 'We will consider our mission to be a success if we manage to recruit at least 200 students from India by the end of this tour,' Viley says. Watch this space to see if they have done it. Asia is not the same as before. It is today defined by the rise of India and China. Singapore recognises this fact. There is also a broad spectrum of quality educational institutions now in India. It is no longer just the IITs. It also helps us that India is actively pursuing a Look East policy. Yes, it has. Five years ago I used to visit India only once a year on behalf of my university. Now I visit India at least six times a year. I find that the overall quality of the education infrastructure in the country has improved over the years. Brain drain is not something that has to be viewed in bad way. People who live and work abroad are the unofficial ambassadors of the country. The best way to handle the issue is by engaging with the Diaspora. Singapore has over 30,000 international students on its campuses. Of these, 5 to 10 per cent are Indian students. Engineering is a perennial favourite of Indian students, followed by Management. The universities also offer full scholarships to meritorious students. India is moving on the right track, but we have a lot of catching up to do. We need to keep pace with the rest of the world. As part of Australia's largest ever trade mission in India, government of Victoria has invited six universities to join the trade mission. The Vice Chancellors that are joining the trade mission include VCs Margaret Gardner from RMIT University, Jane Den Hollander from Deakin University, John Dewar from La Trobe University, and Linda Kristjanson from Swinburne University, while the University of Melbourne, Victoria University and University of Ballarat will be sending their senior delegates. Moving up: Six universities, including Deakin, will join the largest-ever trade delegation from Australia . Education being one of largest exports of Victoria, and having these universities taking part in the mission would help the state to enhance its reputation as a centre for world-class higher education. Big investment: Deakin's Country Director-India, Ravneet Pawha said the university invest $4million in research projects . Deakin University is going to continue to focus on research and academic collaborations during the mission. Deakin University founded its India office 15 years ago, and since then it has established 50 corporate partnership and around 14 academic collaborations. 'We will soon finish the Deakin-India Initiative that was stated four years ago. Under this Initiative, Deakin University made an investment of $4 million for four years in various research areas. Thirty PhD students based in India and enrolled at Deakin University are soon going to complete their programmes,' briefed Ravneet Pawha, Country Director-India, Deakin University. Professor Peter Hodgson, who has been instrumental in establishing partnerships in India, has travelled to India 50 times in the last five years. Talking about what would be the major areas of research that Deakin University is going to focus on in coming years, he said, 'In last few years we have worked in the fields of IT, engineering, biotechnology, biofuels and eye diseases. 'We will continue our work in these areas but public health, agricultural biotechnology and nanotechnology are other major fields we are looking at,' adding, 'Deakin is also setting up a research centre at TERI with a co-investment of $8-10 million.' Among various programmes that Deakin University offers, engineering, MBA, Film and Video Production are the sought-after degrees from the University. Deakin University has quite a good number of scholarships that it offers to International students, which again makes it a favourable choice for international students.","The CampusFrance Admission Tour 2012 road show will take place on February 4-5 (Saturday & Sunday) at the Embassy of France, Shanti Path, New Delhi.

Mr Heath, a grandfather, said his beloved Jack Russell terrier  began barking . 'pretty intensively'  as the family ate an evening meal at their home near Market Drayton, Shropshire. Lifesaver: Christian Heath is pictured with Bessie, whose constant barking alerted him to a huge blaze which had broken out in a stable block alongside his house . The fire destroyed the stable block, a garden room and 75 per cent of the roof of the home - as well as leaving a number of bedrooms and bathrooms severely damaged. 'My wife and I were having a meal with our two daughters, their husbands and children on Boxing Day at about 6.30pm,' said Mr Heath. Thankful: Christian Heath looks on proudly at his Jack Russell terrier with the fire-damaged home clearly visible in the background . 'Bessie was in the garden and started barking pretty intensively which made my wife get up and look through the window. 'It was only because of her persistent barking that we noticed the flames coming out of the stable block - Bessie warned us ten minutes before it started working its way through the roof.' Fire crews from Market Drayton, Oswestry and Shrewsbury, took more than 11 hours to bring the fire under control, with help from crews based in Staffordshire and Cheshire. 'It's quite a big house, with a garden room and loft above it that were both completely destroyed,' added Mr Heath. 'Thankfully, we were all untouched by the fire because of Bessie barking in the garden. 'She's always in the house, but that night she was wandering around outside and if it hadn't have been for her barking, I dread to think what would have happened.' The cause of the fire is unknown and the cost of the damage is now being assessed by loss adjusters.","Jack Russell terrier warned the family 10 minutes before fire took hold of home's roof .

"By . Toby Harnden In Milwaukee, Wisconsin . PUBLISHED: . 20:50 EST, 3 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:50 EST, 4 April 2012 . Mitt Romney last night stormed to a hat-trick of primary wins in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia, trouncing main rival Rick Santorum and all but securing the Republican nomination to face President Barack Obama in November. It was one of his biggest nights in three months of voting in the roller-coaster Republican battle. Romney’s resounding victory, following a string of big-name endorsements in the past week, means that he can now firmly lock his sights on Obama. With 98 delegates at stake, the former Massachusetts governor was on track to top 600 delegates, well over twice that of all his rivals combined. Scroll down for video of the speech . Victorious: Mitt Romney moved ever closer to the Republican presidential nomination after winning in Maryland, Wisconsin and Washington tonight . Although Romney needs 1,144 for outright . victory, which he was unlikely to secure until June, his lead is now all . but unassailable. In his victory speech in Milwaukee, Romney turned his fire on Obama, who earlier in the day had mentioned him by name publicly for the first time in recent months. Returning the compliment, Romney used Obama’s name 16 times and Santorum’s not once. Romney said: 'Under this President's watch, more Americans have lost their jobs than during any other period since the Depression. Millions have lost their homes, and a record number of Americans are living in poverty. 'And the most vulnerable have been hurt the most - over 30 per cent of single moms are struggling in poverty. 'New business start-ups are at the lowest level in 30 years, and our national debt is at a record high. And when you drive home tonight and stop at a gas station, just take a look at the prices and ask yourself, ""Four more years?""' Newt Gingrich has already cut back his staff and curtailed his campaigning while Ron Paul, the maverick Texas congressman, was intent on building his libertarian movement and not making a serious play to win primaries. Even Santorum has dampened down his anti-Romney rhetoric in recent days. Victorious: Mitt Romney greets the public during a campaign stop at a Cousins Subs fast food restaurant, in Waukesha, Wisconsin . Romney lambasted 'Barack Obama’s government-centred society', as a place where 'government spending will always increase because…there’s no reason to stop it' and 'there’s always someone who is entitled to something more, and who will vote for anyone who will give them something more'. With the next primaries taking place on April 24 in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, New York and Rhode Island, Romney has three weeks in which Santorum, a former US Senator for Pennsylvania will be under fierce pressure to pull out. Polls in Pennsylvania showed Romney closing the gap fast. Defeat in his home state for Santorum would be a devastating blow, not only ending his 2012 hopes but also damaging his future political prospects – a calculation that he may well be making in the coming days. On the back foot: Rick Santorum addresses supporters at his Wisconsin and Maryland primary night rally in Mars, Pennsylvania . In Milwaukee, Romney was introduced by Congressman Paul Ryan, a rising Republican star and one of the big endorsements Romney received last week. Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, is a top prospect to become Romney’s vice-presidential running mate. Earlier in the day, Obama had begun general election hostilities by criticising Romney for embracing Ryan’s budget proposal and even mocking his probable general election opponent for his somewhat old-fashioned language. 'He said that he’s ""very supportive"" of this new budget,' Obama said of Romney in a Washington speech. 'And he even called it ''marvellous,'' which is a word you don’t often hear when it comes to describing a budget. It’s a word you don’t hear generally.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:34 EST, 29 February 2012 . Responsibility: The Met Police should have informed Mark Duggan's family about the fatal shooting, the police complaints watchdog ruled . The Metropolitan Police has apologised to the family of Mark Duggan, whose shooting triggered last summer’s riots, for failing to inform them of his death. The apology was revealed after the Independent Police Complaints Commission upheld a complaint by the family that neither the Met or the IPCC formally notified them. Duggan was shot and killed by Metropolitan Police officers on August 4 in Tottenham, north London. The IPCC is still conducting a separate investigation into the full circumstances of the shooting. But it also looked into the Duggan family’s complaint that they were not formally notified of his death by either the police or the IPCC. IPCC commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said today: ‘The investigation is complete and has found that Mr Duggan’s parents were not informed of his death by the Metropolitan Police Service, whose responsibility it was, and I have upheld that complaint.’ The Met’s North Area Commander Mak Chishty said: ‘We recognise that it was the responsibility of the MPS to keep the family informed immediately following the shooting and up until it was handed over to the IPCC family liaison managers. ‘We acknowledge and apologise for the distress caused by not speaking directly to Mark Duggan’s parents Pamela Duggan and Bruno Hall. ‘I met with the family of Mark Duggan on 2 September 2011, and apologised to them directly on behalf of the MPS for the distress caused by officers not attending personally to inform them of their son’s death.’ Ms Cerfontyne also apologised for the way the IPCC dealt with the family. The Met and the IPCC were criticised in the wake of the shooting over their contact with the Duggan family. The family lodged a formal complaint about this in September. Ms Cerfontyne said that a police family liaison officer had spoken to two members of Duggan’s family at the scene and on the night of the shooting. The officer told the IPCC that he had confirmed to them with ‘99 per cent certainty’ that the man who had been shot by police was Duggan. Aftermath: Confusion among the police left Mark Duggan's mother 'hoping the worst had not happened', not knowing he had been fatally shot . Tensions: A police family liaison officer had spoken to two members of Duggan's family at the scene and on the night of the shooting . Shock: Officers say relatives spoken to at the scene on Ferry Lane, Tottenham, asked not to inform the Duggan family . The officer said the family members had asked the police not to go to the Duggan family home to formally notify his parents because it would be too much of a shock for them and said that they would do it themselves. Categorical: Fiancee Semone Wilson told the police watchdog that she did not tell family liaison officers she would inform Mark Duggan's parents . But Ms Cerfontyne said the two family members, who had introduced themselves as his sister and his partner, ‘are categorical that neither of them told the family liaison officers that the police should not visit Mr Duggan’s parents to tell them the news of his death, nor did they say that they would inform his parents themselves. ‘Indeed, both have said that they left the scene uncertain that the dead man was Mark Duggan, so in their view, they would not have been in a position to deliver such news to his parents.’ The IPCC took over family liaison on Friday August 5 and was told by the MPS that Duggan’s parents did not want direct contact. Ms Cerfontyne said: ‘In the aftermath of Mr Duggan’s death, his family were very confused and wanted to know what had happened to him. ‘They did not understand the role of the IPCC, nor that the organisation was separate from the police. ‘It . would have greatly assisted them if a senior representative of the IPCC . had visited the family home to introduce the organisation and explain . its role. ‘With the benefit . of hindsight, the IPCC should have explored the family’s wishes in more . depth following the handover from the police family liaison officers, . and not made the assumption that any wishes that may have been expressed . by the family in relation to the police would automatically extend to . the IPCC. ‘Mark’s mother . told us that she was receiving conflicting messages from various people . in the community and the lack of formal notification allowed her to hope . that the worst had not happened. Confused: Mark Duggan's family, seen attending his funeral, complained to the IPCC they were not given enough information about the circumstances surrounding his shooting in the immediate aftermath . ‘As she told me: ‘A mother’s worst nightmare is the police coming to your door to tell you that your child is dead. Because this did not happen, I believed the worst had not happened’.’ Ms Cerfontyne went on: ‘What is clear from this case is that a grieving family, suffering from shock, felt badly treated by the police and the IPCC. ‘The MPS has apologised to the family for the way in which Mr Duggan’s parents became aware of his death and I have told them how sorry I am that the IPCC did not provide more support, nor visit them the day after Mr Duggan’s death.’ Tottenham MP David Lammy said: ‘There were serious errors of judgment by both the IPCC and the Met in the days following Mark Duggan’s death. ‘It is any family’s worst nightmare to get a knock on the door telling them that their son or daughter has died. Mark Duggan’s parents weren’t even afforded that courtesy. ‘The IPCC have suffered from a significant credibility gap in Tottenham. They have accepted that they made mistakes - very serious mistakes, given the riots that followed. Now we need to see some significant reforms of the IPCC to make sure this never happens again.’ 'Credibility gap': Police relations with local communities have suffered significant damage since the shooting . Eruption: Two days after Duggan died, the Tottenham riots exploded after his family . spent five frustrating hours seeking a meeting and explanation from . local police chief . An investigation into the death of Duggan failed to establish the sequence of events concerning a handgun found at the scene. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) looked into the possibility he was carrying the weapon at the time of his death. A Home Affairs Select Committee study carried out into the cause of the riots later failed to isolate a single factor but found that the death of Duggan was a ‘trigger’. This led to widespread ‘copycat’ instances as looting spread to other English cities. The Metropolitan Police have since admitted they did not have enough officers available on the first night of the riots. They also found that reinforcements took too long to arrive as looting and rioting spread through the capital. The force later re-examined how it draws intelligence from social media like Twitter and Facebook. Keith Vaz, chairman of the House of Commons home affairs select committee, said: ‘Families deserve accurate up-to-date information when incidents such as this occur. ‘I welcome the apology by the Metropolitan Police and the thorough report by the IPCC.","Met Police had a responsibility to inform Mark Duggan's family .

Iain Duncan Smith last night signalled support for a major campaign to promote marriage and turn back the ‘appalling’ tide of divorce. The Work and Pensions Secretary, widely seen as the social conscience of the modern Conservative Party, indicated he was wholeheartedly behind a bid by High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge to end the ‘destructive scourge’ of family breakdown. Sir Paul will formally launch the Marriage Foundation today in a bid to raise awareness of the vital role of marriage in bringing up children. The senior family court judge said he felt compelled to speak out because of the unprecedented scale of the problem. He added: ‘I happen to think that the family judiciary have a contribution to make to this debate. Most of us have watched as the situation has gradually got more and more and more appalling and out of control and there comes a time when it is, I think, irresponsible to remain quiet. ‘This is now happening across Britain – and indeed Europe and North America – on a scale we have never seen before and the impact it has on the whole of society is very, very real and dramatic and we need to highlight it and do something about it.’ The initiative received a mixed reaction at Westminster yesterday. Mr Duncan Smith, whose social justice strategy paper earlier this year underlined the importance of marriage, indicated his support. Cool reaction: Ed Miliband (left) said politicians should avoid being judgmental on the issue while Ed Balls (right) said not everyone in a marriage had a good time . Saving marriage: The campaign will seek to raise awareness of the vital role getting married has in bringing up children . A source close to Mr Duncan Smith, who has been married to Betsy for 30 years, said: ‘He thinks it is a great campaign – it has his wholehearted support.’ But the Labour leadership responded coolly. Ed Miliband, who married 11 months ago, said he did not think politicians should be ‘judgmental’ on the question of whether people get married. And former Labour children’s secretary Ed Balls said that he and his wife Yvette Cooper – who wed 14 years ago – believed marriage was ‘a better way forward for our children’, but warned: ‘Not everyone in a marriage has a good time.’ High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge said family breakdown is 'destructive' Speaking at a press conference in London, he said: ‘What I’m not going to do is become moral or judgmental about people who aren’t married.’ Launching the Marriage Foundation in London tonight, Sir Paul will stress he is ‘not courting politicians’, saying they ‘did not create the current epidemic’ of divorce. But he adds: ‘If we are going to improve things, we need consistency of approach and for many years to come. On this issue the record of politicians and political parties is simply not reliable.’ The organisation will instead seek to set out the facts about the impact of family breakdown on children’s prospects and provide practical support for couples. It already has the backing of a string of senior family lawyers, including former president of the family division Baroness Butler-Sloss and divorce lawyer Baroness Shackleton, who represented Prince Charles and Sir Paul McCartney. Other high-profile backers include the Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks and the Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu. Research by the Centre for Social Justice think-tank found that 26 per cent of cohabiting parents had split up by the time their first child reached the age of five, compared with only 9 per cent of married parents. Another study has estimated the total cost of family breakdown to society at £44billion a year. Sir Paul yesterday accused celebrity magazines such as Hello! of promoting unrealistic expectations of marriage. He added: ‘We all know, all of us who have been in relationships – whether married or unmarried – for a long time is that the only way that they are made to work and the only way that they become really qualitatively good is by absolutely grinding away at it. ‘That’s when people find that, actually, if they get through the difficulties and do get the help, they will in fact end up with a product that is really worth having.’",Work and Pensions secretary signals his support for the major bid by Sir Paul Coleridge .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:43 EST, 16 January 2012 . Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton has warned a report that Iran is a year away from being able to build a nuclear bomb may be too optimistic. In a radio interview today, he said: 'I worry the publicly available information is giving only a very small picture and that Iran is actually even much further along.' Mr Bolton was speaking on Aaron Klein Investigative Radio on New York’s WABC Radio. John Bolton (left), pictured with U.S. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney (right), has warned of Iran's nuclear capability . The former ambassador was asked about a statement from a former head of U.N. nuclear inspections claiming Iran is now just a year or so away from having enough enriched uranium to assemble a nuclear bomb. Olli Heinonen wrote in an article published earlier this week that Iran made this advancement after switching production of its higher-grade enriched uranium to a new, underground site. Reacting to the one-year timeline, Mr Bolton stated: 'I think it can be even less than that.' He continued: 'They’ve got, by publicly available information from the International Atomic Energy Agency, enough low-enriched uranium that if enriched up to weapons grade would be enough for four weapons.' 'So they’ve got more work to do, but they are already well on their way,' he said. Mr Bolton told Klein that 2012 will be a key year to stop Iran’s nuclear program. 'Even Secretary of Defense Panetta said last month that Iran could have a nuclear device within a year,' he argued. 'So they are very close, and obviously if they stepped up their efforts and worked harder, they may well be able to do it before then. Negotiations: Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, right, talks with British Prime Minister David Cameron, far left, . 'So this is a clear and present danger,' he continued. 'And I think it’s one of the reasons why you see the tension now in the region and why 2012 is going to be such an important year.' In his article last week, Heinonen, who was the IAEA's director-general until 2010, said that building a stock of 250 kg of 20 per cent enriched uranium did not mean Iran could deploy a bomb without further engineering work. Still, he allowed that 20 per cent enriched uranium could within weeks be further purified to the 90 per cent necessary for weapons grade. Meanwhile, Iran today turned its attention . towards its Gulf neighbours, warning Saudi Arabia that it would suffer . consequences if they raised oil output to replace Iranian crude. Dead: Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan was killed in a magnetic bomb attack . With . the EU contemplating a ban on oil imports from Iran, for their refusal . to halt nuclear activity, Tehran officials have told several Arab . countries not to negotiate with the United States and Europe. The European Union is Iran's second biggest oil customer after China, buying some 450,000 barrels per day of its 2.6 million bpd exports. Its foreign ministers will meet on January 23. China's . premier was in Saudi Arabia on Sunday probing for greater access to its . huge oil and gas reserves and Britain voiced confidence a once hesitant . EU would soon ban oil imports from Iran. That follows British Prime Minister David Cameron's visit to the Saudi capital Riyadh where he discussed Iran's position with King Abdullah whilst also requesting an increased output from the Saudi reserves. Today, Saudi Arabia expressed doubts over Iran's claim it could block the main oil shipping route out of the Gulf and made clear it was ready to pump more oil after sanctions threatened to cut Iranian sales of crude. Brent crude rose above $111 on concerns about global oil supplies if sanctions freeze OPEC's second biggest producer out of the market or push it towards military conflict, while Saudi Arabia said it would work to stabilise the price at $100. Saudi Arabia, Iran's main rival for influence in the Middle East which would play a key role in replacing Iranian oil in he event of an embargo, played down Tehran's talk of closing the Strait of Hormuz, the vital shipping lane for Gulf exports. 'I personally do not believe that the Strait, if it were shut, will be shut for any length of time. The world cannot stand for that,' Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told CNN. 'I don't think all these pronouncements are helpful to the international oil market or to the price of oil. It's really disturbing.' Iran's warning to its Gulf Arab neighbours not to raise oil output to replace its crude appeared to have fallen on deaf ears. Mr Naimi said Riyadh could increase production by about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) 'almost immediately'. Killing: This is the car the Iranian scientist was sitting in when he was blown up by the magnetic bomb . 'Our wish and hope is we can stabilise this oil price and keep it at a level around $100,' Mr Naimi said. Iran has been in turmoil following the . fifth bomb attack in two years that killed 32-year-old Mostafa Ahmad . Roshan in Tehran last Wednesday. Ratcheting up the war of words with the West, the Iranians claimed that they have proof that the CIA was behind the killing. They also sent a ‘letter of condemnation’ to Britain accusing London of having an ‘obvious role’ in the bombing. Both Britain and the United States have . condemned the killing of civilians. Israeli officials, in contrast, have . hinted at covert campaigns against Iran without admitting involvement. It . said that the chain of assassinations began after British intelligence . chief Sir John Sawers hinted in 2010 at undercover operations against . the Islamic Republic. Sir . John was quoted at the time as saying that intelligence-led initiatives . were needed to make it more difficult for countries like Iran to develop . nuclear weapons. He said . one of the agency’s roles was to investigate efforts by states to build . atomic warheads in violation of their international legal obligations . and identify ways to slow down their access to vital materials and . technology. Aftermath: The killing has sparked outrage in . Iran, and state TV broadcast footage Saturday of hundreds of students . marching in Tehran . The letter said the killing of . Iranian nuclear scientists had ‘started exactly after the British . official John Sawers declared the beginning of intelligence operations . against Iran.’ The Iranian Foreign Ministry handed a . letter claiming it had evidence the US plotted the scientist’s death to . the Swiss Ambassador in Tehran. Switzerland . has represented American interests in Iran since relations were broken . off with Washington shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution. ‘We . have reliable documents and evidence that this terrorist act was . planned, guided and supported by the CIA,’ said the note, according to . Iran’s state media. Tehran . has urged the United Nations Security Council to condemn the latest . killing, claiming it was carried out to undermine its nuclear ambitions. General . Masoud Jazayeri, spokesman for Iran’s Joint Armed Forces Staff, said: . ‘The enemies of the Iranian nation, especially the United States, . Britain and the Zionist regime, or Israel, have to be held responsible . for their activities.’ On a mission: U.S. Army General Martin Dempsey will head to Israel for discussions . While the Iranians insist they are . merely trying to harness nuclear power for energy uses, the West and . Israel says Tehran wants to build bombs. Iran has threatened to close off the . key oil shipping route through the Strait of Hormuz if new sanctions are . imposed on its lifeblood oil exports. Britain and other western powers have vowed to take military action to keep the channel open. Senior . U.S. military officials said mine-sweeping dolphins would be the first . line of offence if Iran carried out its threat to choke off the Strait. The . Navy-trained dolphins would be used to identify Iranian mines, . according to retired Admiral Tim Keating, former commander of the US 5th . Fleet in Bahrain. In talks: President Obama, left, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the Iran situation via telephone . The . top U.S. military commander is scheduled for talks in Israel this week . at a time when the U.S. is concerned that Israel might be preparing to . attack Iran over its nuclear program. The Israeli Defence Ministry . confirmed the planned visit Thursday by Army General Martin Dempsey, the . chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. It did not give his agenda . for talks with Israelis - but Iran is expected to be at the top. Israel considers a nuclear-armed Iran . to be an existential threat because of its nuclear program, missile . capabilities, support for anti-Israel militants in Lebanon and Gaza and . frequent references by its president to the destruction of Israel. Israel has repeatedly hinted it might take military action if international sanctions fail to stop Iran's nuclear development. The . U.S., Israel and other Western nations believe Iran is developing . atomic weapons. Tehran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful . purposes. Gen Dempsey's visit will be his first official trip to Israel since he assumed command of the joint chiefs on September 30. His predecessor, Admiral Mike Mullen, made several visits to Israel during his four-year term. On Thursday President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the Iran situation in a telephone conversation. The Obama administration is concerned that Iran's recent claim that it is expanding nuclear operations with more advanced equipment may push Israel closer to a strike. The U.S. still hopes that international pressure will persuade Iran to back down, but the Islamic regime shows no sign it would willingly give up a project that has become a point of national pride. The U.S. has led a series of economic sanctions against the regime. On Sunday, Israeli Cabinet Minister Moshe Yaalon said he was disappointed that the U.S. has not expanded the measures to further damage Iran's central bank and its energy industry.","Magnetic bomb killed scientist in Tehran last week - the FIFTH attack in two years .

A paedophile who kept pictures of dead babies on his computer was jailed for 18 months yesterday. David Adams, 65, had the images from post-mortems in a file marked 'Dead Kids' within his huge cache of pornography. Also on the computer at his home in Harlesden, North-West London,  were thousands of images of young children being raped and tortured. Prosecutor Peter Zinner told Southwark Crown Court that the sick images were a 'new benchmark of depravity'. 'The prosecution has never seen such appalling images for sexual gratification,' he said . More than 150,000 images were found in a police raid on Adams's home in 2009. Of the stash, around 11,000 were judged by officers to be in the most serious category - including depicting rape and torture. Twenty two images were taken from post-mortem examinations and showed the bodies of children up to two years old. But the sentence given to means he could be released from jail in as little as nine months. Depraved: Adams was jailed for 18 months at Southwark Crown Court .

We'll be appealing to the attorney general. He needs at least six years to even start addressing his behaviour.' Adams admitted making indecent images of children.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:19 EST, 3 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:19 EST, 3 April 2012 . The civil lawsuit against Florida polo millionaire John Goodman has been dropped, most likely because a settlement – rumoured to be in the tens of millions of dollars – has been reached with the victim’s parents. Last week, Goodman, 48, was convicted of drunk-driving manslaughter that left a 23-year-old college student dead, and faces up to 30 years in prison at sentencing later this month. Lili and William Wilson, parents of Scott Wilson, requested the case be dropped ‘with prejudice,' which usually means a settlement has been reached. Polo tycoon: John Goodman faces 30 years in jail for the crash which happened when he was two times over the legal limit for driving. He has insisted the whole way through the trial he is innocent . While the court papers offer no hint of the settlement’s terms, both the Orlando Sun-Sentinel and the Palm Beach Post report that it is believed to be tens of millions of dollars. Mr and Mrs Wilson’s attorneys, Christian Searcy and Scott Smith, told the Sun-Sentinel that they do not wish to comment on the settlement until Goodman is sentenced on April 30. Goodman’s attorney Daniel Bachi declined comment. News swirled the night before Goodman’s DUI trial that a settlement had been reached. Last week, a jury Goodman guilty of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide in the . February 12, 2010 crash that killed 23-year-old Scott Wilson. Police say a drunken Goodman, the . founder of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Florida, rammed his . black Bentley convertible into Wilson's car two years ago, causing it . to roll into a canal. He left the scene and waited an hour to call 911 . while Scott drowned. Verdict: John Goodman, 48, reacts as he is found guilty of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide in court last week for his role in the death of Scott Wilson . Justice: Lili Wilson, mother of Scott Wilson who died in the crash leaves the courtroom after the guilty verdict was read out . After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 per cent, more than twice the legal driving limit. Scott Wilson was only 23 years old when he was killed in the car crash . The tycoon took the stand at his . trial on Wednesday to give his account of the night of the crash, when . the impact overturned Scott's vehicle, sending it into a canal where . the 23-year-old drowned. 'I don’t know what happened,' the International Polo Club founder claimed while on the stand. But Goodman said he was sure of one thing: he had two shots of tequila and two shots of vodka before the crash, yet he was not drunk. After leaving a bar, he said his car suddenly lurched forward into an intersection 'and I began to apply my brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used to,' he said. Unable to control the vehicle, it slammed into the side of Scott's - even though Goodman said he was not aware he had hit another driver so left the scene. If he had known someone had plunged into the canal, 'I would have done whatever I could have done to help', he claimed. Goodman then went to a nearby barn where he found a bottle of liquor, the Miami Herald reported. 'I ... drank it to alleviate, thinking it would help with my pain,' he said, claiming it was the reason . his blood alcohol content was more than double the legal driving level . when his blood was taken three hours after the crash. Impact: The crumpled car driven by Wilson, left, and the Bentley driven by Goodman, right. Goodman said he drank from a bottle of liquor he found after the crash - the reason he was over the limit . Deadly: Wilson family members look at the Bentley Goodman was driving when he ran a stop sign in 2010 . Prosecutor Ellen Roberts probed why Goodman had failed to notice he had hit another vehicle. A 911 call played to the jurors revealed Goodman knew he had had a serious accident. 'It tore the daylights out of your car. It totaled it,' Roberts said. 'What did you think you hit?' 'I’d, I, did not know, I could’ve — I did not know what I hit,' Goodman stammered, the Herald reported. Engineers for the prosecution and defence testified on whether the system controlling the millionaire's Bentley engine throttle could have malfunctioned, leading to the crash. Defense engineer Luka Serdar said there were several error . codes on the computer system in Goodman’s Bentley - but that pressing the brakes would still have stopped the car. For the prosecution, Tom Livernois said the damage . to the engine throttle would have been caused by the crash itself, adding there there was no way the car suddenly . accelerated before the collision. Expert: Luka Serdar, a forensic engineer for the defense, shows how a dual throttle system works at the trial. He said there were error codes on Goodman's but that the brakes would have worked . Grieving: Lili Wilson, the victim's mother, wept when Goodman's 911 call was played in court last week . Bill: The court is shown Goodman's receipt for drinks, allegedly bought for himself and others before the crash . Describing the smell of alcohol, the police officer told the court he had to let down the windows of his patrol car 'to let it just clear out'. Robert, an emergency medical technician who was at the scene, agreed that Goodman appeared to have been drinking. 'I felt he had a couple of drinks. He stated that to us,' Perreault told the court, but added that he did not believe Goodman has consumed a large amount of alcohol. Goodman's girlfriend, Heather Hutchins, 42, also testified last week to say Goodman told her he had been in an accident but did not mention a car malfunction or having a head injury. Newest family member: Goodman, right, adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins last fall. The move means she is entitled to up to a third of his biological children's $300 million trust fund . In a stunning move last October, Goodman adopted Hutchins, entitling her to up to a third of his biological children's trust fund, worth $300million. Circuit Judge Glenn Kelly had previously ruled that the trust funds set up for his two biological children were off-limits in the lawsuit, according to the Palm Beach Post. The adoption papers state that Ms Hutchins, who has been dating the millionaire since 2009 and is now his legal child, is immediately entitled to at least a third of his trust. The Wilsons' attorney, Scott Smith, told the Palm Beach Post that Goodman was attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets. Lap of luxury: The International Polo Club, which Goodman founded, attracts A-list celebrities . Home sweet home: Goodman sold his mansion in Wellington, Florida to his children's trust for $3.8million and now pays $2,000 in rent each month . Goodman’s civil attorney Dan Bachi told MyFoxOrlando.com that the adoption was meant to secure the assets of his children and family investments, nothing more. 'It has nothing to do with the lawsuit currently pending against him,’ Mr Bachi said. Wilson was a University of Central Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer at the time of the crash.

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 06:31 EST, 26 December 2011 . Football star: Adriano won Serie A, the Italian football championship, four times while playing for Inter Milan . Brazil football star Adriano accidentally shot a woman in his car with his bodyguard's gun, it has been claimed. Adriene Cyrilo Pinto, 20, was hit in her left hand and needed surgery following the incident outside a Rio de Janerio nightclub. The former Inter Milan forward, 29, had reportedly left a party at Barra Music club with four young women at 6am on Christmas Eve when the incident happened. Ms Pinto told police the footballer was fooling around with his bodyguard's .44 calibre pistol in the back seat of the BMW when it accidentally went off and hit her. Police sergeant Amilton Dias told Brazil's Record TV that the footballer had taken out the gun's magazine and was showing off to the women, who he was taking back to his home. However, he did not realise there was still a bullet lodged inside the barrel. Police Sergrant Dias said: 'The player, Adriano, with the gun in his hand, stupidly waved the firearm in the direction of the passengers. That's when the shot was discharged accidentally.' He added that the player, who this year won the Brazilian Championship with Sao Paulo giants Corinthians, called an ambulance for Ms Pinto but did not hand himself into police. Two of the other women who were in the car, both aged 28, later contested Ms Pinto's version of events, claiming she had shot herself in the hand in a deliberate attempt to attract publicity. Adriano - full name Adriano Leite Ribeiro - spent Christmas Eve being interrogated by police. Probe: Police in Rio de Janerio inspect the BMW which the 20-year-old woman was sat inside when she was shot by mistake . He insists that he was sitting in the front passenger seat of the car and never touched the gun, which the bodyguard had placed underneath the driver's seat. Police said that tests had been carried out on the hands of both Adriano and Ms Pinto to determine who had been holding the gun, and results would be ready in eight days. A spokesman for the Barra D'Or Hospital said she had suffered a fracture to her index finger but no arteries or tendons had been damaged. She will undergo reconstructive surgery on her hand tomorrow. Adriano, who won Serie A four times while at Inter Milan, has seen his career go off the rails in recent years because of problems with his weight, alcohol and depression. The firearms incident was not his first brush with Brazilian authorities. In 2010, he was accused of having dealings with drug traffickers in Rio but police did not press charges because of a lack of evidence. Gunshot: A bullet hole can be seen on the white BMW after the young woman was shot after Adriano left a nightclub in the city . The investigation began after photos appeared on the internet of the striker holding a rifle, which Adriano later claimed was a toy. In 2009 he was also accused of buying a motorcycle in the name of his mother and then delivering it to one of the heads of a trafficking gang in a Rio favela. And last year police decided not to press charges despite 'strong indictions' the player had transferred the equivalent of £20,000 to one of Rio's most notorious drug lords. Adriano denied the accusation, saying the money was to buy food baskets for poor families. In February this year, Adriano's driving license was suspended after he refused to take a breathalyser test after he was stopped by the police while leaving another nightclub party.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:29 EST, 30 June 2011 . Anthony Mills is facing up to 20 years behind bars . A drugs baron who created the 'Tesco' of the cannabis trade is facing up to 20 years behind bars. Anthony Mills, 43, hid super-strong skunk weed worth £61million inside crates of flowers from Holland. The method recently formed the plot for an episode of the BBC crime drama 'The Shadow Line'. Mills, the boss of the 'Flowers Gang', was described as one of Britain's most wanted fugitives before he was arrested in Holland in March last year. Between June 2006 and November 2007, Mills' syndicate moved 18 tons of cannabis through UK ports, making £22million in profits. Mills . also oversaw a massive money-laundering operation, setting up companies . in international tax havens to hide the gang's profits. But . they made so much money they could they could not dispose of it quickly . enough. When police raided safe houses they recovered wads of £20 notes . literally rotting away. Although he was photographed at . 'board meetings' at the group's Surrey base, Mills spent most of his . time in Holland liaising with his Dutch suppliers. When police swooped on his co-conspirators, he was able to evade capture, but was finally arrested in Amsterdam last year. Terrence Bowler, left, was last year jailed for 16 years for his role in the operation, while Mark Kinnimont was sentenced to 14 years . Mills' deputy Terrence Bowler was jailed for 16 years in March 2010, while two more gang 'directors', Peter Moran and Mark Kinnimont, each received 14-year sentences. After he was convicted by the jury, Judge Gregory Stone, QC, told Mills: 'I think you are under no illusions about the position you are in.' Mills replied: 'That's correct, Judge Stone.' The skunk weed was grown in vast greenhouses hidden among legitimate crops. The . gang paid £2,200 per kg for the drug, before selling it on to regional . wholesalers in the UK at £3,400 who traded it on the street for £5,760 . per kg. Regular shipments arrive at Harwich port in East Anglia, with shrink-wrapped packages of skunk hidden inside boxes of flowers. The . crates were delivered to a warehouse in Chatham, Kent, where the drugs . were separated out and ferried on to secure lock-ups in Kingston, . Worcester Park, Epsom and Ashtead in Surrey. Dirty money: The gang had so much cash they were not able to dispose of it quickly enough, with some being left to rot . When a shipment of drugs was intercepted in July 2008, the gang simply switched their operation to a warehouse in Leeds, via the port of Hull. Prosecutor Timothy Cray said: 'If the man pushing cannabis on the street, the small-time dealer, is equivalent to the market trader selling his fruit and veg outside London Bridge station, then this group were the big players, the Tesco. 'Anthony Mills was the director of this Tesco.' The gang's 'board of directors' was under surveillance at Cafe Rouge in Esher, Surrey, on October 22, 2008, as Mills totted up the profits on a calculator. Police also followed both Mills and Bowler to Geneva in Switzerland, where they were spotted having lunch with employees of a bank where some of the money was laundered. Mills' gang's activities were echoed in an episode of she Shadow Line, which stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, left, Stephen Rea, centre, and Christopher Eccleston . Detectives are now liaising with colleagues in other countries to try to unravel the network of overseas assets built up by the gang, ahead of confiscation hearings. The organisation's turnover in the period covered by the investigation is estimated at £61m, and its profit at £22m. Mills, of no fixed address, was unanimously convicted of conspiracy to import cannabis and conspiracy to conceal the proceeds of drug supply. He earlier admitted laundering money on behalf of others. During the trial he tried to claim that he had only helped the gang to clean up its profits, but was not part of its inner circle. He will be sentenced on July 22. Bowler, of Kingston-upon-Thames, Kinnimont, of Surbiton, Surrey, Moran, of  Fulham, west London, admitted conspiracy to import drugs and money laundering.","Anthony Mills smuggled drugs in crates of flowers from Holland .

A handyman was convicted yesterday of suffocating a cleaning lady and stuffing her body in an air-conditioning duct in a deserted office tower where they worked at night. Joseph Pabon, 27, was found guilty of the kidnap and murder of Eridania Rodriguez in July 2009. Mrs Rodriguez, 46, disappeared while working a night shift cleaning at a skyscraper in Manhattan's downtown financial district. Her body was found after an extensive four-day search. Guilty: Joseph Pabon, 27, faces life in prison after smothering Eridania Rodriguez and stuffing her body in an air duct . Pabon, 27, has denied killing the married mother-of-three. His lawyers said authorities had woven a criminal case out of coincidences and innocent conduct. However jurors concluded he abducted the woman as she worked and smothered her, covering her mouth with industrial tape. He faces up to life in prison when he is sentenced on May 11. Mrs Rodriguez's sister, Denise Figueroa, wept as she left the New York courthouse. 'It's Joseph Pabon's turn now to suffer,' Mrs Figueroa said. 'You don't call that person a human being — he's an animal.' Defense lawyer Mario Gallucci noted that although Pabon was convicted of a murder charge that involved killing in the course of another felony, kidnapping, he was acquitted of equally serious counts of intentional murder and reckless murder. Mr Gallucci said: 'That said a lot to . me. It said that the jurors listened, they deliberated and they thought . about it during two full days of deliberations.' Night worker: Eridania Rodriguez, 46, cleaned in a Manhattan skyscraper during the night when she was killed by handyman Joseph Pabon who worked in the same building . The lawyer said he would explore possibilities for an appeal. The Manhattan district attorney's office said Pabon tracked Mrs Rodriguez down and killed her on a deserted floor of the building, a few blocks from the World Trade Center site. Prosecutors said he hid her body in the air vent and then told co-workers he was sick and went home early. 'He senselessly and brutally murdered her and discarded her body as if it were trash,' District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr said. It's Joseph Pabon's turn now to suffer. You don't call that person a human being - he's an animal. Denise Figueroa, victim's sister . Pabon's DNA was found on Rodriguez's fingernails, and he had scratches on his neck. He took unusual and unnecessary routes through the building that night and wasn't seen on security cameras for 42 minutes after asking a co-worker where the cleaning woman was, prosecutors said. The evidence 'crushingly proves that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Christine Keenan told jurors in a closing argument. But Pabon's lawyers said authorities rushed to judgment in charging him and misinterpreted blameless behavior as sinister. Pabon went home early simply because he truly was sick, the DNA sample could have come from routine work contact between Pabon and Mrs Rodriguez and the scratches could have come from heavy lifting at his job, the defense said. DNA from two unidentified men was collected in the case and police said vagrants sometimes slept in the building's stairwells, defense lawyers noted. 'That man right there didn't do a thing. Nothing,' Mr Gallucci said in his closing argument. Pabon, whose family is originally from Puerto Rico, had worked at the building for a few years. Mrs Rodriguez, originally from San Francisco de Macoris in the Dominican Republic, was married with three children and had worked at the building for a year. Her bodybuilder brother, Victor Martinez, is a high-ranked competitor who has won the Arnold Classic, an annual event promoted by Arnold Schwarzenegger.","Joseph Pabon, 27, smothered Eridania Rodriguez while they were working a night shift .

Former Scotland Yard counter-terrorism chief John Yates attended the wedding of the News of the World’s ex-crime editor, the Leveson Inquiry heard today. Journalist Lucy Panton said Mr Yates was just one of 'many' police officers of all ranks who were guests when she married a Scotland Yard detective. She told the inquiry: 'There were a few people at my wedding who I would class as working friends, who I didn’t socialise with outside of work. Close: The former News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton, left, told the Leveson Inquiry today that former Scotland Yard counter-terrorism chief John Yates, right, was a guest at her wedding . 'Mr Yates falls into that category. I certainly got on well with him. I had a good rapport with him. 'But we didn’t socialise outside of work. The wedding was the only occasion.' Ms Panton added that Mr Yates attended the wedding of fellow crime reporter Jeff Edwards, who worked for the Daily Mirror from 1992 until he retired in 2008. Ms Panton was told by a news editor to 'call in all those bottles of champagne' to get inside information about a terrorist plot from Mr Yates in October 2010, the press standards inquiry has heard. But the former News of the World crime editor said this was just 'banter' from one of her bosses, insisting: 'There were no bottles of champagne.' She said: 'I think he was putting pressure on me to get a story. Wedding: Lucy Panton said Mr Yates was just one of 'many' police officers of all ranks who were guests when she married a Scotland Yard detective . 'I would call that banter. It’s a way that people spoke to each other in our office.' She added: 'I think they hoped that we would be able to ring these people up and bring in exclusives every week. 'The reality is they know that doesn’t happen, unfortunately, otherwise we would have had bigger and better crime stories than we did. 'My recollection of this is that I did phone Mr Yates, and I don’t believe I actually got to speak to him. That was the reality, week in, week out.' Ms Panton also played down the significance of former Scotland Yard communications chief Dick Fedorcio letting her use his office computer and personal email account to file a story about controversial ex-police commander Ali Dizaei in February 2010. Under pressure: Ms Panton also played down the significance of former Scotland Yard communications chief Dick Fedorcio, pictured, letting her use his office computer to file a story . She said she was under pressure to send her article to her news editors so it could be edited for that weekend’s paper. 'In . the olden days I think people used to knock on doors - strangers, . random residents - to use telephones when they were under pressure,' she . told the hearing. 'I think on this occasion journalistic instinct took over and I did what it took to get the newsdesk off my back.' The inquiry has heard that former Met assistant commissioner Andy Hayman spent £47 on a bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne while drinking with a female News of the World journalist at the Oriel restaurant in Chelsea on the evening of February 1, 2007. Ms Panton said today she is 'confident' she was not the reporter in question. She said Mr Yates and Mr Hayman were 'not so forthcoming' as some of her other police sources, adding: 'As a crime reporter you would hope that all your contacts were more forthcoming than they actually were.' The former crime editor told the inquiry she found it 'rather bizarre' that there seemed to be so much interest in whether or not she drank champagne. She said in a written statement: 'I enjoy champagne but do not drink it often. 'I have two children, meaning I was trying to get pregnant, pregnant and breast feeding for a large amount of the time of the period in question, so therefore was unable to drink much alcohol for much of the period in question. 'I believe that a distorted picture has been presented of how journalists carry out their business. 'We do not live a champagne lifestyle and the reality of the day-to-day grind of journalism is far from glamorous. 'Other crime journalists and I work hard in a fast moving business covering often horrendous crimes, to help bring the culprits to justice and break stories that are of public interest.' Ms Panton, who is married to a Scotland Yard detective, was arrested in December on suspicion of making corrupt payments to police officers. She was later bailed and has not been charged.","Lucy Panton says the former Scotland Yard counter-terrorism chief was one of 'many' police officers who were guests at her wedding .

A jealous father who stabbed his ex-partner to death in broad-daylight while he was on police bail for harassing her has been jailed for 23 years. David Palmer, 40, repeatedly knifed Kerry Smith, 29, after lying in wait for her as she left her local shop. The blonde mother died of multiple stab wounds shortly after the attack in Blackheath High Street, West Midlands, in July last year. Murder: David Palmer, 40, repeatedly knifed Kerry Smith, 29, after lying in wait for her as she left her local shop - he flipped after she refused to let him see their 19-month-old daughter Samantha because she feared he would kill them both . Chillingly, just days before the murder, Kerry confided in friend Joanne Adams, telling her she feared Palmer would kill her. She told her: 'I’m going to die and my daughter is going to grow up without a mum. 'I’ll definitely be dead next time.' The court heard Palmer flipped after Kerry refused to let him see their 19-month-old daughter Samantha because she feared he would kill them both. Miss Smith had left the shop at 11.40am on Sunday, July 31 when she was stabbed three times by Palmer. She was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead a short time later. At the time of the killing, Palmer was on bail for harassing Miss Smith after a series of brutal attacks on her at her home. He was also serving a suspended prison sentence after being convicted of beating her with a broom handle. Palmer was jailed for life and ordered to serve at least 23 years at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Tuesday. Sentencing him, Judge John Warner told him: 'It is not surprising that she feared that one day you would kill her. Crime scene: Kerry had just left a local shop at 11.40am on Sunday, July 31 when she was stabbed three times by Palmer . 'It was a fear she expressed in those final days of her life.' It emerged that before her death Kerry wrote a letter sent to the father of a domestic abuse murder victim expressing her fears that Palmer would kill her. She became pen pals with Michael Brown, whose daughter, 36-year-old mother Clare Wood, from Salford, Greater Manchester, was strangled and set alight by a man she met on Facebook in 2009. In the letter Kerry said she feared that one day Palmer would kill her or their daughter Samantha. And just months before her death Kerry begged police to help her, telling them: 'I’m totally and utterly scared that David is going to try and kill me.' During the four-week trial, the jury was shown shocking CCTV footage of Palmer lying in wait for Kerry as she entered a shop in Blackheath High Street, West Midlands, at 11.30am last year. Palmer crouched behind a wooden board before launching a frenzied attack on the helpless mum and stabbing her three times. Palmer, of Rowley Regis, West Midlands, admitted manslaughter but was convicted of murder after a jury took just one hour 20 minutes to return a unanimous guilty verdict last week. Tragic: During the four-week trial, the jury was shown shocking CCTV footage of Palmer lying in wait for Kerr as she entered a shop in Blackheath High Street, West Midlands, at 11.30am last year . The court was told how Kerry lived in a state of 'abject terror' of Palmer, who was described as 'a man consumed with jealousy, anger and hatred' who would regularly beat Kerry. The jury were also told about Palmer’s violent history and how a terrified Kerry had called the police on numerous occasions following his threatening or violent behaviour. In 2010, Palmer received a suspended prison sentence when he pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm after he attacked her in March that year. Jurors heard how Palmer had beaten her with a broom handle and then punched her several times, leaving her with a fractured left rib and bruising to her head. Over the next two years, the jury were told of Palmer’s failure to leave Miss Smith alone - constantly calling at her mother’s home and making violent threats. The court then heard Miss Smith wrote to a friend on July 27 2011, just three days before her death. In it she wrote: 'I’ve been through a violent relationship. He hit me and when I left him and went to live with my mum, he broke into my mum’s house and broke my ribs. 'His bail conditions are not to come anywhere near my road and not to contact me in any way. 'I’m now that terrified that I sleep with my head up against the bedroom door and Samantha in bed with me. 'I really do think that these bail conditions are not going to stop him as that if he’s found not guilty (of the harassment) he will just keep coming. 'What if he gets into my house and takes mine or my daughters, or both of our lives?' Alan Kent QC, prosecuting, told the court: 'She (Kerry Smith) actually thought that one day he would kill her. That day came on Sunday July 31.' Speaking after Tuesday’s hearing, Detective Inspector Simon Astle, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Palmer will not be eligible for parole until 2035 and remain behind bars after that time if he is still deemed a potential danger to the public. 'David Palmer is a jealous, controlling and violent man. 'Armed with a knife he went to an area where he knew Kerry would be and stabbed her before running off and leaving her bleeding to death on the pavement. 'He intended to kill her and in doing so finally exerted the ultimate control over her.'","David Palmer flipped after Kerry Smith refused to let him see their 19-month-old daughter Samantha because she feared he would kill the pair .

The vessel, predecessor of Nelson's famous flagship, went down in a storm off the Channel Islands in 1744, taking more than 1,000 soldiers to their deaths. Along with a bronze cannon collection, some believe the ship was carrying a large quantity of gold coins from Lisbon to Britain, which would now be worth a reported £500 million. Historic: Admiral Sir John Balchin went down with the ship, HMS Victory . The original HMS Victory (as illustrated left) is due to be raised sea. It was the predecessor to the famous ship captained by Admiral Nelson (pictured right) The wreck is to be handed over to the Maritime Heritage Foundation, which is expected to employ Odyssey Marine Exploration to carry out the recovery.

"By . Reuters Reporter . UPDATED: . 17:46 EST, 8 February 2012 . Birth and abortion rates among U.S. teens fell to record lows in 2008 as increased use of contraceptives sent the overall teen pregnancy rate to its lowest level since at least 1972, a study showed today. But disparities among racial and ethnic groups continued to persist, with black and Hispanic teens experiencing pregnancy and abortion rates two to four times higher than their white peers, the Guttmacher Institute, the nonprofit sexual health research group that conducted the analysis, said. The Guttmacher researchers looked at government statistics on teenage sex, pregnancies and births, as well as the institute's own data on abortions for 2008, the most recent year the numbers were available. Historic low: Birth and abortion rates among American teens has fallen to record lows . They found that nearly 750,000 women under age of 20 were pregnant in 2008 - nearly 98 per cent of them between the ages of 15 and 19. That translated into a pregnancy rate of 67.8 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19, the researchers said, the lowest pregnancy rate seen since 1972, the year before the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade that established a woman's right to an abortion. It was also down 42 percent from 1990, when teen pregnancies in the U.S. peaked at 116.9 per 1,000 teen girls and women. The teen abortion rate in 2008 dropped to the lowest rate seen since 1972 at 17.8 per 1,000 teen girls and women, the analysis found, and was down 59 per cent from 1988 when the abortion rate peaked at 43.5 per 1,000 teen women. Televised: Popular reality shows like Teen Mom, which doesn't glamourise pregnancy, may also play a factor in declining teen pregnancy rates . The Guttmacher researchers said the decline in teen birthrates was largely attributable to increased contraceptive use by teens of both genders. 'Teens are also using more effective forms of contraception,' said Kathryn Kost, a demographer with the Guttmacher Institute who co-authored the analysis. Among women aged 15 to 17, about a quarter of the long-term decline in pregnancies, births and abortions could be attributable to reduced sexual activity, the researchers said. But pregnancy, birth and abortion rates remained much higher for teens who belonged to minority groups, even though their overall rates have fallen over the past four decades. Debate: The newest figures show the lowest pregnancy rate since 1972, the year before Roe v. Wade established a woman's right to an abortion . Birth rates for black and Hispanic teens were more than twice those of their white peers in 2008, the researchers found. The abortion rate among black teens, meanwhile, was four times higher than the rate for their Caucasian counterparts. Abortion rates for Hispanic teens were twice as high as for their white peers. The Guttmacher study was funded with grants from The California Wellness Foundation, The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the Ford Foundation.","Abortion rate at lowest level since Roe v.

It was reported the supermarket  has 20 per cent of the expanding venison market and is looking to double its sales. Typically, strongest sales are November to January. Sensing the growing market, the Co-operative will stock venison for the first time next month. Venison - the ultimate low fat red meat - is used in Jamie Oliver's venison and juniper stew as well as other TV chefs such as Delia Smith who uses it in her venison steaks with cranberry cumberland sauce recipe and Rachel Koo's venison wellington has also helped popularise the meat . Venison fans believe it is the ideal meat because it is lean and full of flavour - it has a third of the fat of chicken. Apparently venison stew is Prince William's favourite dish - he is said to have eaten it last weekend with the Duchess of Cambridge when they celebrate their first weeding anniversary. Marks & Spencer has reported it sold three times as much venison last year as in 2010.

Waitrose meat buyer Andy Boulton told Meat News: 'Venison has been a significant growth area. 'We want to be able to provide a supply of quality venison all year round and to do that we have to import some from New Zealand, but we are working closely with both groups of farmers and they are operating to the same welfare and slaughter standards. Farmed venison offers more consistency than wild venison' he said. Sensing the growing market, the Co-operative will stock venison for the first time next month.

They have already turned to country parks such a Harewood Park in Hertfordshire and Woburn Abbey estate in Bedfordshire. The Yorkshire Venison Centre, who now have to import alot of their stock from New Zealand,  said they have noticed a steady increase in popularity, which can be attributed to both TV chefs and health conscious consumers. 'We are trying to convince more farmers to become venison farmers. People prefer farmed meat as to wild meat, which can be lovely, but is not always consistent. When you hear about dairy farmers going out of business, we think they could become deer farmers and we are trying to persuade them to see how easy it can be if they already have the grass.' Deer can be classified as wild deer, . park deer (reared in herds that roam parklands) or farmed deer (rearing . varies from free-range to intensive). The most common varieties of deer in the UK are red, fallow and roe. Ingredients . • 4 tablespoons plain flour• sea salt and freshly ground black pepper• 800g stewing venison or beef, cut into 2cm chunks• olive oil• 2 onions, peeled and roughly chopped• 3 carrots, peeled and roughly chopped• 2 sticks of celery, trimmed and roughly chopped• 1 tablespoon juniper berries, crushed in a pestle and mortar• 2 sprigs of rosemary, leaves picked and chopped• a knob of butter• 6 sprigs of fresh flat-leaf parsley• 2 beef stock cubes, preferably organic• 600g small new potatoes, scrubbed clean, larger ones halved• 1 clove of garlic, peeled and finely chopped . Method . Dust a chopping board with 2 tablespoons of flour and a good pinch of salt and pepper, and toss your chunks of meat through this mixture until well coated. Heat a large pan on a high heat, add a few lugs of olive oil and fry your meat for 3 minutes to brown it. Add your chopped onions, carrots, celery, crushed juniper berries, rosemary and the knob of butter. Add a few tablespoons of water, give everything a good stir, then pop the lid on the pan and let everything steam for 4 to 5 minutes so the flavours really mingle together. Take the lid off so your meat and veg start to fry, and stir every so often for 5 to 10 minutes. Chop your parsley stalks finely, and once the onions start to caramelize, add them to the pan with your remaining 2 tablespoons of flour and your crumbled stock cubes. Stir, and pour in enough water to cover the mixture by a couple of inches. Put the parsley leaves aside for later. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to medium low so that the stew is just simmering. Add your potatoes and slow cook for at least 2 hours with the lid slightly askew, or until the meat falls apart easily. Keep an eye on it as it cooks, and add splashes of water if you think it looks too dry. Put your chopped garlic in the middle of a chopping board. Add most of your parsley leaves with a teaspoon of sea salt and ½ a teaspoon of black pepper. Chop everything together so you get a kinda chunky paste. Add this to the stew and stir through. Chop the last of your parsley leaves and sprinkle over before serving.","Venison stew is said to be Prince Williams' signature dish .

President Barack Obama took his victory lap marking the first anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan, landing in Kabul amid elaborate secrecy to deliver a live televised address. Speaking in front of a line of military vehicles at Bagram air base, Obama declared: ‘One year ago from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. 'The goal that I set to defeat al-Qaida and deny it a chance to rebuild is now within our reach.' President Obama addressed the nation after arriving on a secret unannounced visit to Afghanistan marking the first anniversary of the death of Osama bin Laden . Insisting that ‘we have a clear path to fulfill our mission in Afghanistan’, he said that Afghans would be responsible for their own security after 2014 but ‘two narrow security missions’ of ‘counterterrorism and continued training’ would still be carried out by Americans troops. His six-hour visit to Afghanistan under cover of darkness came as Republicans lambasted Obama for politicising the operation to take out the al Qaeda leader and serving and former US Navy SEALs blasted him for using their comrades as ‘ammunition’ in his election campaign against Mitt Romney. ‘We've seen recently that President Obama has visited college campuses in an attempt to win back the support of that age group since he has lost it over the last three years,"" Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma said in a statement.

U.S. President Barack Obama greets troops at Bagram Air Base in Kabul all desperate to take a photograph of him on the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death . ‘Similarly, this trip to Afghanistan is an attempt to shore up his national security credentials, because he has spent the past three years gutting our military.’ The Romney campaign, which had been angered by an Obama campaign ad featuring Bill Clinton and questioning whether Romney would have given the order to kill bin Laden, was cautious about taking Obama to task for the Afghan trip because of the tradition of refraining from political attacks when a president is abroad. White House aides said that the visit was to sign a strategic partnership agreement with Afghanistan meant to mark the beginning of the end of a war that has lasted for more than a decade. Rival: Mr Obama's campaign team has questioned whether Mitt Romney would have acted in the same manner as he did in ordering the special forces mission which culminated in the death of Osama bin Laden . But the political nature of the trip was obvious. The situation in Afghanistan was judged to be so dangerous that Obama was not permitted to be on the ground in daylight. Air Force One landed at the Bagram base just north of Kabul and Obama was then flown by helicopter to President Hamid Karzai’s palace in the Afghan capital where the two leaders signed the partnership pact.

Unannounced visit: President Obama shakes hands with U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker after arriving at Bagram Air Base in Kabul, Afghanistan . Obama then met troops before delivering a speech aimed almost exclusively at the American domestic audience. To some degree, Obama was insulated from the charge of playing petty politics by the fact that his trip took place on the ninth anniversary of President George W. Bush’s notorious ‘mission accomplished’ event on board to USS Abraham Lincoln after the Iraq invasion in 2003. Before Obama landed, Republicans had heaped criticism on Obama. Michael Mukasey, attorney general under Bush, slammed Obama for his “plans during the coming campaign to exploit the bragging rights to the achievement” in an article in the Wall Street Journal. Mukasey quoted a declassified memorandum by Leon Panetta, the Pentagon chief, that he argued included a “responsibility-escape clause” that meant if the operation had failed then blame could have been placed on then Vice Admiral William McRaven, head of Joint Special Operations Command (JSCO) at the time.

U.S. President Barack Obama (L) and Afghan President Hamid Karzai speak before signing the Strategic Partnership Agreement at the Presidential Palace in Kabul, May 2, 2012 . The memo said: ‘The timing, operational decision making and control are in Admiral McRaven's hands. The approval is provided on the risk profile presented to the President. Any additional risks are to be brought back to the President for his consideration. The direction is to go in and get bin Laden and if he is not there, to get out.’ Mukasey highlghted ‘the way [Obama] emphasised his own role in the hazardous mission accomplished by SEAL Team 6’ and contrasted with Bush’s praise of American troops when Saddam Hussein was captured in 2003. Donald Rumseld, Bush's Pentagon chief from 2001 to 2006, said via twitter that the professionalism of the SEALs over the bin Laden raid was in contrast to Obama's approach: 'The special operators who have every right to ""spike the football"" are too professional to do so. The White House might follow their lead.' Target: Bin Laden, pictured in his compound in Pakistan, was killed a year ago . Jose Rodriguez, a former head of the CIA’s Clandestine Service, wrote in the ‘Washington Post’ that Obama had made the right decision to order the killing of bin Laden. ‘But his administration never would have had the opportunity to do the right thing had it not been for some extraordinary work during the George W. Bush administration. Much of that work has been denigrated by Obama as unproductive and contrary to American principles.’ Mission: Senior figures, including Hillary Clinton, gathered to watch Navy SEALs invade the compound . He said that although some were ‘trying to turn bin Laden’s death into a campaign talking point for Obama’s reelection” it should be remembered ‘that the trail to bin Laden started in a CIA black site — all of which Obama ordered closed’ and ‘stemmed from information obtained from hardened terrorists’ partly by harsh interrogation methods Obama had since banned.

Parents at a Massachusetts elementary school were left fuming after teachers removed the word 'God' from the Lee Greenwood song 'God Bless the U.S.A.' - then pulled it from a school concert when they complained. Children at Stall Brook Elementary School in Bellingham were reportedly told to sing 'We love the U.S.A.' instead of 'God Bless the U.S.A.' - the original title of the popular country song. When parents expressed surprise and anger at the decision, school officials decided to remove the song from a school assembly concert. Under fire: Stall Brook Elementary School has angered parents by removing the word 'God' from the Lee Greenwood song 'God Bless the U.S.A.' The school's principal told news channel Fox 25 they hoped to 'maintain the focus on the original objective of sharing students’ knowledge of the U.S. States, and because of logistics, will not include any songs'. Singer Lee Greenwood, who first released 'God Bless the U.S.A.' in 1984, issued a statement to Fox News condemning the school's behaviour. He said: 'The most important word in the whole piece of music is the word God, which is also in the title ""God Bless The USA"". 'Maybe the school should have asked the parents their thoughts before changing the lyrics to the song. They could have even asked the writer of the song, which I of course, would have said you can’t change the lyrics at all or any part of the song.' Angry: Country singer Lee Greenwood, who wrote the song, says he would not have given permission for the word change . The country star added that the phrase 'God Bless the USA' has a 'very important meaning for those in the military and their families, as well as new citizens coming into our country.' He pointed out that the song is played at naturalisation ceremonies for new American citizens, after the National Anthem. 'If the song is good enough to be played and performed in its original setting under those circumstances, it surely should be good enough for our children,' Mr Greenwood said. An online poll taken by right-wing TV station Fox suggested that over 80 per cent of its viewers were outraged by the decision to remove God from the song. Facebook users also rallied in defence of the patriotic song's traditional lyrics, with one writing: 'Here we go again, more war on Christianity. You can remove God all you want, but the good news — there is still a loving God and He lives.' Another agreed, saying, 'I’d like to say unbelievable — but it is so totally believable.' However, some parents saw the change as a non-issue. Matthew Cote, who has a child at Brook Elementary School, said: 'I don’t think there’s anything wrong with changing the song. 'It’s a public school. If you want to have the word God in the song, go to a private school.'","Songwriter Lee Greenwood: 'God' is 'the most important word in the whole piece of music'

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 05:01 EST, 28 November 2011 . Go grease lightning: Theft of chip fat oil has soared as it is a cheap alternative to diesel . Thieves are stealing cooking oil from takeaways and restaurants to power converted cars. Theft of the oil has soared in the UK as the price of petrol at the pumps has increased. The crime, common in the United States and Canada, is relatively new to Britain. Converting a car engine to run on . vegetable fat costs around £200 but the money can quickly be recouped . because buying the oil from supermarkets works out cheaper than . filling up at the forecourt. It is possible to convert used cooking . oil to a fuel which can power any car capable of running on bio-diesel, . although the 'home brew' equipment costs up to £1,200. To operate most effectively the car ideally needs to have a diesel engine and will be around a decade old. Sergeant Stuart Gunstone, a neighbourhood police officer in Ware, Hertfordshire, said there has been a recent spate of thefts in his area. 'Until now I haven't been made aware of it being a problem in the UK,' he said. 'It seems to be a specific group of offenders targeting a specific area. The problem is a lot of places leave their back doors open because it gets hot in the kitchen.' In the latest raid, at a fish and chip shop in Ware, four tubs of used fat worth £80 were stolen. Two other shops have also been targeted in thefts police believe are linked. Fresh oil from the supermarket is exempt from VAT if sold as a foodstuff but an alcohol additive needs to be mixed in if it is to be used as fuel. Fueling the future? A home brew kit to convert used cooking oil so that it can power a vehicle costs around £1,200 . A few years ago the law changed to encourage people to experiment with new forms of fuel, meaning a motorist who uses less than 2,500 litres of chip fat fuel each year - 50 litres a week - wasn't required to pay any tax or duty. Excise duty would have to be paid on any fuel above that limit at a discounted rate below the 20p standard charge. The Centre For Alternative Technology runs courses in engine conversion and 'home-brewing' bio-diesel using chip fat and vegetable oil. Experts say if all the conversion work is done properly, it should not reduce the performance of the car. The 'home brewing' of vegetable oil takes around two days to complete and there's an element of risk. Iit involves adding alcohol and leaving the mixture to stand overnight, removing glycerine - an unwanted by-product of the chemical reaction - and then 'washing' the remaining liquid with water to remove impurities. In cold weather, bio-diesel is more prone to freezing. Using vegetable oil may invalidate the warranty with some manufacturers.","Thieves target takeaways in Ware, Hertfordshire, in raids police believe are linked .

A paedophile priest who plied altar servers with cocaine before sexually abusing them has been jailed for nine and a half years by an Italian court. Father Riccardo Seppia, 51, was arrested by police after they discovered his activities during an investigation into the supply of drugs to Milan's gay nightclub scene. Stunned officers listened in as Father Seppia said: 'Come on over I've got some snow' - code for drugs. In another conversation he said: 'Bring the usual gift, I am very lonely.' Jailed: Father Ricardo Seppia sent 'obscene' texts to young boys arranging to meet them . When details of Father Seppia's case . emerged last year in his parish at Sestri Ponente near Genoa he was . immediately suspended by his local bishop - although there were claims . that church chiefs had been warned about him almost 20 years ago. Fellow priest Father Piercarlo . Casassa said at the time: 'I told the Church authorities about him in . 1994 but I was ignored. People had told me he had a untoward approach . with the scouts (altar boys) and I told the authorities he was not the right person . to have around youngsters but no-one listened to me.' His claims were backed up by local . parishioners who told Italian media that Father Seppia had been . nicknamed 'The Night Priest' because of his habit of going out late and . sleeping in. Pope Benedict XVI has said he will introduce tougher guidelines on dealing with child abusers . The case is the latest sex abuse scandal to rock the Roman Catholic Church and comes after Pope Benedict XVI said the Vatican would be introducing tougher guidelines on dealing with clergy who take advantage of children. Two years ago the Vatican was at the centre of a worldwide storm after it emerged there had been thousands of cases of paedophile priests  in Ireland, Germany, America and Belgium which were covered up and not acted upon. Police said the investigation on Father Seppia focused on gyms and saunas in the Milan area which he visited and that two other men - including a former trainee priest - were also questioned as part of the investigation. He was charged with sexually abusing a 15-year-old altar boy, attempted child prostitution and supplying cocaine. A charge of possessing child pornography was dropped. Father Seppia appeared in court in Genoa shaven-headed and dressed in a blue shirt and jeans, and hung his head as the prosecutor Stefano Puppo told the judge he had targeted 'problem children' and had sent them 'obscene texts as he tried to arrange sex with them.' Before the sentence was read out Father Seppia told judge Roberta Bossi: 'I would just like to apologise for all those erotic SMS texts full or erotic fantasies and blasphemies that I sent to altar boys and other children. I am sorry for my behaviour because it was wrong.' Scandal: This is the latest in a number of sex abuse cases to rock the Vatican . Judge Bossi dismissed his apologies and sentenced him to four years, two months and twenty days for the sex abuse and attempted child prostitution charges and five years and four months for the drug offences, making a total of nine and a half years. He was also fined €28,000 (£22,700). He will serve his sentence, a year of which has already been served on remand, in a sex offenders section at nearby San Remo jail. Archbishop Angelo Bagnasco, leader of the Catholic Bishops Conference based in Genoa, refused to comment on the case, leaving it to his spokesman Father Silvio Grilli. Father Grilli said: 'We take note of the court's decision and express once again our pain for what happened to the victim and parishioners. It is appreciated that Father Seppia did apologise when in court.' Last years new guidelines on dealing with paedophile priests was drawn up by Cardinal William Levada, of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and was sent to all clergy members worldwide. It underlines the Church's zero tolerance policy on abuse and highlights how to 'prevent, collaborate and deal' with civilian authorities investigating abuse claims. The document tells church officials that they should collaborate with police and report to them any suspected allegations of child abuse - this was not obligatory before the new guidelines. Two years ago Pope Benedict described his horror at the dozens of sex allegations which hit the Church. At one stage even he was drawn into the scandal when he was accused of dragging his heels when dealing with a case involving a priest in his native Germany when he was Archbishop of Munich in 1980.","Italian Father Ricardo Seppia given nine years in prison .

And 1500m runner Ellie Stevens tweeted that it 'was very sad' that Claire wasn't given a medal and even drew Virgin boss Richard Branson's attention to the matter. However, for Claire, it's not a gong from the organisers that counts, but the medals from other participants. She told MailOnline: 'When I started the challenge, it was never my priority to get a medal as I knew from the start line I wouldn’t receive one. The campaign was always about raising funds and awareness for Spinal Research. 'I’ve been completely overwhelmed by the support from the public, particularly those kind runners that have donated their medals to me. I now have 14!  If anything, these medals mean much more to me than any recognition from the racer organisers.' The paralysed 32-year-old conquered the 26.2 mile course that more than 36,000 ran last . month using a mechanical suit to control her legs. Her achievement has earned her world-wide fame, with The Vancouver Sun, USA Today, Toronto Star and The New York Daily News all reporting on it. Claire lost the use of her legs after . breaking her spine when she was thrown from her horse in competitive . trials five years ago. Since then she has been liberated from a . wheelchair by a pioneering suit that straps to her limbs and torso, . giving her mobility through motion sensors, battery operated motors and . an onboard computer system.

Ace support: Tim Henman walks with Claire in Woolwich during her Marathon walk . Backing the bid: Runner Ellie Stevens posted two messages on Twitter voicing her concern that Mrs Lomas hasn't received a medal . Celebration time: The emotion of finishing the London Marathon after over 16 days was clearly a lot for Claire to take in when she crossed the line this lunchtime . Mark of respect: Claire, who was paralysed in 2007, stops near the finish line of the marathon to pay her respect to Claire Squires, who died during this year's event . Yesterday, Maisie and Claire’s husband . Dan, whom she met after the accident, accompanied her to the finish . line.

'People . have been fantastic and the support I’ve been given has been a huge . help.’ A marathon man has smashed the world record for the longest distance covered within a week - by running an incredible 450 miles. Inspirational John Reynolds, 50, covered more than 18 marathons in six-and-a-half days at an average rate of 69 miles per day. He set off from his home in Radstock, Somerset, last Tuesday and passed the previous world record of 408 miles in nearby Chilcompton at 11am on Monday (7/5) with 21 hours to spare. John continued running and crossed the finish line at Bath Abbey, Somerset, later on Monday after covering a staggering 450 miles in less than one week. His achievement was all the more remarkable because eight years ago he could not even walk - after being struck down by a thyroid condition. He has notched up half-marathons, marathons and supermarathons before tackling his latest week-long challenge, which has so far raised £50,000 for charity. Claire, who lives near Melton Mowbray, . Leicestershire, began the race with everyone else on April 22. She has . since averaged between a mile and 2.5 miles a day.

It was none of those. ‘It’s the pavements,’ she said, raising her . voice. ‘They’re so broken up and uneven, and every little bump is a . hurdle for me. If everything had been flat and even, I’d have finished . days ago! ‘There were times when I questioned . whether I would make it . . . but once I started, I just took each day . as it came. Once I got out there and saw people cheering me on, it . really raised my spirits.’ Tourists, supporters and family followed in her wake and clapped her along the way. Among the voices were former Olympic . rower Sir Matthew Pinsent, TV presenter Gaby Roslin, adventurer Ben . Fogle and three mounted members of the Household Cavalry, riding in an . unofficial guard of honour. She had raised more than £130,000 for the Spinal Research charity when she finished, with the total still rising. And the medal? ‘This was never about me,’ she said . with genuine selflessness. ‘I didn’t do it for a medal, I did it to . raise awareness and raise money.’ Claire’s entry was not officially . timed, and she stayed overnight in a hotel before being driven back to . the course each morning. There may have been a red tape stretched across . the makeshift finish line yesterday but no one, in another sense, was . prepared to cut through it. Marathon organisers insisted competitors . must complete the course the same day to qualify for a medal. Others were less formal.

The children's charity which produced a YouTube viral targeting Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony have released a sequel to their hugely popular video. Invisible Children's video, 'Kony 2012', directed by filmmaker Jason Russell, racked up 50 million YouTube hits in four days after receiving huge support on Twitter and from A-list celebrities. Now following on from the group's 20-minute Kony documentary last month which swept the world, Invisible Children have released a follow-up YouTube video. The follow-up, 'Kony 2012: Beyond Famous', addresses criticism aimed at the original video, but does not feature director Russell, following his naked rant 'meltdown' in San Diego after the video achieved worldwide fame. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Movement: In the 30-minute Kony sequel, Invisible Children show the work they have done in raising awareness of the Ugandan warlord, as well as addressing criticism of their first video . Russell, 33, has been detained in a mental hospital in San Diego after having an apparent 'meltdown' in the wake of the video's unprecedented popularity. The director was diagnosed with brief psychosis last month after witnesses saw him pacing naked on a sidewalk in a San Diego neighborhood, screaming incoherently and banging his fists on the pavement. His outburst happened shortly after Kony 2012 thrust Invisible Children into the global limelight. After its release and worldwide popularity last month, Kony 2012 drew criticism for exaggerating and manipulating facts surrounding Kony  to . over-emphasise the scale of his war crimes . The new 30-minute video by Invisible Children is a slick documentary which addresses criticisms aimed at the San Diego non-profit group since it achieved overnight fame last month. Warlord: The original video aimed to expose the crimes of African rebel leader Joseph Kony (left). Kony 2012 director Jason Russell (right) does not feature in the sequel . Critics said Kony 2012, the original video of which has now collected over 87 million YouTube hits, was too American-centric. Pop culture expert Robert Thompson said the original film is likely to become a case study on what videos can become viral web hits. He said: 'The fact is, the story has developed in so many odd ways with all the controversy, and the sequel can't really promise the bang of that first video - which is informing people of something they did not know before. Popular: Kony 2012: Beyond Famous was only released on YouTube yesterday, but has already amassed nearly 1 million hits on YouTube . Reflection: Various parts of the Kony 2012 sequel show how Invisible Children's original film raised awareness of the crimes of Joseph Kony . Explosion: Kony 2012: Beyond Famous also illustrates how the first video swept the globe partly due to its popularity on Twitter . Detailed: The Kony sequel is again filmed in a slick documentary format, with one passage showing the supposed influence of the African rebel leader . Horrific: Kony's guerilla army has abducted . thousands of children in central Africa to join it, forcing them to . commit horrific acts of violence . Scarred: Kony's LRA has ordered his young army to carry out acts of mutilation on the faces of other youngsters . 'Now we're getting into the details, which is never that thrilling.' Ben Keesey, Invisible Children's CEO, said the sequel was made in two weeks. The thinking, he said, was the organization needed to answer to people wanting to know who was behind last month's Internet success that prompted a bipartisan group of 40 U.S. senators to back a resolution condemning Kony and had children around the country asking their parents to do something. Kony's ruthless Lord's Resistance Army, which has no political aim, has led a campaign of fear throughout northern Uganda and neighbouring countries. The organisation is believed to have murdered tens of thousands of people, abducted at least 30,000 children to work as sex slaves or soldiers and forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes. The brutal campaign has forced millions to live in fear and sees families in some areas abandoning their rural homes at night to sleep in makeshift refugee camps. Kony and several of his leading lieutenants were indicted in 2005 by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. Breakdown: Jason Russell was hospitalized for exhaustion after behaving bizarrely wearing only his underwear in the streets . Naked meltdown: Kony 2012 video director Jason Russell caught acting strangely on the Streets on San Diego . The group operated for more than a decade in northern Uganda but left in 2008 and have since committed atrocities in Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. Uganda's army has theoretically hunted the organisation's leaders but Kony has continually evaded capture - at times arrogantly even emerging from the jungle to give interviews to journalists before disappearing again. Last October American president Barack Obama announced he was sending troops to help the hunt for the LRA. Around 100 US soldiers have since been deployed in the region to help local officials trace the mass killer.","'Kony 2012: Beyond Famous' addresses criticism aimed at original film .

A 'Wallace and Gromit' tax credit to stop film companies going abroad was unveiled by the Chancellor in his budget speech today. George Osborne announced the plan - similar to the current film tax credit - after concerns that some of the biggest names in television were taking production overseas for tax incentives. Julian Fellowes' drama Titanic and the show Birdsong are just two productions that have recently been made overseas instead of in Britain. Scroll down for video . Joke: David Cameron unveiled the Wallace and Gromit tax credits in a personal jibe at Ed Miliband, who has been compared to the plasticine figue . And Wallace and Gromit-creator Aardman Animations warned they would have to move production overseas because they could no longer compete in Britain. But Mr Osborne said the new tax credits would help to attract 'top international investors' to the UK as well as retaining current talent. In a personal jibe at Labour leader Ed Milibad - who has been compared to the pasticine figure - Mr Osborne said 'we want to keep Wallace and Gromit exactly where they are'. Speaking to the House of Commons today, he said: 'Today I am announcing our intention to introduce similar schemes for the video games, animation and high-end TV production industries. George Osborne gives his budget speech in the Commons today, with his Wallace and Gromit measures getting the biggest cheer of the day . 'Not only will this help stop premium British TV programmes like Birdsong being made abroad, it will also attract top international investors like Disney and HBO to make more of their premium shows in the UK. 'It will support our brilliant video games and animation industries too. Because, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is the determined policy of this Government to keep Wallace and Gromit exactly where they are.' A spokeswoman for the TV Coalition, made up of some of the biggest names in TV production, said the tax measures could 'put an end to the exodus' of UK drama. Research carried out by the group estimates that the proposed plan would generate around £350 million a year for the UK economy. Andy Harries, chief executive of Left Bank Pictures which makes shows including Wallander, said: 'The proposed changes in the UK tax laws regarding television would give the British TV industry a much needed shot in the arm. Going? Wallace and Gromit creators Aardman Animations warned they would have to move production overseas because they could no longer compete in Britain . Gone: Actors in Julian Fellowes' drama Titanic which was produced overseas due in part to the tax incentives . 'British production talent is responsible for some of the best television in the world and at the moment many productions, which could very easily be shot in the UK, are being made abroad and many talented creatives are moving elsewhere. 'Left Bank Pictures are currently shooting two productions in South Africa - Mad Dogs and Strike Back - where tax breaks make it possible to make hugely ambitious dramas on a British TV budget and we have many other large scale projects in development that we would love to be able to make in the UK. 'The proposed changes will also welcome productions from around the world to UK shores and quite apart from the revenue that this will bring to our shores it will also help support the creative community in the UK and help train the next generation of film and TV makers.' Tax relief: Nick Park, creator of the Wallace and Gromit animation series . Glenn Whitehead, Executive Vice President Business at US cable network HBO, said: 'Today's news on a new tax incentive has turned the UK from one of the most expensive options into a competitive and affordable location. We would therefore love to bring more production to the UK.' Mr Osborne said that Britian could be 'Europe’s technology centre'  as he unveiled plans to roll out super fast broadband around the country. He added: 'Two years ago Britain had some of the slowest broadband speeds in Europe; today our plans will deliver some of the fastest - with 90 per cent of the population having access to superfast broadband, and improved mobile phone coverage for rural areas and along key roads across the UK. 'But we should not be complacent by saying it is enough to be the best in Europe when countries like Korea and Singapore do even better. So today we’re funding ultra fast broadband and wi-fi in ten of the UK’s largest cities. Belfast, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle and London.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 13:21 EST, 9 February 2012 . Just days after receiving a prosthetic eye, model and fashionista Lauren Scruggs is back in the blogging business. Miss Scruggs returned to her BlogbyLolo.com site over the weekend with musings on summer attire, designer Prabal Gurung and New York City, where Fashion Week kicks off today. The blog post, entitled 'inspired on sunday,' is Miss Scruggs' first entry since January 9, when she thanked her supporters for their love amid the ordeal. In the city: She was working to build up her own fashion site and held interviews at New York Fashion Week . Blogette: Miss Scruggs returned to her BlogbyLolo.com site over the weekend with musings on summer attire, designer Prabal Gurung and New York City, where Fashion Week kicks off today . She also took to Twitter on Sunday, bemoaning the loss of her preferred pair of jeans. 'My goal: to replace my first and favorite @truereligion jeans that were taken away in Dec! So hard to find the exact match!' The denim brand quickly responded: 'What jeans?! We want to help reconnect you with your favorite pair!' Miss Scruggs, 23, was nearly killed on December 3 when she accidentally walked into a plane propeller after taking a ride with a friend to see the Dallas Christmas lights from the sky. Two weeks after the tragic accident, doctors decided that they had to remove Lauren's eye. Though her parents have been actively updating her friends and family through their Caring Bridge website and television appearances, Lauren made her first public appearance on January 17. She was seen walking out of Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas wearing a patch over her missing eye and a Cowboys football hat pulled low. The prosthetic eye is a major step in her healing process, but she still has a long way to go. Her mother Cheryl Scruggs said last week that while some of the physical pain that she used to feel while trying to sleep- which she described as 'ferocious' at the time- has begun to lessen, Lauren needs now to move on to her other forms of recovery. Lauren Scruggs, seen here before the accident, was fitted with a prosthetic left eye after doctors had to remove it . 'Lo’s physical pain has subsided a great deal. It is now the emotional pain that is the tough one,' Mrs Scruggs wrote. The next hurdle for the burgeoning fashion blogger and model is the decision whether or not to be fitted with a prosthetic arm. 'We again met with the arm people this week. Again, another step,' Mrs Scruggs wrote Thursday. More details continue to emerge about the December 3 accident as the emergency 911 call was released in late January. 'A girl walked into an airplane prop - I need an ambulance immediately,' the female caller tells the 911 operator in the seven-minute recording obtained by TMZ.com. 'I think it cut her hand off.' In the call, placed at 8.48pm from the private airport near Dallas, the male caller described the model as conscious and breathing but bleeding badly with her face to the ground. Family: Lauren Scruggs pictured with her father, mother and twin sister - who was suffering 'sympathy pains' When asked exactly what part of her body she injured, the male caller says: 'We don’t know, we haven't turned her over.' Her cries and moans became louder throughout the call. Witnesses thought that Lauren must have been crossing in front of the plane to go thank the pilot Curt Richmond, who was trying to warn her to avoid the propeller.. Mr Richmond put down his arm and turned away from her when he thought she had turned to walk away from the spinning propeller, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report. But it's unclear whether she heard his warning over the roar of the engine. Moments later, someone on the ground screamed 'Stop! Stop!' and Mr Richmond saw her lying on the tarmac and he immediately cut the engine. Pilot: Curt Richmond, right, told investigators that he tried to warn Ms Scruggs about the danger of the propeller . Plane: The pilot's warning may have been lost in the roar of the engine, with tragic consequences . Mr Richmond, believed to be a friend of Lauren's, had left the engine running while new passengers filed into the small plane as he prepared another trip to the skies. The NTSB did not find fault with the pilot for the accident but air safety investigator Denny Kelly said Mr Richmond is ultimately responsible because he 'should have shut the engine down'. 'I don’t know how to thank each one of you, properly, for so much love during this difficult incident in my life,' Ms Scruggs wrote in January. 'My heart is so grateful beyond what I could ever imagine. 'Thank you dearly for the sweet encouragements, the precious words in letters and messages, the beautiful grace in pretty presents. 'But mostly I am so so thankful for you and your loving hearts and sweet spirits.'","Lauren Scruggs writes 'inspired on sunday' post shortly after receiving prosthetic left eye .

Experts say sales driven by fear President Obama will change gun laws if he wins a second term . 2012 Doomsday preppers and the popularity of zombie films and television shows have added to the boost in sales since January . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:19 EST, 5 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:04 EST, 5 April 2012 . The unusual combination of 2012 . apocalypse fears, popular killer-zombie shows and the potential . re-election of President Obama has led to a nationwide spike in gun . sales. A similar increase . was noted in 2009 during President Obama's first term and gun dealers . and buyers say they fear what a second term lame duck Obama . administration may do. Sales . have increased to such an extent that manufacturers such as Sturm, . Ruger & Co. are struggling to keep up with the demand. Record year so far: Sales of firearms have increased so much that manufacturers are struggling to keep up with the demand . The . Southport, Connecticut-based company has suspended new orders after . taking over one million requests for guns in the first three months of . this year. 'Sales usually . increase this time of year with tax returns, but this year has been . higher than most,' said Mike Weeks, owner of Georgia Gun Store in . Gainesville, Georgia. 'People are scared their gun rights are going to be curtailed after the election.' Firearms saw a similar boost in sales during the early months of President Obama's first term in 2009 . This follows a record 2011, when nearly 11 million firearms were sold in the U.S according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. The $4 billion guns and ammo industry in America has been one sector that has bucked the depressed economic trend since 2008. Noting his own sales have risen by around 30 per cent, Mr Weeks now says that he sells ammo by the case. 'Usually . people come in to buy three or four boxes for target practice. Now they . are coming in asking what kind of deals they could get on a case,' said . Mr  Weeks. The common denominator in these increases according to industry experts is the looming November 6 election. 'It’s definitely the election year,' said Jason Hanson, a former CIA officer and personal security specialist to FoxNews.com. 'People feel that Obama will serve a second term and with it their gun rights taken away, so they are stocking up. Zombies and the Apocalypse: Firearm sales have been boosted by those anticipating 2012 as the end of the world . 'They’re also worried that the economy is not getting any better and that they need to protect themselves.' Upon . President Obama taking office in 2009 firearm enthusiasts have rushed . to dealers worried he would tighten gun control and sales have continued . to grow during his term as President. While . campaigning for office as in 2008 he famously told . fundraisers of his frustration that Midwestern and Rust-Belt voters . 'cling to guns or religion' and many supporters of the Second Ammendment . doubt he is fully behind it. 'He's never been pro-gun,' explained Cris Parsons of his thoughts on President Obama. Mr Parsons, 31, runs a Texas gun depository called the Houston Armory. To . date, explains Parsons, the President has been 'pretty coy' regarding . guns and the gun dealer feels this will remain the case during the . campaign. If President Obama was to adopt a contrary position Mr Parsons reckons it will 'upset a lot of people.' As a backdrop to this, gun makers stocks are rising. Sturm, Ruger & Co's share price has risen 55 percent this year and Smith & Wesson is up 91 percent. A strong litmus test for U.S gun sales is the FBI's National Instant Background Check System. Firearm enthusiasts contributed record sales to the $4 billion industry last year . This allows federally licensed firearm dealers to conduct mandatory background checks on purchasers of new and used weapons. Statistics up until December 2011 indicated a 19th straight month of background check increases year on year. November 25, 2011, saw the record for most background checks in one day --129,166 and became known as 'Black Friday'. However politics aside there are other explanations for the current boom. 'There're the 'preppers,' explained Parsons, 'and then there's this whole Zombie Apocalypse thing.' An entire industry has grown up around preppers and the fear of ancient Mayan prophecies predicting the end of the world. As . many as three million Americans now count themselves in that category . buying up guns, ammo and food in anticipation of a solar flare or . catastrophic asteroid hit before the year is out. Ready for anything: There are an estimated three million preppers in the United States alone . A . staggering 61 per cent of 1,000 polled by the National Geographic . channel believe there will be a catastrophic event in the next 20 years, . and people want to be prepared. Combined . with the preppers is the growth in popularity of Zombie shows such as . 'The Walking Dead' which has led firearms manufacturers to produce . themed guns and bullets. 'We can't keep it in stock,' explained Cris Parsons of his line of Zombie Max ammunition. 'It comes in a cool, colorful box with a Zombie on it.' However, in reality business is booming for the American firearms industry. 'There’s . a lot of speculation that the Second Amendment will be affected by the . next presidential term,' said Bret Jordan, a stock analyst specialising . in firearms to FoxNews.com. 'There . was one investors' call and an executive was asked what he thought would . happen if Obama was elected a second term and he said, ""No one in the . gun industry will tell you they like Obama, but everyone will vote for . him.""'","2011 a record year for firearm sales in the U.S with 11million sold .

"By . Jenny Hope . UPDATED: . 01:41 EST, 6 April 2012 . Cutting edge: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley will today unveil plans for a £150million proton beam therapy service on the NHS . Cancer patients will soon be able to receive revolutionary radiotherapy in England. At present, those needing proton beam therapy are flown to the U.S. or Switzerland to receive it, at an average cost of £90,000 to the NHS. But the Government announced yesterday that the treatment will soon be offered in London and Manchester, with the capacity to help 1,500 patients a year. The therapy uses charged particles instead of X-rays to target tumours, and is particularly useful for certain cancers in children, who are at risk of lasting damage to organs that are still growing. It can give a higher dose of radiotherapy that causes minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissue, and also causes fewer side-effects than X-rays. Conventional treatment can lead to deafness, reduced IQ and secondary cancers. Because it is more accurate, proton beam therapy can also treat tumours in hard-to-reach places – such as the base of the skull or the brain, eye or spine – with higher success rates. Under a £250million programme funded by the Department of Health, proton beam therapy facilities will be built at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust hospital in Manchester and the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Targeted: This image shows the cross-sections of a pelvis with a prostate tumour being treated with X-rays (left) and a proton beam (right). The X-ray releases far more peripheral radiation (shown in white) than the proton beam . Less effective: Conventional radiotherapy causes far more side-effects because the radiation can damage surrounding tissue . The sites will not be fully up and . running until 2017, and so the NHS will continue to fund treatment and . travel costs for patients sent abroad in the meantime. Almost . 150 have been treated under this scheme so far, and by 2015 the NHS . will be spending an estimated £30million a year to send up to 400 . patients overseas. Flown to America: Lily Gillon . Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said . that offering proton beam therapy was vital to ensure that cancer . facilities in the NHS were world class. ‘In addition to improved success rates, proton beam therapy reduces the . side-effects which patients, particularly children, can suffer as a . result of traditional forms of cancer treatment,’ he said. ‘Once this . service is in place, The Christie and UCLH will boast unparalleled . cancer facilities. ‘It will mean more patients will be able to get this treatment, . including those for whom travelling abroad for long periods is not . possible.’ The British Institute of Radiology praised the Government’s commitment to the service ‘at such a financially challenging time’. Dr Jane Barrett, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, agreed. ‘We are delighted to see that the Government has made this important . commitment and that by 2017 there will be two treatment centres in . England,’ she said. ‘This underlines the vital importance of modern radiotherapy in the . treatment of cancer and will deliver improvements in treatment for . patients that the RCR has long sought.’ When Lily Gillon was diagnosed with a brain tumour, conventional radiation treatment was deemed too dangerous. The toddler’s age, and the threat to surrounding tissue, meant the only chance of saving her life was proton beam therapy. Although it is offered at two centres in the U.S. and one in Switzerland, the treatment is currently unavailable in Britain. The NHS does, however, pay for some patients to receive it abroad. It also picks up the tab for travel and accommodation. Under this scheme, Lily’s mother Cherie, 26, took her to Oklahoma last year, where she received a course of 33 treatments. Her father Graham, 34, said the trip saved the two-year-old’s life. ‘Lily was really ill. She’d lost a lot of weight and been continuously sick but after eight treatments you could tell it was working,’ he said. ‘She was a different girl to the one who went over there. This treatment doesn’t make a child ill – it just helps them get better. ‘It would be fantastic if the treatment comes to the NHS – it would save the travelling and stress of being away from home. But we’re glad it was available somewhere when Lily needed it.’","Patients currently sent overseas for treatment .

A ban on hosepipes for 20 million people - the strictest ever imposed - is now in force across most of the south and east of the country. It follows two consecutive dry winters and water firms say the ban is likely to last until the autumn if not into next year, even if there is normal rainfall during the summer. But the Environment Agency have warned the . hosepipe ban is just the first step to help conserve water supplies, in . the worst drought since 1976. Dry as a bone: Five-year-old Isla Stanton paddling in Bewl Water Reservoir near Lamberhurst, Kent, which is currently standing at 49 per cent of its capacity . Last resort: A return to standpipes in the street, used in the drought of 1976 is the final option if water levels continue to drop . The Environment Agency have warned the . hosepipe ban is the first step to help conserve water supplies, in . the worst drought since 1976. After the hosepipe ban there are in effect, three water-saving stages: 1. If . water levels continue to drop then the second stage is caps on . non-essential business use such as watering golf courses, cleaning . pavements and car washes could follow.2. Next public and commercial swimming pools will be instructed to shut down as well as industries which rely on mains supplies such as food processors. 3. Finally there could be a time table imposed when people are told to only use water at set times. Another measure could be asking certain areas to share standpipes in the street, similar to what residents in 1976 experienced when there was a severe drought . If . water levels continue to drop then the second stage is caps on . non-essential business use such as watering golf courses, cleaning . pavements and car washes. Next public and commercial swimming pools will be instructed to shut down as well as industries which rely on mains supplies such as food processors. Finally there could be a timetable imposed when people are told to only use water at set times. Another measure could be asking certain areas to share standpipes in the . street, similar to what residents in 1976 experienced when there was a . severe drought. Seven . Water companies Thames Water, Southern Water, South East, Veolia . Central and South East and Sutton and East Surrey Water have all imposed . bans. A list of eleven activities banned in . the 2010 Water Management Act includes using hosepipes to wash the car, . water plants and clean windows; fill fountains, ponds and paddling . pools and even hose down children on a hot day. And that's where it gets confusing. Water companies are allowed to interpret the rules however they wish, . meaning some activities are banned by one water company and allowed by . another. Southern Water customers will be able to wash their cars with a hosepipe, but neighbours supplied by South East Water will not. Those who flout the ban could be forced to pay a £1,000 fine, after being sent a single 'yellow card' warning in the post. Even spraying your children to keep them cool in the sunshine will be outlawed, and those caught breaking the rules face a £1,000 fine. The strict rules are an attempt to close any loopholes after the last . hosepipe ban in 2006 led to widespread accusations of cheating, with . thousands reported to water companies by their neighbours or served with . 'yellow card' letters warning them to obey the law. Commenting on the likelihood of returning to standpipes, Water UK, which represents major UK water suppliers said 'We think it's very unlikely - . we would look at it as a last resort.' Second stage: If water levels continue to drop then the next stage after the current hosepipe ban is asking non-essential users such as golf courses and car washes to stop using water . Closed down: If water levels do not improve then then the next stage is public and commercial swimming pools have to close and water intensive industries like food processors that use mains supplies . Anglian . Water said 'The environmental drought is a very serious situation, but . at this stage standpipes are a very distant prospect which we are not . even contemplating at this stage. 'We . are confident that our customers recognise the severity of the . situation and will do what they can to help save water across our . region.' Martin Baggs, Chief Executive of Thames Water said: . 'Groundwater . levels in the aquifers, which we rely on for both borehole and river . supplies, are well below where we would normally expect them to be. In . some cases they are at their lowest levels ever recorded at this time of . year. 'We know these restrictions will be unpopular, but they . will save a lot of water. A garden sprinkler uses as much water in an . hour as a family of four uses in a day, and when water is in short . supply, the needs of families must come first. Feeling the pinch: Many businesses are already feeling effects of the hosepipe ban: garden centres face singificant losses as people will not be buying plants if they cannot water them . Still waters: The famous fountains in Trafalgar Square have been turned off as part of a hosepipe ban imposed across Southern England as a result of low rainfall this winter . Running dry: Tourists may not be able to cool off this summer in London's Trafalgar Square fountains after the water supply was turned off under the hosepipe ban . The hosepipe ban is already causing problems for business -  for example garden . centres are facing significant losses as people will not be purchasing plants if they . cannot water them. Earlier this week Thames Water ordered the water supply to London'sTrafalgar Square's fountains  be cut as part of a blanket restriction, which includes ornamental fountains, designed to conserve drought-hit reservoirs. The Greater London Authority said the current water stocks feeding the fountains will run out at the weekend. Negotiations are underway to see if a compromise can be found in time for the arrival of millions of tourists to Trafalgar Square during the Olympic and Jubilee summer. Water companies said that without . persistent above-average rainfall for several weeks, the unpopular . measures could last until the end of the summer in the 14 counties which . are already officially in drought. Otherwise . they face 'severe drought' by the summer, the Environment Agency warned . yesterday, which could result in extending restrictions to businesses.

Justin Taberham of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management said that if consumers do not start curbing their water use at home, the economy will be affected. 'If water levels in drought-stricken areas don't improve, hosepipe bans could be just the beginning and industry will start to be affected,' he said. This is one of the largest hosepipe bans ever implemented.

A British soldier was shot dead by insurgents as he helped Afghan police officers find a place to pray, an inquest heard. Lance Corporal Jonathan McKinlay, 33, was shot through the neck while on patrol with the 1st Battalion The Rifles in Helmand in September last year. Members of his family attending the inquest in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, heard how the Darlington-born soldier’s injuries were 'non-survivable', despite the efforts of comrades who tried to reach him while under heavy fire from the enemy. L Cpl McKinlay was one of 12 British servicemen accompanied by three Afghan National Police and an interpreter who were on patrol from Checkpoint Chaabak in the Narh-e-Saraj area. The group were around 90 minutes into the patrol and had stopped in a garden having changed route to avoid a potential ambush point ahead.Navy Medic Stuart Freeman, who was attached to The Rifles at the time, said L/Cpl McKinlay was in a field with the Afghan police, who had decided to pray. He told coroner Andrew Tweddle: 'I believe he had his compass out.' He agreed with the coroner when asked: 'Was he trying to help them find out which way to point (to pray)?' Moments later the group came under heavy fire from two points. Serjeant Christopher Wainwright said: 'We came under a heavy and sustained period of fire. 'I crawled forward into a ditch about 1m in front of me. I dropped into the ditch.' Lance Corporal McKinlay was shot through the neck while on patrol in Helmand (pictured) The soldier was comforted by his dead comrade’s mother Valerie as he fought his emotions while giving evidence. He continued: 'Facing away from the contact, I had a quick scan around to check all the guys were in cover.' Satisfied the men behind him were all right, he turned and saw L/Cpl McKinlay lying out of a ditch. As the firing raged from both sides, it was not possible to reach him for around six to seven minutes. By the time Leading Medical Assistant Freeman could reach him, there was no sign of life. Pathologist Dr Russell Delaney found later that he died from a “non-survivable” gunshot wound to the neck, which would have rendered him almost instantly unconscious. Mr Tweddle read from the pathologist’s report that: 'It follows that there was nothing his colleagues or combat mates could have done to save his life.' The Afghan interpreter was also shot and injured in the fire fight, though his injuries were not so severe. When the coroner asked the family if they wanted to add anything to the inquest, L/Cpl McKinlay’s mother thanked his comrades for their efforts to reach him while coming under fire. Mr Tweddle concluded the inquest by recording the verdict that 'L/Cpl McKinlay was shot by insurgents while on active military service in Afghanistan'. L/Cpl McKinlay, who joined the Army in 1996, was deployed to Afghanistan in June 2011. The father-of-three had also served in Northern Ireland and Iraq. He left behind his wife Lisa, sister Becca, daughter Megan and stepchildren Ollie and Piper.",Lance Corporal Jonathan McKinlay was shot through the neck .

He introduced the personal computer in 1984 and then kept re-inventing technology right up to his death. But here he is in a role that has never been seen before - playing American President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a spoof video aimed to inspire Apple's troops. Jobs gamely plays the role - capturing FDR's trademark smile, on a set which mimics the President's office right right down to the President's cigarette-holder. The video spoofs off Apple's iconic '1984' advert, which six months earlier had played at the American Superbowl and introduced the Apple Macintosh to the public. Found footage: Steve Jobs plays FDR in Apple's long-lost takeoff of the famous '1984' Macintosh advert . In the original Superbowl video, directed by . Ridley Scott, Apple pitched itself in a good vs evil battle against . Microsoft, positioning Apple as a spunky, creative force which was going . to knock down the grey drones that used Bill Gates's software. The . iconic imagery, dramatic overtones and sharp digs at Microsoft ensured Apple entered the public consciousness as the quirky game-changing company, and the advert became a metaphor for the . company that has never died - even if, ironically, Apple today has become a lot more 'Big Brother'-like.

Accused: Jessica Beagley pictured in court on the first day of her child abuse trial - she is said to have punished her son by forcing him to drink Tabasco sauce . The jury was shown video from Dr Phil of Beagley administering the punishment to her adopted son . Prosecutors say Beagley, of Anchorage, Alaska, went beyond 'what would be considered reasonable parental discipline'. But her defence lawyer William Ingaldson said she resorted to unconventional disciplinary methods because more traditional forms of punishment had not worked with the boy. Beagley, along with her police officer husband, adopted the boy and his twin brother from a Russian orphanage after their parents abandoned them, Ingaldson said. The boys were taken there after Russian investigators found their family living in a shack, where the boys slept on shelves in an armoire. He said the couple, who also have four biological children, 'thought this was their chance to make a difference in kids' lives'. Hot: Beagley squirted the hot sauce into the mouth of her seven-year-old son as punishment . Anchorage Police were notified about the case after viewers of the self-improvement talk show Dr Phil saw the footage.

He replies, in tears, saying: 'I get hot sauce.' The video shows Beagley putting the hot sauce in the boy's mouth. She then tells him not to spit it out.

A brave traffic warden who exposed the secret quotas enforced by parking bosses has been awarded £20,000 for unfair dismissal. Hakim Berkani, 44, was hailed a hero after revealing that wardens are forced to issue 10 tickets a day - but he was told he will not be able to get his old job back as it would be returning him to ‘the lions’ den’. Details of the Kensington and Chelsea quota policy emerged at a tribunal which ruled he was wrongly sacked for opposing contractor NSL, which has deals in boroughs across the capital, including Westminster. The judgement found Mr Berkani was sacked because of his opposition to the secret quota. It also found his managers sacked him under trumped up charges. Mr Berkani had wanted his former job back but today the tribunal ruled 'trust and confidence' between the parties had eroded to an extent where that would be impossible. Instead they awarded £20,000 pay out including three months wages for future losses. Employment Tribunal judge Jeremy Burns said the managers he was in conflict with would still be his supervisors and re-hiring him would send him back to the 'lions’ den'. A traffic warden for Kensington & Chelsea council, where Mr Berkani (not pictured here) had worked for more than three years when he was sacked . He said: 'We did find the claimant opposed the quota system, the operation of which put pressure on the civil enforcement officers to issue tickets. 'We found that it was this situation which led to the deterioration between the claimant and his managers. 'His managers are still in the same position and if he were to be re-instated they would still have their daggers drawn. They do not accept the rulings of the tribunal and it would be like sending him back to the lion’s den. The father-of-two, from Wandsworth, . was sacked for gross misconduct last February, following three years’ service, after tipping off a driver set to be given a ticket by another . warden. At the previous tribunal hearing in . Holborn, judge Jeremy Burns ruled that Mr Berkani was unfairly dismissed . for his 'opposition to the respondent’s clandestine quote system' and . his GMB trade union activities. Mr Burns said the former warden was an intelligent man who spoke a number of languages and should find suitable employment within three months. The contractor NSL said 'trust and confidence' between Mr Berkani and his employer had 'broken down to the core' and re-hiring him would be an 'untenable situation'. But Mr Berkani said the company did not want to hire him because a quota system was still in place. He said: 'I believe the practices are still in place and they believe my presence there would impact the productivity and the issuing of tickets.' NSL head of Human Resource director Janet Daley refused to answer any questions regarding whether if the contractor still operated a secret quota system. But the contractor has repeatedly denied the existence of a secret quota.Under questioning from Alasdair Seton-Marsden, acting for Mr Berkani, Mrs Daley refused to comment if NSL still operated quotas. She said: 'I refuse to answer any questions on a quota system.' She said managers at other depots in London would resign if Mr Berkani was redeployed there. Mr Berkani said he had been blacklisted from other parking contractors’ employers. He said: 'I applied for many jobs with other contractors and local councils but never got a reply. 'I was blacklisted.' He told the tribunal he had applied for more than 200 jobs since being sacked from NSL last February but had been unable to obtain suitable work. He said: 'I will work anywhere I am just desperate for a job. But there are no jobs out there and whenever I apply there are 50 or more applicants for one job. 'I wanted to work as a public servant and do a duty for the public. That dream job was taken away when they unfairly sacked me.' Outside court Mr Berkani said he was disappointed he would not return to work patrolling the streets of Kensington and Chelsea. He said: 'I’m very disappointed because I believe that justice has not been done. My job was worth more to me than any amount of money. 'It was judged that I was sacked unfairly and yet NSL punished for their actions.' The tribunal found that three NSL bosses - Andrew Davison, Stephen Rowlands and Andy Dunbar - had tried to 'frame' Mr Berkani on trumped-up charges.","Hakim Berkani, was hailed a hero .

British farmers could be forced to spend about £28 million revamping their pig sheds – because a new ruling from Brussels says gaps in the floors are a millimetre too wide. Many are threatening to quit farming altogether rather than spend cash on what they call ‘millimetre madness’. Bacon, pork and ham would all become more expensive if supplies to shops were disrupted as a result. Outraged: Many are threatening to quit farming altogether rather than spend cash on what they call 'millimetre madness' About a third of the 9.5 million pigs reared in this country each year live indoors on concrete slatted floors. For more than 20 years, the gaps between the slats have been governed  by a British industry standard that has stipulated an opening of three- quarters of an inch (19mm). These gaps are vital for hygiene. But a new European Union directive set to come into force next January has decreed that the maximum size of a gap should be reduced to 18mm. Animal welfare chiefs in Brussels believe this will stop pigs catching their trotters and suffering injuries. Safety: Animal welfare chiefs in Brussels believe the new directive will stop pigs catching their trotters in gaps and suffering injuries . But farmers and vets say there is no evidence that pigs are being hurt. And they add that a narrower gap could hamper the cleaning of the sheds and leave pigs in dirty conditions, which could cause infections. Urgent talks are now being held between the National Pig Association (NPA) and Jim Paice, Food and Farming Minister. Concerning: Urgent talks are now being held between the National Pig Association (NPA) and Jim Paice, Food and Farming Minister . NPA chairman Richard Longthorpe said: ‘We are worried that farmers will fall foul of the law if they are 1mm out. What we need is a pragmatic solution.’ About 800 of Britain’s 2,500 commercial pig farmers could be affected, although the NPA is conducting a  survey to establish a more accurate figure. On average, if each farmer had to replace the flooring in a shed for 1,000 animals, it would cost £35,000, giving a total bill of £28 million. Richard Lister, 49, from Boroughbridge, North Yorkshire, has a herd of 80,000 pigs. He says the new rule would land him with a bill for £120,000 – and that he would quit pig farming rather than pay to have the work carried out. Mr Lister said: ‘It is another part of the ridiculousness that is Brussels. If we had a problem with our slats, we would have a lot of lame pigs and that is not the case.  Everyone I’ve spoken to thinks it’s mad.’ Dr Steve McOrist, a pig spokesman for the British Veterinary Association, said straw bedding could become trapped in the smaller gaps. ‘If pigs have contact with their own manure, the incidence of salmonella would be higher,’ he said. A spokesman at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘It is too early to make any comment about the new rules.’","A new European Union directive has decreed that the maximum size of a gap should be reduced to 18mm .

A teenager accused of bludgeoning his parents with a hammer before hosting a party at their home signs jailhouse autographs exclaiming 'It's hammer time,' calls himself 'hammer boy,' and says he has seen and talked to the devil, a fellow inmate told police. The inmate, Justin Toney, described 18-year-old Tyler Hadley's jailhouse fame in interviews outlined in investigative files released by prosecutors. Hadley has pleaded not guilty in the bludgeonings last July of Blake and Mary-Jo Hadley. Toney told investigators that Hadley is known as 'Hambo' and 'Bamm-Bamm' by other inmates and that he has given autographs, including some on news articles about his case. Charged: Tyler Hadley, seen here in his booking photo, has been charged as an adult for the killings of his parents . Every time a new inmate is admitted, Toney said in the February 21 interview, Hadley makes an introduction. 'What's up man?' Toney quoted Hadley as saying. 'You know who I am? I'm the hammer boy.' The inmate says Hadley has given differing accounts of why he allegedly committed the crimes. First, he said, Hadley blamed it on medication he was on. Later, though, he said Hadley explained it was because he wanted to have a party and knew his parents would not let him. 'All this to have a party?' Detective Kristin Meyer of the Port St. Lucie Police asked. 'That's what he said,' Toney replied. Parents: The bodies of Blake and Mary-Jo Hadley were found in their bedroom where they had been lying as their son held a rowdy party . Family: Hadley's mother Mary-Jo and father Blake were found beaten to death with a hammer, which was lying between their bodies . Toney said Hadley told him he had been contemplating the killings for about three weeks and had considered using a garden tool instead. 'He said he seen the devil,' Toney said. 'He said he talked to the devil and the devil talked to him.' Still, there are glimpses of a different Hadley in the files. Toney said Hadley would sometimes bring him a ramen noodle cup, and often expressed remorse for his alleged crimes. In a log of a jailhouse visit with his older brother, Ryan, Hadley tells his brother he loves him and tells him to tell others he says hello and loves them too. Kelly Reynolds, who was interviewed by police but whose relationship to Hadley was not made clear, said he was an altar boy. Hadley's public defender, Mark Harllee, did not return a call on Friday seeking comment. Hadley told a friend interviewed by police, Daniel Roberts, that his father had punched him in the face several times and had shown signs of injuries at times, according to the files. But Toney said Hadley told him he'd never been beaten or molested, and Ryan Hadley called his parents 'awesome' and his brother a 'pathological liar'. Murder weapon: Police believe Hadley battered his parents to death with this hammer . Police have said about 60 people, invited via Facebook, gathered for a party at Hadley's house after his parents were killed, playing beer pong, smoking cigars and drinking. Friends described Hadley as being in a good mood and hospitable as the bloody bodies of his parents was strewn across the floor of their bedroom. Toney said Hadley claimed to have spent $2,000 on drugs and alcohol for the party, describing it as 'so much fun'. He said Hadley knew he had 'shocked the world' and realised something about his parents as he allegedly attacked them with a hammer. 'I said, ""Did they try to stop you?""' Toney asked about the attack.

In January, the Turkish Government wrote to the museum to request that the grey carved stone object, known as the Samsat Stele, be removed from their collection and transferred to back to its homeland. The basalt stone from the 1st century BC, measures 1.3m high (4.3ft), and is currently on display in Room 52 of the museum. Dispute: The basalt stone from the 1st century BC, measures 1.3m high (4.3ft). In January, the Turkish Government wrote to the museum to request that the grey carved stone slab, known as the Samsat Stele be returned . The Elgin Marbles refer to a collection of stone objects depicting gods, men and monsters - were removed from Athens' Parthenon in 1811 by Lord Elgin. He was the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire that controlled Greece at the time. The objects were then purchased by the British Parliament from Lord Elgin in 1816 and presented by Parliament to the British Museum, where they have been resided since. The subject of their return to Greece has become both a political and national issue, with the Greeks demanding they be sent back to their country of origin, while London's British Museum has insisted they stay in England. It does not attract as many visitors as the museum's glamorous Elgin Marbles, which famously Greece demanded be returned, but is now at the centre of a dispute as both sides lay down their reasons for claiming rightful ownership. Found in southern Turkey in 1882, it has been in Britain for decades, after Sir Charles Leonard Woolley, the museum's director of excavations, purchased it in 1927. The slab, has an image of ancient King Antiochus carved out, greeting Herakles. It has a large hole drilled through the middle because it has been used as a olive press in the past. Turkey's letter in January is not a one-off, they have recently demanded the return of several pieces worldwide in recent years. Targets included on their campaign to restore art to the country include the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the J.Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the Louvre in Paris and the State Museums of Berlin. Although many of the claims were put . in years ago, Osman Murat Suslu, the new director of cultural heritage . and museums has stepped them up since he was appointed in 2010. Turkey has started to refuse loan request from museums that posses the disputed objects. The . British Museum had asked for 35 items for the exhibition Hajj: Journey . to the Heart of Islam  but although Turkish museums were agreeable to . the loans, the ministry of culture blocked them, leaving the British . Museum to find alternative objects at short notice. The . V&A is facing a similar problem over its planned exhibition, The .

Diagnosed with severe autism aged 18 months, Billy is so . affected by the disorder that he still has trouble speaking fluently. Scroll down for video . Presidential Address: Reading from a sheet, Billy Pagoni has asked President Obama for help getting a college place . With seemingly no available programs across the nation able . to take on someone with his specialised needs, Billy’s direct video to . President Obama has become widely viewed across the internet. ‘Dear President Obama, my name is Billy Pagoni,’ explained the hopeful student who appears slightly nervous with his address to the Commander in . Chief. ‘I want to be a baker. I am a great student. I never miss a . day of school. ‘I get straight A’s on my report card. Please, can you help . me get to college? ‘I am an American. I am autistic.’ Going to the top for help: Posting his video on Facebook, Billy is hoping to raise awareness of severely autistic children's plight gaining a college place . Giving the camera a cute wave at the end of his public plea, . Billy is struggling with a system that doesn’t seem to cater for college . applicants who have autism. With universities across the country currently offering . programs for blind, deaf and high functioning Asperger’s students, the options . for severely autistic high school students are small to nothing. ‘When you look online, it looks like, yes there are programs . for these students,’ said Billy’s mother Edith Pagoni the director of KNEADS, a non-profit social and vocational program for adolescents and young adults with autism in Naples. ‘But what universities actually have are programmes for . extremely rare, high functioning, savant-like autistic children. ‘There is nothing for kids who have splintered skills - for . those who are excellent with computers, but may need a subject like geography . broken down for them. 'I am an American. I am autistic.' Billy's plea to President Obama has spread across the internet . ‘There’s a complete generation of these kids who are aging . out of school, who will have nothing to do. 'If colleges had a program for autism that addresses . specific skills for these kids, there would be people at the door waiting.’ Billy is known around his Naples as the ‘puzzle-boy’ as he is adept at . gluing puzzles together and handing them to people around town. He is also a talented artist and sells his work through Florida’s yearly Bonita Springs Art . Festival. His love of baking came after Edith took him to a German bread . baker in Florida. Because of his enthusiasm for the process of baking she enrolled him in classes who . were accommodating of his autism. Now, . Billy cooks most of his own meals. Heart-Felt Plea: Billy Pagoni is hoping the top man hears his request . 'He really wants something a little more than that, where he can take a . vocational skill as a prep chef or a sous chef,' said Edith . However with Billy one year away from graduation he can not find a college that will . accept him. Applying to multiple institutions in the Naples . area Billy has been denied from . every one. 'They tell me there’s no place for him,' Edith said. 'He goes to school . every day, he gets A’s in a specialized curriculum, but he’s being . denied a post-secondary experience.'

The star-studded Cannes Film Festival is at the centre of a bitter sexism row because all entries for this year’s prestigious Palme d’Or are men. No less than 22 male directors will compete for the prize in the French Riviera resort this week. This is despite women stars including Angelina Jolie - who will attend this year’s festival with Brad Pitt - and Madonna getting behind the camera to shoot films. Ignored: Female directors such as Angelina Jolie, left, and Madonna, right, have not been shortlisted for the Palme d'Or . It has led to a group of leading women directors writing an open letter to the Cannes organisers attacking the way ‘exclusively male films’ are being judged, and that ‘men love depth in women, but only in their cleavage’. The letter published in Le Monde also reads: ‘In Cannes, the women show off their show-reels, the men their films’, and that  actresses are solely celebrated for their ‘beauty, grace or lightness’. Referring to the famous Palais de Festival in Cannes, it says that the general message was: ‘Above all, do not let young girls think that one day they might have the nerve to make films and climb the steps of the Palais other than on the arm of a prince charming.’ The protestors point to the fact that an image of the American sex symbol Marilyn Monroe – who died 50 years ago – was being used on the official festival poster this year, and that talented women are mainly acting as comperes. Glamorous: Berenice Bejo, left, will be hosting the opening and closing ceremonies for the festival. The main role of other female stars such as Sharon Stone, right, will be to look beautiful . Berenice Bejo, the 35-year-old French-Argentinian actress who shot to fame in The Artist last year, will be hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, for example. Although stars like Jolie, Marion Cotillard, Kristine Stewart and Sharon Stone are expected on the Cannes red carpet this week, their main role will be to look beautiful. Among those signing the letter on behalf of a feminist collective called The Beard are the celebrated French women directors such as Coline Serreau, who received three Cesar awards for Three Men and a Cradle in 1985. Since the Cannes festival started in 1946 the Palme d’Or (or Palm of Gold) has gone to only one woman - New-Zealander Jane Campion for The Piano in 1993. Past male winners, meanwhile, include Cecil B. DeMille, David Lean, Mike Leigh and Martin Scorsese. But Thierry Fremaux, who is charge of the committee which selects the Cannes films, said he would never choose a film ‘that doesn’t deserve it just because it’s directed by a woman’. Mr Fremaux said the lack of female directing talent reflected an industry-wide problem, and that ‘there is no doubt that women’s role needs to be improved.’","All entries for this year’s prestigious Palme d’Or are men .

FBI agents discovered only two guns while raiding the house of a reputed Connecticut mobster suspected of having information about the 1990 robbery of a Boston museum that remains the largest art heist in history. The mystery deepens after yesterday's search by more than 20 agents in haz-mat suits turned up nothing connected to the art heist. They examined a car in the driveway, searched a wooded area and removed boxes of evidence from the ranch-style suburban home of 75-year-old Robert Gentile, who has been detained since February on federal drug and weapons charges. Scroll down for video . The hunt is on: Law enforcement agents searched the home of reputed 75-year-old Connecticut mobster Robert Gentile yesterday . No stone unturned: An agent in a haz-mat suit searched Gentile's Buick; . but they found nothing in connection with the art heist, only two guns . Teeming: Both local police and FBI were present at Gentile's home all day yesterday . Among the materials the FBI carried from or dug up around Gentile's . home were a gun and a silencer found buried in the backyard, . according to people familiar with the events. The pistol and silencer are likely to result in new charges against . Gentile, a sworn member of the Mafia. Federal authorities have not tied Gentile to the Gardner job in . public, but they have pressed him privately for information about the . heist for years, according to a variety of sources familiar with the . investigation. During the 1990 robbery, thieves disguised as police officers struck as Boston finished celebrating St Patrick's Day, binding two guards, before stealing masterworks by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas and Manet. The stolen art is worth more than half a billion dollars. Despite a $5million ‘no questions asked’ reward by the museum, countless searches, and intense media coverage, no one has been charged in the heist. When the FBI picked up the hot-tempered Gentile and a 75-year-old . co-defendant in February on charges of illegally selling prescription . painkillers, agents asked about the Gardner theft as they drove him from . his home to the federal courthouse in Hartford, according to the . co-defendant. Underground clues: Agents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar . Thorough: An agent ruffles through the contents of the shed in Gentile's back yard . Gentile - short, white-haired, overweight and nearly crippled by an assortment of illnesses - claims to know nothing. 'Lies, lies,' Gentile said while appearing in court in March. 'It's all lies.' Gentile's lawyers claim that federal . prosecutors are piling charges on a 'sick old man' in a futile effort to . force him to divulge information . that he doesn't have about the Gardner job. 'They are telling my client he is going to die in jail unless he gives . them more information, and he doesn't have any more information,' A. Ryan McGuigan, one of Gentile's lawyers, said yesterday. 'I'm sure that . if they can charge him with another crime, they will.' Mr McGuigan said the FBI returned to . his client's property in Manchester, just outside Hartford, because the . agency had a new warrant allowing the use of ground-penetrating radar to . look for buried weapons. Mr McGuigan said he believes agents are really looking for stolen paintings but will find no such thing. 'This is nonsense,' he said. 'This is the FBI. Are you trying to tell me they missed something the first time? They're trying to find $500 million of stolen artwork... All they're going to find is night crawlers,’ though he later added that he believes authorities had recovered two weapons. Irreplaceable: Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum . According to the Boston Globe, officials brought in some non-human helpers as well, using two beagles and a ferret to search for possible weapons. One neighbour told the Globe that the elderly Gentile lives a quiet life with his wife. ‘They are very nice people, very quiet people,’ they said. A federal prosecutor said in March the FBI believes Gentile had some involvement with stolen property related to the 1990 heist. Gentile has not been charged in the art robbery and Mr McGuigan says his client does not know anything about it. A U.S. attorney's office spokesman declined to comment. A message left with an FBI spokesman was not immediately returned. Heist of the century: The thieves also made off with Degas' La Sortie du Pelage . Dutch Master: The thieves stole two Rembrandts -  The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black (right) His attorney says authorities first approached Gentile about the heist two years ago and, when he offered no information, they dispatched an undercover witness to buy prescription drugs from him. FBI agents see in Gentile not an old man who limps with a cane but a . violent gangster who has been active in rackets in Hartford and Boston . since the 1960s. In the 1990s, not long after the Gardner job, he was . associated with a Boston mob crew run by Robert Luisi, a Philadelphia . gangster who moved into a vacuum created by the FBI's . It was Luisi who 'made' Gentile by inducting him into the Philadelphia mafia group, federal prosecutors said. In progress: Left, Degas' Three Mounted Jockeys, and right, a self-portrait of Rembrandt . Most valuable: Jan Vermeer's The Concert is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter . The museum continues to offer a $5 million, no-questions-asked reward. Gentile's lawyer says that if he were some type of arch-criminal, he would have figured a way to get the reward money. Prosecutors say Gentile is a member of a Philadelphia crime family. His lawyer denies the mob allegation. However, Gentile was convicted of larceny in 1996. Convicted felons may not possess firearms or ammunition that have been transported across state lines or from overseas. Federal law also prohibits possession of a silencer unless it's been registered. Each of the three weapons charges carries a maximum prison term of 10 years and a fine of up to $250,000. Authorities say FBI agents have had unproductive discussions with Gentile about the art theft. The Courant reports that Gentile was deemed a threat to public safety by a federal judge, and will be held without bail while he waits for trial.

In April The desperate hunt for the missing cheerleader was thwarted by an internet hacker, who used her Twitter account to write: ‘By the way, we do punch’ followed by an expletive.

New hope: Glen Cunningham, with partner Yasmin Malik and son Glen, can hardly believe that a total stranger has agreed to pay for him to receive a life-prolonging drug . The family of a man with 10 brain tumours say their prayers have been answered after a generous stranger agreed to pay for a life-prolonging drug denied to him by the NHS. Father-of-two Glen Cunningham, 29, who suffers from a rare form of cancer called gliosarcoma, had been planning a fundraising mission after he was refused Avastin, a ‘wonder-drug’ which costs £33,500 per year. But he now hopes to spend more time with his partner and young children after a property developer decided to donate the entire sum himself. Kenny Vickers, 34, and wife Melody, 33, whose youngest son is fighting for life after being born prematurely, were touched by a report of Mr Cunningham's plight in a local newspaper. Mr Cunningham's mother Patricia, 64, from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, said: 'I misheard the amount, I thought it was . £3,500, which in itself is fantastic, but £33,500? I am going to cry. 'What can we say except our prayers have been answered.' Speaking after Mr Cunningham and his family travelled to Sheffield for more treatment, his partner Yasmin Malik, 26, said: 'I am honestly stunned. 'I don’t quite know what to say. I . never thought for one minute there would be people in the world as . generous as this, it’s not sinking in. 'Glen is still half asleep from . yesterday, I don’t think he can believe it, we can’t thank this man . enough for what he has done.' Mr Cunningham, a plasterer from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, hopes the drug will shrink his tumours, two of which are inoperable, and extend his life, giving him more time to spend with daughter Lauren, seven, and a 10-month-old son, also named Glen. South Tyneside Primary Care Trust (PCT) had . said there wasn’t enough evidence the injections, which are licensed by . the Government, would help him. Mr Vickers, of the Isle of Skye, also has a home in South Shields and read of Mr Cunningham's predicament in their local newspaper, the Shields Gazette. He said he and his wife were in 'floods of tears' at Mr Cunningham's circumstances. 'We are lucky enough to be quite . comfortable financially and so we would like to give Glen the chance to . see his children grow up and spend more time with them,' he added. 'To me life is everything and very precious, and I want to give Glen the quality time he deserves with his family.' But Mr Vickers, a father of seven, is also facing a troubled time in his own family. His youngest child, 10-week-old . Preston, is fighting for life after being born 14 weeks prematurely, . weighing just 1lbs 11.5 ozs and is in South Tyneside District Hospital’s . Special Care Baby Unit. Preston has suffered from two holes in . his bowel, plus a double hernia and needs further surgery at . Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary on Thursday. Mr Vickers said: 'We have children and we . know how difficult it can be, especially at the moment, so we know what . it’s like to be going through hard times. 'We wish Glen and his family the best . of luck and we just hope our gift will help. 'If he needs anything else, . all he has to do is ask.' Doting father: Mr Cunningham hopes the injections will enable him to spend more time with his son, Glen, and daughter, Lauren . South Tyneside PCT told Mr Cunningham last week that it was not prepared to pay the £33,600 a year it would cost for him to receive a course of twice-monthly injections. He then began planning a fundraising campaign, claiming it was his 'last chance', but Mr Vickers's intervention means he can be treated even sooner. Mr Cunningham was diagnosed with cancer in December 2006 after he suffered a seizure. During 2007 he endured chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, and was delighted when he went into remission. Three years later, in September 2010, doctors discovered the tumour had returned and Glen found himself facing further surgery. When the cancer came back yet again at . the start of 2011, Mr Cunningham went through gamma knife - a special . type of brain radiation treatment. The difficulties surrounding the drug Avastin relate in part to the fact that, while it can be legally prescribed in the UK, . it has not been approved for use by . the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) - which . gives advice on which drugs should be made available to the NHS. NICE, which weighs up the relative . costs and benefits of drugs, believes Avastin is too expensive based on . the benefits it provides. From 2014, the Department of Health plan to bring in a new system called 'value-based pricing.' Under the plans, groups of GPs will decided whether a drug should be funded or not rather than the medicines watchdog NICE. Ministers hope this will help to make new drugs affordable through direct price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies. NICE will continue to give advice on which drugs are effective.","Property developer to pay for medication that South Tyneside Primary Care Trust said was too expensive .

Steven Dunn, of Burton, Staffs, was banned for four years after he was caught driving drunk on the school run . A father driving his two young sons home from school was more than three times over the drink-drive limit. Steven Dunn, 32, consumed a ‘vast amount of alcohol’ the night before and downed five more cans of lager that afternoon, magistrates at Burton, Staffordshire, heard. Dunn was banned for four years after he was caught driving with his sons, six and eight, in the back seat. Emma Thompson, prosecuting, said: 'He had his two sons in the car when he was pulled over. 'It quickly became apparent that he was unfit through drink. He was more than three times the drink-driving limit.' Dunn, of Stapenhill, Burton, claimed he felt ‘fit to drive’ even though he had been drinking for four hours straight that afternoon and had eaten nothing all day. The two boys were picked up from Burton Police Station by their mother after Dunn was arrested. Magistrates heard the school was just ten minutes’ walk from the family home, but Dunn had decided to drive as he was running late. Sonia Lawrence, defending, said her client had a ‘problem with alcohol’ and had been stashing it in his car to drink secretly. Miss Lawrence said: 'He has been drinking to excess and has had a dependency for 12 months. Dunn was pulled over while driving a Ford Fiesta. He was found to have 110 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath when tested. The legal limit is 35 micrograms.

"By . Nina Golgowski . UPDATED: . 15:33 EST, 7 March 2012 . A pair of 73-year-old twin sisters and former television stars had been dead for 'at least several weeks' before police found them in their California home after succumbing to what investigators believe were natural causes just a short time between one another. Former 1950s entertainers Patricia and Joan Miller were found in separate rooms of their shared South Lake Tahoe home late last month but foul play has been ruled out. Medical investigators have not been able to determine how or when the women died but their decomposed bodies suggest they had been dead for at least several weeks when they were found, said detective Matt Harwood. Scroll down for video . Shared life: Twins Patricia and Joan Miller, 73, were discovered deceased in their South Lake Tahoe residence just a short time between one another from what police believe were natural causes . There was no blood, no signs of struggle . and nothing indicated that the women had persistent health . troubles.Toxicology reports will not be available for at least two more . months. After a life in showbiz, dancing and . singing on TV as well as at several military bases with their mother on . piano, the twins spent their last decades as recluses who never married, . say police. Detectives are now on a hunt for their next of kin. Discovered on February 26 after not responding to a home welfare check, El Dorado County Sheriff's deputies say they found one of the sisters in her downstairs bedroom and the other in the hallway outside. Unable to find living relatives of the two women, police have combed their home for information from documents and pictures. One photograph showed the women as young girls sitting on the lap of the American singer and actor Bing Crosby. Another showed them wearing tap dancing shoes. The . two women regularly appeared on the weekly television show, The Hoffman . Hayride, with their parents 'heavily involved in their entertainment . business', according to the sheriff's office. Friends . tell deputies that the sisters were dependent on each other throughout . their lives though being from Portland, Oregon originally, they may have . family still within the area. Detective Harwood said it was as if the two sisters, long each other's only companion, could not live without each other. 'My perception is one died and the other . couldn't handle it,' said the detective, who has been unable to identify any . close friends or family members to inform of the sisters' deaths. 'It . appears purely natural, but we are still trying to piece it all . together.' It is unusual for police to release the names . of the dead without first informing their relatives, but the sisters' shrouded lives made that impossible, he added. 'The circumstance surrounding their . death is somewhat of an enigma,' he said. 'These two only ever had each . other, and we would like, at least for their sake, to notify their . family.' The detective told the Los Angeles Times: 'I think they need to have some family know that they’re gone. 'I think they deserve that.' Unraveling history: In detectives' hunt for family, they uncovered numerous photos from the twins' days entertaining on TV and for American troops, along with one photo of them seated as young girls on the lap of Bing Crosby . The deaths have confused some residents . in the resort town of South Lake Tahoe, where homeowners tend to be . close-knit and the sisters' reclusiveness had long inspired questions . and concern. In the past year, there were hints that . something was amiss at the Miller home. A neighbour spotted an ambulance . at the house a year ago and assumed they had fallen ill. Someone asked . police to check regularly on the house. When someone arrived on February 25 for . a routine check, no one answered the door. The next day, police forced . their way in and found the bodies. There was no blood, no signs of . struggle. Nothing indicated that the women had persistent health . troubles. Their longtime home was not disheveled or unkempt - potential . signs of mental or physical illness. Detective Harwood said he called a nearby centre for the elderly to see if the sisters were visitors, but no one there had heard . of them. He checked with Meals on Wheels volunteers, but the sisters did not appear to have received their services. The only relative he found . in his preliminary searches was the sisters' deceased mother. As news of the deaths spread, former . South Lake Tahoe residents called police to report that they had lived . near the sisters for decades in some cases, and had hardly seen them. One sent in a postcard that claimed the sisters were the only remaining . members of their family after their mother's death and their brother . died at war. Calls made to several longtime . residents and social groups in the area turned up little, as many . community leaders said they had never heard of the sisters. Joan Miller was a senior accounting . clerk in the payroll department at the Lake Tahoe Unified School . District from 1979 to 1984. Patricia Miller, who drove a white . convertible with red upholstery, worked in the El Dorado County's social . services office during that time. 'I never heard of anyone else being in . either of their lives,' said Betty Mitchell, 89, who supervised . Patricia Miller in the social services office and saw the twins around . town. 'They were inseparable and really identical.' The sisters were said to be friendly and often . told stories of their singing adventures. They told Mrs Mitchell they had . performed at Yosemite National Park and when their mother came to visit . from Oregon, they all dined at her home. But the sisters were also guarded. When Mrs Mitchell urged them to join a community choir, they declined. They . never discussed their social lives. 'They kept things to themselves,' Mrs Mitchell said. 'I don't even know if they had siblings.' The sisters never seemed interested in . dating or expanding their social spheres. They listed each other as . their next of kin, the detective said. He added: 'All they had was each other and that's actually the way they wanted it.' Joyce Peterson of the International . Twins Association, a social group based in Oklahoma, said she once heard . of 100-year-old twins who died within days of each other. 'As a twin, you've got this bond, . you're close - almost like a married couple,"" she said. 'It's a bond no one else can understand."" The Miller twins appeared in poor . health recently and possibly had been treated a year ago for dehydration . or malnutrition, Detective Harwood said. Their childhood friend told him . that the sisters stopped sending annual birthday cards last year, and . when the friend called to enquire about the missing card, the sisters . seem disinterested in continuing the relationship. Neighbours would call and the sisters would say, 'Let me call you right back,' and then wouldn't. Detective Harwood said: 'They weren't taking care of themselves as they should or could have.' The precise cause of death for either of the two women has not been determined.

One of America's top spies has revealed key details of the shadowy world he lived in for 24 years - including how he used his own wife in a mission. Hank Crumpton, who served as deputy director of the CIA's Counter-Terrorism Center and led the U.S. response to 9/11, told 60 Minutes he owes his wife 'everything'. Asked about an operation involving the mother of his three children, Crumpton told CBS: 'This one operation that you refer to we had a communications device embedded in a cooler. Family man: Former CIA officer Hank Crumpton revealed his wife had no formal training as a spy, but occasionally helped in his operations . 'We were transporting it across a . border to deliver to an agent so he could . install it and so we could have regular communications with him. 'My spouse was an integral part of that effort as she was with many more.' Asked whether his wife had training . as a spy, he said: 'No training but just through the course of necessity . while raising three children.' Crumpton, who also led the team hunting Osama bin Laden, described the wife he met in . Africa as a 'terrific partner in marriage and in espionage'. 'I owe her . everything,' he added. The former officer ran . one of the spy agency's secret domestic networks conducted . counter-intelligence within the U.S. as the chief of the CIA's National . Resources Division. Crumpton also led the U.S. response . to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and talked about the months in . Afghanistan after America declared war on the country and the CIA led . the mission to topple the Taliban. Ex-CIA: Hank Crumpton spoke to CBS's Lara Logan regarding his pessimism about how many foreign spies there are in the U.S. Varied: Crumpton served as deputy director of the CIA's Counter-Terrorism Center and led the U.S. response to 9/11, as well as being on loan to the FBI . In his book, The Art of Intelligence, he tells how he learned about insurgency first-hand from African rebels. He learned about blood feuds from Afghan tribal leaders and he learned that al Qaeda terrorists and enemy agents from North Korea all have a weakness for porn. Crumpton said: 'I never met a North Korean that did not like pornography.' Telling interviewer Lara Logan what he would have to do in his line of work, Crumpton said: 'Supplying porn to a North Korean official to entice them to spy for America, along with money or whatever else it might take. Well, for me the answer was yes, I was willing to do that.' Crumpton also told how he led a special unit tasked with finding bin Laden five years before 9/11 and, in late summer 1999, had the former al Qaida leader  in his sights - but was refused permission to kill him. He said: 'From 98, '99 all the way up to 2001, the warnings were there. We had extensive human networks in Afghanistan, Afghan sources that had been reporting on al Qaeda, on the presence of bin Laden.' 'I would hazard to guess there are more . foreign intelligence officers inside the U.S. working against U.S. interests now than even at the height of the Cold War. It's a critical . issue.' Hank Crumpton . But Crumpton said President Clinton's White House didn't trust the CIA's Afghan sources alone and they wanted U.S. eyes on the target. 'So we were driven to look at various technical options. And we looked at a range of things. Long-range optics, they were too heavy, too cumbersome to get over the mountains. 'We looked at balloons. The prevailing winds would take those balloons to China. That would be a bad thing. We scrapped that. And then we stumbled across the UAVs, particularly the Predator. 'And sure enough, wasn't long before we had the Predator in theater over Afghanistan, the Predator unarmed at the time. And our human sources took us to a village-- far-- not far from Kandahar. 'We saw a security detail, a convoy and we saw bin Laden exit the vehicle. Clearly. And we had-- the optics were spot on. It was beaming back to us, CIA headquarters. 'We immediately alerted the White House. And the Clinton administration's response was, ""Well, it will take several hours for the TLAMs, the cruise missiles launched from submarines, to reach that objective. So you need to tell us where bin Laden will be five or six hours from now."" The frustration was enormous.' Crumpton said he wanted to kill the terrorist there and then, but was denied permission. Speaking about the amount of foreign spies on U.S. soil, he told CBS: 'If you look at the threat that is imposed upon our nation every day, some of the major nation states - China in particular - have very sophisticated intelligence operations, very aggressive operations against the U.S. 'I would hazard to guess there are more foreign intelligence officers inside the U.S. working against U.S. interests now than even at the height of the Cold War. It's a critical issue.' He also expressed his concerns about what al Qaeda are doing in North Africa and the danger they pose. 'I'm . particularly concerned about al Qaeda in Yemen, which is fractured as a . nation state. The Sahel, if you look at al Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb, . they pose a threat, and in Somalia. Those are the places I'd be . concerned,' he said. He . also believes the U.S. government should not withdraw the troops too . quickly as he fears al Qaeda could make a comeback in Afghanistan. He said: 'You've got so many mistakes on the U.S. side, and you've got a feckless, corrupt government on the Afghan side.

Luxury British car-maker Jaguar Land Rover is set for another jobs boost as its Indian owners yesterday announced a doubling of investment to £1.5billion a year to fund a range of new models – both at home and abroad. The extra cash injection and prospect of thousands of new jobs comes as the firm is set to announce Jaguar and Land Rover production in booming China. It already builds Land Rovers in India. Tata said it had now selected a Chinese joint venture partner for manufacturing its luxury vehicles in China and that an official announcement will be made ‘very soon'. Magazine: Autocar has uncovered a secret 'baby' Jaguar project. It yesterday emerged that Jaguar Land Rover is set for another jobs boost as its Indian owners announced a doubling of investment to £1.5billion a year to fund a range of new models . Chinese sources said in December that Jaguar Land Rover had ‘agreed in principle’ to develop a luxury car with China's Chery Automobile. But bosses in India stressed that UK production and investment will also increase. This is understood to include a top secret new ‘baby’ saloon car costing around £22,000 to take on Audi’s popular A3 hatchback which could be launched within three years. Jaguar Land Rover’s Indian parent company Tata Motors said on Tuesday it will double investments in its Jaguar and Land Rover models to £1.5billion a year. Speaking in India, Tata's chief financial officer Mr CR Ramakrishnan said: 'Over the past five to six years, Jaguar land Rover has spent around £700million to £800million annually on capital expenditure and product development. 'Going forward, we will double that. Jaguar Land Rover spending will be in the order of £1.5billion each year.’ Mr Ramakrishnan told reporters that the increase would apply in the current fiscal year ending in March. Jaguar Land Rover contributed 95 per cent of Tata Motors profits in the quarter to the end of December, with a profit margin of 20 per cent - three times the profitability seen at Tata's domestic business. Hilton Holloway, of leading motoring . magazine Autocar, said of the secret ‘baby’ Jaguar project: ‘According . to sources in India the new model is thought to be about 4.5metres long. ‘There will be a number of variations on the mainstay four-door saloon, including a coupe and possibly a small roadster.’ Jaguar's Halewood factory on Merseyside is also tipped for expansion with investment of up to £100million to double the size of the plant and the create up to 1,500 new jobs . In November, Jaguar Land Rover announced 1,000 new jobs to accelerate its export-led expansion plans. This will help deliver 40 significant new models and variants over the next five years under a multi-billion pound investment in new vehicles. The new British jobs will be created at the firm’s Land Rover plant in Solihull, West Midlands – one of its three factories – and represents a 25 per cent increase in the plant’s workforce. The firm’s Halewood factory on Merseyside is also tipped for expansion with investment of up to £100million to double the size of the plant and the create up to 1,500 new jobs. It already builds the compact new Range Rover Evoque, which has won a clutch of awards with Victoria Beckham designing the interior for a special edition ‘VB’ version. A top secret new generation Range Rover is set to go into production at Solihull this Autumn. Heavily disguised prototypes of the luxury 4X4 in black and white zebra stripes were spotted on test in and around the Queen’s Balmoral estate in Scotland in November. Jaguar Land Rover is also on a product roll with a new two-seater Jaguar sports car – codenamed C-X16 but already dubbed the E-Type for the 21st century to go on sale next year – as well as two new prototype versions of its iconic Defender for production in 2015. In May last year it unveiled a £1million petrol-electric hybrid British supercar codenamed C-X7 and the most expensive and 'greenest' Jaguar in its history. Prime Minister David Cameron and a number of Cabinet ministers are already chauffeured in the new flagship XJ saloon. The luxury car-maker - which employs some 21,000 workers in the Midlands and Merseyside - said it will build a £355million engine plant in Wolverhampton that will potentially create thousands of jobs. The company reported pre-tax profits of £1.1billion in the year to March 31 last year, up from £14.6million the previous year. Revenues increased 51per cent to £9.9billion. The results represented a turnaround on two years earlier when the company slumped to a loss as the car market collapsed amid the global economic meltdown. Tata bought the company from Ford for £1.5billion in June 2008. Tata’s super-rich boss Ratan Tata retires on his 75th birthday in December, to be succeeded by 43-year-old Cyrus Mistry. Jaguar Land Rover is also to build the next generation of its iconic back-to-basics Defender off-roader in India from 2015 – and may even export Indian-built Defender off-roaders back to the UK in kit form, to be assembled here by British workers. Land Rover already builds some of its Freelander model in India – exported in kit form for final assembly – in Pune.",News comes as firm is set to announce Jaguar and Land Rover production in booming China .

The Facebook effect: Prices in Palo Alto, near Mark Zuckerberg's swanky home, are steadily on the rise ahead of the company's IPO . This is something most Palo Alto homebuyers won’t ‘like.’ Ahead of Facebook’s estimated $79.3billion IPO – the biggest in Silicon Valley history – real estate prices are climbing, and are only expected to go higher after the company’s stock goes public. Prices for houses in the area are already some of the steepest in the country, and are only estimated to go higher after soon-to-be Facebook millionaires swarm the market. According to the New York Times, Palo Alto and the surrounding area is already a major hot spot of the housing market – despite poor sales in nearly every other part of the country. On top of that, inventory – that is to say, the houses that are available for purchase – are down by as much as 57 per cent. A full three years after becoming the world’s youngest billionaire, Zuckerberg himself took advantage of Palo Alto’s real estate market and bought a $7million, five-bedroom home with long-time girlfriend Priscilla Chan. The property is said to be a ten-minute drive to Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park. Before that, the social network creator was renting a more modest home, which his then-neighbours called ‘absolutely average.’ Home sweet home: Zuckerberg bought this $7million mansion in Palo Alto, California in 2011 - and it's only a ten-minute drive to the office . The social network: The company's headquarters are minutes away from Zuckerberg's new home; a Facebook employee found this sign while traveling in rural Florida and the company had to have it . Silicon Valley real estate agent Ken DeLeon told the Times that he recently sold an 8,000-square-foot house to a Facebook employee. They had upgraded from a modest 1,000-square-foot home. When Mr DeLeon saw the old property, he asked: ‘Did you win the lottery?’ And the practice, it seems, is not isolated to one or two employees of the social network. According to real estate company Coldwell Banker, in 2011, eight out of 20 of the nation’s most expensive real estate locations were nestled in Silicon Valley. Mr DeLeon said residents and prospective homebuyers in the area have several options ahead of the expected IPO. One, they can stay in their homes until the offering, and wait for their house’s value to climb. Similarly, he predicted an influx of house-flippers – people who snatch up ‘fixer-upper’ houses at lower prices, upgrade them, and sell them for top dollar. Up for grabs: This four-bedroom, four-bath home on Alexis Drive, listed on Realtor.com, is offered at $4.6million . Location, location, location: The home has views of the sweeping hills, as well as the city, and offers plenty of natural light . Splish spash: The home also has a three-car garage and a pool . Not all of this is good news. According to BrokerMetrics, the median-price of a home in Palo Alto went up 11 per cent last year, but inventory went down 57 per cent. Recent listings on Trulia.com show most homes – including a comfortable but modest-looking three bedroom, two-bathroom ranch home – listed in the millions of dollars. In the house’s description, the agent names the 1920’s cottage a ‘fixer in liveable condition with wonderful appeal.’ More luxe properties range anywhere from $1.5million up to more than $6million, for multi-bedroom estates. From the listings, the least expensive homes were around $270,000 – but had all been foreclosed, and are now owned by the bank. Listings on Realtor.com showed much the same. A four-bedroom, four-bath home is selling for $4.6million, while $6.3million can get a brand-new house with five bedrooms and six baths on Washington Avenue. Grand home: This home on Washingto Avenue is selling for $6,350,000 and has five bedrooms and six baths . New house smell: The house has 4,837 square feet and was built this year . Deluxe dining: The brand-new home offers a sunny dining room for meals with friends . National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement at the end of last month that 2012 has seen a moderate boom in housing. ‘The housing market has clearly turned the corner,’ Mr Yun said. ‘Rising sales are bringing down inventory and creating much more balanced conditions around the country, which means home prices will be rising in more areas as the year progresses.’ But, according to Fortune, there is another scenario at stake. If Facebook’s offering doesn’t earn as much as anticipated, the region’s housing market could spiral downwards – meaning that the housing burst that was experienced by most of the country would finally come to Silicon Valley. Fortune also notes that ‘the Facebook effect’ may be bringing about secret sales. Rather than have a large ‘For Sale’ sign hammered in wide lawns (which many homeowners in the area find tacky), they sell their home through word-of-mouth. This also means that pictures of their often lavish interiors and personal spaces aren’t splashed on web listings. The private market also keeps dozens and dozens of potential buyers – and wishful gawkers – out of the property.","Facebook's new millionaires expected to snatch up properties in Palo Alto area, 10 minutes away from Facebook HQ .

A caffeine-loving robber was being hunted today after holding up a newsagents armed with a cup of coffee. The masked bandit has been dubbed Britain's most carefree raider after casually strolling into the shop holding a mug of black coffee in his right hand then calmly asking the sales assistant to empty the stock of cigarettes into four bin bags. He also stole cash from the Oasis News store in Wythenshawe, Manchester, before walking out. Easy raider: This masked bandit was caught on CCTV holding up a newsagents in Manchester armed with just a cup of black coffee as he made off with four bin bags full of cigarettes and tobacco . Nonchalant: The caffeine-loving robber's accomplice doesn't even worry about covering his face as he enters the store. Police have released these images in the hope someone will come forward with information . He did disguise himself in a bandana and a hooded jacket, but he was with an equally casual accomplice who didn’t even cover his face despite security cameras capturing every moment of the 10.45am hold-up on New Year's Day. Greater Manchester Police today issued CCTV of the raid at the store and said both robbers were 'clearly nonchalant' in their attitude to the raid. A shop assistant at a neighbouring store said: 'We couldn’t believe it when we heard what this guy was carrying when he went into the shop. Normally you hear of robbers carrying guns, knives and coshes - but never one carrying a cup of coffee. 'Obviously, it must have been terrifying for the shop assistant to be told to hand over the money, but some people round here have been joking as to whether the robber asked for milk and two sugars too.' Laissez-faire: The raid was carried out at around 10.45am on New Year's Day at Oasis News in Manchester . Another local said: 'It’s just typical of the way robbers behave these days. They didn’t seem to have a care in the world and this robber must be the most carefree around. He must take being casual to a whole new dimension.' Police said the two robbers handed a bin bag to a cashier and demanded he fill it with cigarettes and tobacco. In total, four bin bags were filled with cigarettes and tobacco. The men also stole cash from the till. As part of the subsequent investigation, two men, both aged 25, have been charged with conspiracy to commit robbery and are awaiting trial. But the men in the CCTV images have yet to be traced. Now the CCTV images of the two men who carried out the robbery have been released and police are appealing for anyone who knows them to get in touch. Det Con Matthew Farrell, of West Didsbury CID, said: 'We have carried out a thorough investigation into this incident and while we have charged two people, we now need to trace the two men in the CCTV. 'These two offenders are clearly nonchalant in their attitude to this crime: one has made no attempt to conceal his face and the other is casually carrying round a hot drink. 'Someone will almost certainly know who they are and I would urge those people to contact me.'","Robber calmly asks assistant to fill four bin bags with cigarettes and tobacco .

A Scottish farmer will lose a crop of 15million daffodils which bloomed early - because he can't get enough people to pull them out of the ground in time. Mark Clark says severe winter weather which hit England in February delayed the flowers by a fortnight, while in Scotland they arrived a week early. As a result, crops arrived at the same time north and south of the border. Blooming nightmare: Mark Clark's daffodils arrived a week early while English crops were ready two weeks late. As they are ready at the same time, the market has been flooded with flowers . The market price will be so low that it won't be worth Grampian Growers in Montrose, Angus, pulling the flowers out of the ground. And despite there being 234,000 people unemployed in Scotland, Mr Clark has struggled to recruit pickers locally because they don't want to do the back-breaking work. There are currently 100 pickers working at the farm - but Mr Clark needs closer to 500 to bring the crop in. Despite placing adverts in local newspapers and in job centres he has not found enough workers. He is set to lose £300,000 because the daffodils cannot be picked in time. Frustration: A solitary daffodil picker, Zanna Svgatoduha, 24, works a Grampian Growers daffodil field. Mark Clark needs around 500 workers - he has only 100 . Warm weather in Scotland meant the crop was ready for picking one week earlier than expected. Mr Clark said: 'We’ve lost about 25 per cent of our volume because of the weather. That’s 1.5 million of our bunches, each containing 10 blooms, completely wiped out. 'Every single day that we don’t have enough pickers helping out, we are losing 150,000 to 200,000 bunches. 'It looks like it’s going to cost us just over £300,000, which is absolutely devastating. 'We were looking for a cold week last week, so that the growth of our daffodils will halt, but it just never happened. Pick your own: Mark Clark inspects his crop. If they aren't pulled out of the ground soon the market will already be flooded with flowers and the price will plunge . 'Instead we had really mild weather last week which has continued from November, December time. 'When you look back at the whole winter we’ve not even had one spell of particularly cold weather.' He added that the weather had conspired to bring the Scottish and English picking seasons together. With all the flowers coming at once, the market has been saturated and the price has tumbled. He added: 'Even when we finally get some pickers we’re going to lose money, the market value will be so low. 'Our main competitors for growing . daffodils are down in Lincolnshire and Cornwall. Down there they had . that very cold weather front from Serbia in early February. 'Lincolnshire even reached -15, -16 . degrees which put their crops on hold for two weeks. This has meant that . it’s brought our picking seasons together. 'Even if the market wasn’t flooded we . don’t have any pickers anyway, because they’re all still down in . Cornwall and Lincolnshire. 'We are probably ten days earlier than . what we normally would be. We started picking on March 2 when on . average we start on March 12.

The Georgia man who gunned down his lover's husband outside a preschool as he dropped off his son was today found guilty but declared mentally ill - meaning he will be treated in a mental hospital in prison. Hemy Neuman was charged with murder in the death of Russell Sneiderman. Prosecutors and defense attorneys said the shooting was linked to an affair Sneiderman's wife was having with Neuman, though she denied those allegations. He will be sentenced later on Thursday and faces up to life in prison. Neuman, a Georgia Tech graduate and father-of-three, was a high-ranking manager at General Electric, where he supervised Mr Sneiderman's wife Andrea.

He was arrested about six weeks after . the killing when prosecutors discovered he rented a silver minivan seen . speeding away from the shooting on the morning of November 18, 2010. The trial garnered attention because . the slaying was brazen, Neuman and Sneiderman had impressive . professional backgrounds and because of the questions surrounding Andrea .

The angel ordered him to fatally . shoot Sneiderman, Neuman said in one interview. Prosecutors called the shooting a calculated killing by a jealous man who wanted what he couldn't have. Neuman's attorneys argued he could not tell the difference between right and wrong when he killed Sneiderman. Secret conversation: Defendant Hemy Neuman, left, spoke with attorney Douglas N. Peters who fought his case on the grounds he was not guilty by reason of insanity . Widow: Andrea Sneiderman took the stand to testify during the trial but was barred to avoid a mistrial . He pleaded not guilty by reason of . insanity. If the jury had reached that verdict, Neuman would have become . a ward of the state mental health department and a judge would have . later decided when, if ever, he could be released. Experts on both sides of the case disagreed over whether Neuman was insane during the shooting. Russell Sneiderman, a . Harvard-educated entrepreneur, was killed shortly after he dropped off . the couple's two-year-old son at a daycare in Dunwoody, a wealthy suburb . north of Atlanta. Police said a bearded man in a hoodie . resembling Neuman fired four shots at the 36-year-old and sped away, . blending in with rush hour traffic. Neuman's lawyers said during the . month-long trial he fell so hopelessly in love with Andrea Sneiderman . that he believed he was the father of her two children and that the only . way to protect them was to kill her husband. Defense attorney Doug Peters called . her a tease and an adulterer who took advantage of Neuman's . deteriorating mental condition to get her husband's $2 million life . insurance policy. 'The gun in this case was in Hemy's . hand,' Peters said. 'But the trigger, I respectfully suggest, was pulled . by Andrea Sneiderman.' Prosecutors also had few kind words for the widow. Torn apart: Russell Sneiderman was murdered after dropping his children off at daycare. His wife, Andrea, right, was allegedly having an affair with his accused killer . Scene of the crime: Randy Sneiderman was shot outside of Dunwoody Daycare Centre outside of Atlanta . DeKalb County District Attorney . Robert James suggested in his closing arguments that she was Neuman's . co-conspirator and that the two were covering up for each other. But he said her possible influence on Neuman shouldn't take away from the crime that he committed. 'This was not because of some made . up, some contrived, some constructed mental defect. It's simple,' James . said. 'Hemy Neuman killed Rusty Sneiderman because he wanted his wife, . he wanted his money, he wanted his life. Period.' Ms Sneiderman repeatedly denied allegations she was having an affair with Neuman. She testified that Neuman weaseled . his way into her life and attacked her husband after she refused many . advances, and that she didn't air her suspicions that Neuman killed her . husband because it sounded unbelievable. Denial: Andrea Sneiderman says her husband's killer was merely a 'family friend' 'Seems kind of ridiculous, right?' she said. 'The theory that my boss could kill my husband, it seemed kind . of stupid at the time.' Days after she testified for . prosecutors, she was barred from the courtroom for being disruptive and . improperly engaging a witness despite being told not to do so. Andrea Sneiderman was hired in early . 2010, and she and Neuman hit it off, exchanging 1,500 phone calls and . text messages in the months leading up to the killing. On work trips, they would share long dinners and intimate moments, including sex, according to attorneys. Neuman didn't testify, but jurors . heard him through hours of video recordings of interviews with . investigators and mental health experts. In one interview, Neuman was asked if he thinks he's the biological father of Sneiderman's two children. 'I don't know. I don't know. I don't . know,' he said. 'I feel like these are my children. I feel like I need . to be there for them. I feel like I need to raise them and I need to . protect them. But I don't know.' Neuman's attorneys tried to portray . their client as a brilliant but troubled child who was constantly in . fear of his father, a Holocaust survivor wracked with guilt because he . was able to escape the death chambers at Auschwitz while many relatives . died. Born in Mexico, Neuman was sent to a . boarding school in Israel and still suffers from fear of being . abandoned, his attorneys said. He later landed the GE job that allowed him to buy a pricey home in an upscale Atlanta suburb. Neuman first tried to kill his rival . in November 10, 2010, when he camped outside the Sneiderman house with a . gun he recently purchased and waited to attack, prosecutors said. But he bolted after Russell Sneiderman noticed an intruder on his property and called police. Eight days later, prosecutors said, . Neuman arrived at his office much earlier than usual — at 5:36am — then . sneaked out a back door to avoid security cameras and to give himself an . alibi. Days later, Neuman went to Russell . Sneiderman's funeral and even visited Andrea Sneiderman's house for a . Jewish mourning ceremony, prosecutors said.","Hemy Neuman gunned down co-worker's husband Russell Sneiderman in 2010 .

Ordeal: Sahil Saeed, then five-years-old, was kidnapped and held for 13 days before being ransomed back to his family for £110,000 . A British businessman today told a court of the terrifying moment an armed gang kidnapped his five-year-old son in Pakistan. Sahil Saeed, from Oldham, was held captive for 13 days after being snatched while visiting his sick grandmother. His father Raja Saeed, 30, described the moment four men wearing balaclavas and carrying assault rifles and pistols fled with the youngster. And he described how the ordeal transformed his son from a 'bubbly' toddler into a 'scared and stressed' child. Mr Saeed said the gang bound and gagged him then beat him and his relatives after assaulting the family's home in Jhelum, Punjab in March 2010. He said: 'A person came up to me pointing a gun at me and made me lie down on the floor. 'He had a big gun, like an AK47. They tied everyone up and held us for several hours in a bedroom. They tortured one of my uncles a lot, and kicked and slapped us. 'They told me they were going to take my son and I had to pay £100,000 ransom. Then they left the house and took my son.' He was told: 'If you try to contact the police or involve them, we will kill him,' prosecutors allege. The gang fled with cash, jewellery, watches and even kitchen appliances as well as taking Sahil. He was released unhurt almost two weeks later after his uncle Tauseer Ahmed travelled from the UK to France and handed over a £110,000 ransom. Reunited: Sahil, found shoeless and with his head shaved, is pictured back home in Oldham with his mother Akila and father Raja, who today described the impact the ordeal had on his son . Three people were arrested in Spain after police raided a flat near Tarragona, where they recovered the ransom money. Mr Saeed told Tarragona Provincial Court his son has not been the same since the kidnapping. He said: 'My son is not the kind of bubbly kid he was any more. 'He used to be a laugh with me, playing, a happy kid but now he's always scared. A few months ago he started speaking about about the kidnap. 'He's scared all the time. At school he's not that clever any more. He's always stressed and under pressure. 'It has affected my son and the rest of the family.' Accused: Pakistani brothers Muhammed Sageiz (centre) and Muhammed Saleem (right) along with Romanian Monica Neruja, hide their faces in court in Tarragona, Spain, during the opening of the kidnapping trial today . Mr Saeed revealed Sahil has been seeing a school psychiatrist to help get over the traumatic memories of his ordeal. He told the court his son learned to swear in Punjabi while being held, and was taken out riding on a buffalo by his captors. Sahil's uncle Tauseer Ahmed told the court the boy's mother Akila 'went through hell' when her son was being held. Mr Ahmed told how he he followed the kidnappers' instructions to travel from the UK to Paris where he left the ransom money by a park bench. Kidnapped: Sahil was snatched from his grandmother's home here in Jhelum, Pakistan, in March 2010 . Undercover cops monitored the exchange and then followed Monica Neruja, 26, from Galati, Romania, and her husband Muhammed Zahid Saleem, 36, from Pakistan, as they drove from Paris with the money to their home in the town of Constanti, 60 miles south west of Barcelona. When the boy was freed armed police raided the flat and arrested the couple and flatmate Muhammad Sageiz, who was living illegally in Spain. They recovered most of the ransom money in a bag in the flat. The three of them are accused of planning and organising the kidnap. They deny kidnap, robbery, belonging to a criminal organisation and illegal detention. Prosecutors have called for them to be jailed for up to 25 years. The trial continues.","Sahil Saeed was held captive for 13 days after visiting his grandmother .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:22 EST, 7 March 2012 . A battle is underway for the insurance payouts for killer dad Josh Powell and his two young sons - and now the insurer has asked the courts who, if anyone, should get the money. It comes after the killer's sister and brother filed claims on insurance policies worth $1.5 million just nine days after he blew up his Washington home, killing himself and Braden, seven, and Charlie, five. The New York Life Insurance Company also wants the U.S. District Court to decide who should get the $1 million policy for Susan Powell, Josh's wife who went missing from Utah in December 2009. To add yet another complication, the company wants to know whether changes Powell made to his policy in 2011 should stand, questioning his competency at the time, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Murder suicide: Josh Powell killed himself and his sons, Charlie and Braden, by blowing up their home. There are now questions over who - if anyone - should get the money from their insurance claims . The changes, made three months before the killings, named his siblings and father as beneficiaries rather than his father-in-law, with whom he had been embroiled in a custody battle for his sons. According to the Tribune, documents filed in the Washington court write: 'New York Life has concerns regarding Joshua Powell’s competency at the time the beneficiary changes were made.' It adds that 'doubtful questions' remain over payments being made to a 'slayer’s siblings and/or father'. Chuck and Judy Cox, the parents of Susan plan to support the insurers request for a review, their attorney told the Tribune. 'Clearly, under any law, he didn’t have the right to change the beneficiaries,' Steve Downing said. The $1 million policy in Susan's name came as a shock to West Valley Police, who said they were not aware of any insurance policy. Chuck Cox reportedly said the question should have been asked. Claimant: Powell's sister Alina, pictured, and brother Michael both contacted . the insurance company nine days after the deaths to inquire about making . a claim for the $1.5 million policy . Tragedy: Powell blew up his Washington home, pictured, killing himself . and the two young boys, aged five and seven, when they were dropped off for a supervised visit in February . A spokesman for the police would not discuss if investigators evaluated the insurance payouts as a motive for Susan’s disappearance. The Tribune reported that Josh and Susan Powell took out insurance polices in 2007, two years before she went missing. Missing: West Valley Police in Utah said they had not been aware of an insurance policy worth $1 million for missing mother Susan Powell . She disappeared on 6 . December 2009. Her husband had claimed she ran away after he took their boys on an impromptu camping trip in freezing conditions. Her . body has never been found. Powell had a five-year term life insurance policy worth $1 million and riders worth $250,000 on each of their sons. Susan had a $500,000 five-year term policy and a $500,000 rider, according to court papers seen by the Tribune. She was initially named as the only beneficiary of Josh's policy. In February 2009, Powell added family trust in their names as the secondary beneficiary of his policy. Powell’s brother Michael and Susan’s father were listed as joint trustees of the estate. Powell changed his policy again in October last year, taking off Susan and the family trust as beneficiaries. This came just three days after a judge put his sons in the custody of the Coxes. Instead, he named his brother Michael and sister Alina as the primary beneficiaries and his brother John as the secondary beneficiary, according to the Tribune. Michael was later named as entitled to a 93 per cent share, with Alina entitled to four and John to three. He also placed Michael and Alina's names on his son's policies, keeping himself as the primary beneficiary. Michael and Alina both contacted New . York Life Insurance on February 14 to ask for forms to make claims on . their brother’s and nephews’ policies, according to the Tribune. Fight: Chuck and Judy Cox, in-laws of Josh Powell, support a court's review of who should get the money . Plea: The New York Life Insurance Co. has appealed to the U.S. District Court to help with the decision . These are not the first complications for the years-long case, which has scores of unanswered questions. The couple's sons, aged seven and . five, had recently started talking about their mother and what happened the . night of their trip, saying that when they went camping 'mommy was . in the trunk and then mom and dad got out of the car and mom . disappeared'. The boys had been taken from their . father's care and given to Susan's parents after . authorities found child pornography and voyeuristic videos on Josh's . father Steve Powell's computer. It also recently emerged that Josh had . hundreds of images of disturbing cartoon sex and graphic depictions of . incest on his home computer, which Utah authorities knew about for two . years. He killed his sons in an explosion of February 5, after they had been dropped off by a social worker for a visit. Prosecutors consider the murder suicide to be an admission of guilt in his wife's death. The two boys were laid to rest in a single casket in front of family and friends on February 13.

But vineyards across the north of England are toasting extraordinary success - as climate change makes the region ideal for wine-making. Just over 25 years ago, Renishaw Hall, near Sheffield, was the most northern vineyard in the world. Toasting success: Kieron Atkinson, who runs the English Wine Project, at Renishaw Hall which is planning to double output to 6,000 bottles per year . Yet as they celebrate their 40th anniversary this year they are planning to double the number of white wines they produce from 3,000 to up to 6,000 per year. Vineyards across the north of England have seen demand soar as the quality of their grapes improves - and they are giving their more illustrious French rivals a run for their money in the sparkling wine stakes. As temperatures increase because of climate change, grapes become more acidic. But unlike in Champagne, northern France, it is not too hot in northern England. Improved trellis systems and management techniques have also helped British manufacturers close the gap on their continental rivals. Chateau Doncaster: The town in northern England has become the unlikely home of sparkling white wines rivaling those from Champagne . Even in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, vineyards have been able to produce wine with 12 per cent natural alcohol. The Summerhouse vineyard on the outskirts of the northern town started production in 2005 and has rapidly seen its output increase. But despite their growing success, their are still only a small number of northern vineyards spread across Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire. Across England, winemakers have seen demand soar in recent years - although until now it has largely been manufacturers in the south getting all the accolades. Last year, two English rosés, produced just a few miles from the M25 in Surrey and Kent, scooped top international awards at the wine world's 'Oscars', proving the nation does not need Mediterranean heat to turn out a top tipple. Toasting success: The head gardener works on the vines at Renishaw Hall, Derbyshire . Kent-based Chapel Down, the winemaker which provided white wine for Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton, picked up a gold medal for its sparkling Vintage Rosé Brut at the International Wine Challenge, the world's biggest and most important wine competition. And just a few miles down the road, Denbies Chalk Ridge Rose 2010, produced on the hillsides of Dorking, Surrey, beat off stiff competition from more than 360 producers from 21 countries across the globe to win the still rosé gold medal prize. Kieron Atkinson, who runs the English Wine Project, told The Times that northern winemakers are giving Champagne a run for their money. 'We are cooler than Champagne, which means we have nicer levels of acid in our grapes. That makes for a better sparkling wine,' he said. 'We are still relatively young at doing this in comparison with the Champagne region but our techniques are catching up, hence our ability to get better and better wine every year.' He added: 'I guess the alarm bells for the Champagne region are ringing because the summers are so much hotter.' Running scared?

The mother of a mentally ill homeless man who died after a violent confrontation with Southern California police has accepted a $1million settlement with the city of Fullerton, California. In exchange, Cathy Thomas agreed to not pursue any further claims or lawsuits seeking damages for the death of her 37-year-old son Kelly. The vote was passed unanimously by Fullerton’s city council members. Scroll down for video: Warning - graphic content . Seeking closure: Cathy Thomas, pictured last year, has settled with the city of Fullerton for $1million in the death of her son Kelly . Troubled: The officers say Thomas kept fighting them, despite their attempts to subdue him and calm him down . A father's grief: The victim's father, Ron Thomas (right), was not involved in the settlement . ‘Resolution of Ms Thomas’ claim at this time allows her to begin the healing process and avoid what would like be protracted, expensive, and difficult civil litigation,’ Ms Thomas’ attorney Brian Gurwitz and the City of Fullerton said in a joint statement. In exchange for the settlement, Ms Thomas agreed to not pursue any further claims or lawsuits seeking damages for the death of her son, according to the Orange County Register. The deal does not involve her ex-husband, Ron Thomas, NBC Los Angeles reported. A judge earlier this month ordered two officers to stand trial on criminal charges in the case. Their next court appearance is scheduled for May 22. The incident last July also prompted an effort to remove three Fullerton council members. They face a recall on next month's ballot. Officer Manuel Ramos is charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. Cpl. Jay Cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and assault or battery by a public officer. Both have pleaded not guilty. The officers confronted Mr Thomas while responding to reports that a homeless man was looking into parked cars at a transit center. 'This is another victory, on another battle,' said Mr Thomas' father, Ron. 'We're going to start a new one with the trial.' John Barnett, Ramos' attorney, said he would seek another court's review of Mr Schwarm's ruling and did not expect his client would end up facing a jury trial. 'We're disappointed that they were held to answer but we will seek review in an appropriate manner,' he told reporters after the ruling. 'He believes, and he is innocent. Charged: Officer Manuel Ramos (left) is charged with murder for the fatal beating. Cpl Jay Cicinelli (right) faces lesser charges, but is still implicated in the death . Killed: Kelly Thomas, 37, who suffered from schizophrenia, was horrifically beaten to death by police after reports of a homeless man looking into parked cars led to his probe . Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said during the hearing that Ramos' actions - snapping on latex gloves, making a fist and threatening to take on Thomas - would have led anyone to fear they were about to get beaten by police. 'Any person, any creature on this earth would have fear at that point,' Mr Rackauckas told the court. 'You're going to fight or flee because this is an imminent threat of a serious beating by a police officer who is there with a baton and a gun and other police officers.... This is going to be a very bad deal,' the prosecutor said. Defense attorneys countered that police - who are authorized and trained to use force when necessary - viewed the incident as an encounter with a man who refused to give his name and continued to resist arrest even as multiple officers rushed to assist. Mr Thomas suffered from schizophrenia. Testifying for the defense, a witness said both of the accused officers, Ramos and Cinelli, were in shocked disbelief at the man who refused to stop fighting them. Ramos was holding his rib cage and out of breath after the incident in July, police forensic specialist Dawn Scruggs said. Ramos told her he had never had anyone fight him like that before, she said. 'He looked like he was in disbelief of what just happened,' Scruggs said during a preliminary hearing being held to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to have the officers stand trial. Moving forward: Judge Walter Schwarm explains why he believes two Fullerton police officers should remain charged with the death of a mentally ill homeless man last summer . Weapon: Attorney Tony Rackauckas holds up a taser similar to the one allegedly used as a blunt-force weapon against Mr Thomas during Wednesday's trial . Mr Barnett, Ramos' attorney, said during the hearing that the video - which was introduced by the prosecution - shows that his client made a conditional threat during his conversation with Mr Thomas, stating he wanted the man to start listening and following police orders, such as sitting with his legs stretched out and providing his name to officers. 'All that Kelly Thomas had to do was simply comply,' Mr Barnett said. 'Officer Ramos just lifts him up, he's going to arrest him. ... Not only can he do it, he must do it. He is bound to do it.' 'Officer Ramos didn't do anything that should or could kill Kelly Thomas,' Mr Barnett said, pointing out that his client is often seen on the video at the man's feet. Prosecutors have argued that Ramos punched Mr Thomas in the ribs, tackled him and lay on him to hold him down while Cicinelli - who arrived later on the scene - used a Taser four times on Mr Thomas as he hollered in pain and hit him in the face eight times with the Taser. After Mr Thomas lost consciousness and was taken to a hospital,  he was taken off life support and died five days later. The coroner's office found that Mr Thomas died from compression of his chest that made it difficult for him to breathe and deprived his brain of oxygen, and facial injuries stemming from his confrontation with law enforcement. In court, Mr Schwartz, Cicinelli's attorney, challenged those findings, noting that testimony by a paramedic who treated Mr Thomas at the scene indicates that he was breathing, although with difficulty, during the confrontation. Shocking: Footage from a bus station shows officers beating Kelly Thomas as he begged for his father . Subduing: Thomas screamed out in pain as he was being tasered . Mr Schwartz also defended his client's use of the Taser on Mr Thomas, who was still struggling and resisting officers' efforts to handcuff him, and said Cicinelli only swung the Taser at Mr Thomas' hand when the man made an effort to grab the weapon. 'To call that a crime is to effectively handcuff our police officers out in the field from dealing with any combative suspect,' Mr Schwartz said. The hearing in a Santa Ana courtroom was marked by lengthy testimony from medical experts and graphic photos of Mr Thomas' injuries, including multiple bruises and a bloodied eye, while he was lying on the autopsy table. Attorneys repeatedly played portions of the grainy surveillance video, which was paired with audio from digital recorders worn by some of the officers who were present and which brought some of Mr Thomas' supporters to tears and prompted them to leave the courtroom. The incident last July prompted an ongoing FBI investigation to determine if Mr Thomas' civil rights were violated, an internal probe by the city, protests by residents and an effort to recall three Fullerton councilmembers that is slated for next month's ballot. The recall was sparked after angry residents chastised the council members for failing to take significant action regarding the incident. That was not the only shocking moment shown to the court Monday. The bloody, battered photo of the dead homeless man drew gasps at the court hearing. Six Fullerton police officers responded to the incident. All were placed on paid administrative leave and are facing an internal investigation but only Ramos and Cicinelli were criminally charged.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 06:35 EST, 23 June 2011 . A mentally handicapped murderer who fatally shot two people . and paralysed a third in a Houston crack house in 1998, was executed last night by lethal injection - after eating a mammoth final meal. Milton Mathis, 32, scoffed two burgers with bacon, fried pork chops, fried chicken, fried fish, chili cheese fries, regular fries, and fruit punch, officials said. Lawyers for Mathis, who was the 23rd person put to death in the U.S. this year and the sixth executed in Texas, had spent yesterday morning pleading . his case before the Supreme Court. He . previously lobbied unsuccessfully to state and federal courts. Sad ending: Milton Mathis, 32, was executed in Texas on Tuesday, despite being mentally disabled . Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry, however, vetoed state legislation in 2001 that would have outlawed executing inmates with mental disabilities. Perry's decision gave Texas juries the power of deciding who to execute. A year later, the Supreme Court issued its ruling in Atkins verse Virginia, but left it to the states to determine how to decide whether a person had mental disabilities. A Burger with bacon . Fried chicken . Pork chops . Fried fish . French Fries . Chili cheese fries . It's been documented Mathis had an eighth-grade education when he was convicted, and scored in the low 60s on several IQ tests, once getting a 62. Former Texas Governor, Mark White, came to Mathis's aid several years ago, voicing his opinion the convicts life should be spared. Execution: The chamber at Huntsville in Texas where death row inmates are fitted with restraints and given a lethal injection . White argued his low IQ scores should alter the decision. Psychology experts have routinely put the standard for mental disabilities around a 70 IQ and lower. 'Mathis has suffered from obvious mental disabilities since childhood,' White has stated. 'He has had problems with functions that come easily to most of us, like dressing himself.' Mathis was convicted in September 1999 after opening fire in a crack house located in Fort Bend County. Travis Brown III, 24, and Daniel . Hibbard, 31, were instantly killed. A third victim, Melanie Almaguer, then 15, was also shot in the head and is paralysed from the neck down. According to the state attorney general's office, Mathis also turned the gun on Almaguer's mother, but ran out of bullets. He looted the home before setting it on fire, fled in Brown's car, and later told a fellow inmate that he wished he had 'killed them all.'",Milton Mathis had IQ of just 62 and had problems dressing himself .

In his younger days, pensioner Michael Mather was used to sparring in the ring with boxing legend Henry Cooper. But more recently he has dusted off his fighting skills to put up a fight against two brutal thugs who attacked him outside his home in Ilford, Essex. The 77-year-old was hit on the head with a wooden club as they tried to force their way into his house while he loaded his car. They picked on the wrong pensioner! Boxer, 77, who trained with Henry Cooper, beats up two club-wielding thugs after home attack . Proving he can still throw a good punch, Mr Mather hit one of them in the face and the pair, in their late teens, fled the scene. Mr Mather spent his youth training with post-war heavyweight boxing icon Henry Cooper and East End gangsters, the Kray twins. Mr Mather said that in his youth he trained with boxing legend Henry Cooper . Mr Mather said: 'One of the boys walloped me on the head with a two foot log and it started bleeding. I was so angry I swore at them and told them I was going to kill them. 'They then tried to push past me to get into the house. 'I went to hit one of the boys in the solar plexus with my left and then with my right hand hit him on the nose and it just burst which I do feel a bit guilty about.' Mr Mather was on his way to referee a local football tournament when he was confronted by his attackers. 'I was putting my ref's gear into the car and I didn't really notice the boys,' he said. 'I heard a voice saying ""can I use your toilet mister?"" but I told them it was out of order,' he said. They thugs insisted that Mr Mather let them into his house and attacked him from behind after he turned his back. 'After I hit him the boys ran off,' he added. 'I assume it was the sight of me with blood over my face which was so thick I couldn't see through my glasses.' He was then taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford. He said: 'When the nurse at the hospital was stitching my head back together all I could think about was getting to the football match as I didn't want to let the boys down. 'I want to warn people so that this sort of thing doesn't happen to anyone else.' He also said he spent time sparring with East End gangsters, the Kray twins, pictured above .","Michael Mather dusted off his fighting skills to send to thugs packing .

Mitt Romney is today hoping to seal his status as the Republican presidential front-runner with a thus-far elusive victory in the conservative Deep South. The pivotal primaries in Alabama and Mississippi come as a new poll appears to prove just how non-progressive some GOP voters in the region are. An astonishing 29 per cent of Republican voters in Mississippi believe that interracial marriage should be illegal. Front-runner: Mitt Romney addresses supporters outside the Whistle Stop Cafe in Mobile, Alabama, yesterday. A poll has revealed that 21 per cent of GOP voters in the state oppose interracial marriage, rising to 29 per cent in Mississippi . This number falls to a still significant 21 per cent among self-declared GOP supporters in Alabama, according to the survey by Public Police Polling. In Mississippi, 54 per cent said they were in favour of mixed-race marriage, a figure that increased to 67 per cent in Alabama. Interracial marriage has been legal across the U.S. since June 1967, when a Supreme Court ruling banned anti-miscegenation laws then enforced in 16 states. Today's closely-forced primaries in Alabama and Mississippi offer Mr Romney a key opportunity in a region that has been slow to embrace him. The primaries are also poised to render a possible final verdict on Newt Gingrich's Southern-focused candidacy. With polls showing an unexpectedly tight race in the conservative heartland states, Mr Romney made a campaign appearance yesterday in Alabama - a clear indication he is eyeing a potential win there. The former Massachusetts governor campaigned with Southern comedian Jeff Foxworthy and poked fun at his own lack of hunting skills, saying he hoped to set out with an Alabama friend who 'can actually show me which end of the rifle to point'. Meeting the public: The former Massachusetts governor greets supporters inside the cafe . Still fighting: Fellow candidate Newt Gingrich addresses the Alabama Republicans forum at the Alabama Theater in Birmingham last night . Battling to become Mr Romney's main conservative challenger, Mr Gingrich and Rick Santorum both spoke at an energy forum in Mississippi and took questions on religion in public life at a presidential forum in Birmingham, Alabama. They took sharp aim at President Barack Obama, with Mr Santorum labeling the president's foreign policy 'pathetic' and Mr Gingrich taunting Obama as 'President Algae' for an energy speech in which Mr Obama spoke of research that would allow oil and gas to be developed from algae one day. Mr Gingrich has focused his campaign in recent weeks on rising gas prices, promising to bring the price to $2.50 per gallon if elected. The Southern showdown comes as new polling showed a steep drop in Mr Obama's approval ratings amid escalating prices at the pump and renewed turbulence in the Middle-East. A Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 46 per cent of those surveyed approve the way the president is handling his job, and 50 per cent disapprove. A New York Times/CBS poll found 41 per cent approval, and 47 per cent disapproval. Taking the stage: Rick Santorum speaks during the Gulf Coast Energy Summit at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi yesterday . A win in either Mississippi or Alabama would be an important breakthrough for Mr Romney, easing concerns that the Harvard-educated north-easterner cannot win the party's most conservative and evangelical voters. Mr Santorum, who has angled to campaign head-to-head with Mr Romney, pressed the case again that Mr Gingrich should consider stepping aside. Speaking in Biloxi, he said: 'People of Mississippi and Alabama want a conservative. If they want a conservative nominee for sure, they can do that by lining up behind us and making this race clearly a two-person race outside of the South.' Mr Santorum planned to watch returns from Louisiana, which holds its primary on March 24. While Mr Gingrich insists he plans to remain in the race until the Republican National Convention in August, his campaign's survival essentially rests on winning both of today's primaries. The former House speaker has pursued an all-Southern strategy, but he has won only South Carolina and Georgia, the latter the state he represented in Congress for 20 years. A fourth candidate, Ron Paul, is not competing actively in the two contests. Hawaii is also holding a primary today, but none of the GOP hopefuls campaigned there. Mr Romney has more delegates than his rivals combined, and is amassing them at a rate that puts him on track to clinch control of nomination before the convention opens next summer. He has 454 of the 1,144 delegates needed to win the nomination. Mr Santorum has 217; Mr Gingrich 107 and Paul 47.",Mitt Romney is hoping to seal status as GOP front-runner in region that has been slow to embrace him .
"By . Luke Salkeld . UPDATED: . 02:02 EST, 9 August 2011 . With solid wooden frame, veranda and steps, the construction of this Wendy house clearly involved careful planning. But according to the local authority, it should have only have been built with planning permission. Now the owners fear they may be ordered to take it down. Unnoticed: Sally and Brook Johnson said this Wendy House had been in their garden for 18 months, but the council say they now require retrospective planning permission . Sally and Brook Johnson say they were ‘flabbergasted’ when they were told the structure would require a retrospective planning application. They say the Wendy house has been standing in the grounds of their £1million country house unnoticed since they moved into their home 18 months ago. And they say it would have remained that way if they had not asked for a planning officer to assess a proposed extension to their house. They say the officer proceeded to wander around the grounds of their home - without permission - before spotting the offending structure. Mrs Johnson described the Wendy house, which is used by an unnamed six-year-old child, as being ‘within a garden wall under a tree which cannot be seen from anywhere’ at their home in Baydon, near Marlborough, Wiltshire. She is furious that she has been ‘forced’ to put in a retrospective application, which if refused will mean the Wendy House will almost certainly have to be pulled down. Mrs Johnson claimed having to get planning consent for a Wendy House for a six-year-old child ‘is unnecessary and is far beyond what the planning process is for’. And she said the cost of the planning application ‘far exceeds the cost of the Wendy house’. ‘What has happened here is extraordinarily unusual,’ she said. ‘We were completely flabbergasted. It is beyond my comprehension - I do not understand why we need planning permission. ‘[The . planning officer] was here to look at a planning application we had put . in for an extension. He chose to walk around the property and look . wherever he wanted to look without permission. He looked everywhere.’ Plans: The Wendy house only came to light when the couple asked for a planning officer to assess a proposed extension to their house, pictured here . She continued: ‘For whatever reason he then went back and reported there was a child’s Wendy house that needed planning permission. We then received a notice we had to apply for retrospective planning and go through a process . ‘I do not think it is necessary to have planning permission for a child of six to have a very old Wendy house which is not on concrete, not attached to the ground but just sits there within a walled garden under a tree which cannot be seen from anywhere and is not big enough for adults.’ A spokesman for Wiltshire Council yesterday said: ‘A planning officer went to the property to discuss a current planning application. ‘As part of his site inspection he discovered several other structures which required planning permission. He requested the owners put in retrospective planning applications. ‘Because this structure is above the permitted size for an area of outstanding natural beauty, it needs planning permission.’ The spokesman added that ‘the husband gave permission for him to carry out his inspection’. Earlier this year council officials ordered another couple to apply for planning permission for another little girl’s slightly smaller Wendy house. The 6ft by 8ft house was a birthday present for three-year-old Abigail Gent, from Shropshire. None of the neighbours raised any objection to the 7ft tall structure, but because of officials' 'crazy' red tape it still needed planning permission. Wrexham County Borough Council said permission was required to ensure no 'additional development' was carried out. A spokesman for the council said: 'The reason planning permission was required was due to previous planning conditions, when approval was granted for a barn conversion and a change of use of land for grazing of recreational horses.’ She added: 'Permission for this structure was granted on March 8, 2011.'","Couple say they are 'flabbergasted' by the decision .
