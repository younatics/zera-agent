"London (CNN) -- Many visitors to London will be used to flying over the Thames before they land. Within less than 10 years, they could be touching down at an island airport in the middle of the river itself. A futuristic-looking, six-runway airport on an artificial island has been proposed at a location off the Isle of Sheppey, around 80 kilometers from the center of the city. The plan from a consortium formed by the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has been projected to cost Â£47 billion ($76 billion) and to take seven years. With Heathrow running at 99% capacity, the capital needs more runways, the consortium, Testrad, says. The mid-river location is intended to avoid adding to the aviation noise pollution already bedeviling London -- the source of long-running campaigns from residents beneath that approach into Heathrow that passengers so enjoy. New beginnings at the world's busiest airport . Trees growing in terminal . A visualization of the proposed London Britannia Airport shows an oval-shaped stucture bisected by runways, sitting in the Thames where the river widens to form an estuary. Interlinked, translucent hemispherical pods cover the concourse and other passenger areas -- the light they admit allowing trees and other vegetation to grow within. Heathrow Airport, currently the busiest in Europe by passenger traffic and the third busiest in the world, would close if Britannia Airport went ahead, Gensler, its designers, said. Passenger numbers to all London's airports are expected to more than double by 2031, to 300 million from 127 million a year in 2010, according to the Greater London Authority.

"New York (CNN) -- U.S. allegations that the North Korean government aids in or allows the illegal drug trade has long been an irritant in the tense relationship between the two countries. Now, a Drug Enforcement Administration investigation that the U.S. says busted an international drug ring specializing in North Korean methamphetamine could bolster the U.S. claims. Federal prosecutors announced charges Wednesday against five men who the DEA alleges ran a drug ring that distributed North Korean meth around in Southeast Asia. The men, none of whom are American, were expelled from Thailand on Tuesday and brought to New York to face charges. They're part of a broader case that prosecutors unveiled in September, when the Manhattan U.S. attorney charged a group of ex-military men with planning killings in connection with drug trafficking. The United States alleges those men, purportedly led by former U.S. Army sniper trainer Joseph ""Rambo"" Hunter, planned to assassinate a DEA agent and an informer in a sting operation. The five men facing new charges unsealed Wednesday are British citizens Scott Stammers and Philip Shackels; Chinese citizen Ye Tiong Tan Lim; Kelly Allan Reyes Peralta of the Philippines; and Alexander Lnu, believed to be a Slovak resident of Thailand. They're charged with conspiring to import 100 kilograms of North Korean-produced methamphetamine into the United States. The five appeared Wednesday before Magistrate Judge Kevin Nathaniel Fox in federal court in Manhattan. Shackels and Lnu sported tattoos on their arms. Lim, through an interpreter, asked for and received court permission for medication due to a kidney and high-cholesterol condition. The men, represented by public defenders, all entered not-guilty pleas and agreed to be held without bail until their next court date on December 5. U.S. prosecutors said methamphetamine seized in Thailand and the Philippines in 2012 and traced to the group tested at more than 99% pure. ""This investigation continued to highlight the emergence of North Korea as a significant source of methamphetamine in the global drug trade,"" said DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of Manhattan said the case showed ""our determination to close a potential floodgate of supply."" According to U.S. prosecutors, Lim and Reyes Peralta were members of a Hong Kong criminal group that sold over 30 kilograms of North Korean meth, which was the product later seized in Thailand and the Philippines in 2012. Stammers and Shackels allegedly were responsible for storing the meth sold by Lim and Reyes Peralta, authorities said. DEA agents set up sting earlier this year that ensnared the men, according to federal authorities. Agents recorded video and audio of Lim and Reyes Peralta meeting with an undercover DEA informant beginning in January and allegedly agreeing to sell 100 kilograms of North Korean meth for sale in the U.S., authorities said. According to recordings cited by prosecutors, Lim told the informant that his organization was the only one currently able to obtain methamphetamine from North Korea. ""Because before, there were eight (other organizations). But now only us, we have the NK product. . . . (It's) only us who can get from NK."" According to federal court documents, Lim explained that because of U.S. pressure, the North Korean government had destroyed meth labs in its country. But it left the meth-production bases that his organization had access to, Lim said, according to U.S. prosecutors. ""The NK government already burned all the labs. Only our labs are not closed. . . . To show Americans that they (the North Korean government) are not selling it any more, they burned it. Then they transfer to another base,"" prosecutors quote Lim as saying on the recordings. Lim claimed that his group had stockpiled one ton of North Korean meth in the Philippines ""(b)ecause we already anticipated this thing would happen . . . (with the result being) we cannot bring out our goods right now."" According to prosecutors, Shackels was an intermediary for a test run with samples of the North Korean meth. The samples tested at 98% and 96% pure, prosecutors allege. Stammers, Shackels and Alexander agreed to provide security for another test run, using a shipment of tea leaves, to check delivery channels to Thailand. From there the drugs would be repackaged and shipped to the United States, according to prosecutors. According to court documents, Alexander, who was a leader of an Outlaw Motorcycle Club chapter in Thailand, would lead an armed crew of Outlaw members to provide security for shipments. In September, Lim and Reyes Peralta traveled to Thailand to meet with the DEA undercover informant to finalize their deal to sell 100 kilos of the North Korean meth. All five men were arrested on September 25 by Thai authorities, who called it one of their biggest international crime cases. 5 men extradited to U.S. in North Korean meth case .","NEW: All five defendants plead not guilty in first court appearance in New York .

"(CNN) -- By the time the clock ran out on Beyonce's Super Bowl halftime performance on Sunday, the singer had put to rest doubts that she would give it her all. The 31-year-old had been at the center of controversy leading up to her anticipated game day show thanks to her decision to use a recorded track when she performed at President Barack Obama's inauguration in January. That left some questioning whether she'd do the same in New Orleans on Sunday, but Beyonce clarified that she would ""absolutely"" sing live during the game, something that seemed evident as she soared through a decade-plus of hits. Lights out! Play halts at Superdome . As the drumbeat to her single ""Countdown"" played in the background, an actual fan-made countdown sponsored by Pepsi ticked off the final seconds to her halftime set. Perhaps in a nod to her noted perfectionism, viewers heard that ""Excellence must be pursued, it must be wooed, with all of one's might and every bit of effort that we have"" as Beyonce emerged atop a platform to take the stage. She began her show solo, kicking things off with an a cappella version of her single ""Love on Top."" Clad in above-the-knee black stiletto boots and a leather minidress, the 31-year-old strutted to the tune of ""Crazy in Love,"" stripping down to little more than a leotard as she performed the familiar dance moves. Unfortunately for Jay-Z fans, the singer's husband didn't accompany her to perform his rap verse on the song. The best (and the worst) halftime shows in Super Bowl history . But, as expected, Beyonce did host a Destiny's Child reunion on the Super Bowl stage. After performing the high-energy songs ""End of Time"" and ""Baby Boy,"" the latter of which got special effects treatment, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams popped onto the stage to join their former groupmate. Following a few vocal runs of ""Bootylicious,"" the trio segued into ""Independent Women, Pt. 1,"" the popular single that was also highlighted on the soundtrack of 2000's ""Charlie's Angels"" movie. The reunited Destiny's Child paid homage by pausing to replicate the iconic silhouetted pose before swinging into ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)."" Beyonce released that song as a solo artist, but Rowland and Williams joined in on Sunday's show. Beyonce took back the reins from there, closing out with a performance of ""Halo."" ""Everybody, I want to feel your energy,"" Beyonce said as she asked fans to keep waving their hands in the air, many of whom were equipped with blue lights. It was a swiftly paced 12-minute show. Beyonce told press ahead of the show that she recognized how big of an opportunity she had with the Super Bowl halftime gig but that she felt ready. ""I'm trying to learn to live every moment, because these moments are not promised to us,"" she said. ""I've had a 16-year career, and all of the things that I've done have prepared me for this. ...

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An explosion took place on a road close to Kabul's international airport Wednesday morning, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said. There were no ISAF casualties. Initial information indicated that the blast may have been the work of a suicide bomber, ISAF said. The Afghan interior ministry said the blast took place on Qasabah Road, which is situated to the north of Kabul International Airport. Militants have targeted the airport previously. In June, Taliban fighters armed with guns and explosives were killed by security forces after taking over a building near the airport. The Taliban said the attack was intended to target Americans in the international airport, one part of which is used by military forces and another by civilians.","The explosion may have been caused by a suicide bomber, ISAF says .

"Washington (CNN) -- When the troubled federal health care website came online, the key ""Anonymous Shopper"" function was nowhere to be found -- even though it passed a key test almost two weeks before HealthCare.gov launched. That successful test, noted in documents obtained by CNN and confirmed by a source close to the project, contradicts testimony from an Obama administration official overseeing HealthCare.gov, who told lawmakers earlier this month the function was scrapped because it ""failed miserably"" before the October 1 launch. Like much of the HealthCare.gov rollout, the subject has become political fodder for Republicans, who claim the decision to nix the anonymous shopper was made by administration officials worried it would produce rate estimates so high they would deter potential enrollees. What is 'Anonymous Shopper?' The window shopping feature allows website visitors to compare health insurance plans without opening an account, verifying their identity or determining whether they qualify for a federal subsidy. The tool was turned off before HealthCare.gov launched and is still unavailable to users. Using anonymous shopping, visitors would have been able to enter their age, ZIP code, county, number of people in their household and whether they use tobacco, to obtain an array of almost instant quotes and detailed comparisons for various health insurance plans available to them. It's the website feature that best resembles President Barack Obama's frequently stated vision for the website -- that it operates as the most popular e-retail sites millions of Americans use every day. ""Just visit HealthCare.gov, and there you can compare insurance plans, side by side, the same way you'd shop for a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon,"" Obama said on October 1, the day the website went live. ""You enter some basic information, you'll be presented with a list of quality, affordable plans that are available in your area, with clear descriptions of what each plan covers, and what it will cost."" Yet on that day, and even now, that's not really possible. The absence of the online shopping tool is ""a major design failure,"" said Sam Karp, vice president of programs at the California HealthCare Foundation, an Oakland-based nonprofit that supports and promotes the president's signature health care program in the Golden State. Blocked out at HealthCare.gov? Bypass on way soon, feds say . Online window shopping ""is how people have become accustomed to shopping online,"" Karp told CNN. ""Whether it's for airplane flights or shoes, people have become accustomed to anonymously shopping without entering credit card or personal information."" The feature had the added benefit of taking some of the traffic demands off the enrollment portion of the website, Karp said. Lawmakers: Tell us why was the plan was scrapped . So why was online window shopping shelved for HealthCare.gov? That was the question lawmakers posed to Henry Chao, the top technology officer for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a subsidiary of HHS that helped build the HealthCare.gov website. Chao said he made the decision in conjunction with colleagues and testified before Congress last week that it was because the feature ""failed so miserably that we could not conscionably let people use it."" Yet a CMS document made public by the same committee last week tells a different story. The agency and one of its subsidiaries, the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, was working with government contractors on the website. It determined the Anonymous Shopper feature ""tested successfully,"" revealed ""no high severity defects open"" and that ""remaining lower severity defects will not degrade consumer experience."" CMS raised questions about the ""tested successfully"" denotation for the feature in a statement. In it, a spokeswoman writes: ""â€ªCMS believes that the 'yes' that is written on the document in question is likely an error, because the same document also lists a number of ongoing defects and problems with the tool. Additional defects were communicated and discussed in other settings."" â€ªThe source close to the project, however, said the anonymous shopper function did pass testing conducted in the weeks ahead of the HealthCare.gov launch. ""This document reflects one point in time that was part of a series of ongoing updates and monitoring,"" Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for HHS, said in a written statement. The successful test occurred on September 17, according to a source familiar with the project. The next day, in an internal e-mail obtained by CNN, Chao wrote the shopper function ""isn't needed and thus should be removed."" During an interview with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on November 1, Chao said there were 20 outstanding defects with the anonymous shopper that prevented it from making it online when the health care website launched. But according to a list that CNN obtained, only 12 defects remained when the decision to shelve HealthCare.gov was made. ""The application should not have displayed the tobacco question since the person seeking coverage is a kid,"" read one of the listed defects. A source close to the project said ""the problems with the tool were actually rather minor"" and could have been fixed by launch day. Instead, government officials shelved the Anonymous Shopper tool to shift focus on the parts of the website necessary to enroll users in insurance plans. On September 12 and 18, federal health officials instructed CGI, the contractor hired to create the Anonymous Shopper feature, to concentrate on a part of the website called ""Plan Compare,"" rather than the window shopping feature, according to a document that CNN obtained. ""Plan Compare"" allows users to look at health insurance plans only after they have created an account at HealthCare.gov, verified their identification and provided qualification details for a subsidy. ""As we have said, we always envisioned 'anonymous shopping' as a tool that would be a part of HealthCare.gov at some point, however we chose to prioritize other functionality in order to be ready for an October 1 launch,"" Peters, the HHS spokeswoman, told CNN. A week before the federal exchange launched, CMS instructed contractors to disable Anonymous Shopper for launch day, the document shows, preventing HealthCare.gov users from accessing the window shopping function. Prototype was a year in the making . The California HealthCare Foundation, along with seven other nonprofits, helped finance and direct the creation of an Anonymous Shopper prototype in conjunction with 11 states and the agencies of the federal government. One of the world's leading design firms, IDEO, created the prototype, Enroll UX 2014, as a model of world class health insurance shopping experience. IDEO's team for the $3 million project included the designer who created shoe and apparel giant Zappos.com and currently directs design at the popular online restaurant reservation site, OpenTable.com. After a year of work, they presented their Anonymous Shopper template to state and federal officials in June 2012. CMS endorsed the prototype and encouraged states to adopt it, according to a letter the agency wrote to states, which CNN obtained. Many of those states, including California, Colorado and New York, are using the feature designed by IDEO effectively. ""After we presented [the prototype] to [federal health officials], we never heard what they were doing with the design,"" Karp said. ""The entire operation went dark, so to speak, and it wasn't until it launched in October that we saw it wasn't one of the components of how you apply"" on the federal site. Political firestorm rages . If it's puzzling for health care experts such as Karp who consider the tool ""a prerequisite to having a good consumer experience,"" it's red meat for Republicans opposed to the health care program. They accuse the Obama administration of sidelining the feature to hide the sticker shock of insurance plans and force Americans to jump through hoops before they can shop. ""Although, CGI officials (the contractor for the shopping tool) were not able to identify who within the administration made the decision to disable the anonymous shopping feature, evidence is mounting that political considerations motivated the decision,"" Rep. Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, wrote in a leader to federal tech executives in October. So far, no document or testimony has revealed White House involvement in the anonymous shopper decision, and privately, some Republicans admit the accusations the decision was made inside the West Wing is motivated by politics more than evidence. Almost two months since HealthCare.gov's enrollment function went live, the anonymous shopper function is still absent from the site's features, though HHS and CMS point to other online browsing features on the troubled online portal. ""Even without (Anonymous Shopper) in place, CMS included a list of plans and pretax credit examples of premiums on the homepage of HealthCare.gov the day the site launched, and later rolled out our plan preview tool that allows consumers to see this information by entering some basic information about themselves and the coverage they are looking for,"" Peters said. The ""Plan Preview"" tool was added to the site October 10, amid criticism there was no window shopping feature. But it only includes two age categories for estimates -- ""49 or under"" and ""50 or older"" -- and has been criticized for providing wildly varied cost estimates. ""It's not as good as Anonymous Shopper,"" Karp told CNN. ""It doesn't provide the full experience of anonymous shopping that was recommended"" in the prototype CMS encouraged state exchanges to adopt, adding that the online window shopping tool ""still remains a key component, particularly to filter plans in states where there are so many plans."" Seven weeks after HealthCare.gov's launch, the Anonymous Shopper tool is still shelved. At the federal government's order, the contractor responsible for it, CGI, is not even working to ready it, a source close to the project tells CNN. HHS would not provide an estimate of when the window shopping feature will be available. CNN's Rachel Streitfeld and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.

"Bossangoa, Central African Republic (CNN) -- The commander of the Muslim militia in a Central African Republic town that has seen two days of violent clashes shows us a horrifying graphic video that he keeps on his phone. A man Colonel Saleh Zabadi claims is Muslim is being burned to death by the Christian anti-Balaka militia. ""This is targeting of Muslims,"" Zabadi tells CNN. ""They want the current (Muslim) president to step down or else they will keep slaughtering our people."" Zabadi spoke to CNN in a rare interview as a ceasefire negotiated between rival Muslim and Christian militias brought a brief respite to one town after two days of violent clashes. Bossangoa, a six-hour drive north of the capital Bangui, is important to the situation in the Central African Republic because the camps for internally displaced persons (IDP) here host about 40,000 people, 10% of the 400,000 IDPs across the country, according to the United Nations. The U.N. also says there are about 2.2 million people -- about half the country's population -- who are under threat. When we are ushered in to meet Zabadi, he is listening to the radio, probably for updates on the intense fighting that has kicked off that day in Bangui. He is friendly and chats at length to CNN's Nima Elbagir in Arabic. For the interview he dons his military cap and dark glasses and also lights a cigarette that he occasionally smokes during the interview. Around us are about 30 of his men -- carrying guns, grenades and some RPGs. Their ""uniform"" is anything but -- varying in color and design. After the interview we go with the commander and his troops on what they call a patrol of the town -- they go round the town in a pick-up truck filled with some of their heavily armed men. The colonel denies targeting Christians and ordering burning of villages. Asked about the arrival of French peacekeepingtroops, he is nonchalant, adding that people need to know the Muslim rebel militia Seleka is going nowhere. ""We are this country's government. Leave power? Maybe if we are dead,"" he says defiantly. On the drive from Bangui one sees many people walking on the road and lounging outside their homes -- men, women and children. As you continue though, it's mostly men sitting and standing outside their homes. We are told this is because the women go to fetch food and firewood while the men remain on guard against any possible attack on their homes. About 100 kilometres from Bossangoa, the U.N. convoy in which we are traveling stops and we are told to wear our protective gear. Back in the car, we travel past village after village of deserted homes and burnt-out huts. The only sign of life we see are goats and occasionally some pigs. Before we start filming in Bossangoa, a U.N. official takes us to the headquarters of the Muslim Seleka militia -- everyone who comes into the town on official business has to first report to them. The Seleka sees itself as the local administration in the area. After two days of intense fighting between Seleka and the anti-Balaka militias, the regional multinational force for Central Africa (FOMAC) has been able to negotiate a ceasefire to allow aid agencies to get there and assess the needs of those caught in the crossfire. We manage to film at the only hospital in the area, which is run by MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res. When we arrive we find a young man receiving first aid for a deep cut on his head -- it is from a machete. Beds in the in-patient section are full -- most of the patients there have received surgical treatment for bullet wounds. Aid agencies believe the number of sick and wounded could be higher in the surrounding villages but that they are afraid to venture out to seek help. Similar stories of hardship can be seen in the IDP camps -- the one at the Catholic hospital hosts about 35,000 people. The people, mostly Christian, arrived en masse when the conflict began weeks ago. Nearby at the Ecole Liberte school, the Muslim IDP makeshift camp mushroomed in two days from 2,500 people to about 10,000 people. Both camps are running out of everything you can think of -- food, water and medicine. And there is little shelter from the elements. Robert McCarthy, emergency director for the Central African Republic at UNICEF, says that both sides need to lay down their weapons now. ""The rights of child, women need to be respected and they're not being respected,"" he tells CNN. ""And we can't do our work and frankly, little prospect of moving out of this situation unless people especially leaders, people who are armed, people who are responsible for armed men recognize that and begin to take those responsibilities seriously."" Forced to choose children . Julian Donald, an MSF aid worker, describes the scale of the tragedy: ""Any situation really of hundreds of thousands of people who through no fault of their own are living in extremely dire circumstances, I would hope that the international community would be mobilized to provide assistance and the fact that we haven't seen it happen yet, is a tragedy. ""Basically the entire population is displaced. Their health condition is extremely grave. We find 100% malaria positivity, extra-ordinarily high levels of malnutrition and the key thing is the fear of violence,"" Donald said. ""There was this little three-year-old boy who'd been abandoned by his mother in front of the house because she'd picked up the other two children and run into the bush. So try and imagine yourself in that situation -- being so afraid for your life that you had to choose which children to carry with you when you started running."" Up to 500 people have been killed in Bangui already, according to Human Rights Watch, and on December 5, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to grant French troops Chapter 7 powers to directly engage militia to protect civilians against the threat of what the U.N. fears could become genocide in the CAR. A day after the French troops arrived, the hundreds of people who had sought safety in the FOMAC base camp, felt safe enough to return to their homes. Outside one Catholic church, people scatter screaming as the unfamiliar boom of a low-flying jet sweeps over them. The horror soon turns to jubilation and shouts of -- the French! The French! The sonic boom is a sign, they feel that international help has finally come. This mission for France was always going to be about speed and it took them 14 hours straight driving from the capital Bangui to make it out into the regions, and to Bossangoa. CNN went out with the French troops on their first patrol since their arrival in Bossangoa. Initially they were on a reconnaissance mission to get a sense of the situation -- they want to get the scope of the crisis here. There is also a show of force -- they want to show the actors in this conflict that they are now here. All morning, fighter jets scream overhead, to hammer home the reality of the French presence. Heavy tanks and weaponry are also on show. The 100 or so French troops (with reinforcements on the way) hope to both make Bossangoa safe and push out to the even more insecure bush past the city limits where 100,000 people have been hiding for the past six months in fear for their lives. There has been a respite in the killings but the challenge will be to build on the slow progress. An official from the multi-national force for Central Africa (FOMAC) says Seleka will no longer be allowed to run the country as local administrators, and instead the police will begin to do that. Also the militia group will be restricted to their camps and when they venture out, they will be forced to leave their weapons behind. This rule also applies to the Christian anti-Balaka militia, which include vigilante groups. If any of the groups defy this order, said the official, they will be forcefully disarmed. Eventually, according to the FOMAC official, the plan is to absorb Seleka into the army. The country's future stability may depend on how successful that effort is.","Ceasefire between rival Muslim, Christian militias brings respite in Central African Republic .

"(CNN) -- The only sound Christian Myers heard in his classroom at Arapahoe High School was the constant buzz of vibrating cell phones -- calls from panicked parents trying to reach their children. The sophomore and his fellow classmates were hunkered down in a corner of a darkened room. Minutes earlier, they had heard the sound of gunshots. That was followed by a dire warning from a teacher. ""He just yelled, 'Lockdown!'"" Myers, a sophomore, told CNN on Friday. ""He goes 'Do what would you do in a lockdown drill. This is not a drill.''' 'It was a shotgun' It was just after 12:30 p.m. Friday at Arapahoe High School with its student population of more than 2,200 in Centennial, Colorado, when the shooting began. Some students were on lunch break at the open campus; others were still in classes. Janitor Fabian Llerenas was on the north side of the building when he saw a student running ""side-to-side, kinda military style."" The student was carrying something. Llernas did a double take. ""It was a shotgun,"" he told CNN affiliate KUSA. ""So right away, I got on the radio to alert everyone on the staff,"" he said. ""...And that's when I heard the shots."" 'A really loud bang' One minute, ninth-grader Whitney Riley was getting ready to retrieve her computer from her locker at Arapahoe High School. The next minute, she was running. ""We were having fun and laughing and then, all of a sudden, we heard a really loud bang,"" the 15-year-old told CNN. ""My teacher asked what it was and then we heard two more and we all just got up and screamed and ran into a sprinkler system room."" Inside the windowless room were five students and two teachers. ""We were shaking, we were crying, we were freaking out,"" Riley said. ""I had a girl biting my arm."" They soon heard people yelling, and walkie-talkies crackling, and then they heard police asking someone to drop the gun, put the gun down, and hold his arms up, she said. She did not hear another gunshot, though the people doing the talking could have moved farther away, she said. Soon, they heard police ordering them out. Three shots . Eric Waugh was in his physics class when he and his classmates heard a bang. Initially, the teacher opened the door, he said. The teacher and students ""initially thought it might be an explosion from a chemistry class."" Then, they heard a gunshot. And then another. And then another. The teacher locked the door and turned off the lights. ""He yelled at us to go and get in the corner, and we were in the corner in two seconds,"" Waugh said. Later, SWAT officers came to the classroom door. The students filed out in single file, their arms above their heads, he said. ""We never thought this would happen at our school,"" Waugh said. 'Are you OK?' Myers, the sophomore, and his fellow classmates were sitting in the dark when he started to think about his twin brother, Austin. He knew his brother should be in class. Even so, he was worried about him. ""Are you OK?"" Myers texted. There was no answer. He texted again: ""You doing OK?"" Still, there was no reply. Myers was overwhelmed with fear. Was his brother one of those who had been shot? He tried several more times to raise his brother by text message to no avail. Then he sent a text message to a friend, who he knew had a class with his brother. Have you seen my brother? Myers asked. The answer: ""Austin never showed up to class today."" Panicked and in tears, Myers reached out to his father by text message: Dad, Austin is missing. Moments later, his father responded: Austin stayed home today. He wasn't feeling good this morning.

"Bastrop, Texas (CNN) -- Firefighters southeast of Austin, Texas, battled strong winds Monday as they struggled to gain ground against a fast-moving wildfire that has so far scorched some 25,000 acres and destroyed close to 500 homes. Another fire in eastern Texas killed a mother and her 18-month-old child when flames engulfed their mobile home Sunday near Gladewater, the Gregg County Sheriff's Department said. ""We got a long way to go to get this thing contained,"" Gov. Rick Perry said about the fire raging near Austin. ""I have seen a number of big fires in my life. This one is as mean looking as I've ever seen."" Dozens of fires are burning across the parched state, the Texas Forest Service said Monday. Earlier, the governor issued a statement in which he called the wildfire situation in Texas ""severe"" and said that all state resources were being made available to protect lives and property. ""We will pick up the pieces. We always do,"" he told reporters. Texas is battling its worst fire season in state history. A record 3.5 million acres -- an area roughly the size of Connecticut, Perry said -- have burned since the start of the season in November as hot and dry weather, coupled with a historic drought, made conditions ripe for rapid fire growth. ""It's a very serious, scary situation,"" said Jan Amen, a Texas Forest Service spokeswoman. ""The drought has gone on so long -- it's just bone dry. Anything that catches fire takes off."" Over the weekend, officials said low relative humidity and strong winds from Lee, which made landfall as a tropical storm but then weakened, further fanned the flames. A red flag warning was in effect for much of east, south and central Texas on Monday, with wind gusts of up to 35 mph in places, according to the National Weather Service. A fire broke out about 45 miles north of Houston Monday afternoon. It was moving between 15 and 20 mph and threatening homes, said Rhonda Reinholz with the Magnolia Volunteer Fire Department. Another fire burned in the Steiner Ranch subdivision in Travis County, forcing families out of their homes. Justin Allen evacuated from there with his five kids. Though he does not think the flames will reach their house, which is tucked near the back of the development, they are close enough to worry about, he said. ""It's pretty scary,"" said Allen. ""And it's really sad for everyone that's in that path."" The outbreak of wildfires prompted Perry to return to Texas from South Carolina, where he was scheduled to participate in a forum for Republican presidential candidates. The massive, uncontained fire in Bastrop County, near Austin, was the state's largest Monday. It destroyed 476 homes, according to Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald, and threatened about 1,000 others, officials with the forest service's incident management team reported. About 5,000 residents evacuated as flames approached, officials said. Lisa Ross learned she needed to leave her Bastrop home when her husband called 911 after realizing a looming fire had darkened the skies above. ""You learn what is valuable in life, and it isn't the stuff,"" she said. ""It's people in your life, and what means something to you."" Cars crammed with belongings and pets packed a gas station on a highway near Austin, attorney Jonathan A. Zendeh Del said. ""I've lived in Texas almost all my life, and I've never seen a fire that big in central Texas,"" he said. Officials issued a boil water notice for parts of Bastrop Monday. Dark clouds of smoke billowing across the sky could be seen miles from the fire. Satellite images Monday showed the fire stretching over about 25,000 acres, jumping the Colorado River and a highway, the Texas Forest Service said. More evacuations are likely as the fire spreads, officials said. Already, hundreds of people are in shelters as dangerous flames keep them from finding out whether their homes survived. ""We have been told already from three people that live in that area that our house has been burnt. I had a gut feeling that it did not, but now it's looking worse and worse,"" said Gisele Vocal, an evacuee. ""We just have to wait now."" Firefighters used Black Hawk helicopters to douse flames with a mixture of water and fire retardant Monday, officials said. The fire forced parts of state highways 71 and 21 to shut and additional road closures were expected. At least 63 new fires across Texas on Sunday burned nearly 33,000 acres, the state's fire service said. Fires were reported in at least 17 counties. CNN's Jim Spellman, Antoinette Campbell, Chris Welch, Paul Steinhauser, Shawna Shephard, Stephanie Gallman and Anna Gonzalez contributed to this report.","Another fire breaks out near Houston .

"(CNN) -- Would you pay to be handcuffed and locked in a dark room? Or blindfolded with four of your friends and shut in a prison cell? Thousands in Hong Kong have answered yes to those questions, taking part in a new game that challenges teams to break free from sticky situations by solving puzzles, sussing-out clues and breaking codes. Participants say the attraction lies in seeing your video-game or movie fantasies come to life. ""It's not any normal kind of entertainment,"" said student Kelly Tsang, after she and four friends failed to break free from Dr. Alpha's Laboratory, which featured a ""Mission Impossible"" style laser maze. ""We normally go shopping or to a movie."" ""Freeing HK"" charges players around $16 each to take part in one of the games, with names like ""Prison Break"" and ""The Lost Chamber."" Each challenge lasts 45 minutes and only about a quarter of participants manage to escape, owners said. Despite the spooky music and claustrophobic surroundings, the atmosphere here is more Sherlock Holmes than horror movie. Teams can have one clue from the organizers if they get stuck. The hallway is plastered with signs from players holding signs that read either ""We're Free"" or ""We Failed."" Allan Lam, a hotel clerk who came to play with a group of his colleagues, believes the real escapades were a lot harder than the virtual ones. To pick a lock in video games, ""you just click,"" he said, but in real life it's a much tougher task. But people seem to like the challenge. More than 7,000 people have played since the doors opened in November. Two new locations are expected to open by the end of May. They'll offer new games with names like ""Vampire Castle"" and ""Around the World."" The owners say it can take about 20 staffers up to a month to design a single game. Instant Wan and Raymond Sze, two of Freeing HK's founders, said the idea came from popular video games. ""So many people are sitting in front of a computer in a virtual world. We want to bring them into the real world,"" Wan said. And if Wan and Sze have their way, that world will be home to many more locations of ""Freeing HK."" ""We plan to expand to Mainland China, Macau and other places in Asia first. And we think if there are any chances, we will expand to other countries as well,"" Wan said.","A hit new game in Hong Kong is bringing people's video fantasies to life .

"(CNN) -- After 21 years of arrests with a side of wisecracks, Detective John Munch will retire Wednesday night on ""Law and Order: SVU."" Richard Belzer debuted the role in January 1993, with NBC's ""Homicide: Life on the Street."" Never the star, but usually the character with the best lines, Munch survived the cancellation of that show -- and much more. Between the reprisal of the role on various ""Law and Order"" spin-offs and his many guest spots in character, Belzer parlayed Munch into one of the longest running roles in TV history. As Munch, Belzer appeared on FOX's ""The X-Files"" in 1993, HBO's ""The Wire"" in 2002 and shows like ""Arrested Development,"" ""The Beat"" and ""30 Rock."" Munch appeared in nine different television shows, and that doesn't even include the time ""Sesame Street"" turned Munch into a muppet to solve alphabet-related crimes in the Special Letters Unit, or when he popped up on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" Of course, the irony is if you were to design a character who would run for more than two decades on television, you probably wouldn't create someone like Munch. The original character, like much of ""Homicide,"" was at least partially based on a real-life detective, but Munch was given an edge by comedian-turned-actor Belzer. The always anti-establishment Belzer brought a counterculture element to the police precinct with the offbeat detective. The romantically challenged, conspiracy theorist, temperamental Munch was a cop concerned with civil rights and a penchant for self-deprecation. Not your typical TV fare. Which is probably why he endured all these years. Belzer has been enjoying the attention his character's retirement is getting. He's been tweeting out his thanks, saying, ""Am I one of the luckiest actors in the world or what? Between my loving fans and an adoring press-I am virtually speechless."" Though he's not sure he'll be able to watch Munch's retirement episode because he'll be too emotional, he's helpfully suggesting his fans play a drinking game in which they take a swig every time someone says his character's name during the show. Fear not, Munch fans, this isn't completely the end of the line. Belzer is expected to have a cameo or two on ""SVU"" and another crossover opportunity could present itself down the road. (FOX's police comedy ""Brooklyn Nine Nine"" seems like a great choice, and it stars former ""Homicide"" castmate Andre Braugher). At least for one more night, the streets are safe.","Detective John Munch will retire on ""Law and Order: SVU""

"(CNN) -- A 10-year-old Georgia girl may have been dead for days -- having likely been starved well before that -- before her charred body was discovered in a trash can, police said Tuesday. Eman Moss, the father of young Emani Moss pointed Gwinnett County police early Saturday to her body in the trash of a Lawrenceville apartment complex. By then, she may have been dead for days, authorities say. Emani may have died as early as October 30, county police said Tuesday while reporting the results of an autopsy. The state of the girl's body indicated she was severely underweight, with investigators determining she had been denied food for several days before her death. Detectives found Emani had been isolated from everyone but her family in recent weeks. Officials said she had not attended school this school year. Detectives said they believe Emani was burned to cover up her killing. The Gwinnett County Medical Examiner's Office ruled her death a homicide, though it is waiting for additional test results before pinning down a cause of death. The episode began with a 911 call around 3:40 a.m. Saturday from a man now believed to be Emani's father. Police first reported he was suicidal, but on Tuesday indicated that was not the case. The man told dispatchers there was a body with him. His young daughter, he said, had drunk some type of chemical and died. Gwinnett County police headed to the family's residence in Lawrenceville, a city of about 29,000 people some 30 miles northeast of Atlanta. They found the man who apparently had made the call standing outside a building in an apartment complex. Police said he directed officers to a trash can in a recreation area where the girl's body was found. The slain girl's father and her stepmother, Tiffany Moss, were arrested. Gwinnett County police announced Saturday evening that both are charged with felony murder, first-degree cruelty to children and concealing a body.

"London (CNN) -- At an age when most of us were still mastering how to tie our shoelaces, Benjamin Grosvenor was working on his piano arpeggios and legato fingers. The British former child prodigy is now barely out of his teens, but already has a reputation as one of the most exciting and distinctive pianists in the world today. Having first hit the headlines at the age of 11 -- as the youngest ever finalist in the UK's Young Musician of the Year competition -- Grosvenor last year became the youngest musician to sign to the esteemed Decca Classics label, and the first British pianist to do so in almost 60 years. So it's surprising to learn that the precocious star has only the faintest memory of early childhood encounters with the instrument. ""There was always a piano in our house because my mother was a piano teacher and we had an upright which was there from when I was born. But I don't have any strong first memory of my interaction with it,"" he recalls. More from Human to Hero: Former Olympic rower Matthew Pinsent . According to his mother, he says, he ""didn't have any interest in it at all"" in the piano aged five and only resumed playing a year later after he discovered that his friends were taking lessons. ""I had no great desire to practice, but then some friends at school started playing and I was spurred on to work by the thought of them catching me up. It was a competition,"" he remembers. Grosvenor likes to relay memories of his formative years in competitive terms: He admits that he didn't care much for the music as a child, but rather saw playing the piano as a ""challenge"" that needed ""overcoming."" Indeed, such are the physical demands of regular practice that he describes himself as an ""athlete."" But, today, his passion for playing is driven by a profound belief in the power of music. ""The ability it has to communicate emotions to people. I think that is what it's all about,"" he says. Grosvenor's fans certainly believe in his ability to transmit emotions. A ""romantic pianist, almost from another age ... He jumps inside the music's soul,"" is how British newspaper The Times described him recently. More from Human to Hero: Chinese archer Gao Fangxia . Tellingly, Grosvenor says he spends almost as much time developing an emotional bond with a piece of music as he does physically practicing the notes at his piano. ""There are really two sides to playing the piano, I suppose,"" he says. ""The ability to just play the notes and the ability to find meaning in them. ""Part of it is physical -- playing the same things over and over again to get them under your fingers and to get them in your muscle memory ... but playing something over and over again doesn't necessarily make it better."" Instead, Grosvenor often develops an interpretation of a piece of music in his head, ""away from the piano."" For one so accustomed to regular public performance since childhood, Grosvenor still wrestles with debilitating nerves. ""There are concerts before which you have about half an hour where you feel pretty awful and during that time you are questioning, saying to yourself, 'Why am I doing this to myself again? Why am I putting myself through this? ""And then invariably by the end of the concert you look back at that and think, 'How silly, that was quite easy.' But then by the next time you have forgotten that and you go through the same thing again,"" he says. In order to combat performance anxiety, Grosvenor recently conjured an unorthodox mental preparation that he deploys before appearing onstage. More from Human to Hero: Michael Phelps' photo finish . ""I have been trying to picture the contours of an image of a valley I once saw, something completely irrelevant to what I'm about to do and just to look over it and try and picture all the small details -- and I think that helps to calm me down,"" he says. Whatever nerves he may feel inside, it certainly hasn't affected his performances as far as everyone else is concerned. Last month alone he played to sold-out concerts at the Sydney Opera House, London's Royal Albert Hall and the Parc du Chateau de Florans in France. And yet despite this extraordinary ongoing success, Grosvenor -- who just graduated from the Royal Academy of Music in London -- still sometimes wonders if he's made the right career choice. ""I could be doing a degree in something else or working in a more steady profession I suppose, because as a performer it is not a regular job, it is not something that is guaranteed -- you have to keep up the standard."" It's a sobering thought, so how does Grosvenor maintain the force of his convictions? ""It is never playing the piano that is the problem -- it is the outside pressures. It is the pressures of the career and that is something to remember. You go through periods where you feel like all the work is piled on top of you but there is always an end to that and you just have to get through it ... It is usually alright in the end.""","Benjamin Grosvener is regarded as one of the finest concert pianists working today .

"(CNN) -- More than Justin Timberlake, Kanye West, Lady Gaga or Lorde, it was Miley Cyrus who owned 2013. At least, according to MTV. After stealing the spotlight at not one but two MTV awards shows, starring in an MTV documentary and taking over the network on her 21st birthday, MTV has crowned Cyrus as its best artist of the year. It's not like the pop star hasn't worked for it. (Or twerked for it -- we had to!) Her October release, ""Bangerz,"" bowed at No.1 and features two other chart-topping tracks, ""We Can't Stop"" and ""Wrecking Ball."" Both singles were accompanied by music videos that became cultural touchstones and almost broke the Internet. (According to Vevo.com, Cyrus' ""Wrecking Ball"" is its most-viewed video of 2013, followed by the clip for ""We Can't Stop."") The former Disney star also nailed her appearance on ""Saturday Night Live"" in the fall, when she both hosted and performed. Barbara Walters considers Cyrus one of the most fascinating people of the year, and she somehow managed to end up on Time magazine's best- and worst-dressed lists of 2013. Given that, it's not too surprising that MTV's news and music teams -- having noticed that Cyrus' MTV artist page is the most-visited of the year, with her VMAs performance being the most-watched video -- have given her another No. 1. Cyrus is the third star to take the title, following Katy Perry and One Direction.

"Plateau State, Nigeria (CNN) -- Gunmen attacked a mosque in Nigeria with automatic weapons over the weekend, killing at least 44 people, a local police official said. It's not clear who was behind Sunday's massacre, but the militant Islamist group Boko Haram -- which has staged attacks in the same region before -- issued a video around the same time boasting that it was gaining in strength. Details have been slow to emerge about the attack in Konduga, about 30 kilometers (almost 19 miles) southeast of Maiduguri, the capital of Nigeria's northern Borno state. The police official in Konduga spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Another 26 victims were brought into Maiduguri Teaching Hospital for treatment on Sunday, some in critical condition, a source at the hospital who asked not to be identified told CNN. Some villagers in Borno state have also been attacked in their own homes, accused of collaborating with government forces against Boko Haram, police sources said. Local media reported that at least 12 people were killed on Saturday night in Ngom village alone. Opinion: Nigeria's peace 'the peace of a graveyard' In the video released by Boko Haram, its leader Abubakar Shekau claimed that the militant group is growing stronger despite the Nigerian military's efforts to curb its activities. ""You soldiers have claimed that you are powerful, and that you have defeated us, you say we are mad people; but how can a mad man organize the attacks in Gamboru, in Malumfatori, slaughter people in Biu, kill in Gwoza and in Bama successfully, where soldiers fled under our heavy fire power?"" he said. ""We have killed countless soldiers and we are going to kill more. Our strength and firepower is bigger than that of Nigeria. Nigeria is no longer a big deal to us, as far as we are concerned. ""We will now comfortably confront the United States of America."" Shekau said the group would continue to kill unbelievers and ""anyone who stands against the will of Allah by opposing Sharia,"" or Islamic law. Boko Haram has often targeted Christians in Nigeria but the group will also attack other Muslims when it feels they are not adhering to strict Sharia law. There have been suggestions that the group has attacked certain mosques because worshippers at that mosque have assisted government forces in tracking members of the militant group. 'Contemptible act' The U.S. State Department named Shekau as a ""specially designated global terrorist"" in June last year. This year, it offered up to $7 million for information leading to his arrest or conviction, under its Rewards for Justice Program. Britain and Spain each condemned the attack in Borno state and offered their condolences Tuesday to the victims and their families. ""This senseless attack has reportedly killed 44 people and left many others injured. Attacking innocent people in a place of worship is a contemptible and cowardly act,"" said Mark Simmonds, UK Foreign Office Minister for Africa. ""The UK stands with the government and people of Nigeria as they seek to reduce violence in the north east of the country."" Spain's Foreign Ministry ""called on the authorities to advance their efforts to arrest the offenders, probably part of the Boko Haram terrorist group, bring them to justice, and put an end to the activities of the group which threatens the peace and coexistence in the country."" Gunmen kill 20 students, teacher in Nigerian school shooting . State of emergency . Boko Haram, whose name means ""Western education is forbidden,"" seeks to overthrow the Nigerian government and replace it with a regime based on Islamic law. A state of emergency has been imposed in Borno state since May 14, including a complete communications blackout, as authorities seek to tackle the militant group. Yobe and Adamawa states, which border Borno state, were placed under a state of emergency at the same time. Declaring the state of emergency in May, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan blamed ""terrorists"" aimed at ""rebellion"" who have caused ""fear among our citizens and a near breakdown of law and order in parts of the country."" He said the terrorists were mounting a ""rebellion and insurgency"" that threatened Nigeria's unity and stability, and pledged to send more troops to the three northeastern states. ""We have taken robust steps to unravel and address the root causes of these crises, but it would appear that there is a systematic effort by insurgents and terrorists to destabilize the Nigerian state and test our collective resolve,"" he said in a televised speech. With an estimated 174.5 million people, Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation. The CIA World Factbook says the nation is roughly 50% Muslim and 40% Christian. Violence between the mainly Muslim north and Christian south has taken at least 2,800 lives, according to Human Rights Watch. Opinion: How African innovation can take on the world .

"(CNN) -- As a young freedom fighter, Nelson Mandela stepped out of a farmhouse hideout in South Africa, took 20 strides and dug a hole on the sprawling land. He leaned over, put in a semiautomatic pistol and 200 rounds of ammunition, and carefully put a khaki uniform over them. After covering them with heaps of soil, he sauntered back into his rural hideout in northern Johannesburg -- hoping to retrieve them soon. He never got a chance to fire a shot with the Makarov pistol. A few weeks after he buried it at the farm in Rivonia, he was hurled into prison for the next 27 years. That was in 1962, and the whereabouts of the gun -- now estimated at $3 million -- remain a mystery, said Nicholas Wolpe, the chief executive of Liliesleaf Farm, the former hideout now converted into a museum. A scramble to find the gun has sparked a frenzy among collectors, historians and Mandela fans. 'It's interesting how we came to find out about the gun,"" Wolpe said. ""Mandela visited Liliesleaf in 2003, and as we were walking around, he turned to me and asked, 'By the way, did you find my gun?"" Wolpe said he was stunned. ""I turned to him and said, 'Gun, what gun?' "" Mandela then asked him to pinpoint where the main kitchen once stood. ""He then made a 45-degree angle and said, '20 paces from here, I buried a gun,' "" Wolpe said. During the visit, the two tried to retrace his steps using the paces as a guide, but the farm had undergone some changes, making it hard to determine the original location of the kitchen with certainty. Wolpe later realized that the former South African president had talked about the gun during an interview with a journalist in the 1990s right after he was freed from prison. During the interview, Mandela indicated that he buried the pistol, ammunition and the uniform at the site in case there was a raid at the house, according to Wolpe. Mandela and the military wing of the African National Congress used the secret location -- now Liliesleaf Farm -- to plan the toppling of the South African apartheid government. It is the first gun Mandela owned and the first weapon linked to the anti-apartheid fight in South Africa, Wolpe said. The gun was a gift by Ethiopian Col. General Biru Tadesse, whom Mandela visited in the early 1960s for military advice on fighting apartheid. Despite its hefty price tag, Wolpe hastily makes it clear that it's not about the money or glorifying violence. ""It is all about the historical significance of the gun and who it belongs to,"" Wolpe said. ""The 1960s were a defining moment in South Africa's struggle ... The gun has a special link to a very significant period and epoch to our liberation struggle."" A scramble to find the gun has prompted Wolpe to take extreme measures. He hired searchers to demolish a home on Liliesleaf's property, carefully ripping up chunks of concrete and turning over a yard to find it. He also dispatched military experts to try and pinpoint its exact location based on Mandela's information. His trust owns about five acres of the original 20-acre hideout. ""The expert identified three possible locations, two of which are on our site,"" Wolpe said. The third location is on neighboring property, which was put up for auction last week. Historians, collectors and potential international bidders were among the 400 people who participated. Despite the frenzy surrounding the potential site of the gun, the property worth about $350,000 did not sell. ""I'm still shocked, I don't understand why it did not sell,"" said lead auctioneer Joff van Reenen, who speculated that potential buyers may have been scared off by the publicity surrounding the gun. Unlike Wolpe, the owner of the neighboring property did not make an effort to find the gun. The property includes a modern Spanish-style house, under which the military expert believes is the potential third location of the gun. And the mystery continues as both Wolpe and the owner of the neighboring home hope the gun is on their land. ""Obviously, it would be totally inappropriate to ask him for help now,"" Wolpe said of the ailing 92-year-old Mandela. ""And there is no new information he can give us that would make finding it easier.""","He buries the gun before he is thrown into prison in 1962 .

"(CNN) -- A tip from an acquaintance of one of two convicted murderers who were mistakenly released from prison led to their arrests at a Florida motel, the commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said Sunday. Charles Walker and Joseph Jenkins were unarmed when they were taken into custody Saturday evening in Panama City, where they were waiting for their ride to arrive from Atlanta, Gerald Bailey said. It was unclear where the men expected to go, he said. He said a ""close associate"" informed authorities that the men were in the area. Bailey said they were arrested by themselves without incident at the Coconut Grove Motor Inn. They had been in Bay County for only 48 hours, he said. Walker and Jenkins will be held without bail and make their next court appearances Friday, a Bay County, Florida, judge said Sunday. He said the two will be held with probable cause for one count each of escape. There will be more arrests, Bailey predicted. ""They had to have had help (after their escape) -- and a lot of help -- to get where they were last night,"" he said. The state Department of Corrections -- which mistakenly released the men, though it has insisted it was through no fault of its own -- said little about the arrests. Cell phone video obtained by CNN from another guest at the motel shows U.S. marshals storming the men's room, guns drawn. Authorities had been searching for Walker and Jenkins, both 34, after investigators discovered that the motions to reduce their respective sentences and court orders granting the requests had been forged. Both killers had been convicted and sentenced to life behind bars without the possibility of parole within two years of their crimes. In September 1998, Jenkins killed Roscoe Pugh Jr. during a home-invasion robbery attempt. Six months later, Cedric Slater was gunned down on an Orlando street corner -- shot dead, a jury determined, by Walker. Jenkins left the prison in North Carrabelle, in the Florida Panhandle, on September 27, and Walker left on October 8, according to authorities. On Saturday, family members of both men denied any knowledge of the escape plans. The legal-looking documents the men used contained bogus reproductions of several key players' signatures, including those of the Orlando-area State Attorney Jeffrey Ashton or the assistant state attorney and Judge Belvin Perry. They bore the seal of the Orange County clerk of court's office. ""They are excellent fakes,"" Perry said. The judge said his signature is easy to find online on documents related to the high-profile trial of Casey Anthony. Anthony was acquitted in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. ""People, particularly people with criminal minds, come up with ingenious ways to beat the system,"" Perry said. ""They have nothing but time on their hands to think of things."" He stressed to CNN's Don Lemon on Sunday that he had nothing to do with the cases in question -- that they were assigned to other judges. ""When your name and documents that you've signed are plastered on the Internet for anybody and everybody to see, and someone with basic knowledge can paste and cut your signature, it doesn't surprise me that it did happen. It was just a matter of time,"" Perry said. ""It shows that we need to do a little bit more in authentication of documents."" Prosecutors learned about what happened after a member of Walker's family contacted them, Ashton, the state attorney, said. An October 8 letter from the Department of Corrections to Slater's mother, Evangelina Kearse, notified her a ""court order and amended sentence caused (Walker's) sentence to expire."" ""Please be aware that recent actions causing the release of this offender are beyond our control. Nevertheless, we apologize for the delay in this message,"" it said. Mike Crews, secretary of the Department of Corrections, said he was confident in the procedure to release prisoners, but ""obviously there was a gap somewhere."" From now on, prison officials will be required to check with the judge to make sure a release order is legitimate, he said. Bailey said there have been two other instances in which inmates attempted to use false documents to gain release, but officials prevented them from escaping. Both Walker and Jenkins appeared to play by the rules after their release. They went to the Orange County jail to register as felons -- Jenkins on September 30, Walker on October 11 -- as required by law. Though their releases may have initially seemed legitimate, the two convicts later were classified as escapees. CNN's Nick Valencia, John Zarrella, Kim Segal, Chelsea J.

"New York (CNN) -- Madison Square Garden, one of the world's iconic sports and entertainment arenas, has been given a decade to relocate after a vote by the New York City Council on Wednesday amid efforts to renovate the equally well-known Penn Station that sits below it. The council voted to approve a ""special permit"" that will allow the arena to operate for 10 years while its management seeks to relocate, according to a news release. The 47-1 vote comes after years of advocacy from city officials and independent groups who have sought to renovate and expand the bustling Pennsylvania Station. Madison Square Garden's 50-year land-use permit expired in January. The original Penn Station, which featured Corinthian columns, vast hallways and glass ceilings, was demolished in 1963 to make way for the construction of the current Madison Square Garden, which opened in 1968. ""The approval of this permit offers us a great opportunity to reimagine and redevelop Penn Station as a world-class transportation destination and allow time to relocate Madison Square Garden to a new and improved home,"" Council Speaker and mayoral candidate Christine C. Quinn said in a statement. Watch: New York City like you've never seen it . In June, Quinn called for the creation of a ""Commission for a 21st Century Penn Station,"" with the goal of helping to find a new Manhattan home for the arena and to renovate Penn Station. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg had hoped for a 15-year permit, according to Julie Wood, spokeswoman for the mayor. If Madison Square Garden does not find a new location, it will have to reapply for a permit once it expires. Penn Station accommodates hundreds of thousands travelers per day, and the City Council says the Garden's placement above it is an ""intractable problem."" ""Imagine 220 mph bullet trains that sweep you to D.C. or Boston in 90 minutes or less. These plans are on the table, but they can only be realized with a modern, renovated Penn Station,"" said Manhattan Borough President and city comptroller candidate Scott M. Stringer. ""That is not possible as long as the Garden sits squarely on top of the nation's busiest rail transit hub."" The arena's management did not go into the details of the vote, stating rather that it looks forward to its reopening this fall after a ""three year, nearly billion dollar"" renovation, according to Kimberly Kerns, spokeswoman for Madison Square Garden. The Garden, home to the New York Knicks and Rangers, first opened its doors in 1879 but has since moved to several locations throughout the city, according to its website. It has stood at its current Midtown Manhattan location since 1968 and hosted the famous ""Fight of the Century"" between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in 1971.

"(CNN) -- It's a shame that Jackie Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Teddy Kennedy can't experience the transformation of Dallas and Texas from the dark days of John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963 to the outpouring of tribute to him taking shape as the 50th anniversary approaches. People have debated for decades since that tragic day whether Dallas was ""a city of hate"" that brought about his murder. Certainly some factors contributed to that perception: Then-vice presidential candidate Lyndon Johnson and his wife, Ladybird, were spat on during the 1960 presidential campaign, and U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson was struck during a speaking appearance only weeks before the presidential visit. The latter episode resulted in a Time magazine headline: ""A City Disgraced."" Regardless of the validity or fairness of the accusation, the consequences were swift and brutal. The die of public opinion had been cast. For years, the city would endure a bitter stigma. It took long, agonizing decades for Dallas to deal with that burden. Today's observers will find it hard to conceive the harshness of scorn that ensued. Because I was a witness to the assassination from the White House press bus in the motorcade, I still remember vividly the shock and heartbreak of the moment, and the bitterness afterward. Mayor Earle Cabell received death threats from strangers. Dallas businessmen were bodily thrown out of New York taxicabs. A direct mail businesswoman was forced to change her mailing address to Arlington, a nearby community, after orders plummeted. Then, encouraging signs of recovery began to appear. On the political front, Erik Jonsson was drafted to become mayor, and forged an ambitious ""Goals for Dallas"" agenda to refocus and move the city out of its malaise. His strong leadership is credited for Dallas being named an All American City seven years later. Beyond the lofty civic initiatives, the city's image was bolstered by two unexpected sources. One was the spectacular performance of quarterback Roger Staubach, which led to the Dallas Cowboys being called ""America's Team."" The other was worldwide fascination with ""Dallas,"" the TV soap opera so popular that a Dallas reporter remembers a well-educated British interviewee asking whether he knew the Ewings, the mythical TV show family. Despite the benefit of these distractions from JFK's death, the city resisted coming to grips with the historical reality that rocked the world. Most Dallasites preferred to forget. The local Press Club, which stages an annual review of news highlights of the preceding year, did not include a single word about the assassination in its show the next spring. Many advocated bulldozing the School Book Depository. County of Dallas engineer Judson Shook Jr. saved the building by engineering its purchase and rehabilitation, providing space for a fitting memorial. Preservationist Lindalyn Adams and her allies helped realize that goal. After years of fits and starts, the Sixth Floor Museum opened its doors in 1989, and today is home to authoritative historical archives surrounding the Kennedy tragedy, including more than 1,100 oral histories. Fifty years after the trauma it suffered, Dallas is a vibrant city that boasts a host of Fortune 500 companies, an active arts scene and a growing population and economy. But until now, the city itself never has officially come to peace with the event. Dallas has set a tone of quiet dignity and grace to observe the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's death on Friday, November 22. Mayor Mike Rawlings adopted an enlightened pre-emptive strategy more than a year ago to marginalize would-be sensationalists and conspiracy mongers who might seek to dominate the milestone. Thus, more than 1,000 journalists from around the world will experience a simple one-hour ceremony to honor the memory of President John F. Kennedy in an address by noted historian David McCullough. More than 5,000 attendees who won standing-room-only free admission will view proceedings within a secured area of Dealey Plaza, site of the assassination. Next door, the Sixth Floor Museum will offer its vast resources, along with a series of special programs, to the tide of journalists, researchers and the general public expected to descend on the city. The city's initiative has led to the organic rise of other notable gestures across Texas in the weeks ahead. At nearby Fort Worth, an eight-foot bronze statue of Kennedy stands in JFK Tribute Plaza, the site where Kennedy spoke to thousands in a misting rain hours before he was killed. A few miles west of downtown, the Amon Carter Museum of American Art will show fine art that had hung in the Kennedys' suite at the Hilton Hotel Texas the night before his death. The Fort Worth Public Library and the University of Texas Library at nearby Arlington both offer extensive exhibitions of photographs from JFK visits to Fort Worth and Dallas. To the south, the LBJ Library in Austin offers exhibits on the assassination, Johnson's ascension to the presidency and his tenure as the nation's new leader. Visitors can hear Lady Bird Johnson's tape-recorded diary from several days surrounding the tragedy. Sixty miles to the west of Austin, the LBJ Ranch offers free admission to the Texas White House of the 1960s. Although Dallas and Texas never can erase the heartbreak of that day in 1963, this mosaic of honor should touch the hearts of those who mourn the passing of JFK, and help the nation and the world finally come to peace with that tragic time in our history.

"(CNN) -- Kenyan fighter jets hit an Al-Shabaab camp in Somalia on Friday, killing at least 30 militants, the Kenya Defence Forces said. The attack took place while the militants met at the camp in Garbarahey in Somalia's western Gedo region near the border with Kenya, the Kenya Defence Forces said on its official Twitter feed. An initial assessment indicates that ""key commanders"" were among the fatalities. Scores of others escaped with multiple injuries, the military said, and vehicles and other assets were destroyed in the raid. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government calls a terrorist group, was behind the deadly siege last September of a shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya. Kenyan officials say the terror group has used its camps to train operatives, including attackers who targeted the Westgate Mall. The radical Islamist group, which controls parts of Somalia, hopes to topple the leadership and turn the country into a fundamentalist Islamist state. The country has struggled to achieve an effective central government since a dictator's overthrow two decades ago.","At least 30 militants are killed in an airstrike on an Al-Shabaab training camp, Kenya's military says .

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of flying with tuberculosis tested negative for the disease, according to Maricopa County health officials, meaning there was never a risk to other passengers on his flight. The man was held in Phoenix from Saturday until Monday night, when he was released from the hospital. He is free to travel as he is no longer on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ""Do Not Board"" list, health officials said. Passengers aboard US Airways Flight 2846 were waiting on the tarmac at Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport on Friday when their pilot came on the intercom. ""We've been notified about a health emergency aboard the aircraft,"" passenger Dean Davidson heard. A few minutes later, Davidson saw a flight attendant walk toward another passenger sitting a few rows ahead of him. The flight attendant handed the slender middle-aged man a medical mask. Emergency personnel boarded the plane a short time later and removed the man, Davidson said. A firefighter then came on the intercom and announced that the passenger had active tuberculosis and was contagious and that other passengers on the flight had been exposed. He advised them to contact their physicians immediately, Davidson said. The Phoenix Fire Department was operating under the assumption that the CDC only puts a passenger on its ""Do Not Board"" list if the passenger has a confirmed infectious disease, said Dr. John Gallagher, the fire department's chief medical officer. Gallagher and battalion chief John Mure instructed Captain Ron Horne on what to say to passengers aboard the plane. Arizona health officials did not recommend passengers on Flight 2846 seek medical care because even if the passenger had tuberculosis, their risk of being infected was ""very, very low,"" said Dr. Rebecca Sunshine, disease control director for Maricopa County Public Health. ""To put this in perspective... We're much more concerned that the passengers on this flight contracted influenza than that they contracted TB,"" she said Monday. The US Airways flight took off from Austin, Texas, according to airline spokesman Bill McGlashen. It landed in Phoenix approximately two hours later on a layover before it was scheduled to fly to Los Angeles. There was no warning or flag on the passenger's record when he was going through security or when he boarded the plane, McGlashen said. After the plane took off, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the Transportation Security Administration of a possible risk. The TSA then notified US Airways, McGlashen said. Fast facts about tuberculosis . Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which mainly affects the lungs. It can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys, spine and brain. There are two types of TB: latent TB infection, which is not contagious, and TB disease, which is contagious. A person infected with latent TB shows no sign of symptoms and may not feel sick. Someone with TB disease usually feels ill; they may be coughing up blood and may have a fever, night sweats and/or chest pain. TB spreads through the air when a person with an active TB infection coughs, sneezes or speaks. Germs can stay in the air for hours. People who contract TB must take several medications for six to nine months to combat the infection, according to the CDC. Some varieties of the TB bacterium have developed a resistance to common antibiotics and may be more difficult to treat. People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, are particularly susceptible to the disease. The number of TB cases in the United States has been declining since 1992, according to the CDC. In 2010, the most recent CDC data available, there were 569 deaths from TB. In January 2010, a person infected with an active case of tuberculosis flew from Philadelphia to San Francisco on US Airways despite being on the CDC's ""Do Not Board"" list, which is different from the TSA's ""No Fly"" list. The Do Not Board list was created in 2007 after Atlanta lawyer Andrew Speaker traveled abroad with a drug-resistant case of tuberculosis, setting off an international health scare. Speaker insisted that he had not been told he was contagious; public health officials disagreed. The CDC manages the Do Not Board list in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security. The list is authorized under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, according to the CDC. Local and state health officials can contact the CDC to request that someone be placed on the list. ""To include someone on the list, CDC must determine that the person 1) likely is contagious with a communicable disease that would constitute a serious public health threat should the person be permitted to board a flight; 2) is unaware of or likely to be nonadherent with public health recommendations, including treatment; and 3) likely will attempt to board a commercial aircraft,"" the CDC website states. ""Once a person is placed on the list, airlines are instructed not to issue a boarding pass to the person for any commercial domestic flight or for any commercial international flight arriving in or departing from the United States."" The Do Not Board list does not apply to other methods of transportation. The CDC reviews the records of every person on the list every two weeks to see whether they are eligible to fly again. In general, airline passengers are not legally obligated to tell an airline when they are sick, said Jeff Ment, an attorney who specializes in travel law. Unlike cruise lines, which require you to disclose illnesses leading up to the cruise, he said, airlines do not include any language in the ticket purchasing process that would prevent you from traveling. ""If you have some disease and its contagious, where's the threshold?"" he asked. ""If you have the flu? If you have a really bad cold? I think that once you establish some rule that there has to be notification, it becomes a slippery slope."" As a ""common carrier,"" Ment said, airlines are legally required to do as much as possible to ensure the safety of their passengers. If a passenger appears too ill to survive the flight without medical assistance, an airline could prevent him from flying, he said. Or if the airline knew that a passenger had a contagious disease, employees could require her to wear a mask during the flight to prevent germs from spreading. In this kind of situation, any legal troubles would more likely stem from a civil lawsuit. After the 2007 incident, Speaker was sued by eight of his fellow passengers in a Canadian court. Ment said plaintiffs would have to show that the infected passenger knew that he had the disease and was extremely careless around his fellow travelers. ""The line is crossed when the person knows they're sick and intentionally tries to do something (to infect others) or acts with callous disregard for your well-being,"" Ment said. CNN's Jacque Wilson, Chuck Johnston, Matt Sloane, Casey Wian and Miriam Falco contributed to this story.","NEW: Passenger pulled from US Airways Flight 2846 has tested negative for TB .

"(CNN) -- Last week's rumor was the real deal: Google is rolling out a new Gmail inbox today which autosorts incoming messages so important stuff is easy to find and clutter stays out of the way. Wait: doesn't Gmail's Priority Inbox do that? Well, yes. But the new inbox (which you can choose to use if you're not using Priority Inbox) is a different take on the same general concept. Instead of attempting to figure out which messages matter most to you and then promoting them to the top of your inbox, the new one sticks tabs across the top â€” up to five of them, for ""Primary"" messages (basically, ones from real people, plus anything else you haven't chosen to weed out), Social (stuff like Facebook and Twitter updates), Promotions (ads), Updates (bills, notifications, etc.) and Forums (mailing lists and the like). Each tab indicates how many unread messages you've got in that category, so you can monitor incoming messages even if they don't pop up on your current tab. Conceptually, this is simpler than Priority Inbox, since Gmail is only trying to sort messages into general categories rather than figure out which people are more important to you than others. (I've been using the new version for a few days, and the sorting seems to work really well). And you need to proactively click around to other tabs to see less-important messages, so the Primary tab feels more streamlined than Priority Inbox's stacked-inboxes approach (the latter feels a tad cluttered, at least to me). Bottom line: the new inbox is an interesting option for folks who haven't warmed to Priority Inbox. Like, for instance, me â€” I admire Priority, but tend to use it for a bit, then turn it off, then try it again. The new inbox is rolling out to users over the coming weeks; it'll also be available in Gmail's Android and iOS apps. It's good to see a major new Gmail feature debut in both old-school and mobile Gmail at the same time â€” and for a while, at least, this is going to be the Gmail inbox I'll use. &copy 2012 TIME, Inc.

"Kenya (CNN) -- More than a month after Somali militants from Al-Shabaab massacred 67 people at a mall in Nairobi, a Kenyan rapid response team has now been deployed to the northeastern border of the country to secure the closed border crossing into neighboring Somalia. But official border crossings are far from the only routes into Somalia. Branching brazenly off from government roads are panya routes or ""rat routes"" -- paths hacked out of the undergrowth that are used by smugglers to cross back and forth between Kenya and Somalia undetected. They're certainly a smoother ride than the official roads -- and in spite of the Kenyan government's efforts to beef up border security after the Westgate Mall attack, we see no government presence as we cruise down the trail. Traveling on these smugglers' routes, we've managed to enter Somalia from Kenya without showing any ID, without going through any checkpoints, and without going through any kind of a security process. Nighttime is rush hour on the panya routes. People and goods are ferried back and forth, but everyone is too afraid to stop for long here, even to help the stranded families we see along the way. Many are escaping the uncertainty back home in Somalia, but some are seeking to enter Kenya undetected for other reasons. The panya routes end in Kenya at the world's largest refugee camp. Somali refugees have long fled to the Dadaab camp, and it is currently the target of the Kenyan government's post-Westgate ire. Hiding among refugees . Authorities believe that during the build-up to the Westgate siege, Al-Shabaab operatives traveled from Somalia through the panya routes and hid among the refugees in the camp in northeast Kenya. It's from there, Kenyan authorities say, that the operatives, hiding in plain sight, made their way through government checkpoints with other undocumented migrants and then deeper into Kenya. My colleague and I board one of the many buses carrying people from Dadaab to Nairobi and ask the conductor how much the fare is. Two tickets cost about $12, but the price skyrockets when we tell him we don't have legal documentation to be in Kenya. The conductor says $230 will buy us the use of fake Kenyan IDs and a safe trip. We don't need the IDs, but others on the bus do. ""Don't worry,"" he says. ""You're not alone."" We count out the cash and he hands us IDs from a stash he's been handing out on the bus. That's all it takes. As we arrive at Garissa, the main town in eastern Kenya, passengers line up at the checkpoint. Security officers scrutinize thumbprints with the help of a magnifying glass, comparing them against the fake IDs. We overhear one woman take a police officer aside and tell him bluntly she that doesn't have valid papers. Everyone, including the woman, is waved back on to the bus and on their way to the country's capital. I show my official documentation -- not the fake IDs we purchased -- and join them. Vetting challenges . Kenyan interior minister Ole Lenku acknowledges the challenge posed by police officers who willfully ignore obviously fake IDs for migrants, and says his department is committed to stamping out the problem. A new vetting process will remove corrupt officials from the system, according to Lenku. He says: ""People are noticing that there's a new requirement for service in terms of integrity and that those who will not meet that threshold will not be allowed into their service. ""The Kenya-Somali border is roughly 780 kilometers -- that's a very long border. It is a major security concern for us because the points of entry are far too many but definitely as a country we, with our defense forces in Somalia, one of the areas that they're supposed to look after is to take care of that border. What we are working on is a surveillance system using technology that will be able to show us what is happening in the entire borderline."" Repatriation deal . In the meantime, the Kenyan government has signed a voluntary repatriation agreement with Somalia and the U.N. that will provide support for Somalis who wish to return to their country. The goal is to reduce numbers at the Dadaab refugee camp, where Kenyan officials believe some security threats may originate. Lenku says: ""Remember, the process is voluntary, but again the United Nation High Commission for Refugees has confirmed that the areas [in Somalia] these people are relocating back to are safe. ""It's a win-win, taking away the heavy burden that came in terms of our security because criminals unfortunately have taken advantage of that hospitality to carry [out] criminal activities not only in the camps but to plan for them in the country."" But as long as the traffic continues to flow across the many rat routes on the border -- and when a fake identity is only one simple transaction away -- will repatriating a few Somali refugees be enough to protect Kenya?

"(CNN) -- A business jet crashed into a hangar at the Santa Monica Airport on Sunday. No one survived the crash and subsequent fire, but authorities did not immediately determine how many were on board. The twin-engine Cessna Citation ran off the right side of the runway after landing at 6:20 p.m. PT, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor. The hangar collapsed and was too unstable for firefighters to enter, said Captain John Nevandro of the Santa Monica Fire Department. ""It was an unsurvivable crash,"" Nevandro said. There was no communication with the pilot to indicate mechanical failure, Van McKenny, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, said Monday at a news conference. He added that the agency has not confirmed the number of people on the plane and that the county coroner will release that information. Charles Muttillo, vice president of Morley Builders of Santa Monica, issued a statement Monday saying the company's president and CEO and his son were believed to be on the plane. ""We are aware of a plane crash at Santa Monica Airport last night. While we do not have specific facts, we believe that our President and CEO, Mark Benjamin, and his son, Luke Benjamin, a Senior Project Engineer with us were on board,"" the statement read.

"(CNN) -- An anonymous tipper apparently is spreading holiday cheer in restaurants across the country, including leaving a $7,000 tip over the weekend in New York. The jolly gift-giver has even posted pictures of the receipts to an Instagram account, TipsForJesus, which says, ""Doing the Lord's work, one tip at a time."" The images go back to September, with the tip totals at more than $50,000. On Saturday, the anonymous tipper left a $1,000 tip on a $111 tab at Bo's Kitchen and Bar Room in New York. Manager Benjamin Cramer said the event certainly did happen but could not shed any light on the mystery tipper's identity. ""They seemed like perfectly normal clientele for our restaurant,"" Cramer told CNN. Earlier, at The NoMad restaurant in Manhattan's Flatiron District, the tipper left a $7,000 tip, though the restaurant manager declined to go into further detail. Back in October, the do-gooder left a $5,000 tip at a restaurant in Notre Dame, Indiana, and followed it up the next month with a $10,000 tip at a restaurant in Hollywood, California, according to managers at the two establishments. Various media outlets have reported that the generous donor may be former PayPal executive, Jack Selby, though you do not see the tipper in any of the Instagram images. CNN has not independently confirmed the tipper's identity. Valleywag.gawker.com posted what appears to be a screen grab of Selby's Facebook page from November 27: an image of Selby accompanied by a link he may have posted to a story about @TipsForJesus.

"(CNN) -- As you celebrate the holiday season, make time to see Alexander Payne's brilliant new film, ""Nebraska."" The movie is a riveting story, filmed in black and white, about an elderly man named Woody Grant (played by Bruce Dern) who takes a road trip with his youngest son, David (played by Will Forte). The two of them drive from Billings, Montana, to Lincoln, Nebraska. Woody, an alcoholic who has lived a hard life, is convinced that he has won a million dollars based on a letter from a company that sells magazine subscriptions. David tries to explain to his gruff father that the letter is simply a ploy to convince him to purchase subscriptions. The father is determined, and desperate, to claim the prize. With a kind heart, David ends up taking his dad on the trip to play out his dream. Throughout the film, viewers see a landscape that is visually beautiful and economically devastating. The two travel through towns that are aging and fading, where almost every character is struggling to make ends meet. Indeed, the fact that Woody is depending on this kind of letter to find fortune is in itself a devastating statement about what has become of the American dream. David, a struggling salesman in the audio and electronics business, at one point asks what his father would actually do with a million dollars. It turns out that all Woody really wants is a new truck and an air compressor. That's the limit of his aspirations. He can't even dream of anything more or of a better way to obtain it. The movie is a powerful statement about the economic challenges that face so many Americans who live in, or on the verge of, poverty. One of the greatest tragedies of the current political era is that neither party has been doing much to make things better. Like Woody, many Americans cling on for their economic lives, daring to dream based on the flimsiest of opportunities. While the American dream once revolved around making your way up through a union job, selling products to consumers or starting a small business, today for many Americans that dream has come down to hoping to win sweepstakes, contests that are doomed to disappoint almost everyone. In this context, it's remarkable that in recent years, many Republicans have actually threatened to make things more difficult in these communities. Besides the fact that the national GOP has not supported any kind of substantive policies to invest in certain regions to kick start economic growth, congressional Republicans have launched an all-out assault on the social safety net. The House GOP, for example, has pushed for a reduction in food stamps, one of the most important benefits upon which millions of Americans have depended since the 1960s. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin has called for a conservative War on Poverty that relies on private markets, voluntarism and vouchers to help the poor while he simultaneously promotes stringent budget cuts in nondefense spending that would weaken government support systems such as food stamps or the Earned Income Tax Credit. Republicans have pushed for major reductions in programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Many Republican governors are continuing to reject the expanded Medicaid funding in the Affordable Care Act, which would be hugely beneficial to the poor and working poor. There are many more Democrats who are clearly interested in using government to tackle some of the conditions with which the characters in ""Nebraska"" have to cope, though the actual programs they seek to put into place remain unclear (outside of the ACA, which is hugely significant). President Barack Obama delivered a speech last week on economic inequality, calling on politicians to do more to address the issue, which he characterized as the ""defining challenge of our time."" The president called on Congress to pass legislation strengthening unions, raising the minimum wage, reducing the gender pay gap and making college more affordable. But until now, there has been little movement during by the Obama White House to deal with these kinds of structural economic problems. Obama has also faced fierce opposition whenever he raises these issues. Many Democrats assume that tackling poverty is politically impossible today, so they invest more energy in programs that will win them votes in prosperous suburban communities. The nation can't afford to continue along this path. Fifty years ago next year, President Lyndon Johnson and the 88th Congress launched a War on Poverty that committed government funding and created an agency to help impoverished Americans become self-sufficient and restore their communities. For over a decade, the program had many beneficial effects and played a role in diminishing the number of people living under the worst economic conditions. A recent paper from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities showed how government supports created since the New Deal lift millions of Americans out of poverty. In 2011, the paper found, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit rescued 9.4 million people from the grasp of poverty. To be sure, the War on Poverty suffered from many shortcomings. The funding for the programs was always meager compared with the inflated promises that came from elected officials. Some of the programs created huge friction among Democrats as local politicians didn't like what community activists did with federal money that was out of their control. Conservatives have also railed against the unintended consequences of the programs, claiming they made recipients dependent on government. Regardless of the criticism, this was a period when the federal government tried to do something. Importantly, it was not just liberals who were behind these programs, but also conservatives such as Southern Democrat Phil Landrum of Georgia, who sponsored the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 in the House. The time has come to focus our attention on the issue of systematic poverty once again, to make sure that we move the nation on a path toward a better Christmas in Nebraska.

"(CNN) -- Social media posts Wednesday landed a Philadelphia teenager in jail after prosecutors accused him of using Twitter to reveal the names of witnesses in court cases. The case against Nasheen Anderson, 17, who was charged with witness intimidation and making terroristic threats, offers a glimpse into how the reach and power of social media could be used to derail criminal cases. ""The actions of this teenager could have lasting repercussions on untold cases here in Philadelphia,"" District Attorney Seth Williams said in a statement. Anderson is accused of posting information related to a 2012 shooting in Southwest Philadelphia on his Twitter account, according to Tasha Jamerson, a spokeswoman for the district attorney. Anderson also allegedly reposted information from a now-invalid Instagram account known as ""Rats215"" that listed photos and information about witnesses in Philadelphia criminal cases, according to police spokeswoman Tanya Little. The owner of the Instagram account is not known, but police were investigating its origin, Little said. Prosecutors will seek to try Anderson as an adult. ""Witness intimidation has reached near epidemic levels and we are very serious about not only stopping it, but also prosecuting the criminals who are engaging in these despicable actions to fullest extent of the law, "" Williams said in the statement. Anderson was being held at juvenile detention center, and a judge will rule in the coming weeks if he will be tried as an adult, Jamerson said. As of Wednesday afternoon, Anderson did not have an attorney, Jamerson said.","Teen's tweeting of crime witnesses' data could hurt cases, Philadelphia prosecutor says .

"(CNN) -- Winters can be depressingly long in Sweden but when it comes to sports played in those chillier months, curling usually isn't the first choice for youngsters in the Scandinavian nation. They would rather put on skates and dabble in ice hockey or go skiing, with the likes of Nicklas Lidstrom and Ingemar Stenmark providing ample inspiration. The country has also produced legendary tennis players, such as Bjorn Borg, and in Zlatan Ibrahimovic possesses one of football's biggest talents in recent decades. Niklas Edin is glad, though, that he chose curling -- even if it is less glamorous and lucrative. He has mostly overcome his fiery temper and a troubling back injury to make history and end Canada's dominance in a sport dubbed ""chess on ice."" And, at 28, he is part of a younger generation with big ambitions. For Edin, his teammates and Sweden, the timing is good since the Sochi Winter Olympics are a mere five months away. ""We're going into the biggest season of our careers and it's going to be huge playing the Olympics,"" Edin told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""We're one of the favorites to do good so it's definitely going to be a different season for us leading up towards that."" As the men's skip and team leader, Edin led Sweden to victory at the 2013 world championships in April. He not only beat Canada's Brad Jacobs -- another 28-year-old -- in the gold-medal game but did so on Canadian soil in Victoria. It snapped Canada's three-year stranglehold on men's gold at the world championships and gave Sweden its first men's title since 2004. Having also triumphed at the European championships last December in his hometown of Karlstad -- a small city located about 160 miles west of the Swedish capital Stockholm -- Edin became the first skip to achieve that double in the same season. No wonder Sweden is one of the favorites in Sochi. Edin has already visualized capturing gold at the Olympics. Far from being a sign of cockiness, it provides him with motivation. ""We know we can win and we truly believe in ourselves,"" he said. ""I think that's one of the main things you need to be able to do going into the Olympics -- if you want the medal, you need to be able to see yourself winning. ""It's always good to be the underdog and to not have anything to lose. It's easier that way. But now that we've come a bit further I think we'll like the situation even more where we're one of the favorites."" Edin decided to try curling after he watched the Swedish women win bronze at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Curling didn't run in the family, as his father is a farmer and his mother is a teacher who instead liked figure skating. ""I tried it in the local curling rink and I was struck right away,"" said Edin. The sport combines power with touch and strategy. Controlling the 20-kilogram stone while sliding isn't easy and placing it in a particular spot at the other end requires ample skill. Despite the indoor venues, the weather outside can affect conditions inside. ""You can go up to 90% of your maximum pulse when sweeping and during a game we have to do that multiple times throughout that three-hour game, so it can be really exhausting,"" said Edin. ""Then the tournaments are long, the days are long, so you need to be quite fit to be among the best. ""When you try it at first it's so slippery, it's way different than hockey and those sports. It's so tough to find your balance at first but then when you do that it's more about tactics and more about the skills. ""To be amongst the top-10 teams in the world, you definitely need to be good at chess to have a good strategy."" Once it was apparent that he had a special talent, Edin focused solely on curling and devoted all of his time to his new passion. A world junior title followed and at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, not far from Victoria in British Columbia, Sweden finished a respectable fourth under Edin. The team now plays about 20 tournaments a season, enough to make a living. And if Edin stands highest on the podium in Russia next February, his finances will likely improve further given the endorsement opportunities a gold medal brings. Sweden is the two-time defending champion among the women, but its men are seeking a maiden Olympic triumph. ""There's not a lot of money in this sport but you can still go full time if you're reaching towards the Olympics and you get funding from the Olympic association and stuff like that,"" said Edin. ""For us it's been full-time the last few years and building up to the Olympics."" Although Edin's rise has been quick, it hasn't been without struggles. He had back surgery in 2010 after being diagnosed with multiple herniated discs, and needed another operation after the problem flared up on the eve of the 2012 world championships in Switzerland. He shared skip duties with Sebastian Kraupp yet amid the turmoil Sweden grabbed bronze in a tense win over Scandinavian rival Norway. ""It's been a long struggle for the whole team and for (Edin) especially,"" Kraupp told reporters. Edin now says of the back issues: ""I'm feeling better."" His composure has gotten better, too, although it remains a work in progress. He openly admits to having acted like tennis bad boy John McEnroe in the past, losing his cool when things weren't going his way. ""Over the years I've calmed down quite a bit and try to be as good as I can towards all the people around me on the curling sheet or curling rink because I think it's in the interest of the sport -- like golf, where you show respect to one another,"" said Edin. ""Even if you want to win you don't want to show that disrespect to the other people around you so I try to calm myself down. But if we're losing in a bad way I definitely (have a) temper."" However, Edin doesn't often lose in a bad way nowadays.","Niklas Edin took up curling after watching Sweden take bronze at the 1998 Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Gareth Bale netted his first hat-trick for Real Madrid in a 4-0 win against Real Valladolid at the Bernabeu on Saturday. With Cristiano Ronaldo sitting out the game with a hamstring injury, the world-record signing took center stage as Real kept up the pressure on league leaders Barcelona. Bale popped up to score Real's first in the 33rd minute, nodding the ball home after goalkeeper Diego Marino had palmed the ball into the Welshman's path. Karim Benzema doubled the lead three minutes later with another header, before Bale netted twice in the second half. The first, a neat side-foot finish from 10 yards arrived in the 64th minute while the second came moments before the final whistle as Bale swept home his ninth goal in total for his new club following a cut-back from Marcelo. ""I think that his adaption period has finished as I said yesterday,"" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. ""He is a very important player for us, he is playing with confidence and he did very well today."" The win moves Real to within three points of Barcelona who travel to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. City rivals Atletico also continued their dogged pursuit of Gerardo Martino's side on Saturday with a 2-0 win at Elche. Second-half goals from Koke and Diego Costa earned Diego Simeone's men a valuable three points and moves them level with the Catalan club on 40 points. Koke broke the deadlock in the 63rd minute poking the ball home from close range before Costa doubled the lead 11 minutes later firing home his 18th goal of the season. In La Liga's other matches played Saturday, Celta Vigo earned a valuable 3-1 win over Almeria. The victory lifts Luis Enrique's side up to 14th ahead of Malaga who drew 1-1 with Villarreal on Friday. Almeria remains third from bottom with 12 points. An 88th minute own goal by Espanyol striker Christian Stuani gave Real Sociedad a 2-1 win and moves Jagoba Arrasate's side back into sixth spot. Jhon Cordoba had given Espanyol the lead in the 31st minute with Antoine Griezmann leveling the scores in the 69th minute before Stuani sliced an attempted clearance into his own net. Both Saturday fixtures in Serie A finished in 1-1 draws. Antonio Cassano scored for ninth-placed Parma after Panagiotis Kone had put Bologna ahead. Mid-table Torino went ahead in their match at Genoa thanks to an early goal from Omar El Kaddouri but Davide Biondini's second half strike ensured that the home side salvaged a point.

A passenger in Dunn's 2007 Porsche 911 GT3 was also killed, but investigators have not positively identified the body, according to the police report sent to CNN. The red-bearded Dunn, 34, was famous for his pranks and dangerous stunts on the show, which evolved into a successful film franchise. West Goshen, Pennsylvania, police were called to the wreck scene on State Route 322 at 2:30 a.m., the police report said. ""Upon arrival, police located one vehicle off the road and in the woods that was fully engulfed in flames,"" the report said. ""Speed may have been a contributing factor to the accident,"" police said, although the investigation is in its preliminary stages.

"(CNN)  -- You're having lunch with a friend when all of a sudden she pulls a gift out of her purse. ""Here!"" she says, gleefully, pushing the brightly-wrapped present in your direction. ""Merry Christmas!"" You plaster a smile on your face as your brain searches for the moment when the two of you went from see-each other-once-a-month friends to BFFs. Aren't the holidays stressful enough without having to buy gifts for people you hardly talk to? We've all been in a similar situation, whether it's a surprise White Elephant party or a co-worker's overzealous gift-giving spree. Honesty is often the best policy -- that gift is so NOT in the mail -- so we asked our etiquette experts for the best way to respond without lying through our teeth. Jodi Newbern, author of ""Regifting Revival: A Guide to Reusing Gifts Graciously"" This probably happens to almost everyone, every year. (The same goes for people that break the ""no gifts"" rule, and give you something anyway.) That's why it's always a good idea to have a few generic ""spares"" as back-up. Even better if they are already wrapped or in a gift bag ready to give! Of course, that is one of the main reasons why I am a big fan of the ""Regift Closet."" Otherwise, unless the gift giver expects a gift -- and wouldn't that kind of defy the real reason for giving a gift in the first place? -- there is nothing wrong with just being very thankful. Let the gift giver feel good about giving you a gift without getting something back. (After all, there is always their birthday to reciprocate!) Steven Petrow, author of ""Steven Petrow's Complete Gay & Lesbian Manners"" It bears saying directly: Giving a gift is a voluntary action. Just because someone gifts you doesn't mean you need to reciprocate. Ok, so do we all feel better now? Maybe not and here's why: When you get an unexpected trinket all wrapped up for the holidays, how can you not feel 1) cheap, 2) dumb, or 3) unprepared? I certainly used to before I learned to ""be prepared"" -- as the Boy Scouts like to say. Over the course of the year I've learned to stock the pantry with some bottles of wine (red and white), beeswax candles, a jar or two of gourmet jams and chutneys, and a gift box or two of artisan chocolates. Generic enough -- but useful for a wide range of friends and colleagues; we just have to be careful not to give the wine to anyone in AA or the chocolates to a diabetic. If, however, you're caught truly empty-handed, say as genuinely as you can: ""You know, I'm so far behind on my holiday chores. I'll get it to you next week."" And then, please do! Another good option -- and an option that does good -- is to plan to make a contribution to a favorite charity. If surprised by the unexpected gift, explain that you've made a contribution in their name to said non-profit. Just be sure to follow up within the week up with your donation and let the agency know that it's in honor of so and so and would they please acknowledge your gift to them. Anna Getty, author of ""I'm Dreaming of a Green Christmas"" I usually try to be honest and say, ""Wow, I totally forgot. I am so sorry I spaced but want to make it up to you somehow. How about dinner on me soon?"" I'm often met with a laugh and don't worry about it. Peggy Post, great-granddaughter-in-law of Emily Post . If you arrive at a party where there's a White Elephant gift exchange that you didn't know about, don't partake in the game. You can just say something like, ""Oh, I didn't get the message, I'm really sorry."" If everyone is giving a gift to the party host and you don't have one, send a thank-you gift afterward instead. Or if someone gives you a gift and you don't have one to give to them, say something like, ""You really shouldn't have."" Then be sure to graciously accept the gift and don't let your embarrassment overshadow the moment. Sherri Athay, author of ""Present Perfect: Unforgettable Gifts for Every Occasion"" First, thank the giver for the gift. Graciously express your pleasure -- even your genuine surprise -- at such a thoughtful gesture. The worst thing you can do is make the giver feel he or she has made you uncomfortable. Follow up with a sincere thank you note. If you feel so inclined, reciprocate with a gift at the next appropriate opportunity. By doing so, however, you could be entering into a long-term gift relationship -- be sure you're ready for such a commitment. From our readers . Share your missing gift dilemma advice, and it could end up here later today. Cometmom: As a teacher I am often the recipient of many thoughtful gifts and I can not possibly reciprocate. An idea for the many grateful parents giving their children's teachers gifts -- consider just a simple note to express your thankfulness. Erinissuper: I know if i buy a gift for someone it's because I think they would appreciate that specific item and I'd rather not receieve a last minute gift with no thought put into it from that person because they felt like they had to reciprocate. Reddyh: Instead of exchanging gifts, next year you all go out for an inexpensive lunch or dinner... or have a potluck in the lunchroom at work. Jabbes: I keep a few food, restaurant or gas gift cards on hand for these incidents, especially during the holidays.

"Boston (CNN) -- Convicted Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger displayed no emotion Wednesday as he heard one final time from the wives, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters of the people he killed, and those of others who were shot, stabbed or strangled by accomplices in the treacherous Winter Hill Gang. Bulger, 84, who faces life in prison at his sentencing Thursday morning, declined to address the court or the families. He did not make eye contact with them. During a final chapter in the life of a mobster whose rise and fall were as convoluted as any Hollywood script, the families of his victims described Bulger variously as a coward, a rat and even Satan in the emotional first day of his sentencing hearing. Steve Davis, fighting back tears and gasping for breath, struggled to address the court. His wife stepped up to help him utter the words that he said he had been holding inside for three decades. The judge asked him to take his time. ""This man has built up so much hate in my heart, I'd like to strangle him myself,"" said Davis, whose sister Debra was allegedly strangled by Bulger, her remains exhumed from a shallow grave. Debra Davis was the girlfriend of Bulger's partner, Steve ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi, who testified that Bulger killed her. The jury did not convict Bulger of the slaying. ""This son of b---- should look every one of his victims in the eye when they speak,"" he said. ""You piece of s---, look at me!"" Bulger looked up at the front of the courtroom, raising his hand from a pad he scribbled on and began to turn slowly. He shot a brief glance at the podium but then turned to look at the judge. Davis, weeping, did not notice. Bulger was convicted of racketeering, extortion and money-laundering in August after a rancorous two-month trial, with a federal jury linking him to 11 killings. Federal prosecutors urged District Judge Denise Casper to hand down a life sentence for the longtime fugitive, calling him one of the city's ""most violent and despicable criminals."" On Wednesday, Casper ruled -- despite the objections of Bulger's attorneys -- that the families of all 19 people killed by him or his associates would deliver victim impact statements. Asked by the judge at one point whether he has anything to say, Bulger -- in an orange jumpsuit and sneakers -- said no. Casper said she would hear all the victims and determine later which statements were relevant to the sentencing. Mostly, it was a day for the victims -- a procession of human suffering chronicling some of the darkest years of the city's history. Patricia Donahue recounted the life of her husband, Michael, a World War II vet and Boston cop. He was an innocent bystander shot by Bulger. She was shaky and teary but regained her composure when talking about her husband. ""He was always happy,"" she said. ""It drove me crazy."" At Bulger's trial, Donahue and her three sons often sat in the front row. When Bulger said he would not take the stand, Donahue yelled, ""coward!"" -- a word that was repeated by some at Wednesday's sentencing. She said of her late husband: ""He would cook a prime rib so well done you didn't know what you were eating... Michael was kind and thoughtful. He'd send me long-stem roses for birthdays and anniversaries. He'd also send them when he was in the dog house."" Bulger: The 25-million-dollar man? Bill O'Brien said he was born four days after his father, William O'Brien, was gunned down in a drive-by shooting on Boston's Morrissey Boulevard. His mother could not attend the funeral. According to trial testimony, Bulger was in one of the cars in the drive-by shooting. ""Every time I drive that boulevard I think of the horror that man went through,"" he said. ""Every time I pass the spot he was killed, I bless myself twice, seal it with a kiss and look up to him. One for him, one for me."" Sean McGonagle, the 49-year-old son of Paul McGonagle, who was killed in 1974, called the architect of the long reign of terror on the streets of Boston ""Satan."" The electric chair, he said, would be too good for him. ""In '75 you stooped to an all-time low when you called my house and said, 'Your father is not coming home for Christmas,'"" McGonagle said. He recalled that when he asked the caller who was on the phone, Bulger responded: ""This is Santa Claus."" ""My father was no Boy Scout,"" he said, ""but he was a better man than you will ever be."" Theresa Bond, the daughter of Arthur ""Bucky"" Barrett, who went missing in 1983 after a dispute with Bulger, politely asked, ""Mr. Bulger, could you please look at me?"" He never looked up. ""I just want you to know that I don't hate you,"" she said. ""I do hate the choices you made. ... I hate the choices our government has made that allowed you to rule streets."" Bond added, ""Hours before (my father) was murdered, he was praying, from what I understood, to a picture of a little girl. ... That was me. ... You will be summoned to the highest judge. A lethal injection would be too easy of a punishment."" She addressed him one more time. ""Mr. Bulger, do you have remorse for taking my father's life?"" The convicted killer did not look up. ""I think you do,"" she said. ""I forgive you."" In a November 7 sentencing memorandum, U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz wrote: ""Presiding over a massive criminal enterprise, Bulger extorted dozens of individuals, flooded South Boston with cocaine, shot innocent people, strangled women, murdered his competitors, corrupted FBI agents, and then ran away and hid for 16 years."" She added, ""There are no mitigating factors, and defendant Bulger has no redeeming qualities which would justify any sentence below the one called for by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the applicable case law and statutes."" Prosecutor: Whitey Bulger 'deserves no mercy,' should get life sentence . Bulger didn't testify at his trial, complaining the proceedings were ""a sham."" Bulger was captured in California in 2011, a decade and a half after skipping town ahead of a pending indictment. After he fled, investigators learned that the longtime head of South Boston's Winter Hill Gang had been an FBI informant and that Bulger's FBI handler had not only tipped him off to the charges, but also gave up another informant, who was later killed. Meanwhile, Bulger's brother William had risen from the family's blue-collar Irish neighborhood to become president of the state Senate and head of the University of Massachusetts. But in 2003, he was forced to resign the school's presidency after admitting to a congressional committee that he had spoken to his brother while Whitey was on the run, though he denied any knowledge of his whereabouts or alleged criminal activity. Whitey Bulger denied being an informant, even as he insisted that he'd had an immunity deal with the former head of the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force in New England. Prosecutors countered that with a 700-page file outlining how Bulger provided information on murders, drug deals, armed robberies and criminal fugitives that led to several arrests. The tale became the basis for the Oscar-winning film ""The Departed,"" which starred Jack Nicholson as a character modeled on Bulger. At the trial, Bulger snarled, hissed and scowled at prosecutors and witnesses. At one point, he and onetime enforcer Kevin Weeks shouted obscenities at each other when Weeks called Bulger a ""rat"" during his testimony. But Weeks told CNN after the verdict that the Bulger who sat at the defense table was a shadow of the underworld legend he'd once known. ""He wasn't the same guy I knew,"" Weeks said. ""I mean, he's a lot older, but he had no life in his eyes. He was subdued. He had changed. He just kind of lost his spark."" Their lives had one thing in common: 'Whitey' Bulger .

"(CNN) -- Two men were killed Friday in attacks on polio teams and their police escorts in Pakistan, authorities said. A policeman was killed and another injured when unidentified gunmen fired on a polio security team in Swabi, in northwest Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, District Police Officer Sajaad Khan told CNN. The officers were there to protect polio workers, who have come under increasing attack in the past year. The second victim, a polio worker, was shot dead by unknown men in Jamrud, in Pakistan's tribal Khyber Agency, a political administration official who asked not to be named told CNN. Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, who heads the Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, condemned the targeting of polio workers in a statement released by his party. Khan called on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's chief minister and the federal government to take ""strong action"" to arrest those responsible and to provide security for polio workers. The PTI party holds the majority of seats in the coalition running Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's provincial government. Militants have targeted anti-polio campaigns in Pakistan since U.S. intelligence officials used a fake vaccination program to help in their hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011. Under cover of the program, the CIA sought to collect DNA samples from relatives of the al Qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in Abbottabad. More than 20 polio workers have been killed since July 2012. Some mullahs have also preached against the polio campaign, claiming falsely that the oral vaccine leaves Pakistani children sterile. Last year, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continued its campaign of drone strikes. Pakistan stepped up its eradication efforts after cases spiked in 2011, but cases continue to be diagnosed. At least 16 cases of polio have been reported this year in Khyber Agency. Polio, which can cause permanent paralysis in hours, remains endemic only in Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. CNN's Saima Mohsin and journalist Zahir Shah Sherazi contributed to this report.","A policeman who was providing security to a polio team is killed, police say .

"Toronto (CNN) -- Toronto's City Council voted Friday to strip embattled Mayor Rob Ford of his ability to govern in an emergency and to appoint and dismiss committee chairs -- unprecedented moves aimed at reining in the controversial politician. Despite admitting last week that he had smoked crack cocaine in a ""drunken stupor"" about a year ago, Ford has defiantly said he will not leave his job and vowed to challenge the actions in court. ""Obviously, I can't support this,"" Ford told council members, warning that the legal fight will cost taxpayers ""an arm and a leg."" But, he added: ""I perfectly understand where they're coming from. ... I would have supported what they're doing. I want to move on. I'm not mad at anybody."" The City Council meeting reflected the tragicomedic state of municipal affairs in Toronto, where police have investigated the mayor for smoking crack cocaine and other indiscretions. Some council members compared the move to strip Ford of his duties to a coup d'etat. Councillor Anthony Perruzza said he understood the need to bring stability to the city but called Friday's action a ""dangerous precedent."" ""If you win an election for mayor, you are the mayor,"" he said. ""That is the people's will. ... I don't want to use the word coup d'etat. That would be over the top."" The council chambers erupted with laughter. The mayor's brother, Councilor Doug Ford, chastised fellow council members, saying they didn't have the ""moral or legal authority"" to strip an elected official of his responsibilities. ""It's not up to you folks to make this decision,"" he said, ""it's up to the people."" Doug Ford repeated that statement Friday night on CNN, adding that the media had been unfair to his brother, because Rob Ford represented blue-collar workers of Toronto. ""He's admitted to his faults, and I just wish other politicians would come clean like Rob Ford has,"" Doug Ford told AC360. He insisted that his brother did not have a drug problem. ""I want to be very clear here. Rob doesn't come to work and drink and he doesn't drink every single day. "" Ford said. ""But he does admit that he has excess of drinking at times and he's getting the medical support from a team of doctors and he's also gone on a pretty steady diet and exercise program. So we're confident that he's going to move forward."" Council actions ""warranted and necessary"" Councillor John Filion said the actions were being taken ""reluctantly"" but they ""sadly are both warranted and necessary."" The first of two motions, approved by a 39-3 vote, took away Rob Ford's ability to appoint and dismiss committee chairs, giving him less control over policy. In the past, the influential chairs followed the mayor's orders for fear of losing their posts. The second motion, stripping Ford's power during an emergency, was approved 41-2 and is seen as largely symbolic since emergency response decisions are made collectively by the council. Filion said the city was fortunate Ford had not been impaired during a crisis. ""Council delegated those powers and council has the ability to take those powers away,"" City Solicitor Anna Kinastowski said at one point in the meeting. Moments before the final vote, Ford said: ""I would've supported what they're doing"" if another mayor did what he did, ""but since it's me, I have to support myself."" The meeting Friday could lead to more Monday, when the council says it expects to consider a motion to delegate duties not assigned by statute to the mayor. If approved, the motion would strip Ford of most of his duties. Among other things, the motion calls for reallocating the operating budget of the office of the mayor to the city clerk, according the council's agenda published online. 'Today I acted on complete impulse' While fighting for his job Thursday, Ford added to his growing list of missteps. Early in the day, a scrum of reporters approached Ford to ask him about new allegations of drunkenness, drug use and the verbal and physical abuse of aides. In the course of answering, he denied a female staffer's allegation that he sought to perform oral sex with graphic language of his own, stunning reporters. Later in the day, he backtracked. With his wife at his side, he went back before reporters to say he had been under ""tremendous, tremendous stress"" and was getting unspecified support from ""a team of health care professionals."" But he called the latest allegations ""100% lies."" ""When you attack my integrity as a father and as a husband, I see red. Today I acted on complete impulse in my remarks,"" Ford said. He took no questions from reporters, who shouted sharp inquiries at him as he entered the office. ""Mayor Ford, why should we believe you? Why would you subject your family to this?"" one asked. ""What's the matter with you, Mr. Mayor?"" another said. Leave of absence? The Toronto City Council voted 37-5 on Wednesday to ask Ford to take a leave of absence, and most members turned their backs on him when he addressed their Thursday meeting. Even Doug Ford, who has been his brother's fiercest defender, conceded on CNN that his brother should take a couple of weeks off, to ""let things cool down a bit."" TV show starts Monday . In another development, Canada's Sun News Network announced that the Ford brothers will begin hosting their own TV show on Monday. The show, ""Ford Nation,"" picks up where the two brothers left off on a talk radio show that ended its run last week, the network said on its website. A headline on that site posed the question, ""Canada's Ultimate Reality Show?"" And it quoted Doug Ford saying, ""Rob is like Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh"" and ""You just never know what he is going to say."" ""Mayor Ford seems to be in a no-holds-barred mode,"" the network said. ""There is no filter. There is no careful treading."" Critics of Sun News Network have described its conservatism as ""Fox News North,"" according to a story about its launch in 2011 by the Toronto Globe and Mail. Locals: Why Rob Ford 'has got to go' Ford threatens legal action . The mayor recently confessed to purchasing illegal drugs in the past two years, while he was in office. But he has steadfastly refused to step down, saying the voters of Canada's largest city should decide his fate in 2014. The latest allegations surfaced Wednesday in more than 500 pages of court documents that police used to get a search warrant for Alexander Lisi, Ford's friend and occasional driver, whom police accuse of marijuana possession and trafficking. Ford responded Thursday morning by threatening legal action against former staffers who claimed the mayor brought a woman appearing to be an escort to his office and drank alcohol while driving. The documents include police interviews with former staff members, information obtained from surveillance crews and cameras, and even an examination of the mayor's garbage. Several staffers said they were asked to buy alcohol for the mayor of Canada's largest city. One incident described by a former staffer alleged that Ford, while driving, stopped the vehicle, guzzled some vodka, and drove on. The allegations have not been substantiated by investigators, and Ford faces no criminal charges. He called the allegations ""outright lies."" On Thursday, Ford also said the so-called ""escort"" wasn't a prostitute, but a family friend. He added that such allegations ""hurt my wife."" ""It makes me sick,"" he added. ""I've had enough.""

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- All around the world this weekend, Christians are celebrating Easter. For them, this holiest of days announces that death does not have the final word and that eternal life awaits those who would just believe. Sunday also marks the anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s death. Forty-two years ago, an assassin's bullet took his life as he struggled to secure the promises of American democracy for the children of slaves. His sacrifice, along with countless others, helped usher in a new chapter in American life -- one that prepared the way for the election of our nation's first African-American president. Every now and again, the convergence of significant historical moments occasions a time for serious reflection. How might we think about the significance of the resurrection of Jesus and the martyrdom of Martin Luther King, Jr. to the lives we currently live as Americans? What lessons does Easter hold for us? And what does remembering King's death teach us? On April 27, 1957, Dr. King delivered an Easter sermon titled, ""Questions that Easter Answers."" For him, Easter settled the mystery of death and secured for us the importance of living a life in light of those forces that go beyond our physical experience. We are not simply biological processes. Instead, King argued, Easter cries out to us about the importance of the unseen and of the personality, those ""spiritual forces that are eternal and not merely these material things that we look about and see."" We matter. Our hopes and aspirations, our joys and triumphs matter. Not because of something we have actually done, but rather, because of an inheritance borne on a cross on Calvary. King understood Easter's answer to the significance of human action in the world. ""There is a faith, there is love, there is hope, there is something beyond the external that will stand through the ages."" This view holds off the notion that life has no meaning or is doomed to end in shipwreck. The fact that so many have lost their jobs, their homes, their dreams in these difficult times confirms for us that life carries with it a 'Good Friday' experience -- that darkness and disappointment can be constant companions. ""But thank God the crucifixion was not the last act in that great and powerful drama,"" King preached. ""There is another act. And it is something that we sing out and cry and ring out today. Thank God a day came when Good Friday had to pass."" For King, Easter teaches us that death does not have the last word; that invisible forces are more real than the shadows that we currently inhabit; and that the darkness of Good Friday may be necessary but will eventually pass away. Easter ultimately demonstrates that ""love is the most powerful force in the universe,"" said King. And this insight reaches beyond Christians to all of us, no matter what we believe. Here, love isn't some sentimental notion; instead, it involves risks, daring and growth -- a surrender to that feature of human personality that can cause us to sacrifice our lives in defense of it. Love conquers cowardice. It shatters hubris and crushes the illusions of death. It fortifies the soul amid the darkness of the hour; it calls us to bear witness and to suffer, if necessary, the consequences. The mindless chatter of today distracts us from the power of love. Instead, we are mired in the sundry politics of Washington, or we are content to spew venom at our opponents. Mean-spiritedness carries the day. But Easter, if I understand King correctly, teaches us to love and to witness the miracle of the resurrection before the powers that be, no matter the consequences. ""It says to us,"" King preached, ""that love is the most durable power in the world"" and is stronger ""than all of the military giants, all of the nations that base their way on military power."" Such a conviction led him on April 4, 1967, a year before he was killed, to condemn the Vietnam War and to say that America was ""the greatest purveyor of violence in the world."" The fact that Easter falls this year on the anniversary of Dr. King's death highlights the true lesson of this holiest of days. We are not to sit idly by because Easter proclaims the victory. Too many Christians take comfort in the wrong-headed idea that all is settled because Jesus rose from the dead. Martin Luther King, Jr's death suggests otherwise. His was a life given in love and in devotion to justice. Are we, Christian or not, as committed? To stopping war? To ending poverty? To fighting for the most vulnerable among us? Or, are we content to rest in the illusion that salvation is guaranteed? Our lives, if we are to be saved, must stand as a testament to that legacy which, beyond our doing, is inescapable. Cowardice and complicity must die in us. And we must rise again to ""love"" a new world into existence. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eddie S. Glaude.","The anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s death coincides this year with Easter .

"(CNN) -- He didn't die with Wendy on the streets, but Bruce Springsteen's career needed some life. It was early 1974, and Springsteen had enjoyed critical acclaim but little commercial success with two albums the previous year, ""Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J."" and ""The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle."" He wasn't the rock icon he'd soon become. He needed a hit. So the 26-year-old sat down at his Long Branch, New Jersey, home on 7Â½ West End Court -- the same house where he would also write ""Thunder Road"" and ""Backstreets"" -- and he began scribbling lyrics on a sheet of ruled paper from a spiral notebook. ""This town'll rip the (out your) bones from your back / it's a suicide trap (rap) (it's a trap to catch the young) your dead unless / you get out (we got to) while your young so (come on! / with) take my hand cause tramps / like us baby we were born to run."" On December 5, almost 40 years later, the handwritten genesis of one of The Boss' biggest hits -- and one of rock 'n' roll's most well-known songs -- will be auctioned off to the highest bidder. Sotheby's New York expects the manuscript, which features 30 lines and marginal notations scrawled in blue ink, to fetch between $70,000 and $100,000. ""Born to Run"" reached only No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100, but it aged incredibly well, earning the No. 21 spot on Rolling Stone magazine's list of all-time greatest songs and being named among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 songs that shaped the genre. Springsteen explained the song's birth in a statement from Sotheby's. ""One day I was playing my guitar on the edge of the bed, working on some song ideas, and the words 'born to run' came to me. At first I thought it was the name of a movie or something I'd seen on a car spinning around the circuit. I liked the phrase because it suggested a cinematic drama that I thought would work with the music that I'd been hearing in my head."" An AllMusic review described the tune as a ""celebration of the rock & roll spirit, capturing the music's youthful abandon, delirious passion and extraordinary promise with cinematic exhilaration."" ""A blue-collar fairy tale evoking Phil Spector in its romanticized grandeur and Bob Dylan in its street-corner poetic grit, critic Greil Marcus once described it as 'a '57 Chevy running on melted-down Crystals records,'"" the review states. ""'Born to Run' is teen melodrama in excelsis, overblown and histrionic in ways Spector never imagined; it smacks of the kind of palpable, life-or-death desperation which threads its way through everything from 'Romeo and Juliet' to 'Rebel Without a Cause,' where every action, every thought and every word bears the complete weight of the world."" The 1975 track became Springsteen's first worldwide release, and while Sotheby's says many of the original lyrics never made it to the recording booth, the chorus was ""nearly perfected"" in the handwritten manuscript. ""Ultimately, the song took six months to finalize and clocks in at four and a half minutes long. Springsteen aimed for musical perfection and Spector-level grandeur which he undoubtedly achieved,"" a Sotheby's news release says. The manuscript, which was once part of record producer Mike Appel's personal collection, will be on public view beginning Saturday, according to Sotheby's. Appel is credited with discovering Springsteen, and he produced The Boss' first three albums.","Sotheby's New York expects handwritten lyrics to fetch $70,000 to $100,000 at auction .

"(CNN) -- It's a mind-boggling surprise in whodunit mysteries and soap operas, but a soldier in Colorado is using the dramatic ploy for real in a criminal courtroom: his ""evil twin"" may be responsible for the sex crimes against girls that he's now accused of. The soldier's defense rests partly on the fact he and his identical twin brother have virtually the same DNA, an attempt to undercut authorities' allegations that the DNA from the crime scenes belongs to the soldier. The defendant, Aaron Gregory Lucas, 32, is also a suspect in sex crimes in two other states, authorities say. In addition to raising his twin brother as a suspect, Lucas also claims that a third man may be the culprit in some of the crimes, court papers say. A Colorado judge in El Paso County ruled last week that Lucas will be allowed to name his twin brother, Brian Lucas, as a suspect in his defense. The judge also allowed the defense attorneys to use the name of a third man as a suspect, too. The twin brother, who hasn't been charged in the any of the crimes, could not be reached by CNN for comment. So-called ""evil twin"" defenses have been used before in courtrooms, experts say. Defendants with an identical twin have sometimes accused the sibling as the real culprit to try to create reasonable doubt and seek acquittal, but the finger-pointing isn't a sure-fire strategy, said CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos, who's also a criminal defense attorney. ""No two of us have the same set of DNA -- with one exception and that is identical twins,"" Cevallos said. ""Cases like this are interesting,"" he added. ""Each twin essentially has to come up with an alibi, and we're seeing that in this case and seeing it in other cases. It comes down to whose alibi is a little bit better. You can imagine the complexity if both twins are in the same geographic area at the same time of the crime."" In fact, both Lucas brothers lived in Alabama and Texas, where the other sexual assaults occurred, but authorities in Alabama, Texas and Colorado say Aaron Lucas is the focus of their investigations, Colorado prosecutors said. Brian Lucas has been to Colorado only once in the past decade and didn't visit El Paso County, according to the Colorado Springs Gazette, citing a police detective's testimony last week. Aaron Lucas, a decorated Army officer assigned to Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, is accused of trying to lure 11 girls between ages 6 and 9 and sexually assaulting three of them, authorities said. In all, Aaron Lucas faces 27 charges in six cases, officials said. Prosecutors want all the cases to be heard together, but defense attorneys do not. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday to address the prosecution's request. The 27 charges include two counts of second-degree kidnapping with a sex offense on a child; one count of kidnapping with enticement of a child; two counts of aggravated sexual assault on a child; four counts of attempted sexual assault on a child; one count of sexual assault on a child; and other charges. Aaron Lucas is also charged with being a fugitive from justice in the Alabama and Texas cases. The Colorado crimes occurred in Fountain, Colorado Springs and unincorporated El Paso County from summer 2010 until late 2012, when Aaron Lucas was arrested, CNN affiliate KKTV reported last year. The Colorado crimes began at the same time that Aaron Lucas was first stationed at Fort Carson, the affiliate reported. Both of the Texas and Alabama cases ""involve DNA evidence that the prosecution states matches the DNA of Aaron Lucas,"" defense attorneys said in court papers. When Aaron Lucas was arrested last year, Colorado authorities took his DNA and ran the findings in a national law enforcement database, said police in Madison, Alabama, and Texarkana, Texas. His DNA matched samples found in unsolved sex crimes in those jurisdictions, police said. But Aaron Lucas offers a different interpretation of those findings. ""Aaron Lucas has an identical twin brother, Brian Lucas, who has (a) similar DNA profile,"" Aaron Lucas' attorneys said in court documents. ""Additionally, witness statements from the Alabama case describe a vehicle matching that of Brian Lucas being in the area of the attack prior to the assault. ""The defense believes that Mr. Brian Lucas contributed the DNA in the Alabama and Texas cases and that it is his DNA that was found during those crimes, not Aaron Lucas's."" Aaron Lucas also argues that some of the Colorado Springs sex crimes may have been committed by a man who had been arrested for indecent exposure, defense attorneys said in court papers. That man, whose name is listed in court papers, also ""bears a striking resemblance to the descriptions provided by several of the complaining witnesses (and) owned and drove vehicles matching the descriptions of the vehicles driven by the alleged perpetrator,"" the attorneys said. Aaron Lucas's attorneys said it is unclear whether the twin brother will be compelled to appear during the trial, expected to begin in January.","Aaron Lucas is charged with trying to lure 11 girls and sexually assaulting three of them .

"(CNN) -- One of the many characters Peter O'Toole played on-screen insisted that he wasn't an actor but a movie star. We knew better. The real O'Toole, who died Saturday in London at 81, was triumphantly a great actor and a great screen idol. He played a variety of roles, from meek (1969's ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"") to bombastic (1968's ""The Lion in Winter""). In the process, he yielded a body of work that, taken together, was likely more varied than any actor of the prodigious, mostly hell-raising generation of male actors that emerged as screen icons mid-20th century. (In terms of variety, only Michael Caine challenges O'Toole, but not Richard Burton, Richard Harris or Sean Connery.) Here are five of his best movies, in my view, and the ones most representative of his life's work. What's your own list? It's through this ongoing evaluation that artists such as O'Toole live on: . 1. ""The Stunt Man"" (1980) As the imperious moviemaker Eli Cross, O'Toole is a loose cannon: manipulative, abusive, self-centered -- but nowhere near as wicked as he should be. The reason this leads my list of O'Toole's best performances is that it encompasses just about everything about him that was inimitable: Feline physical grace, a musician's timing, a writer's instinct for nuance, bravura rhetorical flourishes and a boundless capacity to keep his audiences off-balance even when he's not speaking or moving. 2. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) It wasn't his first movie role. (That came in 1960's ""Kidnapped."") It just seems that way. Fifty-one years have passed since David Lean's desert epic was released and O'Toole's dominant, star-making performance as the flamboyant T. E. Lawrence remains among the most galvanic big-screen breakthroughs in movie history. It also set in motion the dispiriting pattern of O'Toole being nominated for the best actor Oscar and losing. Gregory Peck was a nice man and his Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was an even nicer man. But in retrospect, they shouldn't have won the Oscar that, in retrospect, had O'Toole's name all over it. They needed to get it right the first time. Instead, they denied him six more times, even for his performance as a dying actor in 2006's ""Venus,"" which came three years after he received a lifetime achievement Oscar. 3. ""My Favorite Year"" (1982) O'Toole's portrayal of Alan Swann, aging movie swashbuckler who's not so devil-may-care when it comes to the demands of 1950s live TV, may well have been his most widely beloved role. His boisterous physical comedy fits the raucous surrounds like an old shoe (with a hole in the sole.) His Swann also has melancholy moments, but he always keeps the characterand the movie from going to the maudlin zone. 4. ""The Ruling Class"" (1972) By this time in his career, O'Toole had assembled a curriculum vitae that included at least two overwrought English kings (1964's ""Becket"" and 1968's ""The Lion in Winter""), two self-tortured adventurers (1962's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and 1965's ""Lord Jim""), a manic Lothario (1965's ""What's New Pussycat"") and Don Quixote (1972's ""Man of La Mancha""). This dark comedy's lead character, Lord Jack Arnold Alexander Tancred Gurney, seems a barking-mad composite of these personalities. At the beginning, Jack's a shaggy, blithe species of maniac who's been called to his family estate to do whatever's expected of a well-heeled nobleman. Problem is, he's convinced that he is God. Why? ""Simple. When I pray to Him, I find I am talking to myself."" This brand of crazy is far more blissful than the malevolent kind that takes over the 14th Earl of Gurney when his hair is cut and his demeanor made more ""respectable"" to his peers. The movie is a tad overlong and may leave you with an acrid aftertaste. But O'Toole bowls you over with the effortless way he enchants you at one end of the movie and frightens you at the other. 5. ""Lassie"" (2005) In the late autumn of his career, O'Toole eased into being more character actor than movie star and infused even the most offhand role (e.g. the voice of snooty restaurant critic Anton Ego in Pixar's 2007's ""Ratatouille"") with immaculate polish and unassuming mastery. My own favorite from this period comes in this latest adaptation of the Eric Knight children's classic, ""Lassie Come Home,"" in which O'Toole plays the gruff Duke of Radling, who's forbidding on the outside but keeps the fuzzy kindness deep within the tempered steel. Often, it's in the miniature parts rather than the major ones that you see where real poetry can come from. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Peter O'Toole was an outstanding actor and a movie star, writes Gene Seymour .
He showed his versatility in everything from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" to ""My Favorite Year""

"(CNN) -- Authorities struggled to explain how a small plane crashed at an international airport, erupted in fire, but evidently went unnoticed for hours. The incident occurred early Tuesday in Nashville. But exactly what time remains a mystery. The single-engine Cessna registered to the Windsor Flying Club in Ontario, Canada, evidently crashed sometime after 3 a.m. local time, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. But it wasn't noticed until well after sunrise when another plane taxiing for take-off saw an engine cover on the edge of runway 2C -- the middle of three parallel runways. Controllers contacted airport personnel, who found the fire-scarred wreckage. The plane's sole occupant was dead, officials said. The airport's control tower is staffed 24 hours a day, the Federal Aviation Administration told CNN. But it was not immediately clear how many controllers were in the tower during the overnight shift. An FAA spokesman said there was low visibility overnight and fog. Another FAA spokesman said it was not known whether the plane had been in contact with controllers, or if it had made a distress call. The agency declined to answer questions, saying the matter was under investigation. Airport spokeswoman Shannon Sumrall referred all questions to the NTSB.

"(CNN) -- A 16-year-old suffered a medical emergency on a Delta Air Lines cross-country flight, and died after the flight made an emergency landing in Spokane, Washington, authorities said Saturday. Jim Uttke, deputy medical investigator for the Spokane Medical Examiner, said it appeared the youth died of natural causes. An autopsy will be performed Monday. His name was not released. The youth was the son of a soldier from the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade of the 7th Infantry Division out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord at Fort Lewis, Washington, a U.S. military official said. The youth was traveling with mother to join his father who'd gone ahead to a new base, the official said. The Spokane Fire Department said on its Facebook page that the youth was part of a military family flying to Atlanta for Christmas. Delta Flight 128 was bound for Atlanta from Seattle on Saturday and was diverted to Spokane after a medical emergency, Delta spokesman Michael Thomas said. Thomas said the plane carrying 258 passengers was scheduled to land in Atlanta at 4 p.m. ET Saturday.

"Washington (CNN) -- (CNN) -- The words ""budget"" and ""compromise"" haven't been connected in Congress in recent years. But legislators stunned observers and perhaps each other this week when Republicans and Democrats proved that they can, indeed, agree on government spending. Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray worked out a budget framework to fund the government into 2015. The House approved the compromise agreement Thursday. The measure now goes to the Senate, where it is expected to pass as early as next week. The White House supports the proposal. It was the first full budget agreement by a divided Congress -- in which different parties control the House and Senate -- since 1986, Ryan boasted in announcing the deal. After years of bruising political fights over spending and the federal borrowing limit, dysfunction reigned supreme in October when the government shut down for 16 days. A short-term spending plan got it going again, but a CNN/ORC International poll found that 71% of Americans thought another shutdown would occur when the money ran out in January. Instead, such repeated budget brinksmanship would be put on hold if Congress passes the Ryan-Murray proposal. While neither side loves the compromise legislation, it appears to be on a path to approval. So, what changed this time? Republican leaders stood up . For two years, the most conservative members of the Republican Party, with the help of outside conservative groups, have been driving the agenda in the GOP-led House. House Speaker John Boehner endured humiliating leadership lapses when he was unable to corral sufficient votes from his majority caucus for legislation and agreements opposed by the tea party wing. The government shutdown in October was apparently the last straw. Led by tea party conservatives, Republicans forced a showdown over their demand to dismantle Obamacare. When Democrats balked, the public blamed the GOP for the dysfunction. Plummeting poll numbers emboldened Boehner and other establishment Republicans to assert their leadership this time by defying conservative opposition to the budget agreement. In particular, Boehner has blamed outside conservative groups that exert influence on Republican politics for pushing GOP legislators into the politically disastrous government shutdown in October. ""The day before the government re-opened, one of these groups stood up and said 'well, we never really thought it would work,'"" he told reporters Thursday before animatedly asking: ""Are you kidding me?"" At the same time, Boehner and other GOP leaders want to keep the political focus on problems with Obamacare, such as the botched launch of the HealthCare.gov website and policy cancellations despite President Barack Obama's promise that people could keep coverage they liked. Rep. Paul Ryan: From Republican VP candidate to fiscal deal maker . In defense of defense . In general, members of Congress hated the untargeted forced spending cuts known as sequestration from a 2011 agreement, albeit for different reasons. Democrats disliked the indiscriminate nature of the dramatic spending reductions, with priorities such as education and social programs targeted equally with other less-valued categories. Republicans, meanwhile, opposed the deep cuts to military spending that top generals said weakened America's defense readiness. The budget deal would eliminate $45 billion worth of sequester cuts set to hit in January, as well as another $18 billion scheduled for 2015. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel praised the agreement Thursday, saying it provided certainty for military planning. ""This agreement does not solve all (Department of Defense) budget problems but it helps address readiness especially in 2014 with putting more money back in training, in particular, and procurement,"" said Hagel, a former Republican senator. ""It also gives us some new certainty, predictability for our planning, for our budgeting over the next two years which is particularly important,"" he added. No one likes Congress . Years of dysfunction have really torpedoed the public's view of Congress. After the October government shutdown, a CNN/ORC International poll showed only 14% of respondents expressed satisfaction with how the government was operating. By comparison, 26% of people were dissatisfied with the government during the Watergate scandal. Congress was under pressure from the public as well as the business community, including the influential Chamber of Commerce, which warned that another manufactured government crisis would harm the economy. Perhaps lawmakers are sick of being the least popular kids in town. Pat Murray emerges as bipartisan figure after budget deal . Democrats don't want to be blamed . Republicans got the most blame for the October shutdown, and Democrats want to make that a permanent association in the mind of the public. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told CNN on Thursday that the anti-government tea party wing had sullied the GOP brand. ""In many ways, those people have hijacked the name Republican, which has been such a valuable contribution to our country, the Republican Party,"" the California Democrat said. ""But they've taken it over the cliff."" With congressional elections coming up next year, Democrats want to ensure that voters think of Republicans whenever the word shutdown comes up. Agreeing to the budget plan avoids the possibility of another shutdown until at least 2015, preserving the negative connotation for Republicans through the next election cycle. Certainty at last . Actually passing a formal budget for the first time in several years benefits everyone. Congress returns to what leaders call ""regular order"" on the budget, meaning spending proposals are debated and passed instead of the practice in recent years of merely authorizing spending at previous levels. Bureaucrats can develop strategies and plans based on known figures, rather than wallowing in uncertainty over how much money the bickering legislators finally would authorize. Legislators up for re-election next year can campaign on their political and fiscal philosophies and accomplishments -- such as passing a budget -- instead of engaging in spending showdowns that anger voters and hinder economic growth. ""I came here to cut the size of government. That's exactly what this bill does,"" Boehner said Thursday of the budget deal. Meanwhile, Pelosi made sure to point out that passing the budget agreement would require Democratic votes because too many Republicans oppose it for the majority party to push it through on its own. ""They haven't passed anything with their own votes that was any good for the country,"" she said. Opinion: A budget deal that's bad for America . CNN's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","For the first time in years, leaders agree on a full budget plan .
Republicans want to avoid another government shutdown and focus on Obamacare .
Democrats can still brand Republicans as the shutdown party due to October .
Bureaucrats, politicians and the economy benefit from the funding certainty ."
"(CNN) -- There's hate. Then there's trying to heap shame on your foe. On the eve of this weekend's bevy of college football rivalry games, fans of the Alabama Crimson Tide gleefully registered their contempt for the Auburn Tigers at #ThingsILikeMoreThanAuburn. Like getting a root canal without a painkiller. Or standing on a fire ant mound while barefoot. The Auburn faithful, who are hosting this year's Iron Bowl and have their own national championship dreams, had their say at #BamaHateWeek on Twitter: . ""What has 2 teeth and is 100 yards long? The front row at a Alabama home game."" Such is the stuff of rivalries, many of which go back to the closing decades of the 19th century. The 7-4 Michigan Wolverines and the undefeated Ohio State Buckeyes, which first clashed in 1897, will meet up again Saturday. On Friday, Ohio Gov. John Kasich issued a ""Scarlet Letter Saturday"" resolution, trying to bring shame to his state's neighbor to the north. He encouraged all Ohioans to refrain from using the letter ""M."" The letter was scratched over throughout the declaration. Reaction on the Twittersphere was i(m)(m)ediate, if not entirely supportive. ""Does that mean the(ir) head coach is Urban Eyer?,"" asked Patontheback17, referring to the Buckeyes' head coach. ""So stupid."" Among the other rivalries playing out Saturday are Florida-Florida State, Arizona-Arizona State, USC-UCLA and Clemson-South Carolina. The Oregon Ducks edged the Oregon State Beavers 36-35 on Friday night in their series dubbed the ""Civil War."" The Georgia Bulldogs travel to Atlanta to play Georgia Tech in the rivalry dubbed ""Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate."" Georgia Tech alum Jessica Keesee says the home tailgating experience for Yellow Jackets fans is more upscale outdoor luncheon than gigantic parking-lot party. Pennants, a tent, Georgia Tech logo camping chairs, a grill, tables covered with tablecloths and a classy spread of food are the staples of Keesee's tailgate. Taking tailgating beyond BBQ and beer . She couldn't hold back a dig at her school's rival, the University of Georgia. ""I would expect a trashy tailgate at a UGA game,"" she said. Bulldog fans talked trash of their own. ""Who has a yellow jacket as a mascot? Like what's up with that?"" read one tweet on #WeRunThisState. Another Georgia fan wrote: ""My dad's response on why we aren't going to the game tomorrow -- 'I don't want nerd to rub off on me.""' Of course, pranks can make for great stories passed on over the years. In 1958, UCLA students tried to drop 500 pounds of manure on USC statue Tommy Trojan and students protecting him.

"Washington (CNN) -- Members of Congress are quick to say they support the troops and veterans, but the number of elected officials who have served has plummeted to its lowest point since World War II. Only 20% of the 535 members of the new Congress have served in the military, 25 from the Senate and 90 from the House of Representatives. Juxtapose that with 1975, when over 70% of those elected had served in the armed forces. Pre-World War II data on veterans serving is difficult to find, according to the Senate Historical Office. With the nation currently facing two wars, one group worries about the effects the dwindling numbers may have on defense decisions. ""It's not always that veterans care more about defense issues, but those politicians who have served in the military understand to a much greater degree what they are voting on,"" said Seth Lynn, executive director of Veterans Campaign, a group that trains veterans to run for public office. ""Having members in Congress with military experience is crucial to effective civilian control of the military,"" Lynn added. Today, some of the most prominent voices on military, foreign affairs and veterans issues are themselves veterans. Among them are Vietnam vets Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who was a prisoner of war for more than five years; Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts; and Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, is currently in the National Guard and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, is in the Air Force Reserves. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, is a veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Despite the continuous drop in the number of veterans elected to Congress, funding for veterans' issues have not taken a hit. The Veterans Affairs budget went up 16% in 2010, the largest single-year increase in over 30 years according to the department. The defense budget has also grown considerably in the last decade. ""Over the past four years, Congress has elevated priorities and expanded benefits and services to all U.S. veterans to the highest levels in quality and funding in our country's history,"" said Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. ""I believe that Congress will continue to hold veterans' issues and needs at the forefront even with a reduction of congressional members who are veterans."" A government expert who studies Congress said a concern like Lynn's dates back to the country's founding fathers. ""What this reflects is a classic debate of descriptive representation, meaning do I need a person that is a member of my group to adequately represent my views in Congress,"" said Michele Swers, an associate professor at Georgetown University. Swers believes where this matters most is in a party's ability to sway public opinion and gain credibility on its proposals, for example, the opinion of a doctor serving in Congress on the health care debate may hold more weight with the public. President Barack Obama's top military adviser voiced concerns recently about what he sees as a disconnect between the civilian and military worlds, claiming most Americans know ""precious little"" about the military and the military needs to work harder to justify itself to the public. ""To the degree we are out of touch, I believe it is a very dangerous force,"" Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said at a conference on military professionalism last week. The drop of veterans in Congress may be attributed in part to the end of the draft system in 1973, according to the Congressional Research Service, but Lynn's group says there is more to the drop off than just a decline in the number of vets in the population . ""The cost of running a campaign has skyrocketed, especially with the need to buy TV commercials, and that creates a barrier of entry to people coming out of the military (who) don't have the financial ability that others in different professions have,"" said Lynn, whose group is trying turn the decline around. The group also claims that the increased partisanship in Congress is a turnoff for vets. ""Military members have served overseas and seen that the enemy is the guy at the end of the battlefield, not the guy on the other end of the aisle,"" said Lynn.","115 members of the new Congress -- 20% -- have served in the military .
In 1975, 70% of the members of Congress were veterans .
The top U.S. military advisor is concerned about a disconnect between the military and civilians ."
"(CNN) -- Delta Airlines said Tuesday that it didn't bump 50 passengers just to accommodate the travel plans of a nationally ranked college basketball team on Sunday, one of the busiest travel days of the year. A spokesman for the carrier said the plane the 15th-ranked University of Florida Gators were supposed to use had an engine problem, so the carrier put them on another jet out of Gainesville while workers tried to fix the issue. When the problem couldn't be solved, Delta booked many of the 50 passengers headed to Atlanta on a later flight. A handful of passengers left on flights Monday, Morgan Durrant said. The story made national sports websites Monday with headlines like ""Delta bumps entire flight to accommodate the Florida basketball team,"" but Durrant said the fact that it was a charter flight played no role in the plane swap. Flight schedules weigh heavily on operational decisions, he said. The Gators were due to take off at 3 p.m., and the commercial flight was scheduled to depart about a half-hour later. ExpressJet, the regional carrier that operated both flights, assured Delta that it would have the problem solved in time, Durrant said. ""We don't bias toward the chartered side of the business,"" Durrant said, pointing out that such flights make up a tiny percentage of Delta's business. ""All of our customers have somewhere to go."" Earlier, Durant told CNN that none of the 50 passengers had been pulled off their original flight, and they were all offered vouchers toward a future flight. A spokesman for the Gators said they had no idea the planes had been swapped. ""UF was not part of the decision-making process,"" Denver Parler said. ""We arrived, boarded and departed as we normally would."" The Gators lost the Monday game, by the way, dropping a last-second 65-64 decision to the Connecticut Huskies.

"(CNN) -- It's a crisp November morning and Slava Polunin is paddling his way down an idyllic river -- in a floating bed. The 63-year-old Russian isn't escaping some sort of natural disaster. Instead, the white-haired man with bulging red nose and yellow raincoat is doing what clowns do best -- making us laugh. ""The art of clowning is filled with fantasy and absurdity -- a collision of the incompatible,"" he says, speaking from his surreal fairytale home outside of Paris. ""It's a way to create a new world, rather than repeat the existing one. For example, rather than making your way out through the door, you would make your way out through the window, as it's closer to the tram stop."" Polunin is one of the most famous clowns working in the world today, winning an Olivier Award for his ethereal Snow Show, and performing in 50 countries across the globe in a remarkable career that began in Soviet Russia four decades ago. Fantasy land . Stepping inside Polunin's rambling home is like walking into a dream -- staircases melt into the walls, a psychedelic caravan parked out front beckons the visitor inside, and childlike murals swirl on every surface. Indeed, there's barely a right angle in sight in the dizzying house of rainbow, folk-inspired knick-knacks. Windows of every shape and size give a glimpse to the lush gardens outside -- not to mention the emerald river with an iron bed boat moored to its banks. It's a place to feed Polunin's imagination, which in recent years has helped revolutionize the world of clowning -- transporting it from the big top to the theater stage. Rather than the buffoonery of the circus, Polunin's clown is a more thoughtful, poetic character, with a minimalist style. ""At the beginning of my career, my clowning was filled with movement, like a child, when you are filled with so much energy that you think you could jump to the sky,"" he said. ""Today my perception of clowning is that you should be able to move just one centimeter and get a reaction from the audience as if you moved an entire mountain."" Childlike Chaplin . It was watching Charlie Chaplin film ""The Kid"" on TV as a seven-year-old growing up in Soviet Russia, that Polunin first decided to make a career out of clowning. ""My mom turned the TV off because it was time for me to go to bed, and I cried all night as I wanted to know what would happen next in the movie,"" he said. ""The next day, when I was about to leave for school, I thought: 'I have to wear something similar to Charlie Chaplin.' So I took my father's boots, hat and a cane and went to school. I made my friends laugh for the entire evening."" Read this: 'Perfectionist' Chaplin demanded 342 takes for one movie scene . Polunin was fascinated by the way movement could convey emotion, and studied dances from across the world -- everything from Japan's surreal Butoh performances, to rock 'n roll, and tango. He even analyzed the way Disney cartoon characters held certain poses. ""In order to learn how to move as a clown, I imitate the way kids, insane people, drunkards and animals move,"" he said. ""These movements are not limited by intellect. ""The perfect example is to see a child playing on a playground, or running around a forest -- this is how humankind used to be originally -- genuine and excited. These movements evoke a desire to follow."" Provocative performer . Polunin performed on state television throughout the 1970s and 1980s, using his wordless routines to mock the authorities without falling foul of draconian censorship. ""During Soviet times, when Brezhnev was still in power and there was no freedom of speech and expression, I came up with idea of movements without any words to express your personality,"" he said. ""This idea became massively popular, because I was saying important things without actually saying them."" Polunin became one of the country's best known clowns, later creating the ""Academy of Fools,"" an international organization uniting clowns, and the ""Caravan of the World,"" a traveling theater that meandered from Red Square in Moscow to Paris's Tuileries Gardens. Universal language . Of course, not every country has the same sense of humor, and Polunin must alter his shows depending on where in the world he's performing. Americans prefer a faster pace. The Spanish more passion. The French more poetry. And the British seem quite happy for him to stand still for 10 seconds or more. ""I feel very happy when I discover something new on stage,"" said Polunin. ""For example, you perform in China and realize that everything you have done in Europe does not work with a Chinese audience. ""So you start searching, improvising and suddenly you hear a laughter. You wonder why this laughter happened, so you start to dig into those movements. Every culture has its own aspects of movement."" Polunin seems determined to explore them all.

"(CNN) -- Yes, it happens every year: the snow and the cold. After all, it is winter, or least late pre-winter. But how's this for a change in the weather? Wednesday's official high in Dallas was 80. Thursday night brings freezing rain, sleet and a low in the 20s, according to the National Weather Service. Yikes, talk about mood swings. A particularly brutal batch of Arctic air has taken hold across the center of the country, bringing sub-zero temps to the north and sleet as far south as central Texas. ""The weather is bad and getting worse,"" said Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, who declared a state of emergency Thursday because of the storms. Roads were slick and dangerous in some parts of the state, where officials reported three dozen storm-related injuries, including 16 falls. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol responded to more than 50 weather-related accidents. The wintry mix is expected to continue through the weekend. For the first time in its 26-year history, a downtown Dallas holiday parade scheduled for Saturday was canceled. The Dallas Marathon, which typically attracts 25,000 runners, plus family and friends, is still expected to run on Sunday. Oklahoma and Texas are not the only states affected. Tennessee has also declared a state of emergency. ""The most unsettling aspect about Arkansas' weather for most of us is its looming uncertainty,"" said Mike Beebe, the governor of that state. ""During severe weather season, we know when conditions are ripe for tornadoes, but never exactly where and when they could strike. In winter, that uncertainty takes a different form but can still create widespread anxiety,"" he said. ""Often, only a few degrees above or below the freezing mark can make the difference between a cold rain, a blanket of snow, an ice storm or a mixture of all of the above."" Schools in various cities have canceled classes for Friday, including in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Little Rock, Arkansas and Dallas, authorities said. Classes were also canceled for some counties in western Tennessee, including Shelby, Fayette and Dyer. Area flights were so far running more or less on schedule. As of Thursday afternoon, there were just seven weather-related cancellations at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport, which expects more cancellations and delays early Friday. About 160 departures scheduled for Thursday were canceled at Dallas/ Fort Worth International Airport, with more disruptions expected Friday. Temperatures will be 10 to 30 degrees below average over the Plains into parts of the Mississippi Valley. Winter advisories stretch from western New Mexico to southern Ohio. Major icing is forecast from the Southern Plains to the Ozarks and into the Ohio Valley. Shuffle about 900 miles to the north of Dallas, and you'll find folks who'd love to see temperatures anywhere close to the 20s. Through the weekend, the highest high in Minneapolis is forecast at 10 degrees. The lowest low: minus 10. If you throw in the wind chill, make it 20 below. Hot Springs, North Dakota, is anything but. Wind chills there could hit a minus 26. And there's snow too, just to add to the shivering misery across the upper Midwest . A winter storm warning covers eastern North Dakota and the northern half of Minnesota. The Twin Cities area got up to 6 inches of snow on Wednesday. To the north in Two Harbors, Minnesota, residents were digging out from under 3 feet of powder. Not great for driving but perfect for snowmobiling, a staple winter activity along the state's North Shore. ""It's been a while since we've had this much snow in December,"" Dixie Bar & Grill owner Deanna Larson told CNN affiliate KARE. No snow means no customers, so 3 feet of the white stuff looks like a lot of green to her. ""Actually, January, February, March can be our largest months in business if we have the right snow."" They like the snow in Colorado, too, but the bitter cold is a different story. ""The thermometer in my truck said 7 degrees when I was driving over here, so it's cold,"" Boulder resident Mani Moniek said. But as cold as that is, it got a lot colder just before midnight, setting a record low for the day at 13 below.

"(CNN) -- Full funerary state honors were bestowed upon former Brazilian President Joao Goulart for the first time Thursday, nearly 37 years after his death. Goulart, who was president from 1961-1964, was deposed in a coup and died in exile. The ceremony in the Brazilian capital provided the proper official ceremony to which deceased heads of state in Brazil are entitled. President Dilma Rousseff placed flowers on top of the casket and presented the flag that had been draped over it to Goulart's widow. But the remains of the former president were exhumed for purposes other than a funeral ceremony. Goulart died in exile in Argentina of a heart attack in 1976, but there have long been suspicions that he was murdered. Poisoned, to be exact. The former president's body was exhumed so that investigators in Brazil and abroad can study the remains in hopes of clarifying how he died. ""It is Brazil's duty to clarify the circumstances surrounding the death of President Joao Goulart,"" said Maria do Rosario, Brazil's secretariat of human rights. Other South American leaders have recently been exhumed for similar investigations. In 2011, the remains of former Chilean President Salvador Allende were disinterred over questions about his death. A court studied the results and ruled that Allende indeed had committed suicide. In Venezuela, investigators studied the remains of revolutionary leader Simon Bolivar, but were unable to determine the cause of his death. They did, however, recreate a 3-D image of his face. According to the Brazilian government, there are suspicions that Goulart was poisoned on orders of the Brazilian military government with the help of the Uruguayan military through Operation Condor, an alliance between the military dictatorships in the Southern Cone at the time. Last year, the media reported on intelligence documents that showed that the military government spied on Goulart even after he left the country. After being ousted from the presidency, Goulart went to Uruguay, and later Argentina. The first requests to have the former president's remains exhumed came from his family in 2007, the government said in a news release. The request received the backing of the human rights secretariat in 2011, and the exhumation was finally given the green light in 2012. The intent is to combine the forensic analysis with testimonies and government documents to paint a complete picture surrounding his death. But on Thursday, it was a moment of honor and ceremony for the president who was popularly known as ""Jango."" In addition to Rousseff, three former presidents were also in attendance.","The remains of former Brazilian President Joao Goulart are being studied .

"(CNN)  -- On a recent trip across America, what surprised me most was the number of people -- over 200 in one city, 80 to 150 elsewhere -- who wanted to discuss this odd word, ""acedia."" It's an ancient term signifying profound indifference and inability to care about things that matter, even to the extent that you no longer care that you can't care. I liken it to spiritual morphine: You know the pain is there but can't rouse yourself to give a damn. The concept of acedia was developed by Christians in the fourth century who had fled to the deserts of the Middle East, opting for a simple life in rebellion against a newly legal, wealthy and politically powerful church. Today, we would say that they went off the grid. These men and women quickly discovered that although they had left material possessions behind, they hadn't shed their inner demons. They developed a sophisticated psychology of the ""eight bad thoughts"" that commonly troubled them, the most spiritually devastating of which were acedia, anger and pride. Several centuries later, as the church developed its doctrine of the ""seven deadly sins,"" acedia was tucked into the sin of sloth, and the word disappeared from the common vocabulary. Unless you were a student of monastic history or medieval literature, chances are, you would never encounter it. I wrote my book because I suspected that although the word ""acedia"" is unfamiliar to most of us, its effects are widely known. When I compared the classic descriptions of acedia with the plagues of contemporary society -- a toxic, nearly unbearable mix of boredom and restlessness, frantic escapism (including that of workaholism), commitment-phobia and enervating despair -- I found the ancient demon of acedia in modern dress. Acedia can manifest as either extreme lethargy or hyperactivity, but it is not merely an individual spiritual problem. It affects communities as well. And it was this aspect of acedia that my audiences wanted to discuss. They raised questions about addictions to the Internet and ""virtual reality,"" about fractured families who are so hyper-scheduled that they no longer spend much time together, about the dissonance of living in a society that is the wealthiest in history but whose citizens remain dissatisfied, gobbling up drugs for anxiety, depression and sleep disorders at an alarming rate. In hard economic times, we can lose faith in ourselves and others, and acedia offers a false sense of complacency and security. We can care about celebrities or online ""friends"" more than our neighbors; we can treat rampant homelessness as just ""the way things are,"" and that relieves us from having to do anything about it. We can keep ourselves so busy that we don't have time to care, or we can simply drop out of the fight. Acedia feeds on ""compassion fatigue"" and assures us that the world's problems are so big that we need not trouble ourselves about them. It's useless to try to change things. If the Christian church has made too much of the vice of pride, which seduces us into thinking too highly of ourselves, it has not made enough of sloth, which allows us to settle for being less than we can be, both as individuals and a society. As the late playwright Wendy Wasserstein wrote in her book ""Sloth,"" ""When you achieve true slothdom, you have no desire for the world to change. ... Better to fall into line than to question the going ethos."" There is no certain remedy for acedia, any more than for anger and pride. It is part of the human condition. But we can learn to recognize it and resist it when it strikes. A method that was recommended by a Christian monk in the fourth century, and is also a technique employed in current cognitive behavioral therapy, is to ""think about your thoughts."" When anger comes, or acedia, examine it dispassionately and try to figure out where it is leading you. There is no blame attached to having a ""bad thought,"" because they come to everyone. But we do have some choice in how we respond to them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Norris.","Author: Acedia is profound indifference and inability to care about things that matter .

"(CNN) -- Three San Jose State University students in California have been charged with racially bullying their black roommate by clamping a bicycle lock around his neck and decorating their four-bedroom suite with a Confederate flag, Nazi symbols, photos of Adolf Hitler and a white board with a racial epithet, prosecutors said Thursday. The three students -- Logan Beaschler, 18, of Bakersfield; Joseph Bomgardner, 19, of Clovis; and Colin Warren, 18, of Woodacre -- are charged with misdemeanor hate crime and battery, the Santa Clara district attorney's office said. Neither the three students nor their attorneys could be immediately reached for comment. Beaschler was booked in the Santa Clara County Jail on Thursday, with bail set at $15,000. The defendants face a maximum sentence of one year in county jail if convicted, prosecutors said. The 17-year-old roommate who was the alleged victim wasn't named by prosecutors. He suffered a minor injury when he fought off the bike lock around his neck, prosecutors said. ""I can't believe in the year 2013 that we're talking about an African-American student being treated this way,"" District Attorney Jeffrey F. Rosen told CNN. ""We're taking this case very seriously."" The defendants are accused of nicknaming their black roommate ""Three-Fifths,"" an apparent reference to a U.S. constitutional provision that counted slaves as ""three-fifths of all other persons,"" prosecutors said. When the African-American student objected to that name, the three roommates in the campus housing began calling him ""Fraction,"" the prosecutor's office said. The alleged harassment began in August and lasted through October, prosecutors said. Are we too quick to cry 'bully'? San Jose State's president, Mohammad Qayoumi, said in a letter to the student body Thursday that the three students have been suspended. ""Let me be clear: I am outraged and saddened by these allegations. They are utterly inconsistent with our long cherished history of tolerance, respect for diversity and personal civility,"" Qayoumi's letter said. Members of the alleged victim's family released a statement saying they were ""deeply disturbed by the horrific behaviors that have taken place against our son."" ""Our immediate focus is his protection,"" the family said. ""We have taken a stand on this matter. Our response prompted the community to be alerted of the appalling conduct of the students involved."" A total of eight men were living in the four-bedroom suite, but the remaining four students turned their back on the racial harassment, the prosecutor said. ""The other four were aware of this (but) ... did not stand up"" and allowed the harassment, Rosen said. Parents saw the Confederate flag in the dorm suite and ""the N-word scrawled on a white board,"" Rosen said. When friends become bullies . At least one of the defendants tried to downplay the harassment, and the three defendants then wrote a note to the African-American roommate, asking him to join their group, Rosen said. But the black roommate objected to the harassment and sometimes ""barricaded"" himself in his room, Rosen said. ""The young man in this case was terrorized. It was difficult for him to study,"" Rosen said. ""He told them not to do this to him."" Qayoumi said the university police immediately began investigating the allegations ""the day our housing staff learned of the situation."" The same day the investigation began, two of the roommates were moved to other residence halls and placed in single rooms. ""A third suite-mate, originally believed to be a bystander, was identified yesterday as an offender. We regret he was not removed from the victim's suite before today,"" Qayoumi said.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick booked Portugal's place at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil as the Real Madrid forward ensured Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be watching the tournament on television. After two Ibrahimovic goals gave Sweden a 2-1 lead with just 18 minutes left, the 28-year-old scored a quickfire double to turn Tuesday's playoff tie on its head. Portugal's 3-2 victory in Solna enabled the visitors to qualify as 4-2 aggregate winners. ""I know Portugal needed me in these matches and I showed I am here,"" Ronaldo told Portuguese TV afterwards. The hat-trick enabled Ronaldo to become the joint highest scorer for Portugal, level with Pauleta on 47 goals, and to take his recent scoring record to an astonishing 31 goals in 19 games. The tie had been billed as a battle between Paris Saint-Germain forward Ibrahimovic and Ronaldo, and the latter -- who had scored the only goal in the first leg -- was the clear winner by the end. Elsewhere, France qualified for the finals after making history with a 3-2 aggregate defeat of 10-man Ukraine. No European side had ever come back from two goals down to win a World Cup playoff but the 1998 world champions did precisely that when winning 3-0 in Paris. Strikes from Mamadou Sakho and Karim Benzema gave the hosts a two-goal lead before an own goal from Oleg Gusev in the 72nd minute sealed one of World Cup qualifying's most famous comebacks. Didier Deschamps was instantly rewarded when the French Football Federation announced that his contract had been extended by two years, meaning it will now finish in 2016. ""It was important for French football to be in Brazil next year -- when we've got all the ingredients we can do great things,"" the coach told French television. Croatia, who also enjoyed a memorable 1998 finals when finishing third, booked their place when beating Iceland 2-0 in Zagreb. Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic opened the scoring but he is set to miss the opening match of the World Cup in June after receiving a straight red card for a reckless tackle. Dario Srna sealed the win against a nation of 330,000 inhabitants, with the visitors having been in contention to become the smallest nation in history to reach the finals. The final European playoff was decided by Greece, who drew 1-1 in Bucharest to qualify as 4-2 aggregate winners against Romania. An early strike by Konstaninos Mitroglou enabled a team that has struggled for goals in this qualifying campaign to comfortably book a place in Brazil. In Africa, Ghana lost 2-1 in Egypt but the quarterfinalist at South Africa 2010 reached a third straight World Cup by virtue of a dominant first-leg performance, winning 7-3 on aggregate. Algeria ensured that the same five African teams that had qualified for the last World Cup will be there again, following the weekend qualifications by Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Cameroon. Trailing 3-2 from last month's first leg in Burkina Faso, the hosts won 1-0 in Blida to qualify on the away goals ruling. The two remaining places of the 32 were decided on Wednesday. Mexico secured one of them, beating New Zealand 9-3 on aggregate after a 4-2 victory in Wellington, with striker Oribe Peralta adding a hat-trick to his first-leg double. Uruguay also went through despite being held 0-0 at home by Jordan in Montevideo, with the 2010 World Cup semifinalist having set up a 12th finals appearance by winning the first leg 5-0 last week. It was the fourth successive time the two-time world champion had come through the playoffs. On December 6, the draw to determine the eight groups at next year's World Cup will be held in the Brazilian state of Bahia.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores hat-trick to fire Portugal to World Cup .

"ENSENADA, Mexico (CNN) -- It's what every sailor remembers: The fear of the first overnight race. The moment takes on bigger meaning when the seaman is a mere 9 years old. ""It's really cool having a shift overnight,"" said Jake Mayol, a third-grader from Aliso Viejo, California. Frightening too. ""It was pretty scary because when the adults went up on the bow, you were worried that they were going to fall in,"" said Jake, whose long blonde hair casts him as a year-round boy of summer. He and three other youngsters -- including two girls, both 13 -- joined their fathers on a 46-ft bluewater cruiser in a 125-mile sailrace along the Pacific coast that describes itself as the ""world's largest international yacht race."" The Newport to Ensenada International Yacht Race makes that claim because it begins in California and ends in Mexico. The regatta offers vistas of mountains meeting the sea and ends in Mexico's wine country, where Ensenada produces 90% of the nation's wine. The race fielded 204 boats this April -- an increase over recent years but still well below the almost 700 boats that competed in the 1980s. Past participants included celebrities and great sailors alike, such as actors Humphrey Bogart and Buddy Ebsen, the late Steve Fossett, America's Cup winner Dennis Conner, and Walt Disney Co. scion Roy Disney. Nautical memories . For 9-year-old Jake, his achievement marked the third generation of Mayols completing the race, said his father, Erik, 48, a tile and stone contractor. Jake's grandfather completed the race 20 times, said Erik Mayol. ""It was really special for me to be able to share it with him,"" recalls father Erik Mayol, who added he's raced the event 35 times. ""There were a few moment when they were not completely comfortable, which is completely normal, and it's our job to make them feel safe."" Those moments arose when overnight winds hit 17 knots, and the boat turns knocked the sleeping youths to the cabin sole. ""It's really hard to go down and sleep for a couple of hours and then get back up for your next shift,"" said Cole Pomeroy, 12, a 6th grader from Newport Beach. His father, Karl, 48, an executive with an air conditioning manufacturer, described the experience as a lifetime memory -- ""a great thing to share with your son."" Or daughter. One girl, Lolo Foster, 13, a 7th grader from Corona Del Mar, California, said the parents entertained the youngsters with ghost stories, creating a playful banter on the Stella Maris. ""I saw this boat at night in silhouette, and it looked like a pirate ship,"" Lolo recalled. Another girl, Sammy Pickell, 13, also a 7th grader from Corona Del Mar, marveled at the marine life. ""We saw a lot of dolphins and they were doing tricks for us close to the boat,"" Sammy said. ""They were jumping up and going in front of us and crossing in front of the bow."" Safety at sea . The fathers of the four children said their parental anxieties were allayed by how skipper Tom Madden outfitted his sailboat with redundancies for safety. Those concerns are understandable as of late. The perils of sail racing have been on the mind of many Pacific sailors as the past year has been particularly tragic on the California coast. In last year's Newport-to-Ensenada regatta, four sailors were killed when their 37-foot boat, named Aegean, struck the north end of the unlighted North Coronado Island off the Mexican coast at night, according to authorities and race organizers. And just last month British sailracer Andrew ""Bart"" Simpson, 36, was killed training for the America's Cup aboard the 72-foot Artemis Racing, which capsized in San Francisco Bay. The risks of coastal sailing carry the reward of thrills, adventure, and a coastal horizon that can mesmerize the sailor for the entire journey. ""This is one of the more prominent races in the world,"" said Chuck Iverson, commodore of the Newport Ocean Sailing Association, which has hosted the sailrace since its inception in 1947. ""We have had world-class sailors in this race."" Race organizers work with the governor and tourism official in Baja California, Mexico, ""to make sure everybody has a good time,"" said vice commodore Dave Shockley. The post-race party recently went upscale, moving to the elegant Hotel Coral and Marina from a downtown Ensenada motel in need of a coat of paint. The old motel was a longtime sentimental favorite, where race organizers maintained a tradition of using a bucket to pass results and notes up and down the outdoor floors. Economics of sailing . In the 1980s, the competition lured about 680 boats, its peak. The more than 200 boats in this year's race marked an increase from recent years, especially since the recession hit in 2008. In 2011, the race experienced its lowest turnover ever, 175 sailboats, Iverson said. ""When the downturn came in 2008, it really affected us, and the number of boats declined,"" Iverson said. Some sailors and their families had also dropped from participation because of the intense U.S.-Mexico security and lengthy border checks, prompted by cartel violence and smuggling. ""No one wants to drive down here anymore,"" said sailracer Peter Bretschger, past commodore of the Balboa Yacht Club, a regatta co-sponsor. However, he and several hundred partiers weren't daunted, evidenced in the after race celebration in the hotel courtyard. This year's contest, with its finish line now located off the hotel marina, enjoyed extraordinary winds: a 60-ft trimaran, the Loe Real from San Diego, didn't even have to sail overnight and finished just before sunset, setting a race record for second fastest time ever for a multi-hull, at 7:03:51. The multi-hull record still belong to adventurer Fossett, whose 60-ft Stars and Stripes catamaran completed the course in 6:46:40 in 1998. It wasn't just children showing a trailblazing spirit in the race. Rhonda Toller was among the small but growing number of women racers. ""I grew up power boating my entire life and I always dreamed of sailing,"" she said. She's now been sailing for six years and owns a 57-ft sailboat. ""It's just really fun to come to Mexico,"" she added.

"(EW.com) -- Considering the deep bench of A-list talent involved, Ridley Scott's new Southwestern noir, ""The Counselor,"" is a jaw-dropping misfire. The dialogue is laughably pretentious, the plotting is virtually nonexistent, and the performances are so broad and cartoony that you keep wondering if it's all some sort of prank. Reteaming with Ridley Scott after the disappointing ""Prometheus,"" Michael Fassbender stars as a smooth, naive lawyer operating in the moral gray zone along the border between Texas and Mexico. It's a godforsaken land where drugs are cheap and life is cheaper. After years defending crooked clients there, Fassbender's ''Counselor'' finds all of the easy money too tempting to resist. So he sells his soul and saddles up with a ring of flashy bad guys for a big drug-smuggling score. Box office preview: 'Bad Grandpa' ready to take down 'Gravity' There's Javier Bardem as Reiner, a spiky haired playboy who looks like he picked his wardrobe from a Siegfried and Roy yard sale; Brad Pitt as Westray, a charismatically mysterious stringy-haired hood who speaks in cryptic riddles; and Cameron Diaz as Malkina, a sex-crazed harpy covered in tattooed spots to match her pet cheetahs. (This is the film's subtle idea of character development.) For all of her man-eating efforts in the film, Diaz is punished with one of the most wince-inducing scenes in years — a spread-eagle masturbation spectacle performed on the hood of Bardem's yellow Ferrari that I'd say has to be seen to be believed. But I wouldn't want to encourage anyone to cough up ten bucks to sit through it. If the film's posse of ethically shady villains seems right out of a bad Cormac McCarthy novel, that's because it more or less is. ""The Counselor"" is the celebrated bard of the borderland's first feature-film screenplay. And as Fassbender's drug deal goes sour, putting his fiancée (Penélope Cruz) in harm's way, he's forced to listen to a lot of poorly-sketched characters wander on screen and deliver stilted metaphorical speeches about greed and the evil that men do. 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' pushed to January . All of this may have seemed fine and dandy on the page. But I suspect that McCarthy is about to find out the hard way that writing novels and writing screenplays are two very different things. In ""No Country For Old Men,"" the Coen brothers wisely stripped the author's doomed tough-guy dialogue and injected it with a stiff dose of harrowing naturalism. But operating on his own here, McCarthy's unchecked macho arias leave you sitting there slack-jawed, wondering if he has any idea how people talk in real life. Scott doesn't do him any favors either. The director surrounds the garishly painted characters in excessive dollops of glitzy opulence, hammer-to-the-skull symbolism, and sex scenes that are as embarrassing as they are un-erotic — the film's paranoid view of women comes off as downright Neanderthal. I suppose the only good thing than can be said of a movie as bad as ""The Counselor"" is that its existence is a reminder of just how right Hollywood usually gets it. Big honking bombs as bad as this one are like solar eclipses. Rare and not to be looked at directly. Grade: D+ . See the original story on EW.com.

"(CNN) -- The death of movie star Paul Walker has both shocked and enthralled fans. Perhaps it is because of the irony of the buff actor coming to fame in the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise to then lose his life in a car crash. Or maybe it is due to the fact that at the age of 40, his death was so unexpected and means he will now forever be frozen in time in the minds of fans -- defined not only by his roles and his philanthropy, but also by the footage of a smoking wreck which trapped him and his friend Roger Rodas. 'Fast & Furious' star Paul Walker killed in car crash . Here are 5 things we know so far about the story: . 1) Authorities are focusing on the car and how fast it was going . The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office has said speed was a factor in the crash, which occurred after Walker hopped in Rodas' 2005 Porsche Carrera GT for a ride, according to witnesses. The rare vehicle has three times the horsepower of an average car and is reportedly not easy to handle. Both Rodas and Walker were experienced drivers and had raced in competitions before. 2) Toxicology tests are not yet in . According to an autopsy report from the Los Angles County coroner's office, results of toxicology testing, which would show if drugs or alcohol played a role in the accident, won't be available for six to eight weeks. Both men's deaths have been officially ruled an accident. 3) Production of 'Fast & Furious 7' is on hold . ""At this time we feel it is our responsibility to shut down production on 'Fast & Furious 7' for a period of time so we can assess all options available to move forward with the franchise,"" Universal Pictures said in a statement. Walker was on Thanksgiving break from filming the latest movie in the franchise in Atlanta at the time of the accident. A source close to the production told CNN that the studio is trying to figure out how to move ahead with a movie featuring fast cars and crashes, given that one of its stars was so tragically killed in an accident. Editors have been reviewing footage that had already been shot with Walker in an attempt to see if any of it would work with a rewritten script, the source said. Universal scrambles to save 'Fast & Furious 7' after Paul Walker's death . 4) The wreckage is of interest . Jameson Witty, 18, was arrested and accused of allegedly stealing a piece of the charred Porsche as it was being transported after the crash. Authorities arrested Witty in Tujunga, California, and said a red T-top roof panel was recovered from a residence in Canyon Country. The sheriff's department said a 25-year-old man connected to the case had also been identified and was making arrangements to surrender himself. 5) Friends and family are grappling with the loss . Those who knew and loved both Rodas, who was a married father of two, and Walker, who was raising his 15-year-old daughter Meadow as a single parent, have come to the crash scene to mourn as well as taken to social media to express their heartbreak. The Walker family posted the following statement on his official Facebook page: . ""Paul Walker's family appreciates the outpouring of love and goodwill from his many fans and friends. They have asked, in lieu of flowers or other gifts, that donations please be made to Paul's charity Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW). Donations can easily be made through their website at http://www.ROWW.org/. ""It's comforting for them to know that the son, brother, and father they love so much is equally adored, respected, and appreciated by so many. Paul founded the organization with the genuine desire to help others, and it's important to his family to keep his memory alive through ROWW."" According to 2011 tax information from the organization, 35% of the funds raised went to the charity's programs. The rest of the funds are used for administrative and fundraising costs.","Fans are enthralled by the loss of Paul Walker .

"(CNN) -- I'm reading a terribly sad book these days. It's a book that I thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew in me a sense of hope. It's called ""The Audacity to Win,"" and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. When I'm finished with my patient write-ups at night and get into bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away. The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour. My classmates cried with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find. A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change. During Obama's transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating. There was something in the air. And then I close the book. Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream. It's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of opportunities gone by. Change indeed happened, in the years since I cast my first ballot. It was simply nothing I could have imagined. I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of ""don't ask don't tell,"" to the killing of Osama bin Laden. Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others. But, after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I've reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide. I've reached a point of political despair. Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas. It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing. It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns. It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the ""most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration"". And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. I don't know if this is what I should have expected. If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it. Obviously, elective office isn't a predictable course, as the opposing political party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation. Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the administration's own choosing. That is what troubles me most of all. I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy. Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions. I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long. Still, as Obama's approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder. It makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared. This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary. At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause. "" 'I want us to get our mojo back,' he said. 'We've got to remember who we are.' "" It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.","Nathaniel Morris: I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change .

"(CNN) -- For a while there, Kathy Amaya thought her long-lost son was gone forever. He was 2 years old when her estranged husband took the boy to San Luis Potosi, Mexico, to visit grandparents. That was 35 years ago, and that was the last time Amaya, now 60, saw her son. Then, the U.S. Border Patrol called her this month and said a man who spoke only Spanish was claiming to be a U.S. citizen -- and that she was his mother. At long last, the day that Amaya thought would never come finally arrived. ""We didn't talk over the phone, but I heard him"" in the background during the call with the Border Patrol, Amaya said. ""He was right there. I was asking his birth date and what town he is from because I wanted to know if it was the same."" Through a Border Patrol agent in California, the man answered the questions correctly. He was her son. Moreover, the Border Patrol agent earlier had researched the man's birth certificate and used that document to track down Amaya in Wisconsin: ""All he told me was, 'You're really hard to track down, you know that?'"" she said of the agent's phone call. Hearing her son's voice for the first time in 35 years -- though it was in the background -- was ""very emotional,"" Amaya said. ""After I got off the phone with the Border Patrol, I just sat down and cried for hours,"" Amaya said Wednesday. Amaya had spent years searching for her son on the Internet and on Facebook. But now she knows why she couldn't find him: He was using her maiden name as part of his full name, David Amaya Barrick. ""It never dawned on me that he was using my maiden name,"" Amaya said. Her son, who's now staying in the care of a San Diego church, couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday. Amaya said she is planning to travel from her Wisconsin home to San Diego to see her son in person on November 24. The Border Patrol described the tale as ""an unusual human story based on good investigative work and genuine compassion,"" the agency said in a statement. Agents encountered the son in a canyon near Imperial Beach, California, and determined that he had crossed the border illegally with several other persons. They were all arrested, the Border Patrol said. The son first said he was a Mexican citizen, but then claimed to be a U.S. citizen taken to Mexico by his father 35 years ago at age 2, the patrol said. While traveling north through Mexico, bandits took David Amaya's cell phone and money, the Border Patrol said. In checking his claim of being a U.S. citizen, agents called the Cook County vital records office in Chicago and received a fax of the birth certificate, the Border Patrol said. After researching several sources, agents found the mother on November 1. ""Too often our Border Patrol Agents deal with the darker aspects of border security -- violence, drugs, and smuggling,"" Imperial Beach Border Patrol Agent-in-charge Gregory Bovino said in a statement. ""But David's case was a welcome respite for all involved. It was truly inspirational to witness David talking with his mother for the first time."" The Border Patrol station is now raising funds for the son's trip back home. The separation of mother and son began when the estranged husband took the boy from the care of his mother's sister on what seemed like a routine outing, Amaya said. The family was living in Chicago near Midway Airport, and when the boy wasn't returned home promptly, the estranged husband told Amaya that he had taken the boy to Mexico for a month-long visit. But the month became a year, and a year became decades. ""I was very upset. I begged him to bring him back,"" she said of her estranged husband, whom she eventually divorced in 1986. The grandparents raised the boy because the father returned to Chicago and saw his son only a few times in the 35 years, Amaya said. She went to police, but because the couple didn't settle on custody during the divorce, the police couldn't help her, she said. ""Neither one of us had custody,"" she said. Years passed. ""I was very emotional for a while. I was upset and angry,"" she said. Amaya went on to have four other children -- three boys and a girl -- and moved to Rice Lake, Wisconsin, in 1986. She moved to Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, in 1999, where she lives now with two of her children, both in their 20s. Now that she knows her son's whereabouts, they have been exchanging chat messages on Facebook, with a San Diego church pastor helping translate David Amaya's messages into English and then translating the mother's responses into Spanish, the mother said. ""David told me he was looking for me for a long time, and he couldn't find me,"" Kathy Amaya said. The last time she saw her son, he spoke only a few words in English. ""He wasn't speaking a whole lot back then. Just some words here and there. It was like 'mom' and 'dad' and 'play' and stuff like that,"" the mother said. She found additional confirmation that the man was her son when she saw that her ex-husband is among her son's friends on Facebook. She and her ex-husband have not spoken to each other in many years, she said. And she has no plans to ever speak to him again. When she saw a photo of her son for the first time in 35 years on his Facebook page, she said: ""Well, the first thing I thought of was he kind of resembled me a little bit, and he kind of resembles one of his brothers."" Her son holds no hard feelings about any unsuccessful family searches for him. ""I told him I was looking for him, and he told me that he was looking for me, and I told him I was sorry that I missed a lot in his life, and he told me we have a future to catch up,"" Kathy Amaya said. Somehow, they will find a way past the language barrier once they see each other face to face for the first time in 35 years later this month. She doesn't know much about her son other than he played drums in a band in Mexico, even going on tour there. He wants a career in music. Kathy Amaya, who works as an assistant housekeeper at a hotel, will bring her fiance with her on the flight to California this month. When she flies to San Diego, it will mark another first in her life: She's never flown. ""I'm 60, and I've never been on a plane,"" she said. ""I'm very old school."" Her son will then fly back with her to Wisconsin on November 26, reunited at last. Colorado dad fights, and waits, for daughters taken by mom to Argentina .

"(CNN) -- Thailand is bracing for a critical showdown, as anti-government protesters vow to occupy key Bangkok locations for a month beginning Monday, in a massive show of political might intended to shut down the capital and force an end to the political deadlock gripping the nation. 1. Why are the protesters demonstrating? Since the government's botched attempt to pass a controversial amnesty bill in November, protesters have been taking to the streets and occupying government buildings, calling for an end to the elected government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. They accuse Yingluck of being a puppet of her brother, the ousted prime minister and telecommunications billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, who was overthrown in a 2006 military coup. In response to the crisis, Yingluck dissolved parliament on December 9, calling new elections to be held on February 2. But the move failed to mollify protesters, with the opposition Democrat Party, closely aligned with the protest movement, announcing a boycott of the vote. Led by Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister and Democrat MP who resigned his parliamentary seat in November to spearhead the protests, the demonstrators are demanding that no elections be held until major political reforms are implemented. 2. Why are the opposition refusing to participate in the polls? Protesters contend that Thaksin's immense fortune has allowed him to warp Thailand's fragile democracy in his own interests, giving him an unfair advantage and making substantial reform necessary.. Suthep has outlined his preferred vision for the current government to be replaced by an unelected ""people's council,"" made up of representatives from various professions and led by a prime minister appointed by the Thai king. The council would be charged with implementing a wide-ranging program of reform, including restructuring the police force and decentralizing power to provincial governors. But observers say that the Democrats would be unlikely to win anyway against Yingluck's Pheu Thai party, which commands significant support in the populous rural areas of north and northeast of Thailand. Thaksin-affiliated parties have consistently triumphed in parliamentary elections since 2001. 3. How ugly are Monday's protests likely to get? The specter of the 2010 crisis, when a crackdown by security forces on pro-Thaksin ""red shirt"" protesters occupying upscale parts of Bangkok left about 90 dead, looms large over the current impasse. But despite the high tensions, the recent protests have been largely peaceful, with eight deaths in contrast to the bloodshed of 2010. Back then, the protesters immobilizing Bangkok were supporters of Thaksin; this time, they are opponents of the tycoon and his sister. The pro-Thaksin ""red shirts"" remain players in the current crisis, however, with rallies in support of Yingluck's government scheduled to be held around the country this weekend. Organizers have told state media they will not protest near the anti-government demonstrations Monday; similarly, Suthep has similarly promised the anti-government protesters will be peaceful, assuring Thai state media the demonstrators will be non-violent, unarmed and restricted to seven locations in the capital. Nevertheless, the U.S. Embassy has issued an advisory to its citizens to avoid demonstration areas, warning that while recent protests had been generally calm, they had the potential to ""escalate into violence without warning."" ""Most of the protestors will be peaceful,"" said Bangkok Post political columnist Voranai Vanijaka. ""It's the few in the militant wing that we have to watch out for."" The U.S. and other Thai allies have been urging the country to resolve the deadlock by proceeding with democratic elections. 4. How much support remains for Suthep? After months of political instability, Thais are growing weary of the impasse, says Vanijaka. ""The support for Suthep is waning ... because many have begun to see that this is a road that leads to nowhere except for achieving changes through intimidation and violence, and possibly a military or judicial coup,"" he said. Nevertheless, he said, Suthep still drew strong support from his political base, broadly drawn from Bangkok's middle classes and members of the old establishment threatened by Thaksin's rise. ""Suthep can still command a large number in the streets,"" he said. 5. Where's the military in all this? Observers are watching keenly as to whether Thailand's military, which dislodged Thaksin from office in 2006 and has launched more than a dozen coups or attempted coups during the country's democratic era, will play a similarly decisive role in breaking the current deadlock. The army has thus far declared itself neutral in the conflict, and has proven reluctant to assist in defending government agencies from protesters. 6. What triggered the current crisis? Yingluck's prime ministership was largely stable until her party attempted to pass a controversial amnesty bill in November. The bill would have nullified Thaksin's corruption conviction, allowing him to return to the country. The tycoon has been living in exile in a number of different locations, most recently Dubai, while continuing to play an active role in Thai politics, since being sentenced in absentia to two years jail over a controversial land deal in 2008. 7. How is the crisis impacting Thailand's economy? The Thai economy is already feeling the effects of months of turmoil since November, said Capital Economics economist Krystal Tan, with the tourism sector suffering and significant investments in infrastructure projects deferred. While Thailand, southeast Asia's largest economy, had rebounded well economically from crises in 2006 and 2010, the picture was less rosy this time. ""The difference this time around is the economy wasn't in good shape even before the crisis,"" said Tan. ""Thailand has very high household debt; exports are not quite picking up."" ""The longer the impasse lasts, the worse it is for the economy,"" she said. CNN's Jethro Mullen and Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Anti-government protesters plan to occupy key areas to ""shut down"" the Thai capital .

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso won't be saving Euskaltel Euskadi after all. But Alonso still wants a cycling team and might start one up from ""scratch."" Formula One's highest-paid driver reached an initial agreement to buy Euskaltel Euskadi, Alonso's website stated early this month, but negotiations since broke down. If the Spanish outfit can't find another major sponsor soon, it won't be around for a 20th year. ""The negotiations between Euskaltel and the representatives of Fernando Alonso for the acquisition of the cycling team Euskaltel Euskadi on behalf of the Asturian driver, which began with an agreement in principle on August 31, have ended without an agreement,"" the team said in a statement posted on its website. ""For Euskaltel it is sad news that after the hope generated by the agreement in principle a definitive agreement has not been formalized to guarantee a professional future for the members of the team and to reward the fans that have been loyal until the last moment. ""We would like to explain the details of the negotiations, because we have done our part, with total honesty, but it is not possible because we need to respect the confidentiality of the negotiations."" Alonso, a cycling fan who hails from Spain, later took to Twitter to respond. ""We've tried it until the end but it's just been impossible to have a cycling team in 2014,"" said Alonso. ""My passion for the sport, my will to cooperate and do my bit remains intact, so this is only the beginning of the future.

"(CNN) -- It was an upscale, expensive vehicle -- a 2012 silver Range Rover -- sitting unoccupied in a parking deck at an upscale, expensive New Jersey mall crowded with Sunday holiday shoppers. Police say the luxury SUV's owners -- a 30-year-old Hoboken attorney and his wife -- returned to it after shopping, walking straight into an apparent carjack attempt. A few seconds and a few bullets later, the young attorney lay shot in the head and dying in a shopping mall parking lot, his shocked and stunned wife likely in a panic nearby as two suspects sped from the scene in the Range Rover. On Monday, New Jersey's legal community, friends and family were mourning the death of Dustin Friedland, who, police said, had performed one last act for his wife before the couple was accosted. He had opened the car door for her. And on Monday, police found that 2012 silver Range Rover parked in Newark, apparently with no obvious signs of what had happened to the two carjackers who became killers in a matter of seconds Sunday night in the parking deck of The Mall at Short Hills. According to authorities, Friedland apparently was walking behind the vehicle after opening his wife's door and helping her get in, when he was confronted. There was a struggle, authorities believe, and shots were fired. Friedland's wife heard the struggle and had gotten out of the SUV when the two attackers got in and drove off. She was not injured. Friedland was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital in Morristown. A manhunt for the suspects was launched, with authorities fanning out from the mall with its 150-store roster of retailers including Cartier, Prada, Gucci and Dior in addition to Bloomingdale's and Neiman Marcus. The Essex County, New Jersey, Sheriff's Crime Stoppers program announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspects. Police described the two still-at-large suspects as being armed and dangerous, but beyond that, few details of the investigation were released. Essex County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Thomas Fennelly would not confirm how many shots were fired during the seconds of the struggle behind the SUV, pending autopsy results. CNN's Jean Casarez and Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.","One of Dustin Friedland's last acts was to open the car door for his wife .

"(CNN) -- Central African Republic's parliament elected the mayor of Bangui, the capital, as interim president Monday, United Nations peacekeepers there said. Catherine Samba-Panza, elected in a second-round runoff, will face the task of ending the country's turmoil and months of sectarian violence as she heads a transitional government. ""This election must mark a new beginning as the country moves towards the full restoration of democratic legitimacy, including through free, transparent, and democratic consultations,"" the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office there said in a statement congratulating Samba-Panza on her victory. She replaces Michel Djotodia, the leader of the Seleka rebels who seized power in March. Djotodia stepped down 10 days ago under pressure after failing to halt the escalating violence in the country. Meanwhile in Brussels, European Union foreign ministers agreed to send EU troops to the country, a spokesman for the bloc's top diplomat said. There are currently about 4,000 African troops and 1,600 French troops in the CAR to help end the violence. In a statement U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon welcomed the EU's troop commitment and urged support for the African-led Support Mission to the Central African Republic (MISCA). He asked the wider international community to provide financial support. ""The Secretary-General looks forward to generous contributions at the MISCA donor conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 1 February."" the statement said. The Central African Republic, a former French colony, plunged into chaos last year after a coalition of rebels dubbed Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize, in the latest in a series of coups since the country gained independence. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. Djotodia, one of the Seleka leaders, became interim President. Since then, political turmoil and violence have spiraled. Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition, and to counter the attacks on Christian communities, vigilante Christian groups have fought back. The United Nations has said it fears a genocide is brewing, and aid agencies warn of a humanitarian crisis. The International Committee of the Red Cross said fresh inter-communal violence had flared in the west and northwest of the landlocked country. ""Red Cross staff and volunteers have buried some 50 bodies discovered in the area around Bossembele, Boyali and Boali, in the north-west of the country,"" the ICRC said in a statement on Sunday. ""Much of the population, in danger of reprisals and with no one to protect them, have fled their homes and are hiding in the bush,"" it added. The U.N. estimates that the worsening humanitarian crisis affects more than half of the country's population. ""The Central African Republic, with the active support of the international community, has an opportunity for a new beginning. This opportunity must be seized,"" the U.N. said. CNN's Antonia Mortensen and Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report.","The Central African Republic elects an interim president, Catherine Samba-Panza .

"(CNN) -- Mathias Boe is smiling, like a lot of people do when he explains that badminton is his full-time job. Perhaps that mirth would evaporate if those people regularly had to face down a shuttlecock hurtling towards them at a speed of 185 miles per hour. Or if they came face-to-face with his most treasured possession -- an Olympic silver medal, won with doubles partner Carsten Mogensen at the 2012 Games in London. ""Badminton is very popular in Denmark but it's seen as a hobby sport,"" Boe told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""After the Olympics we are quite famous here and (people) still often ask us, 'Do you do this for a living?' ""Even though it's popular, and everyone has played it once in their lifetime, they still see it as a hobby."" A closer inspection of the sport at the highest level should wipe away any lingering smirks. It can occasionally be hard to keep track of the relentless back and forth such is the breakneck speed at which the world's best operate. Boe has been attuned to this intense wave of frequency since the age of eight, when badminton drew him in. ""Badminton is definitely faster than tennis,"" Boe explained. ""You have strokes over 300 kph (185 mph) so it's an extremely fast sport -- only tennis table is faster. You need to have your reflexes ready when you play because it goes very, very fast. ""The skills that are most important are speed -- even though the court looks small on television it is quite big -- and you need to be quick around the court, and you have to have a very good technique. ""As you can see we don't have the biggest arms but we really have a big smash, a lot of us. I'd say power and stamina are two very important things."" As is, of course, his relationship with his badminton buddy. Boe and Mogensen were first paired together in 2004 by a coach at the national training center and started a steady climb towards the world number one ranking, which they clinched in 2011. The duo have won a tranche of titles, including the prestigious All England Championships crown in 2011 -- one Mogensen describes as the equivalent of winning Wimbledon -- but none bigger than their Olympic silver. Their success is a testament to their on-court chemistry, and their battle to maintain that level of hunger as they head towards the twilight of their careers. ""One of our things is that we're strong mentally,"" Boe explains. ""There are a lot of things going on between you and your opponent. ""It's important to look your opponent in the eyes when it gets close in the games and also to believe in yourself that you can be good enough to win tournaments. ""There are a lot of very challenging parts of the game; for me and Carsten it's when we don't have our best day, we need to struggle with ourselves. ""That's extremely difficult because we can be our own biggest opponent ourselves if one of us doesn't feel comfortable, or motivated. So for us now in our senior years we struggle with that, particularly after some of our bigger achievements. ""It created a bit of emptiness afterward and made some of the tournaments a little bit unimportant. That's what we're fighting with."" That motivation still burns bright enough to win titles though, as demonstrated by their recent victory at the London Grand Prix held at the Olympic Park. They are still formidable opponents for anyone on the 13-event global Super Series run by the sport's governing body, the Badminton World Federation. But given they dovetail so neatly on court, it is perhaps a surprise to hear their off-court characters are almost complete opposites. ""Me and Mathias, we are very different from each other, so I think that's a good mix to play at a high level,"" Mogensen explains. ""We have to talk a lot, find out what we are doing, what we need to practice, talk about feelings. ""I'm very relaxed. Mathias, he wants everything in boxes, to know today, tomorrow, how we travel, and I'm very relaxed so if we don't practice that today, we'll do it tomorrow."" Despite these differences, the pair are united by the feelings provoked within them prior to a big match -- a crackling tension that helps both Boe and Mogensen hit top gear on court. ""The feeling you have just before a match, I think you can compare it with going into an exam, you are a little bit tense, and a bit nervous,"" Boe explained. ""But that's also important, it's the feeling you have when you're about to do something that really matters to you. ""You are a little nervous, and you're struggling a little bit breathing, and not that comfortable, but that's important, because it means it matters what you're about to do."" Then, when the winning point is sealed, Mogensen explains what a weight of pressure is lifted off their shoulders. ""It's a huge feeling, when you win the last rally you go crazy, you think of all the tough hours during practice, these small moments are so crazy, you go crazy and celebrate and being very happy,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to describe, you need to go it on your own to understand how big it is for us to win a tournament or reach an Olympic final.""","Mathias Boe and Carsten Mogensen are a Danish badminton doubles pair .

"(CNN) -- Oklahoma City's Western Heights High School recently hosted some kids from Upward Bound. The visitors took the stage to urge students to stand up for kids who are bullied at school. Eighteen-year-old Marisa Velasco shared her story with CNN's ""American Morning's"" Carol Costello, explaining that she knows how it feels, not only to be bullied, but also to bully. Carol Costello: You also said that you were a bully? Marisa Velasco: Yes. Costello: What do you mean by that? Velasco: I mean, in middle school, I felt superior. I mean I had my clique and like there were a lot of us, I mean I can't really think of any right now, but I do remember putting somebody down. I do remember saying mean words, hurtful words to them. But now I know that they do stick with you and that people do take it to heart. And that it does affect people. Costello: When you were calling people names did it make you feel better? Read CNN's complete coverage on bullying . Velasco: It's not that it made me feel better; it's that I knew they felt worse. Costello: And when you think back on it now do you have any clue why you would do something like that? Velasco: I don't really know. I think it just got to me, the whole eighth grade ""you're superior"" thing. Yeah, and when you get to high school you're back to the bottom, and it's like, ""OK, got to start all over."" Costello: Is it worse in junior high than it is in high school? Velasco: High school I would say was the worst for me... is the worst for me. Costello: When you were in junior high, and you were the bully, were there kids who you picked on who you just didn't like for any real reason? Velasco: Um, I don't really know if there was a real reason. I guess it was just an easy target I guess. Costello: Is it because other kids were making fun of those kids, too? Velasco: Yeah, there were a lot of others also bullying. Costello: Sort of like a mob mentality? Velasco: Yeah. ... Costello: So If someone were to come up to you and say, ""You know, look, that's really not a very nice thing to do. Stop making fun of this kid."" What would you have said? Velasco: I would have said, ""Back off. It's my business and not yours."" And that's how high school is right now. Nobody should get in any other person's business. 'Cause it's a one on one thing, or even if it's others, it's personal. ... Costello: So more than one person should come up to the person to say stop? Does it take three? Does it take four? Velasco: Well, one person can be the right person. Costello: What do you mean? Velasco: Well, I actually did have someone come up to me and say that isn't right. And [they asked] why is the reason you are going against them? And I really didn't have a reason, so like, whoa ... so ... I shouldn't. Have you ever been bullied? Share your story . Costello: So someone made you aware of what you were doing? And you were like, ""Why am I doing that?"" Velasco: Yeah, it was pretty much like I don't have a reason to ... just because they don't like them, I shouldn't like them. That's not right. Costello: So now you're taking part in this effort with Upward Bound and you're trying to fight bullying because you've been both the victim and the bully. So you bring a really great perspective, I think, to the group. So what advice would you have for kids in school? Velasco: The No. 1 thing is to accept others -- how they are, who they really are, how they dress, how they really act. That's the No. 1 thing. If you can't accept people, then you're going to have a problem. Costello: If one kid sees another kid bullying, what should that kid do? Velasco: Stand up, not stand by. Costello: So you should be brave enough to go up to someone and say that's not right. Velasco: Exactly. Costello: And sometimes that's all it takes? Velasco: I think that it would make them the target, but together ... I think there is power in numbers and you can do it together. You can actually put a stop to it and go forward and be the helping hand. Costello: Is it more effective for another student to approach a bully instead of another teacher? Velasco: I think that when it's student-to-student there would be a conflict. And when it's a teacher and it's up to them, they stop it for a while. So you don't know when it's really going to go on. And it's going to keep on going. If it's a student that goes up to them, it depends -- it does get to them. They get the message even if it's wrong or right. Costello: A lot of schools are throwing assemblies and they have a lot of guest speakers saying that you shouldn't bully and that it's wrong. Does that get through to someone who bullies? Velasco: To me personally, I would listen and I would get pumped up in the assemblies. But as soon as I walked out the door, it was something different. It didn't really, like, stick to me. Costello: So the more effective thing to do is have kids speaking at these assemblies rather than adults or teachers? Velasco: I think being on the same level helps out a lot. Costello: And what words do they need to use? Velasco: That -- what does it get you? Why are you doing that? Accept others. Be somebody. Be the change. Be the solution.","Marisa Velasco says she used to bully kids and call them names .

"(CNN) -- ""There's between 100,000 and 300,000 child sex slaves in the United States today,"" Ashton Kutcher tells CNN's Piers Morgan. ""If you don't do something to stop that -- that's when there's something wrong with you."" In their first-ever joint prime time interview, actress Demi Moore and actor Ashton Kutcher will be guests on Thursday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" The husband-and-wife team launched The Demi & Ashton Foundation (DNA) after a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in January. They met a girl who had been trafficked into the United States by her pimp, who brought her into a field where she was repeatedly raped on a trash bag by 30 men. The DNA Foundation stands for the fundamental right to freedom for every person -- because it's within our DNA. ""It just seemed impossible to live in a world where that was going on and not, you know, do something about it,"" said Moore. More: The CNN Freedom Project: Ending Modern-Day Slavery . According to Kutcher, the average age of entry into the sex trade is 13. ""And that's globally, by the way,"" added the actor, who also pointed out that many Americans view child sex slavery as a problem in places that they have no control over, such as Cambodia, India or Nepal. Kutcher wants to people to realize trafficking is prevalent in the U.S., too. Traffickers are often ""Average Joes,"" usually in their early 30s. ""And what they're really doing,"" said Kutcher, ""is profiting off the sale of these women and girls."" These men seem like perfect guys to vulnerable girls from broken homes. Pimps start off nice and generous in a ritual that Moore likens to ""courting."" Sometimes they meet the girls online, establish relationships with them, take them shopping, make them comfortable and gain their trust. One of the so-called faces of human trafficking joined ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" under concealed identity from an undisclosed location to provide a first-hand account of what Morgan called ""the horrors of sex trafficking."" The 17-year-old girl went by the name ""Nicole"" for the purposes of the interview. When Nicole -- who is an American citizen -- was 13, her father went to jail while her mother battled drug addiction. Nicole began establishing relationships with men online, leading to a cycle of pimps, drug problems and even jail. Moore recalled the story of a girl who, now 18, was just 11 when she was taken in by a pimp. In a similar fashion, he took her to McDonald's, took her to the mall and made her feel safe. Pretty soon she was forced into child prostitution and given a $1,500-a-night quota. If she didn't meet her quota, she was beaten or forced to sit in a tub of ice. Her pimp's nickname was ""Daddy Day Care"" because the girls he overpowered were extremely young. According to the girl, Moore said, the pimp would load the girls into an overcrowded car -- so crowded that some rode in the trunk -- drive to Las Vegas, place ads on Craigslist and have the girls prostituting almost immediately. Siddharth Kara, author of ""Sex Trafficking, Inside the Business of Modern Slavery"" also joined the show. Kara said at a minimum, there are ""1.5 million traffic sex slaves in the world today generating profits in 2010 that exceeded $39 billion."" Moore reiterated that she and Kutcher initiated the campaign ""to create awareness. You have to acknowledge a problem exists before you can actually go about finding a solution,"" she said. ""And what we've found is that most people aren't even aware of what's going on."" Moore and Kutcher maintain that they will remain committed to the cause no matter how long it takes to eradicate child sex slavery. Morgan asked the couple famously addicted to Twitter -- Kutcher has 6.5 million followers, Moore has 3.5 million -- if it is smart to use social media as a tool to spread the word about their campaign when social media often makes it easier for child sex traffickers to operate. ""For me,"" said Kutcher, ""I think I looked at this platform and thought to myself, 'This could be the collective consciousness, right?' This platform, in and of itself, a little shout here, and a little shout there. But the key was being able to drive a link into deeper, richer content into a tweet, and then have that tweet be syndicated. ""I don't believe that there's a problem in the world that exists that the solutions didn't exist before the problem. So that's why we're using social media for this campaign,"" he said. ""It's to actually go right into the heart of where it's taking place. Seventy-six percent of the transactions for child sex slavery is actually happening online. So if we can motivate people while they are online to do something about that, then we can make a dent."" Furthermore, Kutcher urged people to visit sites such as Craigslist and flag pages that appear to be about child trafficking. ""People can start to actually un-root this at its root,"" said Kutcher, who urged people to go to Facebook.com/TheDNAfoundation, put themselves in a video, share that video with friends and go to the action tab where the foundation outlines online initiatives. ""We want the social web to become the police for human trafficking online,"" Kutcher told Morgan. Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- The poster at the end of the montage is written in the colorful, uneven handwriting of children, but its message is clear.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- A 19-year-old prostitute working in an apartment that doubles as a brothel said she has up to eight clients a day. A woman awaits customers at a Beijing barber shop in 2008. Sex workers also ply their trade in barber shops. Working in the southern boom city of Shenzhen, a special economic zone just north of Hong Kong, she told CNN she worries about getting AIDS, but has her own prevention measures. ""I always use condoms or take an injection. The medicine can prevent sexually transmitted diseases,"" she said. ""Some girls do not use prevention measures, but we don't talk about that in public."" This young woman, who would not give her name, is part of a group that Chinese and international health authorities are concerned could potentially spread HIV and AIDS in the world's most populated country, so officials have stepped up efforts to educate them about the virus and dispel misconceptions about so-called ""injections"" that can prevent infection. ""I think sex work is probably one of the most important factors for the potential of HIV spreading in Asia and also in China. There is no doubt about it,"" said Bernhard Schwartlander, UNAIDS China Country Coordinator. ""One of the things that we have seen in China is that knowledge about HIV/AIDS is very low in the general population and certainly also in the sex work industry. That is a big, big problem,"" Schwartlander said. It is estimated that some 700,000 people are living with HIV in China and there are about 50,000 new infections every year, according to the Chinese government and UNAIDS. The U.N. agency believes a significant number of those new infections include sex workers. Prostitution is officially illegal in China, but very loosely addressed by the government. It is estimated that there are between two and four million sex workers in China. As the country's economy has boomed, so has the sex industry, especially in prosperous cities like Shenzhen. Many clients flock there from Hong Kong which is just an hour away, some of them businessmen with money to spend. Condom use in China can range anywhere from about 20 percent to 80 percent, according to UNAIDS. ""There are misconceptions. People think that they can avoid HIV infections by taking a pill. People think that they are not at risk for HIV infections because they don't know anybody (who has it), because you can't see it, you can't touch it. And clearly, this is something that we have to change very rapidly,"" Schwartlander said. Historically, HIV and AIDS have been taboo topics in China, another reason awareness can be so low. Prevention in the gay community has also been difficult because of traditional stigmas against homosexuality. But the Chinese government is now conducting educational campaigns to inform higher risk groups, including sex workers, about how to prevent the transmission of HIV. ""After years of these campaigns, we found out through survey that condom use is constantly increasing, especially in urban areas, the condom use can reach 70 percent or even up to 80 percent,"" said Hao Yang, Deputy Bureau Chief of the Chinese Health Ministry's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau. But other areas are proving difficult. In rural parts of the country, the proportion of condom use among sex workers is less than 50 percent, Hao said. ""When we go to investigate in rural areas, the proportion of people with this knowledge (of AIDS prevention) is still very low,"" he said. ""In addition to that, the proportion of change in their activities is also very low, which means that the condom use rate is still low."" About one in 200 sex workers nationwide currently has HIV, Schwartlander said. But in one part of Yunnan province in the country's far southwest, seven percent of the sex workers -- or as many as 14 in every 200 -- have HIV, according to UNAIDS. ""The sex workers living in remote areas and rural areas have played an important role in AIDS spreading. We do not have a precise figure for the proportion that sex workers make up in it (the spread of AIDS), but we can say that they are making up a significant proportion,"" Hao said. The government has a long-term plan to educate the general public and to strengthen intervention in the high-risk populations, particularly sex workers, Hao said. When HIV initially began to spread in China, infections were concentrated among people who injected drugs, Schwartlander said. Campaigns among this group have been effective, while infections among other groups have risen. One of those groups, Hao said, was men having sex with men, which accounts for 5.9 percent of infections, according to the Chinese Health Ministry. A majority of the infections are concentrated among drug users, men having sex with men, and sex workers and their clients, Schwartlander said. ""Society and communities have been able to curb the spread of HIV, also in sex work, and that is what we have to do,"" Schwartlander said. As China's economy grows, it is likely the sex industry will as well. Current estimates show that some 30 to 50 million people are at significant risk for HIV infection, Schwartlander said. ""China is a society which is in quite a significant transition. There is a huge increase in disparity of income between the rich and the poor, and all these are very well-known factors that drive the sex industry forward,"" Schwartlander said. ""Clearly, in China, I think that the sex industry is a rising industry. We will see an increase in the number of sex workers due to these factors in the future."" A 22-year-old prostitute in Shenzhen, who did not want to give her name, said she knows the risk but needs the work. ""AIDS is the number one killer for my job. I cannot let this disease destroy my life. This is only a short-term business. I don't have any relatives in Shenzhen and can't borrow any money. I can only rely on myself.""","Some people in China believe injections or a pill can prevent infection .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. military expects on Thursday to begin flying Burundi forces into the Central African Republic to help stop the violence in that war-torn country, according to a U.S. military official. The United States has two C-17 aircraft in Uganda that will pick up the forces in Burundi and unload them in Bangui, the capital. The official emphasized the U.S. planes will remain on the ground in Bangui for a very short period due to the violence there. The official also said the United States believes its planes and crews will be safe, because French forces control the airport there. The airlift of Burundi forces is expected to last about a week. Discussions about what additional assistance the United State may provide continue. The Pentagon announced Monday that American military would fly African and European peacekeepers to the Central African Republic, which is in the midst of a bloody internal conflict between various proclaimed Christian and Muslim militias and other rebel factions. That announcement was followed by a statement from President Barack Obama, who called on the country's citizens to reject violence and urged the transitional government to join ""respected leaders"" in Muslim and Christian communities in calling for ""calm and peace."" ""Individuals who are engaging in violence must be held accountable in accordance with the law. Meanwhile, as forces from other African countries and France work to restore security, the United States will support their efforts to protect civilians,"" Obama said. Pentagon spokesman Carl Woog said ""the United States is joining the international community"" in aiding the peackeeping effort ""because of our belief that immediate action is required to avert a humanitarian and human rights catastrophe."" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel responded after talking with his French counterpart, Yves Le Drian, on Sunday from Afghanistan, Woog said, adding that France asked for ""limited assistance."" The request for near term help involves U.S. air support to enable the prompt deployment of African forces ""to prevent the further spread of sectarian violence,"" Woog said. Violence has raged in the former French colony east of Cameroon since a coalition of rebels deposed President Francois Bozize in March. It was the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence. Bozize fled the country after his ouster. Left uncontrolled, militia groups are uniting along religious lines. Christian vigilante groups have formed to battle Seleka, the predominantly Muslim coalition behind the President's removal. More than 400,000 people -- nearly 10% of the population -- have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations. Those displaced include people hiding in the bush without shelter, food, or drinking water, Doctors Without Borders has said. In a statement on Monday, the international medical organization called for all parties to let the wounded and sick ""safely obtain medical care,"" and for ""an end to violence and threats against patients, civilians, and medical staff"" nationwide. The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a resolution last week authorizing military intervention by an African Union-led force backed by French troops to protect civilians, restore humanitarian access and stabilize the country. As part of the effort, the United States will fly troops from Burundi to the Central African Republic capital of Bangui. The Pentagon will provide security for its planes, but there is no indication about the number of troops involved. The operation is expected to be relatively small. Violence on the ground, which has included machetes, knives, rifles and grenades, will be a ""big factor"" in any U.S. operation, a U.S. official told CNN. ""It's a concern,"" the official said. French President Francois Hollande said in Paris over the weekend that the goal is to hold elections once security is restored. CNN's Jim Bittermann contributed to this report.","U.S. military airlifts of Burundi forces expected to begin Thursday .

"London (CNN) -- A jury in the case of two former personal assistants accused of defrauding celebrity chef Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi was sent out Thursday but has not yet reached a verdict. Francesca Grillo is accused of defrauding Lawson and Saatchi of 580,000 pounds ($950,000), and Elisabetta Grillo is accused of defrauding them of 105,000 pounds ($172,000). They deny the charges. The jury was sent home for the night and will resume deliberations Friday. One of the defendants was not in the dock at the end of deliberations Thursday because ""she is not feeling well,"" the judge said. The Italian sisters have told Isleworth Crown Court in west London that Lawson authorized their personal expenditures on Saatchi's company credit cards, including on designer shoes, clothes and trips abroad. Their respective defense lawyers said in their closing arguments Thursday that the prosecution's claims had not been proved. They also argued that for the jury to return a guilty verdict, it would have to be sure that Lawson did not authorize the sisters' spending either explicitly or implicitly. Both defense lawyers questioned Lawson's credibility as a witness and said their clients' claims that she repeatedly used drugs were relevant to that issue. Elisabetta Grillo's defense lawyer, Anthony Metzer, told the jury that his client was the ""soft underbelly"" by which Saatchi was attacking Lawson after the breakdown of their relationship. The couple divorced this year. Karina Arden, representing Francesca Grillo, said her client had made no attempt to hide her spending, so it was impossible for Lawson to say she was ignorant of it. The case has gripped UK media, thanks to revelations of drug use by Lawson and intimate insights into her troubled marriage to Saatchi, a millionaire art collector. Jane Carpenter, giving the prosecution's closing argument in the case, said Thursday that the sisters had abused their position ""time and time again"" and that they ""grew bolder and greedier"" as time went by. ""Just because Saatchi is a wealthy man, obviously it doesn't mean he should be defrauded by the staff,"" Carpenter said. ""That seems to be what the defense are putting forward."" She urged the jury to find both sisters guilty. In her own testimony, Lawson confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times, during two periods of her life, and used cannabis in the past. But she denied being a habitual user. The court heard that none of the witnesses had seen her take drugs. Lawson, whose culinary skills and flirtatious manner have long entranced UK audiences, has also appeared as a judge on the ABC show ""The Taste"" in the United States. A second season of the show is due to air in January.","NEW: The jury in the trial of Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo will continue deliberations Friday .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of travelers spent the night camped out on airport floors and thousands more were stranded in hotel rooms and relatives' homes as blizzard conditions halted flights at New York's three major airports, slowed rail travel and continued to create treacherous conditions on roads throughout the East Coast on Monday. The storm brought high winds -- in some cases as much as 80 miles per hour -- and blinding snow to much of the East Coast beginning Sunday. Some places were forecast to receive as much as 30 inches of snow overall. Blizzard warnings remained in effect through noon Monday for much of coastal New England. Incoming and departing flights were suspended at New York's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports Sunday night, as well as at Newark Liberty International Airport in neighboring north New Jersey, Port Authority spokeswoman Sara Joren said. The airports are now not expected to reopen until 4 p.m. ET Monday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Amtrak, which had canceled service between Boston and New York on Sunday, said Monday morning that it had resumed limited service between the two cities. But spokesman Cliff Cole warned that many trains may already be sold out. The passenger train service's decision to cancel service on Sunday affected some 10,000 passengers. Travel by road was also difficult. Emergency declarations were in place Monday in Virginia, Maryland and Massachusetts, among other places. Connecticut Gov. M. Jodi Rell has asked people to stay off the state's roads unless absolutely necessary, said Peter Boynton, the commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Emergency Management. ""If you have to be on the road, of course, the rule of the day is take it slow,"" he said. Airlines have canceled some 2,000 flights since the storm began, leaving airports that normally would have been flush with activity after Christmas largely quiet. Many would-be travelers stayed away, thanks in part to many airlines' pre-emptive cancellations. But not all. Shabaz Motan came to LaGuardia on Sunday afternoon even though he knew his flight to Chicago had been canceled. He was hoping to get a free hotel room or flight voucher from the airline, but he ended up sleeping on a cot because airline officials told him it wasn't their fault he couldn't fly. ""It's been tough,"" he said. Julie Stratton also spent the night at LaGuardia. She was scheduled to fly to Indianapolis, Indiana, on Sunday, but said Monday she is now being told she may not be able to fly out until Thursday. ""It's not the best of scenarios, no,"" she said. ""But you just have to make the best of it. There's nothing else you can do."" Most carriers were waiving penalties for passengers traveling Sunday and Monday to airports from North Carolina to Boston and beyond. Affected customers were being urged to contact the relevant airline either by phone or online. The mayors of Philadelphia, Boston, Providence and Portland, Maine, also called snow emergencies, while New York City launched a winter snow storm operation and encouraged people to stay off the roads by taking mass transit or staying put. ""Unfortunately, our city is directly in the path,"" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sunday afternoon, amid a blizzard warning that extends until 6 p.m. Monday. ""It's hard to stand up in a 55-mph wind, so this really is dangerous."" The Northeast was not the only area being affected. In North Carolina, icy road conditions were blamed for three deaths. The storm's timing, coming over a holiday weekend, was fortuitous for some and disastrous for others. City and state officials predicted that the blizzard's impact on the economy and otherwise might be muted, because many people had the holiday weekend off and fewer were expected to be commuting into work than normal on Monday. ""With the people who are staying home for the holidays, it's great, but we know a lot of people who are trying to get home,"" said Brett Martin, claiming his hometown of Virginia Beach, Virginia, had received almost a foot of snow. ""We're just playing games and hanging out by the fire."" Metropolitan New York could see snow totals between 15 and 20 inches of accumulating snow, with sustained winds of 25 to 35 mph and gusts of up to 50 mph, the National Weather Service said Monday. Meanwhile, the NFL announced that a game between the Minnesota Vikings and the Philadelphia Eagles -- originally scheduled for Sunday night -- had been postponed until 8:20 p.m. Tuesday. ""It was dangerous for the players, dangerous for the fans,"" said Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, who called a state of emergency in anticipation of up to 14 inches of snow. ""People still have to get out of the parking lot (and get in) their cars."" Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick told reporters Sunday that 1,000 plows, sand and salt trucks were working to keep state roads clear and that as many as 4,000 would be deployed as the storm worsens. ""We expect visibility to be very low and travel to be extremely dangerous,"" Patrick said. CNN's Allan Chernoff, Greg Botelho, Nick Valencia, Chuck Johnston, Nina Golgowski and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: New York airports expected to remain closed until 4 p.m. Monday .

"(CNN) -- The timing and location of the Arapahoe High School shooting make it certain that memories of other mass shootings won't go away. Arapahoe happened one day before the anniversary of the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting. It occurred within 17 miles of two other infamous Colorado gun rampagesâ€”the Aurora movie theater shooting and Columbine High. The shooter, identified as 18-year-old Karl Halverson Pierson, shot one student before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life, Sheriff Grayson Robinson said. Arapahoe is in suburban Denver. For some people, the tragedies are linked. A mother who picked up her child from Arapahoe shared her family's anguish. ""My husband was a freshman at Columbine. He's freaking out right now,"" she told told CNN affiliate KCNC. ""It's bringing back horrible memories of that. And it's just way too close to home."" Newtown had hoped to quietly remember what happened on December 14, 2012. Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six adults at the now-demolished Sandy Hook Elementary in what was the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, following the April 2007 slaying of 32 people at Virginia Tech. City leaders asked journalists to stay away and give the community a chance to grieve, and many news organizations had said they would honor that request in some manner. It's not known if they'll stay away in light of Arapahoe. Newtown started an intense national conversation on gun safety but led to little legislative change. Connecticut authorities released a report last month saying they don't know what motivated Lanza, who briefly attended the school. He killed his mother before going to the school and killed himself. Arapahoe High is about 16 miles from Aurora, Colorado, where a gunman killed 12 people and wounded 58 on July 20, 2012, in a movie theater screening a new Batman film. James E. Holmes, then 24, was taken into custody outside the movie theater. Police said he was dressed head-to-toe in protective tactical gear and sprayed the theater with bullets from an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40-caliber handguns police recovered at the scene. Holmes had colored his hair red and told police he was ""the Joker,"" police said. Jury selection for Holmes' trial was scheduled to begin in February, but the judge said that process could take eight months. The judge vacated the trial date and has not set a new date. Jordan Ghawi, whose sister was killed in Aurora, shared his feelings on Twitter: ""Sitting here at the FD listening to @donlemon on @CNN as my hands are literally shaking. Rush of emotions ranging from solidarity to anger. ""17 miles away from where my sister was killed. My thoughts are once again with Arapahoe Co and the State of Colorado."" On April 20, 1999, the Columbine High mass shooting happened about 8 miles from Arapahoe High. Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and one teacher before fatally shooting themselves in the school library. SWAT teams entered Columbine 47 minutes after the shootings started. Five hours passed before law enforcement declared the school under control. In contrast, the first sheriff's deputies and police officers arrived at Arapahoe and entered almost immediately after the shooting was reported, Sheriff Grayson Robinson said. It is not known if law enforcement altered their protocols because of Columbine. Harris and Klebold made home videos before the attack making references to what they were going to do and apologizing to their parents for it. In the intervening years, Columbine has become a synonym for unfocused, violent teenage rage. Arapahoe is part of the Littleton Public School district and Columbine part of the Jefferson County School District.","""It's bringing back horrible memories,"" one woman says .

"(CNN) -- The eye of the Tiger will be on Lindsey Vonn as she continues the road to recovery -- and to the Winter Olympics -- Saturday. The American skier will have the support of golf star Tiger Woods as she competes in the downhill World Cup race at the French ski resort of Val d'Isere. Vonn made a successful return to racing earlier this month after undergoing reconstructive surgery on her right knee, an injury that was aggravated again in a training run in November. The 29-year-old had a best finish of fifth at Canada's Lake Louise course but hopes to make further progress on the French snow. For his part, Woods explained in a blog on his official website that he had decided to pack up his golf clubs for now and play a cheerleading role. ""I'm going to put my clubs away for a while to spend more time with my kids and support my girlfriend Lindsey Vonn as she tries to prepare for the Sochi Olympics,"" the 14-time major winner said. ""Having experienced reconstructive surgery on my knee, it's really hard to explain to anybody unless you've been through it. ""I've had my share of experiences in that regard -- unfortunately -- but I think it helps her in a sense because she can bounce ideas off me about what to expect. ""We see our sports through the same looking glass in how we approach them. We both work very hard and are prepared for our seasons. ""And when we're ready to go, we give it everything we possibly have and there's no holding back. I think that's some of our commonalities. ""But she has to be way more aggressive in her sport than I have to be in mine. You're trying to make your way down a mountain at 80-plus mph, and you have to have the adrenaline and the aggressiveness to do it. ""For me, I'm trying to tone everything down mentally."" Woods and Vonn went public with their relationship in March and, although their one-year anniversary is approaching, the pair have their fingers crossed that they will be celebrating another landmark before then. Vonn is the Olympic downhill champion and wants to be fit enough to defend her title at the Winter Olympics which take place in the Russian resort of Sochi in February. ""As far as Lindsey competing in Sochi, we're very hopeful,"" Woods commented. ""It all depends on how that knee is...""","Lindsey Vonn continues her comeback in downhill race at Val d'Isere .

"(CNN) -- With her curved 'wings,' long pointed nose, and gleaming underbelly propped high above the waves, this space-age yacht might be better suited to the sky than the sea. Just a few square meters of the futuristic vessel -- valued at $15 million -- actually touch the surface of the water, allowing it to skim across the waves with ease. The innovative design, along with high-tech features such as an iPad-controller, helped glossy ""Adastra"" win three prizes at last week's prestigious ShowBoats Design Awards in Monaco, including Best Naval Architecture. The yachting world is clearly impressed. The honor follows a prize for the Most Innovative Design at the 2013 World Superyacht Awards earlier this year. So could this alien shape -- resembling something between a spaceship and the Concorde supersonic plane -- be the future of superyacht design? ""The superyacht industry is pretty traditional,"" designer John Shuttleworth, told CNN. ""But the establishment has given a 'yes' to this idea which is a huge step forward."" ""Inevitably, there has to be a trend for reducing fuel consumption -- and I think superyachts will have to look something like this in the future. Initially I don't think economics will drive it -- these are wealthy owners and cost isn't an issue. Instead, it will be from an ethical, environmental point of view."" Billionaire's toys . Billionaire shipping magnate Anton Marden is believed to be the proud owner of the plush 42.5-meter vessel, which took more than five years to design and build. The Hong Kong-based mogul and wife Elaine will be able to remotely control their luxury yacht from up to 50 meters away, simply by sweeping their hand over an iPad. If you want to appeal to the mega rich, such flashy gadgets -- and room to house them -- are now an essential part of superyacht architecture. ""We have recently seen an increase in new and exciting superyacht toys on the market and clients are increasingly looking for more space to house these,"" said co-exterior designer Orion Shuttleworth. ""Our new designs incorporate lots of space to accommodate jet skis, sailing boats, kayaks, paddle boards and other toys."" Speed machine . With just 20% of the enormous 52-ton boat submerged in water, Adastra is able to glide along the waves without the same drag as traditional superyachts, hitting up to 43 kilometers per hour. It also means the vessel, made from a super-light glass and carbon material, consumes a lot less fuel -- around 14% of a conventional superyacht the same size. ""Adastra's longer, slender main hull has extremely low drag, which is why she is so fuel efficient,"" explained Orion. ""The smooth, seamless, unbroken surfaces also help to reduce weight,"" he said of the boat, which can travel up to 6,400 kilometers -- the same distance from London to New York -- without refueling. In fact, the three-pronged design -- featuring a slim hull and two 'wings' -- is similar to the world's fastest sailboat Hydroptere, which broke the speed record in 2009 at 95 kilometers per hour. Living in luxury . Step inside the sleek Adastra and you'll find all the luxury of a five-star hotel, including five elegant bedrooms and four bathrooms. The plush yacht also features a saloon, a lounge and an industrial kitchen. The rear deck has an open-air bar, allowing guests to gaze out at the water while they enjoy a cocktail. At night, the glowing underbelly of the boat lights up in neon blue, giving it the impression of a futuristic spacecraft. If the reams of recent awards are anything to go by, this yachting future could be a lot closer than you think.","The $15 million yacht features an iPad controller, luxury interior .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs is still struggling with an enormous backlog in claims for medical and educational benefits that are piling up despite efforts to diminish the paperwork, the secretary of the department admitted Wednesday. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki says the backlog for processing claims by veterans is too long. The VA has implemented an electronic records system, but faces a flood of medical claims each month. In July alone, the VA processed 92,000 claims, but another 91,200 came in. The department has 400,000 claims in the works, with more than a quarter of them left unprocessed for more than 125 days. ""Regardless of how we parse the numbers, there is a backlog. It is too big and veterans are waiting too long for decisions,"" said Eric Shinseki, secretary of veterans affairs, in his opening statement to the House Veterans Affairs Committee hearing Wednesday. Shinseki was pressed on the backlog by Rep. Debbie Halvorson, D-Illinois, who asked about the problem of many claims having to be resubmitted. The secretary said it was a problem of trust between veterans and the department that he was trying to change, making every employee an ""advocate"" for veterans. ""What I mean by advocacy is that when Shinseki walks in and says 'I want to put a claim in,' my intent is to put together the very best claim the first time with a very high probability of success,"" Shinseki responded. ""Whatever is there right now is what we are addressing. It is a change in culture. It is a change in attitude."" The department became a victim of the success of its new education program for veterans who have served since September 2001. The claims became so backlogged that the VA was forced to issue more than $70 million in emergency funds to veterans who were still waiting for money for supplies and living needs, weeks into the school year. ""Uncertainty and great stress caused by these delays were addressed through these emergency procedures, which remain in effect,"" Shinseki assured the Veterans Affairs Committee. Despite the department's efforts to build a computerized system to process the new program claims, the system was not up and running in time. Problems facing veterans are even more acute for female service members, who have more difficulty accessing veterans programs, according to the advocacy group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association. The IAVA released a study on Wednesday highlighting the concerns women veterans have. More than 212,000 women have served in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, according to the IAVA, but they face a system that is designed more for the care of their male counterparts. Department of Veterans Affairs statistics show that women make up almost 10 percent of the veteran population, but their numbers are growing. One area of concern underscored by the report is access to female-specific medical care at VA facilities. ""For most women, this translates into having a primary care physician handle general health care while a second clinician may handle gender-specific needs, and in some cases, a third provider may address mental health issues,"" the study said. In some cases, female veterans may be forced to travel more than two hours for routine gynecological care, according to a VA study cited by the IAVA report. At the House hearing, Shinseki was asked by Chairman Bob Filner, D-California, about women veterans being refused care at VA facilities because there was nobody to watch their children while they were being examined. Shinseki assured Filner that the issue was being addressed and that no veterans should be turned away for that reason. The VA got some good news, however, on its budget. On Wednesday the House and Senate finalized a bill to provide the department with funding for medical programs one year in advance. The move, which still has to be signed by President Obama, will assure the department more stability in projecting its ability to provide properly funded services.","Backlog of claims keeps growing despite efforts to streamline, VA head says .

"(CNN) -- A Sri Lankan journalist who was fatally shot last year has been recognized by the International Press Institute as a hero for freedom of the press, the group announced Thursday. The institute said it is naming Lasantha Wickrematunge, who was editor of Sri Lankan newspaper The Sunday Leader, as an IPI World Press Freedom Hero. Wickrematunge, a fierce critic of the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tiger militants, was shot dead near Colombo on January 8, 2009. More than a year later, the killing has not been solved, IPI said. ""The murder of Wickrematunge was a shocking reminder of the dangers facing Sri Lanka's courageous journalists, for whom death is all too often the ultimate form of censorship,"" IPI Director David Dadge said in a written statement. ""By naming him an IPI World Press Freedom Hero, IPI honors his memory and his sacrifice, and sends the strongest message possible to the Sri Lankan government that the international community will not forget his murder and that the perpetrators must be found and punished."" Three days after his death, The Sunday Leader published a column in which Wickrematunge had predicted his own death. The column anticipated his killing by government forces and defended the craft of journalism in his country, which is enduring a bitter civil war. Wickrematunge wrote that he was twice assaulted and his house was fired upon. ""Despite the government's sanctimonious assurances, there was never a serious police inquiry into the perpetrators of these attacks, and the attackers were never apprehended,"" he wrote in the column. ""In all of these cases, I have reason to believe the attacks were inspired by the government. When finally I am killed, it will be the government that kills me."" Asked last year about threats to journalists, Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa voiced assurance that no journalist or media institution had cause to fear any threats or attacks by the government, according to a statement on the government's official Web site. ""The government had no interest whatever in seeking disgrace through any attacks on the media,"" he said, and he assured media leaders that the culprits would be captured and brought to justice, the statement said. Wickrematunge's brother, Lal Wickrematunge -- chairman of Leader Publications Ltd., which includes The Sunday Leader -- told IPI that the slain editor had known he was in danger. ""But he continued in his journey unbowed and unafraid. He felt total commitment to his work,"" Lal Wickrematunge said. Lasantha Wickrematunge's killing spurred a demonstration in Colombo by 4,000 people, which Reporters Without Borders said was the largest since Rajapaksa took power in 2005. He was re-elected to a second term last month. Sinhalese-dominated government forces have been working to eradicate the last vestiges of Tamil Tiger separatists in Jaffna peninsula, a rebel-held northern region. The 25-year-old civil war has left more than 65,000 people dead. According to IPI figures, 17 journalists have been killed in Sri Lanka over the past decade. Two of them were killed in 2009. Wickrematunge will be among 60 World Press Freedom Heroes honored in a ceremony in September, IPI said.","Lasantha Wickrematunge was editor of Sri Lankan paper The Sunday Leader .

"(CNN) -- The thought of it is enough to make fair-weather golfers shudder in horror. But for hardier sporting souls, a sub-zero round in the Arctic snow could be the perfect off-piste adventure this winter. Welcome to a world where greens are ""whites,"" where snowplows -- not mowers -- groom fairways, and players swap snazzy pants and Pringle sweaters for ski jackets and mittens. Like normal golf, the goal remains frustratingly simple and the rules are largely the same as they are on grass. But the obstacles are somewhat different as players battle a strange playing surface and the cold. At Björkliden, a ski resort in Swedish Lapland which started offering snow golf last year, players can expect a warm welcome but a decidedly chilly round. ""We are 250 kilometers to the north of the Arctic Circle. It can be anything from zero degrees Celsius down to -25, but usually the average is around -10,"" says Merja Bergwall, marketing and sales manager for Lapland Resorts, the company which manages Björkliden's facilities. Thin a ball at those temperatures and your poor hands may never recover. But for most the experience is a happy one, Bergwall says, with players enjoying clean, crisp air under frequently blue skies while mastering the art of driving, chipping and putting on snow and ice. Björkliden's winter golfers tread the same path as summer guests, playing the route of a long-established grass course beneath. ""Summer golf has been here since the 1930s, but we wanted to do something for the wintertime,"" explains Bergwall. ""We have nine holes and we use snowplows that we usually use on the slopes (to smooth the course)."" Visitors pay 350 Swedish Krona (around $50) for a round, which includes club hire and balls. Tee times after dark are also available thanks to glowing golf balls -- and night golf also lets players witness one of nature's most magnificent spectacles up close. ""It's very, very magical if you catch the Northern Lights. We are one of the best places in the world to watch them,"" Bergwall says. The Aurora Borealis can be seen frequently in Swedish Lapland during the winter, but sadly the opportunities to get stuck into snow golf are more limited -- the course is only open for three weeks in March. ""We want to keep the 'whites' in the right condition to ensure a good standard of play,"" says Bergwall. Björkliden joins a long list of European destinations which host snow golf events. Engadin Golf Club in St. Moritz, Switzerland will welcome entrants to the 35th Snow Golf Cup later this month, and in March patrons of the annual Boerl and Kroff Snow Golf tournament will reconvene on Wispile mountain in Gstaad. Other annual events are scheduled to take place in France and Austria, but 2014 will not see the return of the World Ice Golf Championships in Uummannaq, Greenland which has, since 2009, fallen foul of the weather. ""Global warming has made it more difficult to arrange the event as we can't rely on ice being formed on the fjord of Uummannaq -- the place where the event used to take place,"" Malik Milfeldt of Visit Greenland told CNN. Happily for Björkliden, there have been no such issues with the weather so far and plans are in place for a weekend of competitions in late March, with the Scandinavian Snow Golf Masters forming the centerpiece.

"(CNN) -- Another place on Formula One's motorized merry-go-round has been filled for the 2014 season. Pastor Maldonado has been named as Frenchman Romain Grosjean's teammate at the Lotus F1 team after leaving Williams. Maldonado, whose deal with Williams had been funded by the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, has filled the Lotus seat vacated by 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen, who is returning to Ferrari. ""It is a fantastic opportunity for me to join Lotus F1 team for 2014,"" Maldonado said in a statement. ""It's no secret that I have wanted a change of scene to help push on with my Formula 1 career and Lotus offered the very best opportunity for me to be competitive next season. ""The regulations and cars will change significantly so it is a very good time for a fresh start."" The Venezuelan made his F1 debut in 2011 with Williams and the following season he clinched a shock win for the former world champion team at the Spanish Grand Prix -- the first by an F1 driver from his country. Maldonado's brief reign in Spain was the high point of his relationship with Williams, a partnership that showed signs of stress towards the end of the last campaign. At the penultimate United States Grand Prix, the 28-year-old said: ""Leaving is an important moment for my career."" Before signing for Lotus, Maldonado was among of group of F1 protagonists without a drive at the end of the 2013 season, which reached its climax in Brazil last weekend. Force India duo Paul di Resta and Adrian Sutil, McLaren's Sergio Perez, Sauber pair Nico Hulkenberg and Esteban Gutierrez, Marussia's British driver Max Chilton and Caterham pairing Charles Pic and Giedo Van Der Garde are yet to settle their futures. Many drivers are now expected to fund their own drives in F1, a problem that has been exacerbated ahead of the new season. A major rule change looms large in 2014 and that means the 11 teams are having their resources stretched, with the new turbo engines alone estimated to be three times more expensive than the ones being phased out. Grosjean has managed to avoid the fray of the driver market by securing a third straight season with Lotus. After an erratic 2012 season, which included a one-race ban for dangerous driving, the 27-year-old showed consistent improvement in 2013, racing to six podiums. His performances were enough to see Lotus take up the option to extend his contract. ""I am very happy to have official confirmation that I will be continuing to drive for Lotus next season,"" said Grosjean, who, like Maldonado, became a father for the first time in 2013. ""This past year has been tremendously satisfying for me. I know everyone is motivated to continue the fight for every last point available."" Although Lotus won the opening race of 2013 in Australia, the final part of the season was overshadowed by speculation over the team's finances. Lead driver Raikkonen, who opted to have back surgery rather than race in the final two grands prix of the year, was reported to be owed $20 million in wages. The arrival of Maldonado is likely to help boost the team's coffers as he is expected to once again bring financial support to his new team. Lotus team principal Eric Boullier added: ""It is clear that Pastor has pace and potential. We are convinced that we will be able to provide the correct environment to enable him to flourish regularly on track. ""With Romain and Pastor I believe Lotus will be able to cause quite a few surprises next year.""","Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean will race for the Lotus Formula One team in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- When Grace Lieblein started her career in a car assembly plant at the age of 18, she was a rare woman in a man's world. Today, 34 years on, she is the newly appointed VP of global purchasing for General Motors, and trying to persuade more young women to reach the top in the car industry. Before her appointment earlier this week, Leiblein was president and managing director of General Motors, Brazil for a year and a half. She takes up her new post in Detroit at the end of January 2013. ""I'm honored that I was offered the position. It's an important role in GM,"" she said. ""This is a global job. I will be visiting other regions and seeing how things work. ""I think it's the cool thing that (at) GM, not only do we have a lot of women in key leadership (roles) ... we have more women than any other automaker. i am proud our leadership believes in women in such positions."" Lieblein says she has ""gas in my veins."" She studied engineering at what was then General Motors Institute, now Kettering University, in Flint, Michigan, and has worked for the company ever since. Before moving to Brazil, she was chief engineer for vehicles such as the Buick Enclave and Chevy Traverse, and then president and managing director of General Motors in Mexico. ""My feeling was always, I'm going to get in and I'm going to do the best job that I can and I will build my credibility from there,"" she said. ""With that attitude I was able to win over some skeptics, and for those who maybe didn't change their mind, I figured that's their problem. That is not my problem."" Despite the progress, Lieblein is still working in a male-dominated environment. Women made up just under 21% of employees in car manufacturing in the United States, and 16% of executives and senior management, according to a 2010 Equal Opportunity Employment Commission report. Yet women buy 52% of all new cars in the United States, and influence more than 85% of sales, according to Forbes, so manufacturers should have a high incentive for reaching out to women. Lieblein recognized this while working as chief engineer for the launch of the Buick Enclave in 2008. The car includes a dip in floor on the driver's side for women wearing high heels. ""The vehicle line executive was a woman, I was a chief engineer as a woman, my assistant chief engineer was a woman, a lot of my development engineers were women, our vehicle line director was a woman"" said Lieblein. ""I don't know if the vehicle would have turned out differently if we hadn't had been a part of it. ""When we were launching the Buick Enclave or the Chevrolet Traverse, we did a lot of connection with mommy bloggers because we saw them as some of our key customers. It was a really great opportunity."" To encourage others to follow her into the boardroom, Lieblein has mentored young women, making sure they get the right assignments to make the most of their career. ""I picked out five young women and I helped to move them where they needed to go,"" she said. ""I was able to take (on) these women and I tried to make sure they got the right assignments. ""When they look at senior leaders, they think that their life can only be work. So one thing that I really try and share with young people is that you can have a successful career but also a successful family life as well."" Also on Leading Women: How Scandinavia's 'CEO of ideas' puts creativity into action . While Lieblein and others have successfully risen through the ranks, the industry is struggling to attract and retain women in its senior positions. When Automotive News compiled its list of ""100 Leading Women in the North American Automotive Industry"" in 2010, it found fewer women in the most senior positions than on its previous list in 2005. There were just two women CEOs in 2010, down from five in 2005, and 51 women with executive officer titles, compared with 64 in 2005. Deloitte carried out a survey of the 100 leading women to find out what was going wrong. Its report ""Women at the Wheel"" found 56% of the women said their companies did not have an active recruitment program targeting women, and none thought the school system encouraged girls to pursue careers in the industry. One senior woman told the report that engineering needed to improve its image in line with the ""Hollywood-ization"" of other careers such as medicine and law. There are programs encouraging women in the industry. The Detroit-based Automotive Women's Alliance Foundation and the Women's Automotive Association International both offer scholarships to help women pursue careers in the industry. Also on Leading Women: Your top-flight lawyer? She's a stay-at-home mom . In the UK, Sarah Sillars, outgoing executive chair of the Institute of the Motor Industry, which represents car retailers, is about to take over as chief executive of the Sector Skills Council for Science, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies. ""We have got an image problem, and I don't think the industry has done enough to educate teachers, parents and careers advisers about opportunities and what it's like to work in the motor trade,"" said Sillars. ""There are lots of companies that go into schools in their localities, but we need to do that on a broader scale."" She said getting more girls to consider a career in engineering would be one of her top three priorities in her new job at the Sector Skills Council. Lieblein, too, believes the task starts in schools, persuading girls to consider engineering. ""What we can do is really try and reach out to girls in middle school and high school, and talk to them about math and science,"" she said. ""We need to reach out to those young girls and make them see that they have the capability and then show them how engineering can be exciting.""","Women influence more than 85% of new car purchases .

"(CNN) -- Hoboken, New Jersey, Mayor Dawn Zimmer is again embroiled in a controversy over redevelopment in her community. The first one helped get her elected mayor. The second has added fuel to the fire of scandal consuming the administration of Gov. Chris Christie, a possible presidential candidate. The stakes are high and Zimmer's right in the middle of it with her allegations the administration conditioned Superstorm Sandy relief money for her town to her support for a redevelopment project proposed by a company with ties to Christie. Zimmer was a little-known Hoboken City Council president when she stepped in as its first female mayor in 2009 after Peter Cammarano was arrested in a pay-to-play scheme. He was convicted on federal charges and jailed. She made her mark in local politics working to stop a high-rise redevelopment plan, a controversy that played out in court. A Democrat, the wife of a diamond manufacturing executive, and the mother of two children, Zimmer was reelected in November. Republicans paint her as one of many partisan opportunists seeking to derail Christie, who appeals to both GOP and Democratic voters in traditionally ""blue"" New Jersey. Her allegations have added a new dimension to allegations of hardball politics gone awry in New Jersey under the leadership of Christie, hailed by many in his own party, and some Democrats, as a straight-shooter and a refreshing change from scripted politics. ""It's stunning. It's outrageous. But it's true,"" Zimmer told CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union"" Sunday of her claims that Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno told her in a parking lot in May that Sandy funds were conditioned on her support for the redevelopment project. Guadango said her dispatch is ""a direct message from the governor,"" Zimmer said. The allegations, denied by Guandango, are the first time an official has connected Christie directly to recent controversies plaguing his administration. Hoboken mayor: 'It's true' Christie administration withheld Sandy funds . The turn of events is quite something considering she once tweeted during the Sandy aftermath that she was ""very glad Governor Christie has been our Gov."" After Sandy, Hoboken was about 80% underwater. As mayor, Zimmer pleaded for relief and was dismayed when her city received only about $300,000 of the roughly $100 million in state funds the city requested for flood prevention. Christie spokesman Colin Reed told CNN that Zimmer asked for $100 million from a roughly $300 million pot of money for which there was $14 billion worth of requests. N.J. official calls mayor's Christie allegations 'false' Since that request, Reed said Hoboken has been approved for nearly $70 million in aid. The city has also been identified as a pilot community for a federal program to prevent flooding, one of only four such projects in New Jersey. Zimmer, however, had a different account of allocated funds. She said the $70 million given to Hoboken was through flood insurance and other mechanisms that did not need approval from the state. She received only $300,000 in Christie-approved funds, she said. Zimmer's comments Saturday and Sunday are also a change from what she told CNN the previous week, when she said that while she wondered whether Sandy aid funds were being withheld because she didn't endorse the governor's re-election, she concluded that ""I don't think that's the case."" ""I don't think it was retaliation and I don't have any reason to think it's retaliation, but I'm not satisfied with the amount of money I've gotten so far,"" Zimmer told CNN at the time, not mentioning her concerns about the redevelopment project. But Sunday morning, Zimmer told CNN's Crowley that she didn't speak out before because she didn't think anyone would believe her, adding that she is now ""offering to testify under oath."" CNN's Leigh Ann Caldwell, Chris Frates, Steve Kastenbaum and Cassie Spodak contributed to this report.","Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer's at the center of political controversy again .

"(CNN) -- Iran and six world powers ended talks on Tehran's nuclear program with plans to meet again next month, the EU said Friday. The four-day meeting that came to a close Thursday in Vienna brought together technical experts, said Michael Mann, a spokesman for European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. ""There will now be consultations in capitals, in the expectation that technical talks will continue soon,"" Mann said. The talks come after an interim deal last month aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions in exchange for lifting crippling economic sanctions. That six-month deal, reached between Iran and the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany, eases some $7 billion in economic sanctions in return for limiting aspects of Iran's nuclear program. Iranian state news agency IRNA said the next round of talks will be in Tehran on January 21.","The talks ended on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- It was madness. At Jalalabad Airfield, in eastern Afghanistan in the summer of 2006, a young intelligence analyst named Jacob Whittaker tried with great difficulty to understand exactly what he was hearing. The 10th Mountain Division of the United States Army wanted to do what? Whittaker had to choose his words carefully. He was just a low-ranking ""specialist"" with the Idaho National Guard, a very low man on a very tall totem pole. A round-faced 26-year-old, Whittaker had simple tastes — Boise State football, comic books — and a reputation for mulishness belied by his innocent appearance. Whittaker stared at his superior officer, 2nd Lt. Ryan Lockner, who was running this briefing for him and Sgt. Aaron Ives. Lockner headed intelligence for Task Force Talon, the Army's aviation component at Jalalabad Airfield, in Nangarhar Province, adjacent to the Pakistan border. Military leaders considered this area, officially designated Regional Command East, the most dangerous part of an increasingly dangerous country. Lockner had an assignment. Soldiers from the 10th Mountain — a light infantry division designed for quick deployment and fighting in harsh conditions — had recently come to this hot corner of Afghanistan and would soon be spreading throughout the region, setting up outposts and bases. More specifically, they would be establishing a camp in Nuristan Province. The members of the intelligence team led by Lockner didn't know much about Nuristan, as U.S. forces had generally been focusing their efforts on Kunar Province, which had become a haven for Taliban insurgents and foreign fighters sneaking in from Pakistan to oppose the American ""infidels."" During one operation in Kunar the previous summer, in 2005, 19 U.S. troops — Special Forces — had been killed by such insurgents, and since then, the United States had increased its presence there. Helicopters flying in and out of Kunar Province were fired upon at least twice a week, every week, with small arms and/or rocket-propelled grenades. Tapper on 'the bravest of the brave' Nuristan was farther north, a province so mythically untamed that one of the greatest writers of the English language, Rudyard Kipling, had chosen it as the setting for his 1888 novella ""The Man Who Would Be King."" One of Kipling's British adventurers, Daniel Dravot, describes Nuristan as a place where ""no one has gone ... and they fight, and in any place where they fight a man who knows how to drill men can always be a king."" ""You'll be cut to pieces before you're 50 miles across the border,"" warns Kipling's narrator. ""The people are utter brutes, and even if you reached them you couldn't do anything."" The region's previous brigade commander, Col. Pat Donahue, hadn't thought Nuristan had much strategic value, so conventional forces hadn't been posted there, and no one had troubled to find out much about the native people, the Nuristanis, a distinct and outlying ethnic group within Afghanistan. In a departure from his predecessor's policy, Donahue's replacement — Col. John ""Mick"" Nicholson, the commander of the 10th Mountain Division's 3rd Brigade, known as the Spartan Brigade — ordered the establishment of small outposts throughout the area in the summer of 2006, in an attempt not only to stop the Taliban fighters who were streaming in from Pakistan, often with bushels of weapons, but also to win over the locals, who were predisposed to a suspicion of outsiders. Lockner had just returned from Forward Operating Base Naray, in Kunar Province, where he'd met with officers of the 10th Mountain Division's 3rd Squadron, 71st Cavalry Regiment, or ""3‑71 Cav."" They'd told him of their plan to set up an outpost in the Kamdesh District of Nuristan Province, for which he would be in charge of identifying suitable helicopter landing zones. The new base would sit adjacent to the Nuristan hamlet of Urmul. A small settlement missing from most maps, Urmul was home to fewer than 40 families of Nuristanis, or roughly 200 people, who lived in houses made of wood and rock and mud sealant. The residents were primarily subsistence farmers trying to eke out a living through both crops and livestock, but the U.S. Army knew little more than that about them. Coalition forces likewise had next to no intelligence about the enemy in Nuristan — its numbers, its location, its intentions, or, most important, its capabilities — which was one of the reasons the brass was pushing to build a base there. This was the essential difficulty of the task at hand: The higher-ups in the U.S. Army needed to know about the enemy in this unexplored province, so in order to learn as much as they could, they were going to stick a small group of troops in its midst. For all Lockner knew when he flew over Urmul to reconnoiter, the hamlet might have been Osama bin Laden's secret compound. Hero soldier to get medal of honor . ""They're going to build another outpost,"" Lockner told Whittaker and Ives back at Jalalabad Airfield. ""So I need you to take this terrain analysis I started, finish it, and make it pretty so I can brief it in the morning."" Many troops were far more proficient in PowerPoint than they were with firearms, so Whittaker understood just what Lockner meant by ""make it pretty"": The slides for the presentation needed to look crisp and to make a compelling case. ""Where are they going?"" Whittaker asked. Lockner gestured at the topographical map. ""Right over here, northwest of Naray,"" he said. ""Where the Darreh ye Kushtaz and Landay-Sin Rivers meet."" Whittaker looked at the spot, stunned. ""Right there?"" he asked. ""Right there,"" confirmed Lockner. ""Can you do it?"" ""I can do it; I have all night,"" Whittaker said. ""But sir ... that is a really awful place for a base."" This new camp in the Kamdesh District would, like the dangerous Korangal outpost that their pilots knew too well, be surrounded by higher ground. But whereas the base in the Korangal was situated about halfway up a mountainside, in a former lumberyard, the one in Kamdesh would sit in a cup within the valley's deepest cleft, ringed by three steep mountains that formed part of the 500-mile-long Hindu Kush mountain range. Blocked off on its northern, western, and southern sides by rivers and mountains, it would moreover be a mere 14 miles distant from the official Pakistan border — a porous boundary that meant little to the insurgents who regularly crossed it to kill Americans and Afghan government officials before taking refuge in caves or in the mountains or returning to their haven across the border. The camp would be one of the most remote outposts in this most remote part of a country that was itself cut off from much of the rest of the world, and the area all around it would be filled with people who wanted to kill those stationed there. Defending the indefensible . ""So it's located at the base of a mountain peak?"" Whittaker asked. It didn't take a Powell or a Schwarzkopf to know that as a matter of basic military strategy, it was better to be at the top of a hill than at the bottom of a valley. ""Yes."" ""And it's flanked by a river on the west and another river to the north?"" Whittaker continued. ""And there's no good road to get to it — they're still building that,"" Lockner volunteered. The Army had been coordinating efforts to build up the vulnerable and narrow path from Naray to Kamdesh, but rain, steep cliffs, insurgent threats, and high turnover rates among local construction workers had led to frequent delays. The road, often running along the edge of a cliff that spilled into the Landay-Sin River, was a mere 13 feet wide at its widest, and in some spots only half that — narrower than many military vehicles. A soldier could be killed just driving on that road, without ever coming into contact with a single enemy fighter. ""And it's an eternity away by helicopter if something goes wrong,"" Whittaker said. ""Yup,"" agreed Lockner. ""Sir, this is a really bad idea,"" said Whittaker. ""A. Really. Bad. Idea. Anyone we drop off there is going to die.""","CNN's Jake Tapper tells the story of Compound Outpost Keating in his book .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Communications Commission approved new rules Wednesday to further limit automatically dialed or prerecorded calls know as ""robocalls"" and automated text messages. The FCC's rules go beyond Federal Trade Commission rules that have been in force since 2008. ""Too many telemarketers, aided by autodialers and prerecorded messages, have continued to call consumers who don't want to hear from them,"" said FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski in a statement read at the meeting. These new overlapping rules seek to close loopholes in the existing regulations. Under the new requirements, telemarketers will have to get permission in writing before placing an automated call to a consumer. Previously, companies that had an established business relationship with a particular consumer could call them without permission. For example, another FCC official not authorized to speak publicly explained, a bank could robocall one of its checking account customers to try to sell them insurance. The new rules prohibit that without written permission. Information calls, such as school closing information and flight cancellations, are an exception. They can be made to land-line phones without written permission. Text messages and calls to cell phones are subject to stricter rules. ""Any type of phone call or text to a wireless device needs written consent,"" the FCC official added. Telemarketers also will be required to let consumers easily prevent any future calls. ""Each and every telemarketing robocall will have to include an automated, interactive opt-out mechanism, so that a consumer can revoke consent by pressing just a few keys during the call,"" Genachowski said. The company will have to immediately disconnect the call and add you to their do-not-call list. ""Dead air"" calls also are restricted by the new rules. Some telemarketers place many calls at once guessing how many people will answer the phone; if more people answer than there are operators, the result on the receiver's end is often the silence of a delayed response. The new rules ""strictly"" limit the number of such calls telemarketers can make ""within each calling campaign,"" the FCC said. A telemarketing company that has a real person dialing the phone numbers is not subject to the new rules. ""Consumers' first line of protection against any call is the do-not-call list,"" the FCC official said. Consumers can sue companies who violate these rules, the FCC official explained, adding, ""We also take action based on trends of complaints.""","NEW: Rules address ""continued"" robocalls, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski says .

"(CNN) -- The eagle eyes of his playing partner's caddie halted Rory McIlroy's charge at the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship. McIlory was poised to finish the day one shot behind leader Craig Lee but instead he was handed a two-stroke penalty after Ricardo Gonzalez's bag man threw doubt over McIlroy's play at the second hole. The former world No.1 was subsequently judged to have taken his shot with one foot on the white line that marks the spectator's path on the course. ""I hit my second shot on the second hole just into the left rough, but it was in the spectator crosswalk, so I took a drop, which obviously you're allowed to do out of it,"" McIlroy explained to reporters. ""I didn't notice it but my left foot was still on the white line as I played the shot and you need to take full relief. ""I dropped it in a really bad lie, so actually had I known, I would have taken a better drop. ""It was unfortunate, but that's the rules of this game. I don't feel like I gained any sort of advantage by my foot being on a bit of white paint. ""I have to try to make up the shots as early as possible tomorrow. It gives me a bit of extra motivation."" Phil Mickelson may have squeezed his way through the cut but the American hit a sweet spot in Saturday's third round. The British Open champion sunk nine birdies and an eagle to move two shots adrift of the lead alongside India's Gaganjeet Bhullar. ""I love the fact that I have a chance and that I'm in contention the first tournament out this year,"" Mickelson said. ""I love that I've played better each day. The first day, I felt terrible. The second day, half of it started to come around and today it started to feel pretty good and hopefully I'll be able to build on it again."" At the top of the tree, Lee is hoping for a fairytale finish to the Abu Dhabi tournament as he chases his first European Tour win. ""The quality of the players behind me is nothing I have been used to before,"" said Lee, who holds the lead on 12 under par. ""It's possible -- and fairytales do happen.""","Rory McIlroy handed two-stroke penalty at Abu Dhabi Golf Championship .

"Madrid (CNN) -- The big bet is off. The Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced Friday its planned, multibillion dollar casino and hotel complex that Spaniards called ""EuroVegas"" has been canceled. ""We don't see a path that leads to getting the necessary criteria to move this large-scale development forward. As a result, we will no longer pursue this opportunity,"" said Las Vegas Sands Chairman Sheldon Adelson, the American billionaire political activist, in a statement. The project was officially unveiled to much fanfare in February, and Spanish government officials appeared receptive to the promise of tens of thousands of jobs to build and later operate the casino and hotels, to help get Spain back on its feet economically. It had been scheduled to open in 2017 in a Madrid suburb. Opponents all along said the Vegas-style resort would create only low-skilled and low-paying jobs -- not the development model needed for Spain, and they also seemed concerned the resort would attract organized crime. In February, Las Vegas Sands said it would finance $3.6 billion, or 40%, of the cost of the first phase of the operation, including 12,000 hotel rooms, but would need financing from banks for the rest. A Las Vegas Sands spokeswoman said at the time the entire $22 billion project, when completed over 20 years, could create 250,000 jobs. But media reports since then have indicated a variety of hurdles as Las Vegas Sands and the government negotiated potential terms for the deal. Last month, a Madrid government regional official announced the planned groundbreaking for late this year had been delayed until early 2014, the state-run news agency EFE reported. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said that Las Vegas Sands had made demands regarding tax issues and other conditions that couldn't be met under Spanish and European Union law. Las Vegas Sands will continue its ""intense search for opportunities in Asia,"" the company said. Adelson has built the company into a leading global developer of gambling, entertainment and convention resorts. It owns the Venetian and the Palazzo gambling resorts in Las Vegas and has expanded into Asian markets, including resorts in Singapore and Macau.","Las Vegas Sands Corp. cancels plans for multibillion dollar casino and hotel complex .

"(CNN) -- Over the years, the Winter Olympics has thrown up a variety of competitors that defy logic. There was Jamaica's legendary bobsled team, a cross-country skier from Kenya and Britain's Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards, whose inept performances in 1988 prompted a change in the qualifying rules. Now, one of the world's most famous violinists can be added to the eclectic mix. This weekend, Vanessa Mae -- who has sold over 10 million albums worldwide -- sneaked through qualifying for next month's Olympics. ""She's done it by a whisker, but she's done it,"" manager Giles Holland told the BBC. In Sochi, Mae will compete as Vanessa Vanakorn, using the surname of her Thai father and representing his homeland as well. She may be used to racing through scales, her fingers dancing atop the strings of a violin, but the 35-year-old must now negotiate a very different rhythm as she is pitched into the giant slalom. With the Games starting on February 7, Mae left it late to book her place -- only claiming the relevant qualifying marks this weekend, which the International Ski Federation (FIS) confirmed on Monday. Olympic qualification rules determine that countries without a skier ranked in the world's top 500 can send one male and one female competitor to the Games -- to compete in slalom and giant slalom -- as long as the athletes can achieve a second set of criteria. This was to produce an average of 140 points or fewer over five recognized races. She managed this over the weekend after competing in four giant slalom races in Slovenia, even competing in a national junior championship race where the diminutive Mae, 5ft 3in, stuck out by virtue of being 14 years older than her nearest rival. ""According to the qualification system which we have, which requires her to start at least five slalom or giant slalom races, she has done so,"" said Ana Jelusic, the FIS's Alpine media co-ordinator. ""It also requires her to come below a certain number of FIS points, which in this case is 140. She has done so."" Lifelong Hobby . Mae started skiing at the age of four, a year before she took up the violin, and she describes the sport as her 'lifelong hobby'. Such an attitude fueled her decision to relocate from London to Zermatt, after buying a house in the Swiss resort in 2009, where she lives with long-term boyfriend Lionel Catelan, for whom skiing is also in the blood after growing up in the French town of Val d'IsÃ¨re. The musician will become only the second Winter Olympian to represent Thailand. In 2002, Prawat Nagvajara was so slow on his debut that he was pulled out of his race, before improving -- as it were -- to finish last in his cross country event at the Turin Games four years later. At the age of 10, Mae made her solo debut with the Philharmonia Orchestra in London. Three years later, she was the youngest soloist ever to record the demanding Beethoven and Tchaikovsky violin concertos. Born in Singapore, she grew up in London where she became famous for what she herself has termed ""techno-acoustic fusion"", a mix of classical and modern styles. Mae has said that she will return to her music once her Olympic dream is over.","Violinist Vanessa Mae qualifies for Sochi 2014 in alpine skiing .

"(CNN) -- A heavily publicized murder trial. A horrific school bombing. A parade of con artists, legendary athletes, industrialists and anarchists, radiant movie stars and wearisome politicians. And, soaring over all, Charles Lindbergh. They're all part of ""One Summer: America, 1927,"" Bill Bryson's new book about a handful of months of a tumultuous year. ""It was an extraordinarily crowded summer,"" Bryson says in a phone interview. ""I think it was the most eventful summer any nation has ever had -- certainly in peacetime."" Many of the year's events remain well known: Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic, Babe Ruth's 60 home runs, the debut of the first sound film, ""The Jazz Singer."" Others, though less remembered today, echo eerily almost 90 years later. In New York, a woman named Ruth Brown Snyder murdered her husband. The crime grabbed the attention of the public. The trial, which included her lover, dominated news coverage. It was nicknamed, of course, ""the crime of the century."" In Bath, Michigan, a disgruntled farmer named Andrew Kehoe murdered his wife and set off a truck full of explosives at the local school, killing 38 students and six adults, including himself. It remains the worst school mass murder in American history. In Cleveland, Ohio, construction workers finished topping out the Van Sweringen brothers' masterpiece, Terminal Tower. The developers' structure -- which would be the tallest building in the world outside New York when it opened three years later -- included a railroad station, hotel, department store, restaurants and office building. It was also the toppling tip of the Van Sweringens' house of cards, a heavily leveraged empire that included railroads and real estate. In 1929 they were worth $3 billion; within a few years they would be practically wiped out. But perhaps the most fascinating figures in Bryson's book are the aviators: not just Lindbergh, but such now-forgotten figures as Clarence Chamberlin, Bert Acosta, Floyd Bennett and Francesco de Pinedo. At a time when flying was still incredibly risky -- the stuff of air shows and derring-do -- they dared to head across the Atlantic and to other long-distance destinations. Many didn't make it. All too often, Bryson ends the story of an aviator with the phrase, ""He was never heard from again."" The Britain-based Bryson, a wry and thoughtful author known for books on the Appalachian Trail (""A Walk in the Woods""), the English language (""Mother Tongue"") and the sciences (the award-winning ""A Short History of Nearly Everything""), spoke to CNN from a tour stop in Boston. The following is an edited and condensed version of the interview. CNN: Why this subject? Bill Bryson: For a long time, I'd been vaguely fascinated by the idea that Charles Lindbergh flew the Atlantic and Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in the same summer. I wondered if it was possible to do a dual biography of these two iconic figures. But when I started doing the research, I quickly discovered that though Lindbergh and Ruth were important elements of the summer of 1927, they were only part of it. And that became the story. CNN: What struck you about this summer? It seems the biggest broad-shouldered year of an energetic decade. Bryson: Lots. There were so many things that I'd only barely ever heard of -- or not heard of at all. Certain events that were so momentous I can't believe I'd never heard of them. The one that leaps out is the madman in Michigan who blew up the school. I was astounded. I'd never heard of this at all. The problem was he did it on May 19, 1927, and the very next day Lindbergh flew to Paris and it knocked everything off the front pages. CNN: Why was Lindbergh the through line? Bryson: I didn't realize just how momentous (Lindbergh's flight) was, and how it gripped the whole world. And Lindbergh was far and away the most enigmatic and most fascinating (character). Just imagine if you were 25 years old and suddenly, overnight, became the most famous man on the planet. And not just famous and celebrated, but people are regarding you as a kind of savior. In this painfully symbolic way you've descended from heaven and people are treating you almost as if you've come to save the Earth. It was just ridiculous. But soon afterwards he turned quite ugly and became this great Nazi sympathizer and very much pro-Germany and anti-Britain as the second World War came along, and a very, very much less attractive person. He was a very hard person to get a grasp of. CNN: I enjoy the way you draw connections between things -- people who crossed paths at the time, and events that resonate down through today. Bryson: I painted myself into a corner by writing a whole book on this one period. The summer of 1927 came to an end, but nothing else did -- all of these peoples' lives went on. I suddenly found myself in this position of writing an epilogue, and you're supposed to be wrapping things up, but you're actually condensing long and busy lives into a paragraph or two. CNN: But even the quick brush strokes -- the Van Sweringens, for example. They could be the overextended moguls of today. Bryson: It did strike me that the Van Sweringens were not really all that different from Charles Ponzi (who makes a cameo appearance in ""One Summer""). The only real difference was that Ponzi was an out-and-out fraudster. But the Van Sweringens -- their whole empire was built on exactly the same kind of sleight of hand, and looking a lot more sturdy and wealthy than they really were. It was all based on inflating things and building these pyramids -- not unlike Ponzi. CNN: The society was also more rural, and there didn't seem to be the same fear of death. Bryson: That was what struck me again and again with the aviators. They seemed fearless. They were doing the most hair-raising, dangerous things. After Lindbergh's flight, Clarence Chamberlin was persuaded to be the first person to take off from a ship. And he admits just before he doesn't know how to swim! You think, was this guy a complete fool, or was he really that brave? And I think it was a mixture of both. The idea of getting in those planes flying around your own town was scary enough, but getting in them and trying to fly across an empty ocean without any navigation equipment was unbelievable. And yet you look at pictures of them as they're climbing in the planes and they look as confident as they would as if they were going to the grocery store. CNN: How do you go about picking your subjects? Bryson: It's always a combination of things. The basic challenge of any book is you know you're going to be working on it for three or four years or more. So you want to have a subject that will keep you engaged. But then I have to factor in practicalities -- how much travel will this involve, can I make this appeal to English-speaking audiences. These are not things you can always resolve, but you have to take them into account. With ""At Home"" (Bryson's history of residences) I promised my wife I would spend my time at home. I had done a lot of traveling, and I told her I would do something where I could go to a library all day and come back for dinner every night. And it occurred to me, what if I did a history of the world but from the perspective of my own house? This one, since I live abroad, I do get hankerings to come home sometime and reconnect with America. I like to do books in which a lot of the research and the writing and the thinking revolves around something American. So that was indulging my homesickness, and a very, very longstanding desire to write something about baseball. CNN: Do you take the time you spend on planes and ponder the aviators you wrote about? Bryson: It's hard not to! I urge you to go to the Smithsonian and just look at these little planes. I was standing with one of the curators and you can see that (Lindbergh's plane), the Spirit of St. Louis is just fabric. I asked how sturdy was it? Could you poke a hole in it with your finger? And he said yes. You could demolish the Spirit of St. Louis with your bare hands in about a minute and a half. It's just amazing.","Bill Bryson's latest book, ""One Summer,"" is about summer of 1927 .

"(CNN) -- The notion of postcard-perfect villages steeped in old-world charm has inspired centuries of travelers to fan out across Europe, seeking its secluded hamlets. As a result, the continent's scenic spots rarely remain hidden for long. It doesn't take much to make a charming village feel uncomfortably popular. Consider the five fishing villages that make up Italy's Cinque Terre, where an evening summertime stroll often feels like shuffling through a packed amusement park, complete with overpriced restaurants and souvenir shops. The first requirement of a beautiful village is a scenic location, whether among the Norwegian fjords or the sun-splashed Greek isles. But the finest also have distinctive features like the plaza ringed with high-gabled pastel façades in Telč, Czech Republic, or the unforgettable Victorian castle rising above the thatched roofs of Cong, Ireland. Reaching some of these European beauties requires extra effort, yet the rewards are dazzling. Your eyes will thank you. Tellaro, Italy . Snaking cliff-top roads and a minuscule harbor have protected Tellaro from the wave of tourism that has swallowed other Ligurian seaside towns like Vernazza and Portofino. A jumble of pastel buildings clings vertiginously to the sheer cliffs of Tellaro, which occupies the easternmost tip of the Golfo dei Poeti. It's named for the poets and literary icons like Lord Byron and D. H. Lawrence who have sought inspiration in this Mediterranean haven. Finding Main Street on a motorcycle . Bibury, England . The hilly Cotswold region is a designated ""Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty"" in southwestern England, and one of its loveliest villages is Bibury, where verdant meadows abut ancient stone cottages with steep pitched roofs. The River Coln, which bisects the village, teems with trout, but the most scenic area is Arlington Row, a lane of sepia-hued cottages built in the 17th century to house weavers from the nearby Arlington Mill. Travel + Leisure: Best walking shoes for travel . Hallstatt, Austria . The storybook town of Hallstatt in central Austria enjoys a gorgeous setting on the bank of the Hallstätter See, between the pristine lake and a lush mountain that rises dramatically from the water's edge. A history of salt mining dating back thousands of years has translated into enduring prosperity for the town, which is most evident in the beautiful square ringed with ivy-covered buildings. Best affordable island hotels . Folegandros, Greece . Santorini's streets sag with admirers, but on Folegandros, a nearby island in the Cyclades, you'll find similar architecture—streets paved in slate, whitewashed buildings decorated with colorful flowers, the occasional Greek Orthodox church with a bright blue dome—without the crowds. For a secluded swim, trek to Katergo, a sheltered stretch of beach where gentle, emerald-blue waves lap the pebbly shore. Travel + Leisure: America's ugliest college campuses . Colmar, France . French and German influences commingle in this well-preserved Alsatian village, where local bakeries sell both croissants and kugelhopf, and restaurants specialize in foie gras and sauerkraut (or choucroute). A range of architectural styles, from German Gothic to French Neo-Baroque, can be spotted in the old town, which was spared destruction during World War II—thanks in part to the historical beauty of its cobblestoned lanes, quiet canals, and half-timbered houses. Reine, Norway . North of the Arctic Circle, Reine is a pretty fishing village in the Lofoten archipelago, an area of starkly beautiful Nordic wilderness, where sapphire bays punctuate fjords and mountains. Many of the bright red fishermen's cabins (called rorbuer) have been converted into comfortable cottages for visitors that offer direct access to the Norwegian Sea. Settle in for a front-row view of the night sky and its mesmerizing entertainment, from summer's midnight sun to winter's northern lights. Travel + Leisure: Best money saving tips for European travel . Telč, Czech Republic . Residents of Telč, a small town in south Moravia, were once quite competitive about the beauty of their homes, as is evident today on the elongated main square, where one building is lovelier than the next. The Baroque- and Renaissance-style façades, featuring high gables painted in pale pastels, now support small shops and cafés. A grand Renaissance-era château and large fish-filled ponds surround the square. See more of Europe's most beautiful villages . Planning a getaway?

"(Wired) -- Mars is a crazy place. In recent years we've discovered some of the strangest things on the Red Planet: ice spiders, Swiss cheese terrain, and perfectly spiral-shaped lava tubes. And the more we explore our near planetary neighbor, the weirder the things we find get. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling Mars since 2006, provides the clearest and highest-resolution images of the planet's surface. Looking through the image archive of its HiRISE camera, which can resolve things about a meter wide on the ground, reveals a vast supply of strange and wonderful things. Here we share some of the orbiter's most recent weird sightings from the last few months. The images provide incredible scientific insights into Mars. But, perhaps just as important, they are beautiful, fascinating, and reflective of the alien world that sits not too far from our own. Just a note on the colors in these images: HiRISE has cameras that see in slightly different wavelengths than our own eyes. Many of the photos it produces are in ""false color,"" meaning the different wavelengths have been assigned colors for purposes of clarity or to highlight an important feature. There are no actual turquoise dunes on Mars. But the false color pictures do allow scientists to differentiate various textures and materials on Mars. Water discovered in Martian soil .

"(CNN) -- Like its trains, contract talks involving Bay Area Rapid Transit remained at a standstill Friday night -- with no plans for even a return to the negotiating table to resolve the system's second strike in three months. The standoff left many of Oakland and San Francisco's iconic bridges, streets and freeways clogged even more than usual during both the morning and evening rush hours on Friday, the first day in which the nation's fifth-largest train system has been shut down. Union officials, at 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET), publicly detailed what they described as a new plan to end the strike. It includes returning to the previous contract language on all outstanding issues, according to negotiator Josie Mooney. They also offered to bring in a mediator to address the points of contention -- which it says does not include the economic part of any deal, because it says that already has been agreed to -- but rather other issues. ""These (are) real, genuine, thoughtfully written ... steps that will settle all disputes on the table,"" said Roxanne Sanchez, president of the local Service Employees International Union. ""...It's not we win or they lose, but the trains (would be) running."" BART management quickly dismissed the proposal ""as simply a repeat"" of a previous ""unacceptable"" offer, said spokesman Jim Allison. BART is open to mediation, but only if it's on the whole package rather than ""cherry-picking the parts they like and leaving behind the parts they don't like."" ""We're calling on union leaders to return to the bargaining table that continues (to address) all of the issues as a whole,"" Allison said. BART, whose system normally serves 26 communities including San Francisco and Oakland, has chartered buses during the strike for highly limited but free rush-hour service. Buses departed certain stations in the morning directly for San Francisco, then carried passengers back to those stations in the afternoon. That was expected to help about 6,000 passengers in each direction, according to BART. Still, that's just a fraction of the roughly 400,000 people who use the service daily. And for some of them -- like those behind a petition to ban BART strikes, as is done for other transit systems around the nation -- patience is running thin. ""I think the public would have such bad blood this time around for both BART and the unions,"" BART rider Kyle Brunnette, 53, told CNN affiliate KTVU before trains stopped earlier this week. BART and workers' unions have been negotiating a new contract for months. Union leaders said the latest strike was called because management made a late push to change worker rules, the framework governing issues such as how work is assigned and what shifts people can work. This came after the unions made concessions to reach an ""economic framework agreement"" -- after six months of talks -- on wages, pensions and health care, Pete Castelli, a local executive director of the Service Employees International Union, said Friday. ""Basically what management did was produce, in essence, a poison pill, saying, 'Great, we made this amazing progress after six months, we have an economic framework agreement. But wait, there's more. You must take this now,' "" Castelli said. ""At that point ... the negotiations broke down."" BART objected to that characterization in a couple of ways. First, the sides haven't agreed on wages, BART spokesman Rick Rice said. ""We're still at a 12% pay increase over four years (at 3% per year),"" he said. ""The union's last proposal was higher than that."" Second, Rice said, changes to worker rules -- such as ditching a regulation that requires communicating with handwritten notes and faxing in favor of using more modern technology -- have ""been in our package since April 1."" ""How they can think this is a surprise is simply not credible,"" he said. Castelli said he wants BART to agree to arbitration on the worker rules, but not on the economic issues, which he considered all but set. Rice, though, said that was unacceptable. ""We can't split the package apart,"" he said. ""We can't take one part of this -- the work rules -- to arbitration (and) leave the rest of it on the table to negotiate."" BART said earlier this week that its ""best and final proposal"" included the wage raises as well as increases in pensions and medical coverage. The BART board would take the whole package -- ""because we do not have agreement on the salary increases,"" she said -- to binding arbitration. The unions seek ""20% plus salary increases,"" she said. ""The issues that remain unresolved are not minor. We cannot get tired and give up. They get to the heart of BART's need to function efficiently and economically,"" the BART general manager said. Castelli apologized to the area's commuters. ""We're very sorry. We understand that this strike -- what it does to the Bay Area riders, and we understand that it is a hardship. ... We apologize,"" he said. ""We urge the public to contact the BART district and tell them to finish negotiating a fair deal with our union."" BART workers also went on strike in the summer, paralyzing the San Francisco regional transportation system for four days in July. CNN's Greg Botelho and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","NEW: BART rejects union's latest offer, urges return to negotiating table, spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Both ""12 Years A Slave"" and ""Gravity"" lost out on the best ensemble prize at Saturday's Screen Actors Guild Awards, but both films were still celebrating when the weekend ended. At the Producers Guild of America Awards on Sunday, the two critically acclaimed projects won the ceremony's big prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck producer of the year award in theatrical motion pictures. The award is given out in recognition of the ""finest production work"" of the year, but has also been a pretty solid predictor of which film will walk away with the best picture Oscar. But with Sunday's tie -- the first of its kind in the PGA's history -- prognosticators may have a harder time figuring out if it's Alfonso Cuaron's ""Gravity"" that has a lock on best picture, or Steve McQueen's ""12 Years A Slave."" On the animated film side, ""Frozen"" was also honored for its production work, while ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Modern Family"" were awarded prizes for outstanding production of a TV drama and comedy, respectively.","Darryl F.

"Tallahassee, Florida (CNN) -- Bogus court papers that allowed two convicted murderers to walk out of a Florida prison are part of a ""cottage industry"" that enabled one other jailbreak and several more attempts, the state's police chief said Monday. ""We know today of five other instances"" in which Florida convicts used forged documents in an attempt to shave some time off their sentences, said Jerry Bailey, commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The seven instances of alleged forgery involve six inmates because one inmate was allegedly involved in two forgeries, authorities said Tuesday. Also Tuesday, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the forgeries or inmates' escapes. And the Florida attorney general's office is offering another reward of up to $10,000. State officials have been investigating the scam for about a year and had warned prosecutors about the schemes over the summer, Bailey said. ""We have a confidential source that has advised us that there was a cottage industry, if you will,"" he said. ""An individual was able to construct these documents for $8,000."" Friend tipped off police to whereabouts of escaped Florida inmates . Authorities say Charles Walker and Joseph Jenkins, who were recaptured Saturday night, used a fraudulent order from a judge to get out of the prison in the Panhandle where they were serving life terms. In the past two years, three other inmates in that prison and one at another lockup have made similar attempts to get themselves released, Bailey said. One of those inmates, Jeffrey Forbes, now faces trial on forgery and attempted escape charges, Orange County State Attorney Jeffrey Ashton said. Forbes had been convicted of attempting to kill a law enforcement officer and had been sentenced to life in prison, Ashton said in a written statement last week. ""It is now clear that the use of forged court documents to obtain release from prison is an ongoing threat which all law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, court clerks and prison officials must address and stop,"" he said. An inmate held on stolen-check charges in St. Petersburg used fake papers to get out for about 24 hours in 2009 before being recaptured, Pinellas County prosecutors said. Walker and Jenkins were taken into custody Saturday evening in Panama City, where they were waiting for a ride to arrive from Atlanta. Bailey said they are not cooperating with the inquiry, and investigators are tracking their forged paperwork ""to try to determine who initiated the fraud and who along the way may have harbored these fugitives."" The investigation includes the use of DNA tests on the documents in hopes of trying to figure out who produced them, he said. He said investigators have identified suspects but aren't prepared to make arrests. Walker and Jenkins are both 34 and had been serving life terms without parole for unrelated killings. Jenkins left the prison in North Carrabelle, south of Tallahassee, on September 27, and Walker left on October 8, according to authorities. A tip from an acquaintance of one of them led to their arrests at a Panama City motel, Bailey said. The legal-looking documents the men used contained bogus reproductions of several key players' signatures, including those of Ashton or the assistant state attorney and Belvin Perry, the chief judge for Florida's 9th Judicial Circuit, which includes Orange and Osceola counties. They bore the seal of the Orange County clerk of court's office. ""They are excellent fakes,"" Perry said. The judge said his signature is easy to find online on documents related to the high-profile trial of Casey Anthony. Anthony was acquitted in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. ""People, particularly people with criminal minds, come up with ingenious ways to beat the system,"" Perry said. ""They have nothing but time on their hands to think of things."" In an order issued Monday, Perry laid out new rules for county clerks in his circuit to keep fake orders from getting real inmates released, requiring them to confirm an order in writing with the judge's office. And Mike Crews, the head of Florida's Department of Corrections, said he has ordered prison officials to check with the judge to make sure a release order is legitimate. CNN's Kim Segal, Matt Smith and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Two rewards of up to $10,000 are offered in forgeries of court papers .

"(CNN) -- Van Johnson, whose boyish looks and earnest manner made him a Hollywood heartthrob in the 1940s and '50s, died Friday in an assisted-care facility, a friend told CNN. Van Johnson and Judy Garland in ""In the Good Old Summertime,"" one of many musicals in his lengthy career. Johnson, 92, died around 11 a.m. of natural causes at the Tappan Zee Manor in Nyack, New York, where he had lived for seven years, said Wendy Bleiweiss. Johnson's career stretched over six decades and across genres, from comedies and war films, such as ""The Caine Mutiny"" and ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo,"" to Broadway musicals and television shows, including a guest spot as the Minstrel on the campy 1960s series, ""Batman,"" according to Turner Classic Movies' Web site. The red-haired, freckle-faced actor's youthful charm earned him a huge teen following in his heyday. He became known as the ""voiceless Sinatra,"" despite a singing voice that landed him roles alongside June Allyson and Judy Garland in ""Two Girls and a Sailor"" and ""In the Good Old Summertime,"" according to TCM.com. Johnson was born August 25, 1916, to a plumber and housewife in Newport, Rhode Island. He was 16 years old when he left Rhode Island for New York City so he could forge a career in acting, Bleiweiss said. A few years later, he got his break from Lucille Ball, she said. ""She saw this redhead kid and said, 'Let's give him a break. He seems like he can do some acting,' "" Bleiweiss said. Johnson made his Broadway debut in 1936 in ""New Faces of 1936"" before legendary director-playwright George Abbott hired him as a chorus member and understudy to the three male leads in Rodgers and Hart's ""Too Many Girls"" in 1939. The next year, Abbott cast him as a chorus boy and Gene Kelly's understudy in Rodgers and Hart's groundbreaking musical ""Pal Joey,"" according to TCM.com. His film debut followed in 1940 with a role in the chorus of ""Too Many Girls."" While en route to a screening in 1942, he was in a car wreck that left him with a metal plate in his head and kept him out of the military. But that didn't stop him from acting in war films. Two years later, he received top billing in ""Two Girls and a Sailor."" Other big roles included ""A Guy Named Joe,"" ""Brigadoon"" and ""The Caine Mutiny."" In 1947, Johnson married former actor Eve Lynn Johnson, who had previously been married to a close friend of Johnson's, Keenan Wynn. The two did not have children and divorced in 1968, according to TCM.com . Johnson had a daughter, Schuyler Van Johnson, by another woman, according to TCM.com. As Johnson entered middle age, his features grew heavy but he still managed to find offbeat roles in films including ""The Bottom of the Bottle,"" an unabashed melodrama in which he played an alcoholic, and ""23 Paces to Baker Street"" as a blind detective. As film roles became scarce, Johnson filled the gaps with stage work. He appeared in ""The Music Man"" in London, England, in 1961 and returned to Broadway in 1962 for ""Come on Strong."" In Woody Allen's 1985 comedy, ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" Johnson played one of the actors trapped inside the film screen in a parody of sorts of films from the 1930s. In 1987, Johnson was praised for his work in the Broadway production of ""La Cage aux Folles."" He last appeared on stage four years ago in ""Love Letters"" in a community theater in nearby Suffern, New York, but decided afterward that he would do no more, Bleiweiss said. ""He said he had seen it and done it all and now he was just going to sit back and take it easy. Those were his words,"" she said. Johnson retained much of his youthful energy as he grew older, and became a frequent interview subject on the old days of Hollywood and his lengthy career, TCM.com said. Bleiweiss said she met Johnson when he moved into the home, where she was a case manager at the time. ""He still was tall and striking,"" she said. ""He was one of the all-time old actors."" His ability to communicate was hampered by the loss of his hearing. Instead, he passed the time by painting, needlepoint and crocheting, she said. Though he didn't cook, he loved watching cooking shows and reruns of ""The Golden Girls,"" she said. Bleiweiss said Johnson was estranged from his daughter and stepchildren for most of his life, but children brightened his day. ""When he saw them, he'd smile and wave to them,"" she said. ""It always brought a smile to his face."" A private service will be held.","Johnson died Friday morning at 92 in an assisted-living facility in Nyack, New York .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Beaten with bicycle chains, burned with hot irons and bashed with a shoe, the case of Indonesian domestic helper Kartika Puspitasari -- whose Chinese employers were jailed this week over the assaults -- highlights just how tough Hong Kong can be for some of the city's thousands of foreign domestic helpers. For many of these estimated 292,000 workers, the city's highly regulated if Spartan work conditions are a luxury. ""I worked in Lebanon between 2005 and 2006 and Hong Kong is much, much better,"" domestic helper Marie Reyes told CNN. ""The minimum wage in Lebanon is $US200 (per month) but absolutely no one paid that. We were paid $150 and were locked into three-year contracts and we were required to work seven days a week."" For vulnerable groups like Overseas Filipino Workers, or OFWs as they are known in the Philippines, basic political stability is another of Hong Kong's attractions. Read more: Convicted of human trafficking . ""At the time I was in Beirut, the Israelis attacked the city with rockets and I was so scared, all I wanted to do was get to the Philippines Embassy and get out,"" Reyes said. ""My employers were in London at the time and we were just two domestic helpers in an empty house with rockets falling everywhere. Locked in . ""It was so nerve-wracking because my employers said once we'd left the house, as far as they were concerned we'd left the job and we couldn't go back again. ""Even when we'd grabbed our passports and work permits and got out the front gate, no taxi driver was willing to drive us to the embassy because it was in a Muslim area of the city that was under fire."" Read more: Hong Kong's foreign maids lose residency fight . Domestic helpers are guaranteed a minimum wage of $HK3,920 ($US505) a month but are required to live in with their employers, a situation that support groups for domestic helpers say contributes to abuse. Hong Kong's Mission For Migrant Workers (MFMW) released a study this year based on interviews with more than 3,000 foreign domestic workers, and found that almost one third had no proper accommodation within the house. No privacy . ""They do not have their own room provided and have to either share the bedroom with other members of the household or sleep in common areas of the apartment, such as the living room, study or playroom where there is very little privacy,"" the study reported. ""Some even sleep in unsuitable spaces such as the bathroom, toilets, veranda, corridor, kitchen and storage rooms, with only makeshift beds on top of ovens, cupboards or bathtubs. There are FDWs that are forced to share the room with young adult male members of the household,"" it added. MFMW Director Cynthia Ca Abdon-Tellez told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post that the government requirement that maids must live with their employer meant they had nowhere to run when they were abused. She said the decision should be left to the employers and the maids whether they live together. She also urged the government to scrap a policy that requires domestic helpers to leave Hong Kong just two weeks after their contracts expire, saying it did not give workers enough time to find new work. ""It often forces the helpers to endure abuses so they can hold on to their jobs,"" she said, adding that they needed the jobs to support their families back home. Indonesian Foreign Domestic Worker Ganika Diristiani, chairwoman of the Association of Indonesian Migrant Workers in Hong Kong, told the SCMP agency fees that could often amount to HK$21,000 (US$2,708) -- deductible from a foreign domestic worker's first seven months of salary -- were another reason so many helpers tolerated unfair treatment. For Marie Reyes, however, live-in arrangements, especially with demanding employers, means that as a foreign domestic worker you are on call 24 hours a day, six days a week. ""You can be woken up any time of the night just to get a glass of water,"" she said. ""Living outside is what all domestic helpers want -- it means you can finally get some rest.""","Couple sentenced to jail over abuse highlights tough environment for domestic helpers in HK .

"(CNN) -- At least five people have been killed in the grenade attack on a minibus in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, the country's Interior Ministry said Saturday on its official Twitter account. An attacker was among those killed. Other people were injured in the strike, strongly condemned by the ministry. The blast occurred in the predominantly Somali neighborhood of Pangani. The grenade tore through the bus, blew out windows and sent debris flying into the busy street. Security forces were sifting through the wreckage for clues on who might be responsible. The attack is the deadliest in Nairobi since the September siege of an upscale mall by the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab, an affiliate of al Qaeda, where 67 people were killed.","A minibus was attacked .

"(CNN) -- At least two people were killed and four were critically injured Monday in a plant accident in Omaha, Nebraska, authorities said. The incident happened about 10 a.m. CT at International Nutrition, a company that produces feed and other products for livestock and poultry. ""I heard the explosion and stuff started falling, so I ducked for cover,"" worker Nate Lewis told CNN affiliate KETV. ""It was pitch black in there. All I could see was fire. I had to feel my way out of the place. I couldn't see anything."" There were 38 people at the plant at the time of the incident, interim Omaha fire Chief Bernard Kanger said. Ten of the injured people needed a trip to the hospital, the chief said, adding that four were initially in critical condition. Seven other people were treated at the scene, he said. Kanger said two people had died. One was identified by police as 53-year-old Keith Everett. The other body remained in the facility after officials called off recovery efforts due to cold weather and high winds. Both of the workers who died were discovered on the second floor. The second body should be removed Tuesday, but it will be a very labor-intensive recovery, Kanger said. The chief said he believed all other people at the plant had been accounted for as of Monday night, but they will double-check Tuesday to make sure there were no visitors or workers who had dropped by. An employee told KETV that he heard noises, saw fire and sprinted for his life. ""I just heard a crack pop and big ball of fire, and I just took off running when I heard the first crack,"" worker Jamar White ""That's all I could do was get out of the way and make sure I was OK."" School, neighborhood evacuated after Tennessee plant fire . Kanger said the cause of the industrial accident is under investigation, and officials are not to prepared to say it was caused by an explosion. ""What we do know is there was a significant event that occurred, causing catastrophic failure of the structure,"" Kanger said. He said that the second and third stories of the facility collapsed, sending tens of thousands of pieces of concrete, steel and sheet metal pounding through to the first floor. About 50 firefighters responded to the 911 call. One plant worker, who was conscious and talking, had to be rescued from under debris by firefighters who were unsure whether conditions were stable. It took about 10 to 15 minutes for emergency crews to cut through the concrete and steel. Another two workers were stranded on a beam, Kanger said. There were at least four ladder rescues, he added. A spokesman for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration said OSHA investigators were at the plant, where part of the building had collapsed. Scott Allen said it is too early to determine the cause of the accident. According to OSHA records obtained by CNN, International Nutrition Inc. has been cited for 35 OSHA violations over the past 40 years -- most notably for seven violations following the August 20, 2002, death of a 45-year-old male employee who fell into a mixing tank and was mutilated by an auger. International Nutrition also was fined $10,000 by OSHA in 2013 after a lengthy investigation found six violations, including two related to electrical safety standards for machines that were undergoing maintenance, Allen said. International Nutrition isn't on OSHA's Severe Violator Enforcement Program, a list of companies that have knowingly disregarded safety regulations. OSHA investigators will lead the accident investigation, while Omaha police will lead the death investigations, Kanger said. Kanger said International Nutrition had cooperated with investigators. 5 killed, 12 injured in explosion at chemical plant in Japan .

"(CNN) -- The horrific new report accusing Syria's embattled regime of torturing and killing thousands of detainees in government custody may not be a game-changer for the peace talks set to open in Switzerland on Wednesday, but they may well shift the narrative -- if only for a day. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has played some powerful cards ahead of the Geneva 2 talks. He has cranked up the airstrikes in Aleppo, Syria's biggest city and one of the main flashpoints of the three-year civil war that has devastated the country. And he sent Foreign Minister Walid Moallem to Moscow last week to announce a cease-fire proposal in an attempt to set the stage for opposition groups to look bad if they don't agree to the deal. But when Syrian officials step in front of the cameras in Switzerland this week, the questions won't be about ceasefire deals. They'll be about the report, first revealed by CNN and the Guardian in an exclusive on Monday, alleging systematic ""crimes against humanity"" being committed against prisoners in Syrian jails. 4 things to know about Syria . There may be moments of discomfort for Foreign Minister Moallem here, but they'll be fleeting ones. It would be quite normal for the Syrians to question the authenticity of the photos depicting torture and starvation of prisoners, to brush the issue aside or shift the focus to the atrocities they claim have been committed by rebels (or ""terrorists,"" as they're known in government parlance). We certainly won't see the Assad regime admitting culpability over this. And while the timing of the report's release clearly seems intended to push some much-needed wind into the sails of the groups opposed to Assad , it's hard to see how they'll benefit much from the new revelations. Organizationally, the opposition is a mess. Several of the largest groups, including the Syrian National Council, aren't even showing up to the talks. Rival rebel factions are massacring each other by the hundreds in the streets and alleys of cities across Syria. Even worse, none of the politicians who make up the majority of the Western-backed Syrian opposition are in the country, so they aren't in control of the military forces battling Assad's troops on the ground. The U.S. State Department said they hope a few rebel army leaders show up to the talks, but again, who are they and what weight do they actually carry? The principal rebel commander the U.S. was backing, Free Syrian Army general Salim Idris, fled the country in December. The influence of the group is being increasingly diminished by Islamist and al Qaeda-backed militants who the U.S. does not support. All in all, no one is expecting any major breakthroughs during one day of talks. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who will attend the first day of talks in Montreux before they move to Geneva over the weekend, has said in the past that negotiations to end the Vietnam war took years. The best case scenario for these talks is more talks -- and that none of the parties get up and storm out. In terms of negotiations, when will we see some substantial compromises? Assad recently told reporters that we're still months away from him announcing a date for planned 2014 national elections. It seems increasingly likely that Assad will again run for president. But there's always the possibility that he could use the ongoing war to postpone elections altogether. Let's face it: how could you really hold elections when eight million people are displaced in Syria? The regime would control the balloting and accounting processes: who would provide security? It would be crazy to think international monitors could reliably observe national polls with a full-blown war happening all around them. If -- and probably when -- Assad won an election, it is clear the opposition would simply continue to refuse to recognize him as the legitimate leader of Syria. But until the yet-to-be announced date for a poll approaches, we aren't going to get to a decisive moment in peace talks. It's too early to say, and we're still so far away from any compromise points. EXCLUSIVE: Gruesome Syria photos may prove torture by Assad regime .

"(CNN) -- The past week following the disclosure that French President François Hollande has allegedly been having an affair with an actress, Julie Gayet, has brought to the fore the need in that country to clarify -- or do away with -- the status of First Lady, which until now has been ambiguous. In a news conference last week at the Elysee Palace, Hollande did not confirm or deny the reports of an affair, but admitted that he and France's first lady were going through ""painful moments."" The term ""First Lady"" is likely to have originated in the 19th century in the United States where she has a legal status as a de facto officer of government with her own budget and staff. In France though, the First Lady has no lawful status despite usually having an office of her own and a handful of staff whose salaries are covered by tax-payers. ""There should definitely not be an official status,"" said Armelle Le Bras-Chopard, a political science professor and author of a book published in 2009 entitled ""Première Dame, second rôle"" (First Lady, supporting role). ""If there were to be a status what functions would this cover? They are for the most part archaic and traditional."" In the rest of Europe most spouses of heads of state are not in the spotlight and do not campaign with their partners. ""We are talking about two different cultures,"" said Le Bras-Chopard. ""In the U.S. men who are presidential candidates are always married, and their wives participate in their campaigns. Once they have been elected, their wives, the children and the dog are all visible."" ""We should take inspiration from the model in northern Europe where each person continues their own life,"" said Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist candidate campaigning to become the next mayor of Paris. ""When a president is elected one doesn't vote for a couple. I am voting for a person, not their family."" Petra Gustafsson, a spokeswoman at Sweden's Embassy in Paris confirmed that the Swedish Prime Minister's wife is mostly absent from all events (the couple recently divorced) and that the role of First Lady is ""something unique to U.S. society,"" even if Sweden's constitutional monarchy does provide the public with a figurehead of First Lady in the form of the Queen. In Germany, Angela Merkel is head of government, not head of state, and even though her husband Joachim Sauer has no ceremonial role, he takes an unusually backseat role. ""Look at Merkel's husband. No one ever criticizes her for not being accompanied by him on official visits,"" commented Le Bras-Chopard. ""He does not check that the flowers are just right on the tables when there are official events,"" The role of First Lady in France, however, has become increasingly conspicuous over the years. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy's ex-wife, Cécilia, ran his election campaign, his current wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, a singer and former top model was already a public figure, and President Hollande's companion, Valérie Trierweiler, a journalist, lurched into her undefined role under intense media coverage. Trierweiler's situation is even more complex given the fact that the couple is not married. Herein lies the ambiguity in France, a modern state that, lest anyone forget, removed its monarchy over 220 years ago. Probably more than in any other European country, the President's spouse or companion is a highly public figure. Yet the idea of a woman giving up her career in order to become First Lady is becoming less and less acceptable. French lawyer Muriel Kahn Herrmann embodies this contradiction: ""For me, personally, it is of absolutely no importance that the president has a spouse. I would vote for a president who is a bachelor or gay. But in reality, whether we like it or not, the First Lady is unavoidable, she exists, and therefore we should legalize the situation and be precise about her functions."" Cécilia Attias, who was Nicolas Sarkozy's First Lady for five months until their divorce, and recently published her autobiography, last week called for the First Lady's status to be clarified. However, she said, and Kahn Herrmann agreed, once the role has been decided on, it should be up to each woman to be able to choose whether or not to leave her career."" But Le Bras-Chopard echoes what more and more men and women in France are expressing: ""Instead of crystalizing a tradition we need to see things differently. Today women exist in their own right. They become public but only because of a private relationship. The solution for our day and age is that there no longer be a First Lady."" The situation in France has opened a wider debate: in societies in which divorce and partnerships are more frequent and in which there will inevitably be a gay man or woman as head of state, the concept of ""First Spouse"" seems increasingly anachronistic. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Olivia Snaije.","Olivia Snaije: President François Hollande's alleged affair has spotlighted First Lady status .

"(CNN) -- A court's investigation into alleged financial irregularities by football club Barcelona in its purchase of Brazilian superstar Neymar should be expanded to include tax evasion by the club, a Spanish prosecutor argued Wednesday. Prosecutor Jose Perals formally asked a judge, who is already investigating a former Barcelona president in the case, to expand the preliminary investigation, according to a copy of his writ viewed by CNN. The prosecutor alleges that the club avoided paying 9 million euros (more than $12 million) in taxes on Neymar's signing and transfer, corresponding to contracts signed in 2011 and 2013, through a series of financial maneuvers. Neymar joined Barcelona in June 2013, with his father -- who doubles as his agent -- having entered into an initial contract with the Spanish giants in late 2011. In a statement on the club website, Barcelona said its ""dealings with respect to this operation, and in light of all information available, was at all times in line with the relevant legal legislation."" Barca said its lawyers will appear in court ""within the next few days in order to defend its interests and rights."" ""We express our total willingness to collaborate with the justice authorities in this matter, as we have done since the issue arose,"" it added. But Barcelona's former president, Sandro Rosell, who resigned last month after a judge agreed to investigate a lawsuit against him for irregularities in the Neymar deal, has already denied any wrongdoing. Judge Pablo Ruz opened the investigation last month after a legal complaint from one of the members of this fan-owned club. The request to expand the investigation came Wednesday in a eight-page writ from the prosecutor, who alleges that he's ""become aware of a series of economic transactions by the club, and in favor of various companies, related to the signing of Neymar da Silva Santos Jr., based at times on simulated contracts."" It may take several days for Ruz to consider the prosecutor's request at Spain's National Court in Madrid, said a court spokesman, who by custom is not identified. The investigation originally came after season-ticket holder Jordi Cases complained that the amount paid to bring Neymar from Brazilian club Santos was more than the reported fee of 57.1 million euros. A day after Rosell resigned, the club released figures that showed that Barca actually paid 86.2 million euros for Neymar. Cases' lawyer, Felipe Izquierdo, earlier told CNN that other Barcelona executives, still working at the club after Rosell's resignation, also allegedly signed some of the contracts that brought Neymar to the club. Barcelona has confirmed to CNN that one of those signatories was former club VP, and now President, Josep Maria Bartomeu. -- Piers Edwards and Chris Murphy contributed to this report.","A Spanish prosecutor wants investigation into Neymar deal to include all Barca management .

"(CNN) -- The Web is set to change our lives dramatically over the next decade. This will also raise questions about the use of personal data and the need to balance new powers with ethics. Here are five ways you can expect the explosion in technology to impact you: . 1) Artificial intelligence and ultra-smart software engines will be embedded everywhere. They will be largely invisible yet become indispensable for most Internet users, and will combine dozens of data streams harvested from our digital breadcrumbs. Read more: Le Web's next ten years . Mobile devices are the key to this empire and the convergence of TV and the Internet (known as Social TV) will add yet another dimension to this exponential trend: The TV will know who you are. Powerful, fast, totally customized and self-learning algorithms will feed off our personal data streams, giving us an ever-expanding and free choice of seemingly harmless anticipatory services (think Google Now x 100). Prediction engines will be able to give a ""heads-up"" on anything from weather, to stock market changes, to food warnings or even imminent relationship changes. Read more: Stuck in the digital transit zone . For many of us, this will cross the border into creepiness. Imagine your mobile device recommending that you break your next date because of obvious incompatibility based on what ""the system"" knows about you. AI will start to literally run our lives (as this Gartner report put it: Sync Me, See Me, Know Me, Be Me). 2) Automation is likely do away with hundreds of millions of ""simple"" jobs. It will replace cab drivers (no need, with self-driving cars), check-out clerks (all done on mobiles), data analysts, bank tellers, file clerks, delivery people and others. Smart software engines and networked cloud systems are likely to replace accountants and book-keepers, among others, while delivery drones will replace delivery drivers. Robots will become common in many households, such as for basic elderly care, but will remain far from human-like or even sentient for quite some time. Read more: Inventing machines for the future . Reports such as the Oxford Martin School Future of Employment study have already predicted that nearly half of all U.S. jobs could eventually be automated away. Clearly, human-only tasks and right-brain skills will need to be much more emphasized in education, as well, and the concept of a minimum guaranteed income may seem a lot less futuristic fairly soon. We may get paid to just be creative. 3) Augmented reality and ""natural"" human-computer interfaces will overtake traditional means of making queries. We are going from typing a request, to speaking, to gesturing to blinking to (scarily) thinking. Some may start to feel like they live inside a machine or that a machine lives inside of them. Humans are likely to become dependent on digital machines and what they do for us, simply because they will be so easy to use, so powerful, so addictive -- and because they make so much money for those who run them. Read more: The end of the World Wide Web? This is not as dystopian as it may sound -- but there are ways to balance the trend. 4) Automated, real-time, mobile and accurate language translation will be with us within five years. Imagine speaking into your mobile device and having someone else receive the precise translation at almost the same moment, in a multitude of languages. Then, imagine all these conversations being recorded and added to your profile in your ""personal cloud."" This will dramatically change the nature of media and advertising. Kids may also question the use of learning languages. 5) Everything will be recorded, photo- and video-graphed, tracked and measured. Your car's movements, your performance at work, your dietary habits, the meta-data of your communications will all be scanned. Read more: My year of living open source . The explosive growth of the Internet of Things and the upcoming explosion of Internet access in devices that are wearable, embedded or implanted means we can expect this trend to be all-pervasive within the coming decade. Do we need to control this? The most important consequence of such trends will be the reemergence of ethics as a key issue. Major challenges, such as personal data protection, privacy, human augmentation, ""digital obesity"" and dependency on technology will be magnified exponentially. We will no longer ask if something is possible or doable but whether we should do it, where and when. I predict many of tomorrow's leaders, thinkers, innovators, scientists and creatives will spend time and effort devising something like a ""global digital bill of rights and ethics."" Read more: After Snowden, we're self-censoring . The need for global agreements on these key issues will emerge as a direct response to the vastly accelerating abuse of personal data and the powerful AI that crunches it, giving those that control it almost irresistible powers. I predict even the most technology-friendly or social-network obsessed users will soon start to object to being instrumentalized in such a way. This will force governments and businesses towards creating a ""secure framework"" for society. As with nuclear power, we will need to distinguish between what can be used for bona-fide purposes and what could be used for sinister purposes. The resulting digital data and AI ecoystem will need to become the global guideline, akin to a kind of ""artificial intelligence and automation non-proliferation agreement."" Technology does not have ethics -- but we should. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gerd Leonhard .","The Web is set to change our lives in numerous ways, the use of artificial intelligence to language translation and more .
Futurist Gerd Leonhard says machines may eventually know us so well they will tell us when to break off a date .
Humans will become addicted to digital machines because they are so powerful and easy to use .
But that will create fears around privacy and lead to discussions on ethics and how we control the power ."
"Beijing (CNN) -- China's new leaders, just one year in their posts, will meet in Beijing this weekend for the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party's central committee. China watchers will be looking closely to see if this plenum becomes a launchpad for major new reforms, as the meetings have in the past. But in Beijing's streets and office buildings, the conclave prompts little enthusiasm. ""Those things don't really interest me,"" shrugged a white-collar employee, walking off for lunch in a sprawling mall lined with shops selling luxury goods. ""I don't have time for such topics. Too serious."" His lackadaisical attitude is excusable. Plenums are typically opaque; held behind closed doors. I remember covering past plenums in the 1980s and 1990s. It involved guesswork and tea-leaf reading. I'd look for tell-tale signs -- like an unusually large number of government-issue cars parked inside a government guesthouse -- just to confirm that the plenum had convened. At least now, the official media announces the dates beforehand. Press locked out . This time, as in the past, the media is still not invited. No live-streaming, no microblogging, no press briefings. Yet, the potential impact of the plenum's decisions will be hard to ignore. Virtually every aspect of China's three-decade-old market reforms -- and their unintended consequences -- are up for review. A ""plenum"" is simply an assembly or meeting of members -- in this case, the political elite of the Chinese Communist Party. With over 80 million members, the CCP, in effect, directs a bureaucracy the size of a several armies. Near the tip of its pyramid-like power structure sits the central committee, with over 350 members and alternates selected once every five years. Although the central committee meets infrequently -- about three or four times a year -- it is still the country's highest policy-making body. It serves as a kind of parliament of the Party. It formally approves important decisions on policy and personnel matters. Most of its members hold top positions in the party, government and military. Politburo power-brokers . Many past plenums have been largely ceremonial, with important decisions debated and made by the Party's 25-member politburo beforehand. But on occasion, plenums have been witness to robust debates and sweeping decisions on Party and government policies. An example of this was the plenum held in Beijing in December 1978, at which China formally adopted a policy of opening up and reform. China as we now know was conceived at that meeting, which came just two years after the death of Mao Zedong and the end of the Cultural Revolution. With new leader Deng Xiaoping at the helm, the plenum approved rural reforms that allowed farmers to sell a portion of their produce directly to the market, rather than farm their land collectively. In a short time, it dramatically raised standards of living. All told, the 1978 plenum paved the way for fundamental changes: decentralization, rewarding hard work and discouraging egalitarianism and rejecting ideological dogmatism. But few observers expect such far-reaching changes this time around. David Zweig, political science professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, says opposition from Party conservatives and vested interests may still be too strong. ""In my view ...

"(CNN) -- On a wild night of upsets at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards, virtually nothing seemed to be going ""Breaking Bad's"" way. The AMC series, which concludes its much-lauded run next Sunday, didn't win a lot of honors it was expected to. Bryan Cranston, who was tabbed for outstanding lead actor in a drama, lost to ""The Newsroom's"" Jeff Daniels. Co-star Aaron Paul, who could have won supporting actor in a drama, ended up watching ""Boardwalk Empire's"" Bobby Cannavale take home the trophy. But when it came time for the big prize, outstanding drama, things broke for ""Bad."" ""Holy crap! I did not see this coming,"" said creator Vince Gilligan, citing all of the other nominated shows in ""this golden age of television"" ""Bad"" felt so fortunate to be a part of. ""This is the answer to a wish and a prayer for me,"" said Cranston backstage. ""I've been blessed in the past and this show has been nominated in the past, but what I really wanted was what we got, to celebrate the win for the writing crew and cast. This is one helluva party, and what a way to go out."" Gilligan paid tribute to Netflix, the service behind another drama nominee, ""House of Cards."" ""Netflix kept us on the air,"" he said. ""The show would not have lasted beyond Season 2 if not for streaming on demand."" Emmys: The winners list . ""Breaking Bad's"" Anna Gunn also won an Emmy, for outstanding lead actress. Like ""Breaking Bad"" itself, which has taken viewers in strange directions over five seasons of turning mild-mannered chemistry teacher Walter White into meth king Heisenberg, the Emmys were anything but predictable. Oh, ""Modern Family"" took home its fourth straight Emmy for outstanding comedy, and Jim Parsons won lead actor in a comedy, but even those honors were uncertain after a night in which such shows as ""Veep,"" ""The Big C"" and ""The Voice"" won awards over perennial champs. And the Emmys like nothing better than to honor its perennial champs. As host Neil Patrick Harris said at one point, ""This just in: Nobody in America is winning their Emmy office pool."" Past Emmys hosts show up to help Neil Patrick Harris . 'I don't know how to feel yet' The tone was set right away, with best supporting actress in a comedy series going to ""Nurse Jackie's"" Merritt Wever. ""Thank you so much. Um, I gotta go. Bye,"" said Wever in her abrupt acceptance speech. Wever beat out such contenders as ""30 Rock's"" Jane Krakowski and ""Glee's"" Jane Lynch. Backstage, Wever was only slightly less stunned. ""I'm scared, honestly,"" she said about holding the Emmy. ""I'm scared because it was unexpected, so I don't know how to feel yet. I have therapy next week."" Later in the show, Daniels was equally bemused at winning for his performance as a news anchor on ""The Newsroom."" ""Well, crap. Didn't expect this,"" he said. ""You're glad to be invited to the party, there are six of us nominated. There easily could have been 10 other guys,"" he added backstage. ""I felt the work stood up to what the other guys were doing, but we're all doing different things, so it's anybody's game to win. I was happy to win, but surprised."" Daniels beat Cranston, ""House of Cards' "" Kevin Spacey and ""Homeland's"" Damian Lewis, among others. ""Homeland,"" last year's drama series winner, did pick up a couple trophies. The late Henry Bromell, who wrote the ""Q&A"" episode of the show, earned an Emmy for writing, and Claire Danes won the Emmy for actress in a drama series. 'Candelabra' lights up . The closest thing to a sweep came in the miniseries/movie categories, where the HBO film ""Behind the Candelabra"" won three Emmys on the night, including outstanding miniseries/movie. Also honored: director Steven Soderbergh and star Michael Douglas. The film won eight Emmys at last week's Creative Arts Emmys, giving it wins in 11 out of its 15 nominations. Douglas, who played Liberace in the biopic, joked with co-star Matt Damon, who played the pianist's lover, Scott Thorson. ""You deserve half of this,"" Douglas said, holding up the award. ""Do you want the bottom or the top?"" Upsets all around . But, mostly, it was a night for upsets. ""The Voice"" beat perennial winner ""Amazing Race"" for reality-competition program. It's only the second time in 11 years ""Amazing Race"" hasn't won. ""The Colbert Report"" won outstanding variety series and for variety series writing, also beating a perennial winner, ""The Daily Show."" ""It's an honor to be nominated, but it's more than that -- it's also a lie,"" said ""Colbert"" host Stephen Colbert in accepting the variety series Emmy. He thanked ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart, who gave Colbert the opportunity to host his own show. ""Veep"" took an early lead on Emmy night, winning acting honors for star Julia Louis-Dreyfus and co-star Tony Hale. Louis-Dreyfus beat ""30 Rock's"" Tina Fey and ""Parks and Recreation's"" Amy Poehler, among others. But it wasn't quite enough to unseat ""Modern Family"" for comedy series. ""Family"" also won an Emmy for its directing, which went to Gail Mancuso. Jokes and tributes . Host Neil Patrick Harris kept things moving, despite uneven material. ""Tonight we celebrate the best in television,"" he said in his opening monologue. ""For younger audiences, that's the thing you watch on your phones."" He also cracked a Paula Deen joke to a groan. ""Not soon enough?"" he asked. But Harris rebounded thanks to some winning song-and-dance moves, including a song at the halfway mark called ""The Number in the Middle of the Show."" Other Emmy segments went for the heartstrings. Michael J. Fox gave a moving tribute to producer Gary David Goldberg, who hired the actor for ""Family Ties."" Edie Falco got emotional paying homage to her ""Sopranos"" co-star, James Gandolfini. And Bob Newhart, who showed up gnomishly at one point alongside Ernst & Young accountants, received a standing ovation when he was introduced by ""Big Bang Theory's"" Parsons. Last week at the Creative Arts Emmys, Newhart finally won an Emmy for his guest spot on the show. It was his first Emmy in seven nominations. Bob Newhart finally wins first Emmy . ""They wrote an awful good script,"" Newhart said of his ""Big Bang Theory"" colleagues. ""They gave me a lot of hanging curveballs, and I kept swinging at them."" On this night, Emmy mostly threw knuckleballs. But in the end, ""Modern Family"" and 'Breaking Bad"" connected -- and scored.

"(CNN) -- For more than two years, details about the investigation into who killed David Hartley have been as murky as the waters where his body disappeared. His grieving widow told police that attackers shot him in the head on a lake that straddles the U.S.-Mexico border. She said she was forced to flee and leave his body behind. Some blamed her for his death. Then the severed head of the case's lead investigator was delivered in a suitcase to a Mexican military post. The trail seemed to go cold until Monday, when Mexican authorities said they had arrested a leader of the ruthless Zetas drug cartel and linked him to the Falcon Lake killing. Salvador Alfonso Martinez Escobedo also is a suspect connected to the slaying of the Mexican state police investigator who was heading the investigation into Hartley's killing until he turned up dead himself nine days later, the Mexican navy said in a written statement. Hartley's widow, Tiffany Hartley, told reporters in Colorado that the news was ""a complete, out-of-the-blue shock."" She said she had heard no news about her husband's killing for 10 months, and she and her family were trying to learn more ""from anyone."" ""We've got calls out to all these different agencies, and we haven't heard back from any of them,"" she said. Profile of Tiffany Hartley . Authorities accuse Martinez, known as ""The Squirrel,"" of being a regional leader of the Zetas in three northern Mexican states and heading up a brutal battle with the rival Gulf cartel. They had offered a reward of more than $1 million for information leading to his capture. He was picked up in the Mexican border city of Nuevo Laredo on Saturday night and presented to the media on Monday. But one Texas sheriff says the 31-year-old alleged cartel leader wasn't on a list of five suspect names in the Hartley case that he's handed over to the FBI. ""Based on the information I have, he may have been the one responsible for that area, but not the one responsible for the actual killing,"" said Sigifredo Gonzalez, sheriff of Zapata County, Texas. The navy didn't explain why or how authorities believe Martinez is connected to the case. But his arrest appears to be the first that officials have publicly tied to Hartley's killing. ""If this is, in fact, true that he was involved,"" Gonzalez said, ""it's a welcome sign that the Mexican government is trying to solve the killing of yet another American citizen on Mexican soil."" Widow: Cartels 'are killing anyone who gets in their way' After the shooting she reported on September 30, 2010, Tiffany Hartley told a dramatic story of the attack to investigators. For months, she told the story to lawmakers and members of the media, hoping, she said, to speak out for others caught in the drug-related violence that has killed more than 47,500 across Mexico since December 2006. ""The men who murdered David are right across the river. They aren't in Afghanistan, they aren't in Iraq. They're in our own backyard,"" she said at a congressional field hearing in Brownsville, Texas, last year. ""The cartel members are taking over Mexico, and they are killing anyone who gets in their way."" Tiffany Hartley has said that she and her 30-year-old husband were ambushed by assailants while riding Sea-Doo personal watercraft on the lake. 2010: Wife talks drug pirate claim . It was supposed to be leisurely adventure, she said. They were visiting the ruins of a half-submerged church. They'd been snapping photos when three boats carrying armed men approached, she said. Bullets whizzed by as the couple took off on their Sea-Doos. One of them hit David Hartley in the head. She said she was unable to haul his body onto her watercraft before being forced to flee. Some raised doubts about her account. In a 2010 interview with CNN, she said she was hurt by the suspicion, but no, there was no drug deal gone bad. She said she was no merry widow, as one border town official suggested. Her heart is broken, she said. ""You know, the only people who know what happened that day are the people on the boat, God and myself. The only people who I cared about believing me are my family and his family,"" she said. ""Everyone else can doubt me as much as they want."" Seven months later, a member of Mexico's navy and 12 suspected members of the Zetas were killed in a shootout on a Falcon Lake island. Drug traffickers were using the island for storing marijuana to be transported by boat to the United States, the navy said in a statement at the time. After the shootout, the navy said it seized guns, ammunition and bullet-proof vests. Hartley's remains have never been recovered, and Tiffany Hartley said Monday that she hopes his body is found as a result of the arrest. She said her confidence in authorities has been hard to come by two years later, but, ""At the same time, we're hopeful."" Suspect's alleged ties to high-profile crimes . Another Zetas leader captured . Some Mexican reports Monday about Martinez's capture mentioned his alleged ties to Hartley's killing. But his arrest drew national attention for his alleged connection to some of the region's most high-profile crimes, including the 2010 massacre of 72 migrants in Tamaulipas, in addition to other slayings, mass graves and large-scale prison breaks in northern Mexico. Martinez is accused of leading the Zetas in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon and Coahuila, authorities said. Mexican officials also said Monday that he is suspected in ""the execution of more than 50 people by his own hands in different parts of the country."" Shortly after Hartley's death was reported, authorities surmised that the couple had stumbled into the middle of a drug transaction. Gonzalez, the Zapata County sheriff, has said there were reports of fishermen on the lake being warned away from the Mexican side as long as a year before Hartley's shooting. Word has eked out about possible suspects in the case. But information on the investigation has seemed scarce. Last year, Tiffany Hartley sued the State Department, the Justice Department and the FBI in an attempt to get answers and find out why no one had been brought to justice in her husband's killing. All three lawsuits were dismissed this year after settlements were reached, according to court documents. But the case has remained unsolved. ""It didn't happen in the United States,"" Gonzalez told CNN last year, adding that Mexican authorities have ""somewhat of a zero solvency rate, and a zero conviction rate."" ""So unfortunately,"" Gonzalez said at the time, ""this case may remain open forever, even though the information and the evidence may be there."" Widow sues for information on Falcon Lake killing . CNN's Nick Valencia, David Fitzpatrick, Ann O'Neill, Drew Griffin and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","NEW: Hartley's widow calls Monday's arrest an ""out-of-the-blue shock""

"(CNN) -- A bride is in mourning. Hours after the wedding, groom William Riley Knight, 49, of Crown Point, Indiana, was struck and killed. His new wife, Nikki Knight, was not injured. ""I went from a being a newlywed to a widow in less than 48 hours â€” the highest high to the lowest low,"" she told the Chicago Sun-Times on Sunday. ""It's a blur."" They had just left their reception, according to Patti Van Til, a spokeswoman with the Lake County, Indiana, Sheriff's Department. Nikki was still in her wedding dress, she said. Knight was acting as a good Samaritan on Saturday night when he stopped to assist Linda Darlington, whose vehicle had slid into a ditch along a road in Crown Point. He climbed out to help while his wife waited in the car. ""He said, 'We've got to stop, it's late and they need help,' "" Nikki, a registered nurse, told the Chicago newspaper. ""He was the type of person who was willing to put himself on the line and support you no matter what,"" she said. Her husband and Darlington, 42, were struck multiple times as they stood by the side of the road. They were first hit by one vehicle, followed by two more. Darlington was also killed. According to CNN affiliate WBBM, which spoke to Knight's ex-wife, he had four children, including two stepchildren. He acted in community theater, was a hunter and reportedly served in the U.S. Army Rangers before retiring in the mid-1990s. ""He was very outgoing, always wanting to help somebody,"" said friend Rob Biella, CNN affiliate WLS reported. ""He was good to be around my kids. I'm glad they got to know him."" All drivers remained on scene, and there is nothing to suggest that alcohol was a factor in the crash, according to Van Til. The accident remains under investigation. ""He was just trying to do a good thing for somebody in need,"" the spokeswoman said. ""It's very sad. We have a job to do here, but sometimes it just brings you sadness.""

"London (CNN) -- If ever there was a costume that erased gender, it's got to be an astronaut's suit. Big, bulky, with a uniform shape and reflective mask, it's pretty hard to tell whether the person inside is male, female, or Ham the chimpanzee. So when Sandra Bullock plays an astronaut hurtling through space in new blockbuster ""Gravity,"" one of the only clues she's even a woman is the sound of her hysterical gasping: ""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" For 49-year-old Bullock, playing the lead role of Dr Ryan Stone in the thriller which premieres in Britain this week, this is not a female action film -- it's a ""human action film."" And if it were up to her, the rest of Hollywood would stop making a distinction between the two. ""There is a female and male in it. The point of view is everyone's point of view, it just so happens that I have a female body and I fortunately got to do the part,"" she told CNN in an interview at the London Film Festival screening. ""We were very conscious to not make it about the sex -- we made it about the situation and the adversities, rather than 'this is a woman in adversity' or a 'man in adversity.' Anyone can put themselves in my character's situation and feel exactly the same."" America's sweetheart? Indeed, the infinite blackness of space, and indistinct white uniforms worn by Bullock and co-star George Clooney, create a unique environment not just free from gravity -- but traditional gender cues. It's quite literally a world away from some of Bullock's best known roles -- the love interest of terrorist-busting cop Keanu Reeves in 1994 thriller ""Speed,"" the tom boy FBI agent turned bombshell in 2000 chick flick ""Miss Congeniality,"" or the executive trying to marry her assistant in 2009 rom-com ""The Proposal."" Her 2010 hit ""The Blind Side"" -- in which she plays a southern mom who adopts a black teenager -- earned her an Academy Award for best actress, also becoming the first film with a sole female lead to take over $200 million at the U.S. box office. Yet the day before she scored the highest accolade in cinema, Bullock was picking up the Golden Raspberry Award for worst actress in 2010 comedy ""All About Steve."" She is one of the few actors to accept the prize in person, revealing a charming ability to not take herself too seriously in a notoriously cutthroat industry. ""They said that nobody went to see this film, but there's over 700 members here and that means the majority of the 700 voted,"" she joked at the time. Mom's the word . While Forbes this year named Bullock the most marketable celebrity in the world, with annual earnings of $14 million, it seems her biggest priority right now is not career -- but family. When it was time for the 2010 Oscar after-party, the best actress-winner instead opted to go home to her newly adopted son Louis -- whom she named after New Orleans jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong, also from her child's hometown. It is perhaps a sign of Bullock's strength of character that she continued with the adoption process after splitting with husband and TV mechanic Jesse James, after his infidelities were exposed in the press. Today, mother and son have eschewed the bright lights of Los Angeles for a home in Austin, Texas, with Bullock admitting: ""I feel happier, better and younger now than I did 10 years ago."" Singing her praises . Bullock grew up in a house of music, her German mother Helga and American father John, both opera enthusiasts who taught singing. She and younger sister Gesine lived in Washington D.C, in a home constantly visited by their parents' artist friends. When Bullock announced that she wanted to pursue an acting career, her family was supportive, though realistic about the hard slog ahead. Moving to New York and supporting herself with various hospitality jobs, Bullock was the ripe old age of 30 --practically over-the-hill for a woman starting out in Hollywood -- when she starred in breakthrough film ""Speed."" Brave new world . And while she's since starred in numerous box office hits, you get the feeling ""Gravity"" is a film that pushes her beyond the chick-flick persona she's arguably better known for. ""It took away anything I knew as an actor,"" she said, referring to Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón's decision to shoot the actors in 12-wire harnesses, to recreate zero-gravity. The harnesses were either operated by puppeteers, or attached to rotating rigs. All of which took place inside a cube covered in thousands of LED lights to simulate the alternating glow of the sun. Visual effects artists added the spacesuits later. ""It left me closed in a box for 10 hours a day, with no one to talk to, and no life form around me,"" said Bullock. It was the first of its kind, it was a prototype, they invented it. They didn't know if it would work until the day we got into it. ""As alienating and frustrating as it was, being as cumbersome as it was, you knew you were a part of something that no one else had done before. You just sucked it up, and as crabby as I was most days, it worked. I didn't want to be very comfortable, my character wasn't comfortable in space."" Judging by ""Gravity's"" phenomenal box office sales -- so far taking over $400 million worldwide -- the rest of us are also lining up to see America's sweetheart outside her comfort zone.","Sandra Bullock says blockbuster ""Gravity"" isn't about gender, but human adversity .

"(CNN) -- The chief of police in Kiev, Ukraine, Valeriy Koryak, has resigned after riot police used ""excessive force"" against anti-government protesters, police said. Riot police stepped in early Saturday and dispersed several hundred people who came to Independence Square in support of Ukraine's European integration. Seven people were hospitalized and dozens arrested. The United States condemned what it called ""violence against protesters"" in a statement posted online by the U.S. Embassy in Kiev. Ukrainian Interior Minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko later apologized, saying riot police abused their power. He promised a thorough investigation. But he also warned protesters via state television against improper behavior, saying ""if there are calls for mass disturbances, then we will react to this harshly."" A massive crowd of protesters, estimated to number at least 100,000, gathered Sunday in Independence Square. Some were seen setting objects on fire and throwing them at security forces. Others broke through a police barrier that was guarding a Christmas tree, climbed the tree and topped it with the Ukrainian flag.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- As Egypt marked the third anniversary of the January 25 revolution, many of the activists associated with it were behind bars, awaiting trial, or facing a vilification campaign that turned heroes into traitors. Meanwhile, the police whose brutal force stoked their anger three years ago vowed to protect the weekend celebrations. Wael Ghonim, the Google executive behind the Facebook page that helped mobilize support for the mass demonstrations in 2011, is living in self-imposed exile in the UAE. ""[I took] the decision to stay away since Egypt doesn't welcome people like me anymore,"" he wrote in a letter published on his Facebook page on January 7, breaking six months of silence since the military removed President Mohamed Morsy from power in July last year. Ghonim was a vocal supporter of and participant in the mass demonstrations on June 30, that called for Morsy to step down. That date is written into the new constitution's preamble as an extension of the January 25 revolution; but activists like Ghonim don't receive the same treatment. Instead, they are vilified. Recordings of phone calls by Ghonim and other activists, allegedly discussing receiving money from malicious foreign powers in exchange for their activism, aired on Egyptian TV. They are portrayed as activists trying to instigate chaos rather than support democracy. ""This is part of a systematic campaign of moral assassination and settling scores with dissenters,"" Mostafa Alnagar, one of those allegedly targeted by phone leaks, told CNN. Alnager is facing charges -- with more than 20 others -- for insulting the judiciary, for statements he made as an MP in 2012. Ghonim said the audio recordings were edited and taken out of context. He said he is willing to return to Egypt if an official investigation into such charges is launched, ""to prove my integrity and innocence, against those who attempt to defame my reputation before my family and friends and everyone who has ever trusted me."" The Mubarak regime had leveled these accusations against protesters who amassed in Tahrir Square in 2011. The claims have made their way through the rumor mill over the past seven months, gaining more support, but rarely have they turned into official charges. In 2011, the April 6 Youth Movement urged Egypt's prosecutor general to investigate similar accusations made in the media. None of its members were charged. Two years later, the movement's co-founder Ahmed Maher was found guilty of illegal protesting; he is now serving a three-year sentence in prison, along with movement member Mohamed Adel and Ahmed Douma, a vocal supporter of the army intervention this past summer. This was the first conviction under a legislation restricting protests which was approved in November; numerous activists and protesters have since been arrested and charged with congregating illegally, among other crimes. Among them is Alaa Abdel Fattah, who has been in prison since November awaiting trial on charges of organizing an illegal protest. Abdel-Fattah was imprisoned under Mubarak and then under the military council that took over after ousting him. Under Morsy's rule, he was charged with torching a campaign headquarters in 2012. The case ended recently with a conviction and he was handed a one-year suspended sentence along with his sister Mona Seif, a founding member of the No to Military Trials for Civilians campaign. In a letter he wrote to his two younger sisters from prison last month, Abdel Fattah expressed frustration with his imprisonment saying it was different from previous times and lacking meaning or purpose. ""Before, I felt as if I was going to prison willingly and emerging victorious,"" he wrote. ""Now, I feel as if I can't stand the people and the country and that there is no meaning for my detention except that it relieves me from the guilt of my helplessness against this iniquitous injustice and its justification. ""Every time I'm imprisoned, a part of me is broken, like every time someone else gets unjustly detained something is broken inside all of us, like every time a martyr dies everyone bleeds. Yes his family and friends bleed much more, but everyone bleeds and pays the price."" Hany El-Gamal, one of 24 men awaiting trial for participating in the same protest, said he was expecting this crackdown. ""This is a typical authoritarian regime that's afraid of different people, afraid of different voices,"" he told CNN. But he said it hadn't shaken his faith in a political path; he insists it is the only way is to provide people with an alternative. Since Morsy's ouster Egypt's political scene has become extremely polarized, between the former Islamist president's supporters and those who back the military. The past seven months have seen a deadly security crackdown, in which at least 1,000 people were killed and thousands more detained, and a spike in terrorist attacks targeting police and army facilities. The state declared a war on terrorism and expanded its crackdown to include the country's non-Islamist opposition. ""Egypt has witnessed a series of damaging blows to human rights and state violence on an unprecedented scale over the last seven months,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director at Amnesty International. The organization's latest report on Egypt specifically highlighted stifling restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly and the use of the judiciary as a ""tool of repression."" ""The judiciary is being used to punish government opponents while allowing perpetrators of human rights violations to walk free,"" Hadj Sahraoui added. Three years ago, mass demonstrations kicked off on police day, fueled by anger with police violations. Ghonim's Facebook page mobilized support through the case of Khaled Saied, an Alexandria man killed in June 2010. The two policemen convicted of using excessive force against him were granted a retrial. Six activists were arrested and convicted for protesting outside the court during one of the hearings. The police state has ended, Interim President Adly Mansour said days before this year's anniversary. Addressing the police force on Thursday, he said they had to shoulder the blame for individual violations, which they shouldn't have paid for collectively. Egypt has turned a new page, Mansour insisted. But activists say that nothing on the ground changed -- if anything, they believe it has gotten worse. Numerous rights reports attribute increasing security violations to the lack of police reform and continued impunity. Torture in police stations is continuously evidenced through reports and online videos. Despite this, the police seem to be enjoying a newfound popularity. On June 30, police were welcomed to Tahrir Square, formerly the site of demonstrations against their brutality. Interior Ministry spokesman Hani Abdel Latif told reporters last July the police had been exonerated for crimes it was falsely accused of, indirectly suggesting such accusations formed part of a Muslim Brotherhood plot against them. Following a series of bombings outside police stations on Friday, the ministry renewed its promises to protect the weekend's anniversary celebrations. ""Tomorrow we will dispatch security all across the country because these attempts are aimed to spoil the joy of our people in celebrating the third anniversary of the January 25 revolution, but these attacks will only make our people more determined to go down the streets and celebrate their day,"" the minister of the interior, Mohamed Ibrahim said. ""I am sure we will see millions, as if nothing happened."" In the background, citizens at the bombing site in downtown Cairo chanted for the police, calling on Defense Minister Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi to run for president.","Several activists who mobilized 2011 demonstrations are behind bars .

"(CNN) -- The presidents of the two Sudans concluded talks Sunday aimed at addressing outstanding economic, oil and security issues after tensions between the two nations nearly led to a return to war. Talks between Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and his South Sudan counterpart Salva Kiir concluded in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, where the two agreed to temporary arrangements over a disputed oil-rich region claimed by both countries. The agreement called for the creation of temporary administrative and security arrangements for the Abyei region, including the creation of a police service and a limited governing council. Al-Bashir and Kiir agreed to reconvene another summit to discuss the final disposition of the disputed region. Sudan and South Sudan in 2013: Rise or fall together . South Sudan split from Sudan in 2011 as part of a peace deal that ended decades of war between the two sides. The war left nearly 2 million people dead. Soon after the split, tensions between the old foes escalated over outstanding issues, coming close to an all-out war in April. South Sudan shut off its oil supply last year, accusing Sudan of stealing oil revenue. The South got about 70% of the formerly united country's reserves when it became independent last year. Both countries have seen hyperinflation and a squeeze on incoming foreign currency as a result of the shutdown. Read more: Coup attempt disrupted, Sudanese government says . In September, the leaders signed a deal to resume the nation's oil operations, but failed to address other key disputes between the recently divorced countries. In addition to a deal to restart oil exports from South Sudan, the two presidents agreed on a demilitarized zone and principles of border demarcation. However, they failed at that meeting to reach a deal on the status of Abyei. Neither country implemented the agreements from that meeting.

"(CNN) -- When President Barack Obama responded to this summer's torrent of disclosures about the National Security Agency by commissioning a review board, some wondered whether waiting for the committee to report its findings would involve a lot of delay and not much in the way of progress. But Wednesday the panel issued a blockbuster report urging big changes in how the NSA does business. The recommendations are not perfect, but civil libertarians should embrace many of them, and we are glad that on Friday Obama said that they are being seriously considered. There is no question that all of us will be substantially better off if they are followed. Consider what the report has to say about the bulk collection of Americans' phone records. Even among the troubling programs disclosed this summer, this one stood out because of the sheer number of innocent people whose personal information was swept up and its deliberate targeting of Americans within the United States. Also striking was the government's failure to offer any credible evidence that it has made us safer -- even if you are willing to trade liberty for security, you shouldn't be willing to trade it away for nothing. More than that, the call records program squarely raises one of the most fundamental questions about surveillance in the era of big data: Should we ""collect it all"" in case some of it is useful later? The review board comes very close to rejecting this philosophy of surveillance -- closer than it at first appears: . ""We recommend that, as a general rule, and without senior policy review, the government should not be permitted to collect and store all mass, undigested, nonpublic personal information about individuals to enable future queries and data-mining for foreign intelligence purposes. Any program involving government collection or storage of such data must be narrowly tailored to serve an important governmental interest."" This is a curious statement. On the one hand, the review board does not recommend a complete ban on government mass surveillance programs. But on the other, it sets such a high bar for them -- collection and storage must be ""narrowly tailored to serve an important governmental interest"" -- it is difficult to conceive of a program that would pass muster. How can a program of mass surveillance be narrowly tailored? Moreover, lawyers will recognize that this language has been borrowed directly from the First Amendment's ""strict scrutiny"" standard, which famed constitutional scholar Gerald Gunther once described as ""strict in theory and fatal in fact."" In other words, while it is theoretically possible to meet this high bar, in practice few laws manage it. On the bulk telephone records program specifically, the panel said: . ""We recommend that legislation should be enacted that terminates the storage of bulk telephone meta-data by the government under Section 215, and transitions as soon as reasonably possible to a system in which such meta-data is held instead either by private providers or by a private third party."" This recommendation does not go far enough, but it is a good start. First, the review board acknowledges the two key civil liberties problems with the bulk collection of telephone records: ""the record of every telephone call an individual makes or receives over the course of several years can reveal an enormous amount about that individual's private life,"" and ""knowing that the government has ready access to one's phone call records can seriously chill 'associational and expressive freedoms.'"" (The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit arguing the program violates the constitution for these exact reasons.) Second, the review board suggests that the government not hold the records, instead favoring a voluntary agreement that carriers will retain the records for some time (a solution the carriers have already opposed). On the one hand, this is a disappointing half-measure because the privacy and speech intrusions the review board identifies aren't actually eliminated by shifting custody of the records from the government to the carriers. The true solution would be for the carriers to retain records only as long as necessary for billing and network maintenance purposes. On the other hand, at least the panel is saying clearly that current surveillance practices are in need of major, structural changes. If the review board reframes the debate such that government-maintained call records are out of bounds, that is a helpful contribution. Friday, the president's expressed willingness to consider ending the NSA's collection of phone records, saying, ""The question we're going to have to ask is, can we accomplish the same goals that this program is intended to accomplish in ways that give the public more confidence that in fact the NSA is doing what it's supposed to be doing?"" With this comment and the panel's report coming on the heels of Monday's remarkable federal court ruling that the bulk collection of telephone records is likely unconstitutional, this has been the best week in a long time for Americans' privacy rights. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Catherine Crump.","Catherine Crump: Three major developments this week on the NSA surveillance issue .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- South Sudan's president has written to more than 75 government officials and eight foreign governments in an attempt to recover $4 billion lost to corruption. ""If funds are returned, the government of the Republic of South Sudan will grant amnesty and keep your name confidential,"" President Salva Kiir said in the letter, which was dated May 3 and sent to former and current ""senior"" officials. Kiir said the government has set up a special bank account in Kenya where officials and ""corrupt individuals with close ties to government officials"" can deposit public funds. Those who refuse to return all or part of the stolen cash will be held accountable, he said. ""Most of these funds have been taken out of the country and deposited in foreign accounts,"" the letter said. Kiir said he received ""some positive responses"" to letters he sent to eight heads of states, including the United States as well as countries in Africa, the Middle East and Europe. The appeal comes as South Sudan's government struggles to make up for losing 98 percent of its revenue when it halted oil production amid a dispute over transportation and processing fees with Sudan. South Sudan acquired three quarters if the formerly united country's oil reserves when in became independent last July. But the countries have been unable to agree on how much the landlocked South should pay to use infrastructure that remains in Sudan. South Sudan shut down production in late January after accusing Sudan of stealing $815 million worth of its oil. Sudan said it confiscated the crude to make up for unpaid fees. The shutdown has sent the economies of both countries reeling, but South Sudan has been hit particularly hard by the loss of income from virtually its only export. The black market value of the South Sudanese pound fell from about 3.5 to the dollar in January to about 5 currently. Inflation has jumped almost 80 percent from May 2011 to May 2012, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. In World Bank documents leaked to media last month, the Washington-based lender warned of ""state collapse"" if the country runs out of foreign exchange reserves, which it said could be depleted by July -- one year after South Sudan became the world's newest nation, following a two-decade civil war. ""We fought for freedom, justice, and equality. Many of our friends died to achieve these objectives,"" Kiir wrote in his letter. ""Yet, once we got to power, we forgot what we fought for and began to enrich ourselves at the expense of our people."" When it declared independence, South Sudan became one of the world's poorest countries. Only 27 percent of the adult population can read and write, while just over half have access to clean water, according to the Statistics Bureau. ""There is still time to take critical decisions of saving our country from the crisis we currently face and to help the millions who are in desperate need of assistance in health care and education,"" Kiir said. The Anti-Corruption Commission has recovered about $60 million in stolen public funds, according to a June 1 statement released by the office of the president.","President Kiir writes to former and current ""senior"" officials seeking money lost to corruption .

"(Mashable) -- The world's largest professional social network just got a wider reach -- and it wants to be in front of your face for more of the day. LinkedIn launched its long-awaited iPad app late Wednesday, along with revamped versions of its iPhone and Android apps. Redesigned from the ground up, the tablet version looks nothing like the LinkedIn website; it's more akin to a social news aggregator. ""This was a chance to go back to the drawing board,"" says Mario Sundar, LinkedIn's social media manager. ""To design it for how people use the iPad: morning and night infotainment."" The app's main screen is a clean, simple interface with just three options: updates, profile and inbox. The latter two are self-explanatory, although it's worth mentioning that the list of people who've looked at your profile -- a voyeuristic option hidden deep on the website -- is front and center here. It's ""updates"" where the app shines, and turns into a kind of socially-enhanced Flipboard. You see stories your friends have shared, beautifully laid out, alongside such nuggets of news as which of your friends have changed their jobs recently.(Download it in the app store here.) The app also pulls in details of the day ahead from your Google Calendar or Exchange calendar. LinkedIn expects you'll use it over breakfast, when you're torn between work and news, as well as take it to meetings.

"(CNN) -- One of Mexico's most-wanted fugitives, an original member of the violent Zetas drug cartel, has been arrested in southern Mexico, officials said Tuesday. Flavio Mendez Santiago, alias ""El Amarillo,"" was arrested Monday in a federal police operation in a town north of Oaxaca, Mexico, Mexico's public security ministry said. The Zetas is one of Mexico's major drug trafficking organizations, which are involved in various turf wars throughout the country that have resulted in thousands of violent killings. Mendez, 35, was on a list of Mexico's 37 most-wanted fugitives. There was a 15 million peso ($1.2 million) reward for his capture. It was not immediately known if someone would claim that money. Arrest warrants were out for Mendez in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and the federal district where Mexico City sits. He is being investigated for attempted murder, organized crime, and crimes against health, the ministry said. At one time, he was the personal bodyguard for Osiel Cardenas Guillen, the now-imprisoned leader of the Gulf cartel. The Zetas were created as an enforcement arm of the Gulf cartel, but have since split into their own organization at odds with their former employers. In 1993, Mendez was recruited as a founder of the Zetas. He rose to lead the group's informal spy network of ""hawks"" in northern Mexico, and most recently was in charge of cartel operations in southern Mexico, the ministry said. He is also believed to be in charge of controlling the flow of illegal immigrants coming into Mexico from Central and South America. Mendez was arrested together with Carlos Alejandro Rodriguez, his personal bodyguard. The arrest is a blow to the Zetas operations, though the organization's top leadership, including bosses Heriberto Lazcano and Miguel Trevino, remain at large. According to the government, there have been more than 34,600 drug-related deaths since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels in December 2006.","Flavio Mendez Santiago was arrested Monday night in a federal police operation .

"(CNN) -- Argentine midfielder Esteban Cambiasso scored the winning goal as Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan defeated former club Chelsea 2-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie at the San Siro. Cambiasso drilled home a low shot from 18 yards out, just four minutes after Chelsea had levelled matters, to leave the tie finely poised ahead of the second leg at Stamford Bridge in three weeks. All the talk beforehand had been about the two coaches, Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti -- with no love lost between the pair from when Ancelotti was in charge of Inter's rivals AC Milan, who share the San Siro with them. Added to the mix was the fact that Mourinho was still highly-thought of by many at Chelsea after leading the club to successive league titles in 2005 and 2006. And it was Mourinho's side who struck first, taking a third minute lead when Diego Milito cut inside John Terry before firing home a shot inside goalkeeper Petr Cech's right-hand post. In a frantic opening 45 minutes, Didier Drogba struck the bar for Chelsea with a fierce free-kick while they also had a penalty claim for a tackle on Salomon Kalou turned down. However, Chelsea did equalize six minute after the re-start. Fine work from right-back Branislav Ivanovic saw him skip a couple of challenges before laying the ball off to Kalou, who curled home a shot fromt he edge of the area that goalkeeper Julio Cesar should have done better with. But Cambiasso quickly restored Inter's advantage and Cesar then made up for his error on the goal by keeping out Frank Lampard's close-range strike. Chelsea may have to do without keeper Cech for the second leg. The Czech Republic international appeared to damage his knee while rolling the ball out and had to be stretchered off. His possible absence would be a major blow for the London side as they fight for trophies on three fronts this season. Meanwhile, in the evening's other Champions League tie, Primera Liga side Sevilla look favorites to progress after earning a 1-1 draw at CSKA Moscow. Alvaro Negredo gave the Spanish side a 25th minute lead when tapping home at the far post from a pinpoint Jesus Navas cross. But the home side levelled midway through the second half when Mark Gonzalaez, who ironically joined CSKA in the summer from Sevilla's city rivals Real Betis, fired home an unstoppable long-range drive that gave goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev no chance.","Esteban Cambiasso scores the winner as Inter Milan defeat Chelsea 2-1 .

"South Africa (CNN) -- Competing unions, worker dissatisfaction and multiple reports of violence threaten to weaken the stability of Africa's largest economy. On Wednesday the world's top platinum producer, Anglo American, suspended all of its operations in Rustenburg, South Africa due to ""intimidation"" of its workers. Lonmin, which saw a week of strike-related violence at its Marikana mine end in 44 deaths in August, reports a meager 1.8% attendance rate at all of its platinum mines Wednesday. Meanwhile thousands of striking workers are halting operations at select gold mines as well. Currently there is no end or resolution in sight. The mine violence explained . Fury over shootings tests Zuma . Exacerbating this crisis Tuesday, ousted ANC Youth League President Julius Malema announced to a crowd of striking workers at Gold Fields that, ""There must be a national strike in all the mines,"" adding that for five days each month workers should walk off the job in protest and solidarity. He was preaching to workers like Thokozanin Makhasi. Makhasi dedicated 18 years of his life to dangerous work underground for Gold Fields. A team leader of five people, his thumb was once crushed by a falling rock -- only a small nub remains. His monthly pay is roughly 6,000 Rand or $730. As the sole breadwinner in his household, his meager income supports his mother, wife, five children, and two of his sister's children. He says it's not enough and like thousands of other striking mineworkers is demanding a 12,500 Rand ($1,500) monthly salary or $18,000 for the year. Union dissatisfaction lies at the heart of the growing and widening miner strike movement. Makhasi complains that his union, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), cares more about maintaining ties with the majority party -- the African National Congress (ANC) -- than representing the interests of its members. He says this is why his wages have remained so low. Black South Africans were socially and economically liberated thanks to the efforts of Nelson Mandela's ANC and a coalition of unions. But 18 years later, striking miners feel that political elites and union heads are no longer looking out for the working man's interests. The NUM breakaway entity, AMCU (Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union) is taking advantage of this sentiment, encouraging NUM members to change allegiances. Witnesses have characterized them as more militant and aggressive, carrying machetes and sticks during strike marches. This AMCU-NUM turf war has complicated matters for workers confused at who can deliver on their wage demands and also for mine operators wanting to negotiate with the legitimate groups. Still, one aspect of this crisis is clear, Malema sees himself as playing a major role. During an interview with CNN's Christian Amanpour on Tuesday Malema stated, ""We have now taken over the leadership of [this] struggle to make sure the mineral resources of this country benefit the people of this country."" It's a message is resonating with Makhasi. He says he likes what he hears from Malema and prefers the AMCU all because the leaders he trusted for so long have failed him. He pledges to stay off the job with thousands of others, until his wage demands are met.","Anglo American, the world's top platinum producer, suspended operations in Rustenburg .

"(CNN) -- The report of a lethal chemical weapons attack unleashed by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in the suburbs of Damascus on August 21 was only the latest of more than a dozen such reports in recent months, according to Jon Day, the chairman of Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee. ""We have assessed previously that the Syrian regime used lethal CW on 14 occasions from 2012,"" he said in a two-page report to Prime Minister David Cameron. ""This judgment was made with the highest possible level of certainty following an exhaustive review by the Joint Intelligence Organization of intelligence reports plus diplomatic and open sources."" If what Day described as ""a clear pattern of regime use"" of chemical weapons has indeed been established, why did the latest report spark a more bellicose response from world powers? Part of the answer lies in the scale of the event, in which hundreds of people are reported to have died, said Dr. Howard Hu, a consultant on chemical weapons for Physicians for Human Rights and dean of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. Opinion: Chemical weapons are a nightmare for Syrians . In addition, the evidence is strong, he said. ""This time, there was enough videotaped evidence of victims subsequent to the attacks to provide a level of detail that allowed observers like myself to see signs that were consistent with an acute response to a nerve agent. And that level of specificity, I think, also increased the level of certainty and urgency to this."" Hu further cited the August 24 report by Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders. It cited information from three hospitals it supports in Syria's Damascus governorate that said some 3,600 patients had arrived at one of the hospitals within a three-hour time span showing neurotoxic symptoms, and that 355 of them died. ""Medical staff working in these facilities provided detailed information to MSF doctors regarding large numbers of patients arriving with symptoms including convulsions, excess saliva, pinpoint pupils, blurred vision and respiratory distress,"" said Dr. Bart Janssens, MSF director of operations. Chemical weapons in Syria: How did we get here? Patients were treated with atropine, a drug that treats neurotoxic symptoms. Janssens said the group could neither confirm the cause of the symptoms nor identify who was responsible. However, he added, ""the reported symptoms of the patients, in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events -- characterised by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and first aid workers -- strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent. This would constitute a violation of international humanitarian law, which absolutely prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons."" Hu said that the reports of medical personnel winding up with some of the same symptoms suffered by their patients ""is very consistent with a toxic CW (chemical weapons) agent causing secondary effects. So, put it all together, it's a very, very compelling case."" What justifies intervening if Syria uses chemical weapons? Charles P. Blair, a senior fellow on state and non-state threats at the Federation of American Scientists, has compiled a dataset of 18 other reported chemical weapons attacks in Syria. The August 21 report stands apart from the others in the number of reported injuries, he said. But questions remain about all of the reported cases -- as to what agents may have been involved and who was responsible, said Blair, who also teaches graduate classes on the subject at Johns Hopkins University. ""I think it's likely the Assad regime has (used) sarin on potentially two occasions, maybe three that we know if, but it's done so using very, very small quantities of it,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""And it's used primarily to dislodge entrenched opposition forces and probably to test the international community"" to see how it responds, he said. That would not explain the apparently large use reported in the August 21 attack, which crossed the administration's oft-repeated ""red line,"" he said. ""If it was a chemical attack, if it was the Assad regime, it was such an egregious and completely irrational use of chemical weapons that the administration had to respond,"" he said. But that has left the administration in a dilemma, he said. ""There's nobody on the ground right now that they can identify that they can back safely without the risk of that group being overrun or taken over by the jihadist groups in Syria."" In other words, the jihadists could wind up being empowered if the Obama administration carries out an attack, he said. ""If they don't play this right, the leadership in Damascus could be jihadist -- with a large chemical weapons arsenal at their disposal."" Blair proposed three theories about why the Syrian regime might have carried out the attack: . -- It is playing an ""incredibly complex chess game, playing like what Spock used to play -- it makes sense to them, but we can't even figure it out;"" -- The regime is beginning to disintegrate and the attacks were carried out by rogue elements and was not authorized; . -- The leadership has lost touch with reality. But the administration is unlikely to move beyond rhetoric, Blair predicted. ""I don't think, if I had to guess, that there will be military strikes based on this one incident. If again -- maybe."" Attacking the regime would be a risky move, he said. ""You don't know the response. They could launch Scuds at Israel full of sarin."" Another concern: the command and control over the country's vast stocks of chemical weapons could be delegative, meaning that subordinates in the field may have the power to launch the stocks if certain conditions are met. ""So, if the United States destroys x,y and z, it could actually trigger a response from commanders in the field."" And he added that he was not persuaded that chemical weapons have indeed been used. ""There's nothing available in open sources that they definitively have been,"" he said. A claim by France that a laboratory had discovered a marker for sarin in samples taken from Syria was not persuasive, since the chain of custody of the sample was never verified, he said. ""If you can't prove chain of custody, you can't rely on it. So many groups and states would have an interest in tampering with the samples that went out."" The verification of the claims is particularly critical given the U.S. government's history of being duped about the alleged weapons of mass destruction that preceded the U.S.-led attack on Iraq. ""Words can't describe how catastrophic it was,"" he said. ""Most people in the community are skeptical.""","British intelligence cites 15 such attacks since 2012 .
""A clear pattern of regime use,"" says the Intelligence Committee head .
The August 21 incident poses ""a very, very compelling case""

"(CNN)  -- Lindsey Vonn of the United States lived up to her billing as the golden girl of the Winter Olympics with a dominant victory in the women's downhill at Whistler Creekside on Wednesday. Vonn had been troubled by a shin injury in the build-up to the Games in Vancouver but showed no ill-effects with a blistering run of one minute 44.19 seconds to win her first Olympic medal of any color. The Minnesotan, the reigning world champion in the discipline and totally dominant on the World Cup circuit in the build-up to Games, decimated the time set by fellow American Julia Mancuso by over half a second from start number 16. ""I dreamed about what this would feel like but it is much better in real life,"" said the 25-year-old. ""I can't stop crying. This is everything that I ever wanted and hoped for. I had a lot of ups and downs in my career. Standing here today at the finish, and to win, is amazing."" Vonn is also the first American woman to win downhill gold and the first to win a speed event at the Olympics since Picabo Street triumphed in the super-G at Nagano in 1998. Elisabeth Goergl of Austria won the bronze medal, fully 1.46 seconds adrift of Vonn, just edging out compatriot Andrea Fishbacher for the final podium position. Experienced Swede Anja Paerson looked to be mounting a dangerous challenge to Vonn on the early part of the course, but took a heavy fall on one of the numerous jumps and needed medical attention. Germany's Maria Riesch, a great friend of Vonn's and her closest challenger in the overall World Cup standings this season, could only finish a disappointing eighth. Vonn, who was injured at the Turin Games four years ago, but bravely still took part, is competing in five events this time around and has strong medal chances in each, particularly in the Super-Combined and super-G disciplines. Her husband and coach Thomas Vonn had no doubts she would claim gold with her first attempt despite her pre-Games injury scare. ""For Lindsey to come though, under this kind of pressure and with her shin injury, is fantastic,"" he said. ""Lindsey called me before the race and told me, 'I think I got this. I may not need you,"" he added. She will next be in action in Thursday's Super-Combined event. There was further triumph for the United States in the men's speed skating as Shani Davis retained his 1,000 meters crown at the Richmond Olympic Oval. Davis is the first man in Winter Games history to achieve the feat as he enjoyed a victory margin of 0.19 seconds over South Korea's Mo Tae-Bum. Another American, Chad Hedrick, took bronze. And the U.S. gold rush continued with a commanding performance from Shaun White in snowboarding's half-pipe final to successfully defend his Olympic title. White had a massive four-point lead over compatriot Scott Lago after the first run and rounded off an incredible display with a series of trademark moves in his second effort which scored a massive 48.4 points. Elsewhere, there were golds in the cross country sprint races for Nikita Kruikov of Russia in the men's event and in the women's for Norway's Marit Bjoergen, who also won bronze in the 10km freestyle event on Monday. In the men's luge doubles event, the Linger brothers from Austria, Wolfgang and Andreas, successfully defended the title they won in Turin ahead of the Latvian pair of Andris and Juris Sics. China won their first gold of the sixth day in the short track speed skating as Wang Meng took the 500 meters event by a convincing margin as she pulled clear of the field in the final after a series of false starts.","Lindsey Vonn wins Olympic women's downhill title with dominant display .

"(CNN) -- Adly Mansour, Egypt's interim president, is reviewing a proposed protest law approved by the Cabinet that has drawn the ire of human rights groups and political factions. State media reported Wednesday the measure would have tight restrictions: . -- It requires an appeal to be handed to the Interior Ministry before any demonstration. -- It gives senior police officials the right to cancel, delay or move a protest. -- It allows for the creation of ""protest-free"" areas around public institutions. Rights groups have reacted strongly to the proposed measure. ""Resorting to the security and police solutions will lead to more failure and worsen the political conflict in Egypt,"" Gamal Eid, executive director of the Arabic Network for Human Rights, said in a statement. The April 6th movement, an influential political force deeply involved in Egypt's 2011 revolution, equated the draft law with Hosni Mubarak-era repressions, calling it ""one of the worst repressive laws constraining freedoms in Third World countries and military dictatorships."" Mubarak was removed from power in 2011 during the early days of the Arab Spring movement that swept across North African and Middle East. Tamarod, the grass-roots political faction responsible for organizing the petition campaign that led to the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsy in July by the Egyptian military, reacted to the draft law on Facebook: . ""Any law that limits the right of peaceful demonstration which Egyptians won in the January 25th and June 30th revolutions is an unjust law. Dealing with non-peaceful protest must be done without a law that is used to restrict or narrow peaceful protests."" The Nour Party, the second largest Islamist party in Egypt, also criticized the draft law and urged the interim president to engage in a debate before approval. ""The protest law is dangerous and sensitive and should be preceded by a community dialogue or at least dialogue with political forces. One of the most important gains of the revolution is that the Egyptian people recovered their right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression,"" the party said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- In the end, Del Harvey says the decision to help users report threats of rape and other violence on Twitter was simple. ""It comes down to this,"" wrote Harvey, senior director of Twitter's Trust and Safety division, ""people deserve to feel safe on Twitter."" The site announced a list of changes this weekend in response to complaints that it wasn't doing enough to combat hate speech, particularly against women. The site is adding staff to handle abuse reports, partnering with an organization that focuses on the safe use of technology by children and updating its rules to clarify that abusive behavior is not allowed. ""We want people to feel safe on Twitter, and we want the Twitter Rules to send a clear message to anyone who thought that such (behavior) was, or could ever be, acceptable,"" wrote Harvey and Twitter UK general manager Tony Chang in a blog post. The post also reiterated that a ""report abuse"" button on individual tweets was added recently on some mobile versions of Twitter and said it will be available on the others, as well as the Web, in the coming month. Currently, users who want to flag threatening messages on Twitter must visit the service's online help center, which requires several extra steps. The announcement came after a week during which gender politics in England spilled over onto Twitter. The Bank of England announced that ""Pride and Prejudice"" author Jane Austen will be featured on 10-pound notes. The move came after a campaign by activist Caroline Criado-Perez and others. On Twitter, Criado-Perez wrote that the response got ugly fast: ""I actually can't keep up with the screen-capping & reporting -- rape threats thick and fast now,"" she wrote now. ""If anyone wants to report the tweets to Twitter."" Some of the accounts she cited have since been suspended. Eventually, one man was arrested in Manchester, England. British police also are investigating a threat of rape and murder made to Stella Creasy, a Labour Party member of Parliament, after she tweeted her support of Criado-Perez. But activists complained that Twitter didn't act quickly enough. A Change.org petition, calling on Twitter to add a prominent ""report abuse"" button, had gotten more than 128,000 signatures as of Monday. Twitter had posted last week it was working to address the concerns. In this weekend's post, it said it will continue. ""We are committed to making Twitter a safe place for our users,"" the post read. ""We are adding additional staff to the teams that handle abuse reports and are exploring new ways of using technology to improve everyone's experience on Twitter. We're here, and we're listening to you.""","""People deserve to feel safe on Twitter,"" official says .

"(CNN) -- Deceased Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev participated in a 2011 gruesome triple homicide outside Boston along with a Chechen killed early Wednesday during a confrontation with the FBI and Massachusetts State Police in Orlando, Florida, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. Ibragim Todashev, who died during the interview with authorities, not only confessed to his direct role in slashing the throats of three people in Waltham, Massachusetts, but also fingered Tsarnaev in the deaths, the official said Wednesday. Todashev was being questioned about the slayings and his acquaintance with Tsarnaev. Todashev attacked an FBI agent, who shot him dead, a federal law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the case told CNN. ""He used some kind of weapon,"" the official said, and that prompted the FBI agent to shoot the suspect. A second law enforcement official confirmed Todashev made the confession. The unsolved triple murder received renewed interest after it was learned that Tsarnaev was sparring partners at a local gym with one of the victims. Source: 2011 slayings of Tsarnaev friend, 2 others revisited . Investigators of the crime reported at the time that the heads of the three victims were pulled back and their throats slit ear to ear with great force. Marijuana was spread over the bodies in a ""symbolic gesture,"" and several thousand dollars in cash was found at the scene. Todashev told investigators the men were killed during a drug ripoff because he and Tsarnaev were afraid they would be able to identify them and tell police what happened, according to a law enforcement source. So far, no link has been found between Todashev and the Boston Marathon bombings. However, the FBI is looking into the many connections between Todashev and Tsarnaev, whose radicalization allegedly led to the Boston bombings. A federal law enforcement official has told CNN they were initially led to Todashev because they learned he knew Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar. They also said cell phone records connected Tamerlan and Todashev. Todashev was being interviewed in the kitchen of his Florida home. He grabbed a knife, which is why fatal force was used, according to a source briefed on the ongoing investigation. ""Preliminary information indicates the agent took actions to defend himself,"" said a federal law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the case. ""The agent sustained non-life-threatening injuries,"" FBI spokesman Jason Pack said. Investigators are awaiting test results to determine whether Todashev's DNA was found at the Massachusetts triple murder scene and whether the DNA of Tamerlan Tsarnaev also was found there. Todashev and Tsarnaev were acquainted through a mixed martial arts center near Boston, said a source briefed on the bombing investigation. In Orlando, an FBI team is reviewing the circumstances of the shooting, a procedure that follows any FBI shooting. Todashev had an impending flight from Orlando, via New York and Moscow, to Chechnya, when investigators sought to interview him, according to a source briefed on the ongoing investigation. He was told not to take the flight, the source said. Details emerged Wednesday about how Todashev had Tsarnaev's phone number in his cell phone, said the source. Both men were members of the mixed martial arts forum Sherdog.com, along with Russian-Canadian boxer-turned-jihadist William Plotnikov, the source said. Last month, CNN reported that Plotnikov and six others died in a July 2012 firefight with Russian forces in the southwestern republic of Dagestan, while Tsarnaev was visiting the region, according to a source briefed on the investigation. Todashev, 27, knew Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, also a suspect in the April 15 bombings, the official said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, injured and captured after a manhunt, is being held by authorities. His brother died in a shootout with police. Todashev was from the Chechnya region, as were the Tsarnaev brothers, the source said. Todashev was granted political asylum in 2008, but he came to the United States some time before that, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. Todashev had been living in the United States as a legal resident because of that asylum claim. In the 2011 Massachusetts triple homicide, the Middlesex County district attorney's office said at the time that the victims and two unknown perpetrators appeared to know each other and that it was not a random crime. No suspects were named then. Suspect: Bombing was payback for hits on Muslims . A source said that the FBI had been investigating Todashev for about a month. The FBI had followed Todashev for days, his friend told CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13. Todashev ""wasn't like real close friends (with Tsarnaev), but he just happened to know him,"" Khasuen Taramov told the TV station. ""But he had no idea that they were up to something like that, like bombings and everything, you know what I mean?"" He told CNN affiliate WESH that Todashev and Tsarnaev had spoken by telephone about a month before the bombings. ""It was a complete shock to him,"" Taramov said. The two met a couple years ago in Boston, where Todashev had lived and where there is a small, close-knit community of Chechens, said Taramov. Their telephone conversation before the bombings contained nothing but routine pleasantries, he said. ""It was 'How are you doing; how's your family?' That's all."" Taramov said he himself was questioned by the FBI for three hours Tuesday night. Asked what he was asked, Taramov said, ""Different kind of questions like 'what do you think about bombings,' 'do you know these guys,' blah blah blah, what is my views on certain stuff."" He said Todashev was not a radical. ""He was just a Muslim. That was his mistake, I guess."" Taramov said his friend had told him he had a bad feeling about the direction the investigation was heading. ""He felt like there's going to be a setup ... bad setup against him. Because he told me, 'They are making up such crazy stuff, I don't know ... why they doing it. OK, I'm answering the questions, but they are still making up some, like, connections, some crazy stuff. I don't know why they are doing it.' "" Before meeting with the FBI for a 7:30 p.m. interview Tuesday, Taramov said, his friend asked him to take his parents' telephone numbers. ""He just told me, 'Take the numbers, in case something happens, if I get locked up, or whatever, call them.' You know what I mean? ""We were expecting to get him locked up, but not getting him killed. I can't believe it."" Todashev was unemployed and had been living on insurance money he received after surgery for an accident. ""He used to be a fighter, MMA fighter,"" Taramov said, in a reference to mixed martial arts. Todashev was arrested this month on a charge of aggravated battery after getting into a fight over a parking spot with a man and his son outside an Orlando mall. The son was taken to a hospital with head injuries, a split upper lip and several teeth knocked out of place, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said in a report. ""Todashev said he was only fighting to protect his knee because he had surgery in March,"" the report said. He told the police that he was a former mixed martial arts fighter, it said. Todashev, described as 5-foot-9 and 160 pounds, was released on $3,500 bond. Asked about the incident, Taramov downplayed it. ""He had a fight in the parking lot, the two guys jumped on him ... pretty much he just defended himself against two,"" he told WESH. ""The only mistake: he did kick their ass and left."" Todashev had recently gotten his green card and had been planning to visit his parents in Chechnya and then return to the United States, but canceled the plans, Taramov said. Now, he added, he was planning to call his friend's parents. Former Chechen rebel: 'I have nothing to do with' Boston bombings .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari's Fernando Alonso won a rain-hit Malaysian Grand Prix Sunday holding off a thrilling challenge from young Mexican Sergio Perez. Lewis Hamilton, who started from pole, finished third in his McLaren but teammate Jenson Button was out of the points. Reigning two-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, second to Button in the season-opener, finished 11th after a late puncture. Alonso, a two-time world champion and driving a Ferrari which has been uncompetitive in qualifying in the two races to date, showed his experience to hold off Sauber's rising star Perez with Hamilton a well beaten third. The victory takes him to the top of the driver standings after two races with 35 points, five points clear of Hamilton. The race was hit by a torrential downpour at the start which saw all the leading contenders rushing to change to wet tires. A safety car was quickly called into action before the race was halted. When it resumed, Hamilton lost first place after a slow pit-stop with Alonso eventually appearing at the head of the field. But Perez looked to be the faster and set for his maiden victory until he overshot a corner on lap 50 out of 56. By now racing on dry tires, Alonso held him off to claim his first GP win for eight months. But in the post-race press conference he was realistic about his team's chances in the next few months. ""The win changes nothing,"" he said. ""We are in a position that we don't want. The goal was not to lose many points. ""We did the job track side. So this is a positive news but coming to China and Bahrain there is a lot of stuff coming to the car and this is the real job to do,"" added the Spaniard. Button, who started from second on the grid, made a rare mistake as he drove into the side of HRT's Narain Karthikeyan and lost his front wing. He eventually finished 14th. Vettel's Red Bull teammate Mark Webber was fourth with former world champion Kimi Raikkonen fifth for Lotus. Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, who started third on the grid, span early in the race and took the last points in 10th place.","Fernando Alonso wins Malaysian GP for Ferrari .

"Barrow, Alaska (CNN) -- Edward Itta, a powerful Eskimo leader, looks out at the icy Arctic Ocean stretched out under a fuzzy orange sun that refuses to set this time of year. ""This is our garden,"" said the former mayor of the North Slope Borough, a county-style government covering an area as big as Wyoming. Itta's garden, the Arctic Ocean, is filled with the whales, seals, walruses and fish the Inupiat Eskimos still need to survive. But many Inupiats think ""their garden"" is being threatened by an international oil rush to get at what may be a treasure trove of more than 25 billion barrels of crude. Itta's lynchpin decision on whether to fight Shell Alaska's efforts to begin exploratory drilling in the Arctic was among the most difficult of his 67 years. Running his hands along the edge of a traditional boat -- much like the Inupiat people have used for thousands of years to hunt whale -- Itta remembers environmental oil disasters such as 1989's Exxon Valdez and the Deepwater Horizon. But he also talks about the critical economic needs of the region's 9,500 people -- 11% of whom live below the poverty line. ""I struggled with myself and prayed a lot,"" says Itta. The whole world is watching. Just ask Bob Reiss, an eco-journalist and author of ""The Eskimo and the Oil Man."" ""If Shell really hits it big this summer, I think things will heat up even more,"" Reiss told CNN. ""It will be an undersea gold rush for oil."" Shortly before Itta left office after serving a maximum term, he reached a compromise with Shell that opened the door for drilling to begin later this year. Other officials have struggled with competing fears and desires linked to the promise of oil riches. Opinion: Why we should look toward the Arctic . What's interesting about Itta's shift toward his final decision is how far he traveled. In his own words, Itta moved from ""hell no"" to ""OK."" ""Not only no ... but HELL no!"" Itta emphasizes. ""Even one time I said, 'I'm going to fight this, and they will have to do it over my dead body.' "" In this age of polarized politics and unwavering ideology, you have to wonder: what was that internal journey like? Itta is no stranger to the oil industry. He spent some time working as a roustabout in Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the nation's largest oil field. But Itta viewed Shell's plan at first as ""another threat to our way of life up here."" ""We are the Arctic, because we are the land, we are the ocean we are one and the same,"" says Itta. ""That's how we look at our environment -- how our culture has managed to get to this day and age, through thousands of years in one of the harshest environments."" Proponents say if Shell finds oil, it could spark thousands of new jobs. As much as 27 billion barrels could be waiting to be pumped to the surface, according to federal estimates, and 132 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Opponents say an oil spill could pollute the waters and damage the economy. ""Our subsistence for the winter, it all comes from the ocean, the fish and whale. It's going to ruin our ocean,"" said 79-year-old Abagail Nashupuq of Point Hope, Alaska. Shell Alaska vows it's taken every step possible to avoid a catastrophe. ""We will be drilling these wells like they are the most complex, most difficult wells that we have drilled in company history,"" says Pete Slaiby, the vice president of Shell Alaska. Shell, he says, has to ""take measures to safeguard the culture, the subsistence hunt and the lifestyle the people enjoy."" The company plans to use drilling ships to root for oil in two areas: a site west of Barrow named Burger in the Chukchi Sea and to the east of Barrow in the Beaufort Sea at a spot designated as Hammerhead. About 18 miles offshore in the Beaufort and 70 miles in the Chukchi, in water less than 200 feet deep, the ships will drill about 8,000 feet to collect data on potential oil reserves. Then workers will seal the wells with cement and mechanical plugs before permanently abandoning them. The 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon spill that killed 11 oil workers and lasted three months spewed from a well that was 5,000 feet under water and about 40 miles off shore. The Arctic's shallow waters will make a Gulf of Mexico scenario less likely, supporters say, because getting to the well will be easier and pressure conditions underwater at the drill site will be more favorable. Shell has been forced to postpone drilling, which was scheduled to begin this month, until August by an unexpectedly thick ice pack. The delay cuts valuable time for Shell, which is operating under U.S. permits that require the company to stop drilling in the seas by the end of October. On Saturday, one of the ships that Shell plans to use to drill slipped its mooring and drifted close to one of Alaska's Aleutian Islands. It was the latest in a string of incidents to arise around the controversial project. Questions also were raised in June about the durability of one of Shell's underwater oil spill containment vessels in severe weather, which resulted in the vessel that was headed to one of the drilling sites to be temporarily held at port in Washington. A group of opponents, primarily the Inuit and environmentalists, called for a review of the federal air permits that were issued to Shell as part of its drilling plan. Opponents also fear that floating ice will make any spill in the region a potential disaster. ""Nobody knows how to contain or clean up a spill in the harsh and remote seas of the Arctic,"" said Frances Beinecke, Natural Resources Defense Council president, in a written statement. If a ""blowout occurs late in the drilling season, there won't be time to stop it before the winter ice chokes the site, leaving oil to gush uncontrolled for months."" Scientists predict there will be less ice by mid-century. If Shell finds the oil it's looking for, scientists say melting ice in the Arctic Circle will make conditions friendlier to floating drilling rigs. Some predictions say year-round shipping will be common in the region by 2050. Practical and personal considerations influenced Itta's decision, he says. Growing up, he had no electricity, no running water. ""You'd get back and forth from where you need to with dog teams."" ""I started dealing with looking at my grandkids and my kids and what I had gone through ... and I wanted them to have what I have, if not better."" If production dips from the region's Prudhoe Bay wells and pipeline, ""our tax revenues go way, way, way down,"" Itta admits. In an era when reliance on foreign oil is seen as a security threat, President Barack Obama's support of offshore drilling also helped Itta decide. ""I think it's inevitable that action is going to happen out here -- in the name of national security if for nothing else."" Under the agreement negotiated by Itta, the borough agreed not to sue Shell if the company maintains constant scientific research and halts drilling when whales are in the region. They've agreed to fund a scientific environmental monitoring program with local coastal communities getting from $3 million to $5 million a year, Itta said. Despite the agreement, Itta still says he opposes offshore drilling ""mainly because I don't think enough mitigation measures have been even thought of or done to safeguard our waters and our way of life."" The tipping point in reaching the agreement, Itta said, was something his father once told him. ""You're going to be on a fool's errand if you think you are going to please everybody,"" he said. ""Give it your best shot, seek advice and once you think you've found that -- go with it and don't look back."" ""So that's the point where I said, 'OK, it's a compromise.' That's the right way: they have to give. We have to give."" Final word on whether to allow exploratory drilling is now up to the Department of Interior. ""I think I can rest easy that I have done the very best I could to bring our issues as Inupiat Eskimos to the forefront, in a way the oil industry understands -- the permitting agencies understand,"" Itta said. ""We helped to further set world-class standards for an operation here -- in our garden."" How do you feel about drilling? Let us know in the comments below. Related: The war over coal is personal .

"Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) -- In surroundings even dirtier than the war they escaped, Syrian refugee children in Lebanon now face another potential threat: polio. Highly contagious and potentially deadly, the crippling and incurable disease recently re-emerged in Syria, paralyzing 17 children there. And as the country's brutal conflict continues to spill over its borders, aid workers know they have to act fast, since viruses can often spread quicker than violence. Until this year, no polio cases had been reported in Syria since 1999, and aid agencies say the risk of it spreading to other countries in the region is high. The level of concern is so great that they're going from tent to tent in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, as part of the largest immunization program against polio in the Middle East. ""There are new families, they are escaping from the war in Syria,"" Dr. Zein El Dine Saad, of Lebanon's Health Ministry, told CNN. ""We are afraid [in case] just one of these [families] are infected by the virus, by this polio virus."" Record sum needed to handle burden on Lebanon from Syria's civil war . The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) are attempting to vaccinate as many as 23 million children across the region. According to the WHO, vaccinations will also be carried out in other countries including Iraq, Jordan, and Turkey. ""In order to stop the outbreak and prevent further spread, organizers aim to vaccinate, repeatedly over the next few months, all children under the age of five, whether they are living at home or displaced by conflict,"" UNICEF explained in a statement. ""As if children in Syria had not suffered enough, they now have to contend with yet another threat to their health and well-being,"" said Maria Calivis, UNICEF's Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. ""The current polio vaccination efforts are a huge undertaking by many partners, but we can only halt the spread of the virus if we reach those children who have remained out of reach,"" Calivis added. Tiny Lebanon, which neighbors Syria and has absorbed the highest concentration of refugees - over 800,000 so far, is considered to be at particular risk. Maria Assi is head of Beyond Association, one of the Lebanese non-governmental organizations working with UNICEF and the Lebanese Health Ministry to carry out the vaccinations. She said ""refugees from areas within Syria where polio reemerged arrive into Lebanon daily, ""making the immunization campaign vital."" Read more: Polio cases confirmed in Syria, says WHO . Assi said that during phase two of the campaign, ""within tented settlements in Lebanon, Beyond, UNICEF and the Lebanese Health Ministry were able to vaccinate around 95,000 children"" aged 5 and younger. CNN accompanied Dr. Saad and his team of medics during part of the immunization campaign, while they were inoculating all the children aged five and under who they could find amongst the ramshackle tents in the Bekaa Valley. Asked if the appalling conditions at this makeshift camp make it an ideal breeding ground for the virus, he was quick to respond: ""Yes, yes. Of course, of course."" Here, the children routinely wade through and play in filth - it's a sickening and terribly sad sight. With trash and human waste all around, families here are effectively living in an open sewer. It's hard enough trying to walk through the camp site, let alone trying to live here. One 10-year-old boy told CNN how sick he was of living in these conditions. ""The dirtiness all around,"" he said, shaking his head, as if both embarrassed and enraged, ""it's filthy - life here isn't good."" Doctors warn it isn't just polio that these children are at risk of -- they could easily contract anything from hepatitis to scabies to the mumps. ""This overcrowding and the mud,"" explained Dr. Saad, looking around. ""The bad sanitation -- everything is bad here."" Now, to make matters worse, winter is at hand, and the cold is only exacerbating the refugees' misery. Asked if her family feared getting sick, 12-year-old Maria Ali admitted they were. ""Of course we're worried. We're all crowded together here - if one person gets sick, they'll definitely spread it to everybody else here too."" As the aid workers packed up for the day, the parents who had been worried about polio also wondered how they'd shield their families from the elements; this is one of the worst winters on record and there's no let-up in sight. But the children kept on playing; no matter how young they are, for them, the harshest possible existence is almost expected. Read more: Syrian refugees face miserable winter in Lebanon .

"(CNN) -- Nico Rosberg tasted grand prix success at his 111th attempt with a faultless drive to win the Chinese Grand Prix Sunday. The 26-year-old German led from pole in his Mercedes to relegate the McLaren pair of Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton to the minor podium positions in Shanghai. Hamilton's third successive third place finish has taken him to the top of the world championship standings, two points clear of teammate Button. Previous leader Fernando Alonso could only take ninth place in his Ferrari and slips to third in the title race. Reigning double world champion Sebastian Vettel, who started from 11th place on the grid in his Red Bull, battled wearing tires in the closing stages of the 56-lap race and dropped from second place to fifth. He was overtaken by Button, Hamilton and then teammate Mark Webber, but up ahead Rosberg was untroubled. He crossed the line 20.6 seconds clear to become the first winner for the famous German marque of Mercedes since the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio in 1955 in Italy. ""This is an unbelievable feeling. I'm very happy, very excited,"" he told the post-race press conference. ""It's been a long time coming for me, and for the team also, for the past two years and a bit. ""It's finally there. It's amazing, and it's nice to see now how quickly we are progressing."" Stopping only twice to change tires, Rosberg was always in control, the last challenge to his supremacy disappearing when Button's third stop in his McLaren cost him time. ""I think I lost nine to 10 seconds, which is a pity because when I exited the pits I had four cars ahead of me I wouldn't have been racing. Otherwise I would have had a nice, clear track,"" Button said. Hamilton, who qualified second fastest, but was relegated five grid positions for a pre-race gearbox change, was pleased with another solid performance to take over at the top of the standings. ""I said I wanted to move forward. The team did a great job during the pit stops and with strategy, there was a lot of overtaking, so a fantastic day."" Rosberg's teammate, seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, started from second on the grid, but his race was cut short by a mistake at his first pit stop which saw his right front tire nut not properly fitted. His pit crew were seen slapping the ground in frustration as he drove off before quickly retiring on lap 14. Lotus driver Romain Grosjean finished sixth ahead of the Williams pair of Bruno Senna and Pastor Maldonado.

"Blue Mountains, Australia (CNN) -- Firefighters battling blazes that menaced the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia's largest city, are concerned about Thursday's weather conditions. ""Still expecting strong winds today which is clearly our focus across the current fire grounds."" Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters Thursday morning. Fitzsimmons reported 24 of the 66 active fires are uncontained and raging across a wide swath of Australia's most populous state destroying at least 193 homes in the Blue Mountains area. ""We do apologize and regret that we weren't able to save everything. We are very acutely aware, because our teams are embedded in those local communities- there has been so much damage and destruction and people have lost everything. They did their best and will continue to do their best,"" Fitzsimmons said on behalf of the fire services. A combination of high winds and temperatures Wednesday had fueled fears the bush fires burning across a 1,000-mile stretch of New South Wales would spread even farther. But thanks to fire crews' ""extraordinary"" work, helped out by some unexpected light rain overnight, the worst of the danger has been avoided, said Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. He praised firefighters for their skill and use of ""aggressive and high-risk strategies"" that included ""backburning"" operations -- fires begun by emergency crews to reduce potential tinder for the wildfires to feed on -- and thanked local communities for following instructions to keep them safe. Many families living in the Blue Mountains can now return home, he said, although they should be aware that conditions could still change. Some schools will reopen Thursday in those areas judged less at risk. But not everyone is out of danger yet. ""There's a lot of very dangerous, a lot of very difficult firefighting occurring in communities still under threat,"" he said. ""The fight is far from over."" Blue Mountain resident Pauline Worthington hopes buckets of water and damp grass will stop the fires from damaging her home, but will not be evacuating without trying to protect it. ""Stay and try to defend. If it gets too bad. We will go. Everything is packed ready to go,"" Worthington says. A total fire ban is in place for the greater Sydney region until further notice. More than 1,500 Australian firefighters continue to battle the flames, a fire service spokesman said late Wednesday. Inspector Andrew Luke of the Rural Fire Service confirmed the State Mine fire near Lithgow was sparked as the result of live ordnance exercises on the Marrangaroo Army Range. Ten buldings and homes in the State Mine area have been destroyed since October 16. The Australian Department of Defense issued a statement acknowledging Defense personnel were conducting an explosive training activity in the same area on the day the fire started. The department is conducting an investigation into the military exercise. The Sydney Airport region and Lucas Heights areas are under extreme fire warnings. An emergency warning is also in place in the Gateshead area. Power is out at more than 1,300 homes in fire-stricken regions, according to Ausgrid, a state-owned electricity network. Thursday is expected to bring an unwelcome change in the weather, said Fitzsimmons, with dry, southerly winds that could gust at up to 50 mph. This could present ""real challenges"" for people living and working north of current active fire lines, he said. A nearly 1,000-mile line . Local officials are surprised by the early arrival of bush fires this year as spring turns toward summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Fitzsimmons said the threat to Blue Mountains communities followed an unseasonably hot and dry winter. ""Never before have we seen the extent of damage and destruction and wide-scale fire activity at this time of the year,"" he said. ""We need to remind ourselves that we have still got a long way to go as we look down the coming months into summer."" At least one death has been reported. A 63-year-old man died of a suspected heart attack October 18 while defending his home against a blaze on the New South Wales Central Coast, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. The wildfires stretch along a nearly 1,000-mile line in New South Wales, from the far north of the state south of Brisbane -- which lies just across the Queensland border -- to east of Canberra, the country's federal capital. Fires in the Blue Mountains range west of Sydney are a particular worry as rough terrain has impeded firefighting efforts. Helicopters circled Springwood, a Blue Mountains community under emergency alert status, dumping ""tons and tons of water"" as the flames neared homes, said CNN's Robyn Curnow. ""What we're seeing here is fires coming very, very close to residential properties,"" Curnow said. ""There seems to be a sense of helplessness by some people as they are watching as these fires run out of control."" Scores of fires now have burned more than 126,000 hectares (311,000 acres), an area greater than the size of Los Angeles, said Rural Fire Service spokesman Andrew Luke. Helicopters in the region have dropped not only water to extinguish fires but also incendiary devices on the tops of mountains to create preventive burns. ""These fires ran more than 30 kilometers in one day because it gets on top of a mountain, showers the next area with embers, starts new fires ahead of it,"" Rural Fire Service Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers in New South Wales said Tuesday. The political blaze . Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Australian radio that the United Nations' head of climate change was ""talking through her hat"" when she told CNN's Christiane Amanpour there is ""absolutely"" a link between the fires spreading across Australia's most populous state and global warming. ""The World Meteorological Organization has not established a direct link between this wildfire and climate change -- yet,"" U.N. Climate Chief Christiana Figueres said Monday. ""But what is absolutely clear is the science is telling us that there are increasing heat waves in Asia, Europe and Australia; that there, these will continue; that they will continue in their intensity and in their frequency."" Abbott said on 3AW radio in Melbourne on Wednesday that bush fires have had a long history in Australia. ""The official in question is talking through her hat, if I may say so,"" Abbott said. ""Climate change is real, as I've often said, and we should take strong action against it, but these fires are certainly not a function of climate change, they're a function of life in Australia,"" he said. ""We've had bad fires since almost the beginning of European settlement. It has been since humans were on the continent. The Aboriginal people managed the landscape through various forms of firestick farming.""

"(CNN)  -- Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel is the new Formula One world champion after winning the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. The German produced a peerless drive from pole position to take the checkered flag ahead of the McLaren pair of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, who led the championship standings going into the final race of the season, could only manage seventh place to see his title hopes ruined. The 23-year-old Vettel is the youngest-ever world champion in motorsport's premier class, claiming his fifth victory of the year to take the lead in the standings for the first time in a topsy-turvy season. ""I'm a bit speechless. I don't know what you are supposed to say in this moment,"" Vettel told the official post-race press conference. Blog: Vettel ushers in new F1 era . ""It has been an incredibly tough season, physically and mentally especially. But we have always believed in myself, my car, the team "" Spain's Alonso, who only needed to finish fourth to deny Vettel the title, looked to be the victim of a tactical error by his Ferrari team after being pulled in for an early pitstop. It left the two-time world champion behind slower cars and he could not overtake and make up lost ground on the tight Yas Marina circuit. Alonso defended his team after his shattering disappointment, having qualified third fastest behind Vettel and Hamilton. ""After the race, it is always very easy to see the best strategy,"" he told gathered reporters. ""But this is a sport. This is motor racing. Sometimes you win. Sometimes you lose. Congratulations to Red Bull and Sebastian, but next year we will try again."" Vettel's teammate Mark Webber, who trailed Alonso by eight points going into the final round, saw his chances disappear in similar fashion after a premature stop for new tires and finished eighth. He too defended his team's decision to bring him in early. ""Early in the race, obviously, we had to make a few calls to get out of that position we were in. It wasn't too bad till then. ""And going for the harder tire pretty early on obviously hurt Fernando (Alonso) too because he had to cover me off -- so in a way it was a bit of a team effort I suppose that helped Seb take the title -- but obviously I didn't get the result I wanted."" The victory left Vettel on top of the standings with 256 points, just four clear of Alonso. Webber finished the season on 242 points with 2008 champion Hamilton on 240. Red Bull had already clinched the constructors' title after the penultimate race in Brazil, but a solid display from McLaren left them in second place ahead of Ferrari.","Sebastian Vettel becomes youngest-ever F1 world champion .

"(CNN) -- Lotus driver Kimi Raikkonen stormed to a red-hot Abu Dhabi Grand Prix victory on Sunday, but the ice-cool Finn refused to get carried away following his first Formula One win in over three years. Championship leader Sebastian Vettel and archrival Fernando Alonso were both vying for points in the race for the drivers' title, but it was the 2007 world champion Raikkonen who finally delivered the grand prix win his 2012 form had threatened. The former Ferrari driver, who left the sport in 2009 and spent time in NASCAR and rally before returning to F1 with Lotus at the start of this season, admitted it was satisfying to prove he could still cut it at the front of the grid. ""To be honest it's just another win on the list for me,"" the 33-year-old told the sport's official website following the 19th win of his career and his first since the 2009 Belgian Grand Prix. Latest F1 standings after Abu Dhabi Grand Prix . Raikkonen has quickly readjusted to life in the cockpit. He sits third in the drivers' championship behind Red Bull's Vettel and Alonso of Ferrari having registered six podium finishes prior to his triumph at the Yas Marina Circuit. Raikkonen made his F1 debut in 2001 and is a veteran of 154 races starts. Despite his wealth of experience, the one-time McLaren driver admitted it was good to silence those who questioned whether his best days were behind him. ""It's great of course, because it's been a few years, but the wins prior to this one were very similar,"" he continued. ""We didn't have the best car, but we fought and still won. ""It's great to win now, so people will stop asking me if I can win or not, and at least it makes it a bit clearer!"" However Raikkonen knows a poor performance at the inaugural U.S. Grand Prix on November 17 will render his exploits in Abu Dhabi meaningless in the eyes of his critics. ""I never cared really what people think,"" he said. ""If I don't finish the next race, then they'll think that I'm as bad as that race. ""I'll just do my thing, and if I'm happy with what I'm doing and it's the best it can be for the team, then that's that. So I really don't care if people are thinking differently of me now, than what they did three hours before the race.""","Kimi Raikkonen plays down his win at Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Jenson Button won the Belgian Grand Prix Sunday after a spectacular first corner crash ended the hopes of championship leader Fernando Alonso and three other drivers. Frenchman Romain Grosjean clipped the McLaren of Button's teammate Lewis Hamilton and catapulted into the air in his Lotus, flying over Ferrari's Alonso and narrowly avoiding the head of the two-time champion from Spain. Mexican Sergio Perez of Sauber was also caught up in the crash. Miraculously, no-one was injured in the incident, but a safety car was deployed while the debris was cleared off the circuit at Spa-Francorchamps. Grosjean was later given a one-race ban by stewards after being held responsible for the carnage. Button, who was on pole, avoided the incident and quickly took command for his second victory of the year and the 14th of his career. The 2009 world champion came home nearly 14 seconds ahead of defending champion Sebastian Vettel, the Red Bull driver capitalizing on the chaos after starting a lowly 10th on the grid. Finland's Kimi Raikkonen for Lotus completed a podium of world champions in third place. Button, who has struggled since his opening race victory in Australia was delighted by his change in fortunes. ""What can I say, this circuit is so special to most drivers with the history and the way it flows. To get a victory from lights to flag is very special, especially as it has not been an easy year for me.

"(CNN) -- The Formula One title race took another twist on Sunday as Lewis Hamilton reignited his hopes with victory at the Italian Grand Prix, while Fernando Alonso extended his lead as rivals Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber flopped at Monza. Hamilton, whose future at McLaren has still yet to be decided, moved up to second in the standings with his first victory at the prestigious venue and third this season. ""It's a fantastic win in front of the best crowd. I'm happy for the team. It's been the best day,"" the 2008 world champion told reporters after giving McLaren a third successive victory. However, the English driver is still 37 points adrift of Alonso, who went into Ferrari's home race with a 24-point advantage over Vettel after being caught in a spectacular crash at Spa last weekend. Latest F1 standings . The Spaniard, seeking his third world title and first since he was at Renault in 2006, had to settle for third place after an impressive drive by Sergio Perez, whose Sauber team use Ferrari engines. ""That was a great race for me for my team. It's unbelievable to get a podium in Monza. It's really special,"" the Mexican said. Two-time world champion Vettel and Webber, who had been second and third overall, finished out of the points at the tail of the field as both drivers suffered problems. Their Red Bull team, seeking a third successive constructors' title, now have a 29-point lead over McLaren with seven races remaining. ""Towards the end of the race, I had no rear tires left and I was pushing reasonably hard,"" Webber said. ""I was worried about damaging the car. We do 330 km/h round here, I couldn't see the track, so we decided to retire."" It was the first time both Red Bull drivers had failed to win points since the race in South Korea in 2010. ""I found out I had a problem roughly 300 meters before I stopped the car. It was an alternator problem, similar to the one we had yesterday morning,"" Vettel said. ""It had been a good race for us given the lack of pace. There are not so many long straights at the next couple of circuits, so we can challenge there."" McLaren drivers dominate Italian qualifying . Hamilton started from pole position and finished the race with a comfortable 4.3-second margin over Perez, who began with hard tires while everyone else opted for medium Pirellis. Hamilton's teammate Jenson Button, who won the last race in Belgium, had been in second place but a fuel pick-up problem on the 33rd lap meant he failed to finish -- a result that has almost extinguished his hopes of adding to his 2009 world title. Perez climbed from eighth to second by the 29th lap, while Alonso also worked his way up the grid from 10th following technical problems in Saturday's qualifying. He was helped by Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa, who qualified third and gave up second place to Alonso on the 40th lap -- though Perez came through to secure his second runner-up finish this season and third podium position. Alonso survived a tussle with Vettel which earned the German a drive-through penalty, while Massa held on for fourth to equal his best result this season. ""It was a difficult race starting 10th, but we knew we had the quickest car, so to recover the way we did was good,"" Alonso said. Former world champion Kimi Raikkonen took fifth to be third in the overall standings, a point behind Hamilton and one ahead of Vettel. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher was sixth ahead of Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, while Paul di Resta was eighth for Force India and Kamui Kobayashi ninth in the second Sauber.

"(CNN) -- McLaren's Lewis Hamilton won the Canadian Grand Prix on Sunday to record his first victory of the Formula One season and move top of the drivers' standings. Frenchman Romain Grosjean in a Lotus produced an impressive drive to finish second, just ahead of Sauber's Sergio Perez. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel finished fourth, with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso in fifth, which kept the Spaniard just two points behind Hamilton in the title race. ""I never had a doubt in my mind that there would not be a possibility to win,"" said Hamilton, who is the seventh different winner in seven races this season. It was Hamilton's third Canadian Grand Prix victory in five attempts, and his 18th from 97 races overall, while teammate Jenson Button was out of the points in 16th. Latest F1 standings . While Alonso and world champion Vettel opted for a one-stop strategy, Hamilton made two stops but was able to force his way past the Spanish and German drivers. Hamilton had problems at both pit stops -- almost stalling at the first and then had a difficulty with one of his wheels at the second -- but the British driver recovered to first overtake Vettel on lap 62 and then motor past Alonso three laps later. As Alonso's tires faded the Ferrari driver slipped down to fifth, but he did manage to hold off Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg. ""Fernando and I took the decision to stay out,"" said Vettel, explaining Red Bull's race strategy. ""I felt pretty comfortable on the tires and obviously we were hoping to get the place back, but as it turned out it was the right thing to go for the second stop. ""We decided a few laps from the end to do a pit stop -- a stop here is not so long, about 15 seconds -- and in the end it was the right decision. ""Before the stop we were three to four seconds behind Fernando, but we ended up six seconds ahead of him."" Grosjean also adopted a one-stop strategy but with better success than Alonso as he secured the second podium placing of his career, both coming this season. ""It's been a great day for the team. It was an incredible race and the one stop strategy worked perfectly for us. It wasn't an easy race, but we wanted to be aggressive to achieve a good result,"" he said. His teammate Kimi Raikkonen was eighth, behind Red Bull's Mark Webber.

"(CNN) -- Teleka Patrick had much to look forward to. The new doctor was months into her Michigan hospital residency, and she had plans to visit her parents in Florida for Christmas. Then she failed to show for work this month, and her car was found abandoned in a ditch off a highway in neighboring Indiana. She was gone, along with her purse and keys, police say. Patrick's disappearance is a mystery to police, who've scoured the area to no avail, and to relatives. ""(Missing work) is out of character where she is concerned,"" her father, Matthias Patrick, told HLN's Nancy Grace on Wednesday. ""She is always deliberate about what she's doing."" Patrick, 33, moved to Kalamazoo just six months ago from California, where she earned a medical degree and another doctorate, her family told CNN affiliate WXMI. She was last seen in the parking lot of the hospital where she worked, Kalamazoo's Borgess Medical Center, on the evening of December 5, authorities say. Later that night, an Indiana State Police trooper found her car abandoned off Interstate 94 in Porter, Indiana -- about a 100-mile drive southwest of Kalamazoo. She was supposed to be at work at 7 a.m. the next day, but she was reported missing after she didn't arrive, her family said. Investigators have no information pointing to foul play, but also have no conclusive evidence that she left voluntarily, Kalamazoo County Undersheriff Paul Matyas told HLN this week. Police: Dogs tracked scent from car back to highway . Patrick's car ended up in a ditch about 30 to 40 feet off I-94, but didn't crash, Indiana State Police Sgt. Rick Strong told CNN on Thursday. Investigators used dogs to track the driver. ""(The dogs) indicated that whoever was in that vehicle ... tracked back to that roadway"" roughly 30 feet from the car, Strong said. The dogs sensed no trace after that. ""We have scoured, searched, and looked at everything we could possibly look at -- all the exits, all the businesses, all the hotels,"" Strong said. ""We posted fliers, we talked to neighbors (who live near the highway). We did a full-blown on-the-ground search in the wooded area north of where the car was."" ""We looked everywhere"" but have so far come up empty, he said. Patrick's disappearance shocked not only her friends and family, but also CNN's audience. People flocked to CNN iReport asking that CNN cover the story. The iReport had more than 65,000 views Thursday, as well as more than 400 comments asking for help in finding the missing woman. Patrick's parents told WXMI that she had just bought a plane ticket so that she could visit them in Florida at the end of the month. ""We were shocked. Disbelief,"" her mother, Irene Patrick, told WXMI. Patrick was working at Kalamazoo's two teaching hospitals, the Western University Michigan School of Medicine said. ""This young doctor is new to our community and part of our family of medical professionals, and we're all hoping and praying for her safe return,"" school spokeswoman Laura Eller said. ""We continue to work with authorities in their efforts to locate Dr. Patrick."" CNN's John Branch contributed to this report.","Dr. Teleka Patrick reported missing after not arriving at work .

"(CNN) -- Apple has the pieces needed to build an iPhone model that can connect to just about any cellular network. The evidence was found under the hood of a new iPhone 4 unit made for Verizon Wireless. To work with the nonstandard infrastructure used by Verizon, Apple needed to deploy a different cell chip. The hardware company had to alter parts of the iPhone's construction in order to make it compatible, Apple COO Tim Cook said during the phone's coming-out event. While the new iPhone will only work on Verizon's network, the Qualcomm chip Apple is using in these new models is capable of connecting to Verizon's network, as well as to carriers using the GSM standard, which is what AT&T and T-Mobile USA have. The finding was unearthed by repair firm iFixIt in a full dissection of a Verizon iPhone obtained through the pre-order system. The silicon chip in the iPhone is the same type used in another Verizon phone, the Droid Pro. The latter smartphone is designed for frequent travelers and can be used easily in most countries overseas. But Apple didn't develop the first-run Verizon iPhones in a way that lets them work internationally, despite the building blocks being there. For one, it's lacking the crucial SIM card slot used for telling the phone which network it should connect to and what its phone number is. AT&T is positioning this travel-ready ability as a major competitive advantage of its iPhones, and of other phones made for its network. That Apple has a healthy supply of these dual-carrier chips could be a sign of an impending ""universal iPhone."" Charles Golvin, an analyst for Forrester Research, is confident that the next iPhone model, expected to come out this summer, will be capable of working on both Verizon and AT&T, along with most cell networks worldwide, he said in an interview.","The inner workings of the Verizon iPhone provide hints as to Apple's future plans .

"(CNN) -- Formula One championship leader Fernando Alonso confirmed Tuesday that he will be fit for Ferrari's home race at Monza, after recovering from injuries sustained in a spectacular crash at the Belgian Grand Prix. Alonso complained of pain in his left shoulder, after French driver Romain Grosjean's Lotus flew over his Ferrari on the first corner of Sunday's race, narrowly missing his head. ""Today I woke up with no pain and 200% ready for Monza,"" Alonso wrote on his Twitter blog. Grosjean has been banned for one race for his part in the accident, which ended Alonso's chances along with McLaren's Lewis Hamilton and Mexican Sergio Perez of Sauber, after they were also caught up in the carnage. Hamilton's teammate Jenson Button went on to win the race from pole position after avoiding the incident. Alonso's championship lead was reduced to 24 points as two-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel capitalized on the chaos to finish second and move ahead of Red Bull teammate Mark Webber in the overall standings, heading into the Italian Grand Prix. The Spaniard said after the horror crash that he felt lucky to be able to race on in the championship. ""Given the misfortune of having had an accident like this, I am lucky to be able to get back in the car in just a few days,"" Alonso said. ""The level of safety of these cars is very high and [in Belgium] we saw further proof of that. ""I am not angry with Grosjean, he definitely didn't do it on purpose. It was a case of me being in the wrong place at the wrong time. ""We paid a high price through bad luck and luck owes us now. Let's see what happens in the rest of the season."" Ferrari team boss Stefano Domenicali has emphasized the importance of next Sunday's race for his drivers, following the accident at Spa-Francorchamps. ""We must quickly put this day behind us and look to the next grand prix, in Monza, a track that is particularly dear to us,"" Domenicali said. Grosjean, meanwhile, has been replaced by Lotus reserve driver Jerome D'Ambrosio, while he serves his suspension. Belgian D'Ambrosio, 26, tested for Lotus in preseason and drove for Virgin Racing last year, finishing last in the drivers' championship.","Fernando Alonso says he will be fit to race at this weekend's Italian Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Army Sgt. Kimberly Walker survived two tours of duty in Iraq -- only to be killed back home, allegedly by her boyfriend. Now, eight months later, her family is mourning again because they can't keep two SpongeBob Squarepants memorials at her gravesite. To say Walker loved the cartoon character may be an understatement. ""Every year, my sister had a SpongeBob birthday party,"" Walker's twin sister Kara said. ""Everything she had was SpongeBob."" Even her curtains and bathroom were decked out with the underwater fry cook's image, her mother told CNN affiliate WLWT. ""The funeral home actually bought the pillow of SpongeBob and we asked if they could put it in her casket,"" Deborah Walker said. So the family decided to spend $26,000 on two massive SpongeBob monuments at Walker's gravesite -- one in an Army uniform for Walker, and another in a Navy uniform to honor Kara, an IT specialist for the Navy. Each of the monuments stands more than 6 feet tall and weighs 7,000 pounds. Before the family ordered the SpongeBob memorials, it got the go-ahead from a cemetery representative, Deborah Walker said. ""They came and said, 'Yeah, we can go ahead and do SpongeBob.' She gave us a statement, we signed a contract, and then they started the design,"" the mother told WLWT. The stone SpongeBobs finally arrived on October 10. But less than a day later, Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati said it was going to remove the statues. ""The family chose a design with the guidance of a Spring Grove employee who unfortunately made an error in judgment,"" the cemetery's president told CNN. ""The monument does not fit within Spring Grove Cemetery guidelines, was not approved by senior management and cannot remain here."" Walker's family is devastated. ""It was just heartbreaking,"" Deborah Walker said. ""I just felt we were just trying to honor her wishes."" The family is going to meet with officials from the cemetery on Tuesday. Spring Grove said it is working with the Walkers to design a solution at the cemetery's expense ""that will properly memorialize Kimberly.""","Army Sgt.

"(CNN) -- There's a power struggle going on in the U.S. government right now. It's about who is in charge of cyber security, and how much control the government will exert over civilian networks. And by beating the drums of war, the military is coming out on top. ""The United States is fighting a cyberwar today, and we are losing,"" said former NSA director -- and current cyberwar contractor -- Mike McConnell. ""Cyber 9/11 has happened over the last ten years, but it happened slowly so we don't see it,"" said former National Cyber Security Division director Amit Yoran. Richard Clarke, whom Yoran replaced, wrote an entire book hyping the threat of cyberwar. General Keith Alexander, the current commander of the U.S. Cyber Command, hypes it every chance he gets. This isn't just rhetoric of a few over-eager government officials and headline writers; the entire national debate on cyberwar is plagued with exaggerations and hyperbole. Googling those names and terms -- as well as ""cyber Pearl Harbor,"" ""cyber Katrina,"" and even ""cyber Armageddon"" -- gives some idea how pervasive these memes are. Prefix ""cyber"" to something scary, and you end up with something really scary. Cyberspace has all sorts of threats, day in and day out. Cybercrime is by far the largest: fraud, through identity theft and other means, extortion, and so on. Cyber-espionage is another, both government- and corporate-sponsored. Traditional hacking, without a profit motive, is still a threat. So is cyber-activism: people, most often kids, playing politics by attacking government and corporate websites and networks. These threats cover a wide variety of perpetrators, motivations, tactics, and goals. You can see this variety in what the media has mislabeled as ""cyberwar."" The attacks against Estonian websites in 2007 were simple hacking attacks by ethnic Russians angry at anti-Russian policies; these were denial-of-service attacks, a normal risk in cyberspace and hardly unprecedented. A real-world comparison might be if an army invaded a country, then all got in line in front of people at the DMV so they couldn't renew their licenses. If that's what war looks like in the 21st century, we have little to fear. Similar attacks against Georgia, which accompanied an actual Russian invasion, were also probably the responsibility of citizen activists or organized crime. A series of power blackouts in Brazil was caused by criminal extortionists -- or was it sooty insulators? China is engaging in espionage, not war, in cyberspace. And so on. One problem is that there's no clear definition of ""cyberwar."" What does it look like? How does it start? When is it over? Even cybersecurity experts don't know the answers to these questions, and it's dangerous to broadly apply the term ""war"" unless we know a war is going on. Yet recent news articles have claimed that China declared cyberwar on Google, that Germany attacked China, and that a group of young hackers declared cyberwar on Australia. (Yes, cyberwar is so easy that even kids can do it.) Clearly we're not talking about real war here, but a rhetorical war: like the war on terror. We have a variety of institutions that can defend us when attacked: the police, the military, the Department of Homeland Security, various commercial products and services, and our own personal or corporate lawyers. The legal framework for any particular attack depends on two things: the attacker and the motive. Those are precisely the two things you don't know when you're being attacked on the Internet. We saw this on July 4 last year, when U.S. and South Korean websites were attacked by unknown perpetrators from North Korea -- or perhaps England. Or was it Florida? We surely need to improve our cybersecurity. But words have meaning, and metaphors matter. There's a power struggle going on for control of our nation's cybersecurity strategy, and the NSA and DoD are winning. If we frame the debate in terms of war, if we accept the military's expansive cyberspace definition of ""war,"" we feed our fears. We reinforce the notion that we're helpless -- what person or organization can defend itself in a war? -- and others need to protect us. We invite the military to take over security, and to ignore the limits on power that often get jettisoned during wartime. If, on the other hand, we use the more measured language of cybercrime, we change the debate. Crime fighting requires both resolve and resources, but it's done within the context of normal life. We willingly give our police extraordinary powers of investigation and arrest, but we temper these powers with a judicial system and legal protections for citizens. We need to be prepared for war, and a Cyber Command is just as vital as an Army or a Strategic Air Command. And because kid hackers and cyber-warriors use the same tactics, the defenses we build against crime and espionage will also protect us from more concerted attacks. But we're not fighting a cyberwar now, and the risks of a cyberwar are no greater than the risks of a ground invasion. We need peacetime cyber-security, administered within the myriad structure of public and private security institutions we already have. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier.","""Cyberwar"" is being described as a major, ever-present and ominous threat .

"Nelspruit, South Africa (CNN) -- It's dawn. An international South African sports star bolts out of bed after hearing an ""intruder."" He takes out a gun and fires one shot, killing a young innocent woman. But this is not the case of Olympian Oscar Pistorius. In an eerily similar incident in May 2004, former Springbok rugby player Rudi Visagie was awoken by his wife, who heard a car in their driveway in Nelspruit, South Africa. The couple thought a robber was taking off with their daughter's car. Amid heightened fears following their neighbors' killings the week before, he broke a bedroom window and fired at the car, hitting the driver in the neck. When the car came to a standstill, he ran toward it -- but his daughter's room was empty. ""I heard Rudi growling,"" his wife, Frieda Visagie, said. ""I wondered what's happening now ... and he told me it's Marle in the car."" Their daughter, Marle Visagie, 19, was in the driver's seat. And in that instant, their lives changed forever. ""It happened that one shot out of a million ... went right through the door and penetrated my daughter through the neck,"" Visagie said. ""She was dead on the site."" Marle Visagie was leaving the house about 5 a.m. to drop off a birthday gift to her boyfriend; she had notified her parents about the plan two weeks prior. In addition to mourning their daughter, the family was worried that the rugby star would be imprisoned. ""It's my daughter, it's my husband, what's going to happen now,"" his wife said. A court ruled that the former rugby player had suffered enough over his daughter's death, and opted not to prosecute him. Visagie was a household name and had represented South Africa in a series of international rugby games. 'You can't take that bullet back' His case closely mirrors that of Pistorius, who fatally shot his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, on Valentine's Day, saying he mistook her for an intruder. Pistorius, a double amputee who made history as the first Paralympic to compete in the able-bodied Olympics, is out on bail as he awaits trial on a premeditated murder charge. The track star has said he thought an intruder was hiding in a toilet room inside the bathroom of his Pretoria home. He says he fired in a fit of terror before realizing his girlfriend was inside. ""I can tell him, I feel with you,"" Visagie said. ""You are in the situation. You can't take it back ... you can't take that bullet back."" Pistorius left jail last week after posting a cash bond of about $11,200, with an additional $100,800 due by March 1. Though free pending trial, the man nicknamed ""the Blade Runner"" has to meet various bail conditions, including giving up alcohol, his passport and can't go near an airport, a judge ruled. He is not allowed to return to the home where the shooting occurred. Pistorius runs on special carbon fiber blades, hence the nickname. He was born with missing bones in his lower legs, and doctors amputated his legs below the knees when he was 11 months old. He attained fame as a symbol of triumph over adversity when he competed in the London Olympics last year. While he failed to win a medal there, he smashed a record to win the men's 400-meter race in the Paralympic Games a few weeks later. The hardest thing . The former rugby player said he sympathizes with the sprinter. People in such situations go through a lot of emotions, including fear, anger and helplessness, Frieda Visagie said. ""I didn't want to talk in front of people -- that was the hardest thing for me to do,"" her husband said . Despite the heartbreak, his Christian faith has helped him through the tough times. Now he travels throughout the country, counseling trauma victims. ""I just want to encourage him (Pistorius) and say listen, there are a lot of people praying for you,"" he said. And should he need to talk, Visagie said, he is ready to help.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- After much anticipation, and against the wishes of the international community, North Korea finally pushed the button on its third underground nuclear test, this time using more sophisticated technology than its previous attempts. While it marks another milestone in the short, but increasingly eventful, reign of young leader Kim Jong Un, it also threatens to undermine an already fragile security situation in the region. How worried should we be about North Korea's nuclear test? It's worrying but does this mean they can drop a nuclear weapon on Los Angeles? Absolutely not. The notion that they are going to target the U.S. is way off the mark. Any time the North Koreans stage a test, it significantly improves their nuclear capabilities. This comes after they staged a rocket launch that was successful, a long range rocket which appears to have put a satellite into orbit. What they need to achieve to have the weapon they want is the capability to miniaturize a warhead and put it on a rocket. This test isn't going to do that in and of itself, but it is a significant step forward. What will happen next? The U.N. Security Council will meet. South Korea is the chair this month so they get to call the agenda. There will be discussion about a much tougher sanctions resolution. The $64,000 question is whether the Chinese will in the end agree to anything significant enough for it to really affect North Korea. I think it's certain, whatever the U.N. does, the U.S. will move on its own to ratchet up sanctions. I also think the Americans will beef up their military presence in the region. It will mean stronger anti-missile defenses going to South Korea and possibly Japan . Why is China's reaction so important? The Chinese don't like the idea of international sanctions and coercing other countries. They still have a strategic interest in maintaining a viable separate North Korea as a buffer against a pro-U.S. South Korea and that has only become more important as tensions between the U.S. and China have increased. Are you worried about NK's tests? Share your views with CNN . On the other hand, a nuclear North Korea that is behaving in an adventuristic way risks very bad outcomes from the Chinese point of view. What China least wants is a more active, antagonistic, robust U.S. military presence in North East Asia in conjunction with the strengthening of military capabilities of allies who are not China's friends. Chinese companies are more involved in North Korea than they were half a dozen years ago, so the Chinese stand to lose on that front if the U.S. tightens sanctions. Who really calls the shots in North Korea? (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un has people around him but he's driving the show. There's no evidence to suggest that he's not in charge. All the personnel changes he made he was able to make without enough pushback for it to matter. He's got military people around him, and his uncle. I don't see any evidence to see that he's not ultimately in charge. How significant is the timing of the test? It's the birthday of Kim Jong Il (Kim Jong Un's late father) on (Saturday). Assuming this (test) is not a total dud, this will be ... great propaganda and they will play it to the hilt. North Koreans are extremely nationalistic. They may be hungry, they may be miserable but by God they've got a bomb and they can stand up to the rest of the world and that really, really matters in North Korea. You also have a power transitions in Seoul, Tokyo (and the U.S.). How can Barack Obama not devote more attention to North Korea in his State of the Union address? Everyone is reacting to them and that's how they (North Koreans) like it. What don't we know? We don't know yet whether this was a test of a plutonium device or a uranium device. The previous two tests were plutonium. We know they have a uranium enrichment capability. We know that a uranium bomb, once they master it, is easier to make and they have deposits of uranium in North Korea so they can keep digging it up. If they have successfully detonated a uranium bomb and they have moved forward in the process of developing the technical capabilities to miniaturize it and put it on a war head, then in purely military terms it's worrying . The test also raises interesting questions on the proliferation front. The more successful they are with this program, the scarier the consequences should they choose, for example, to provide Iran with test data or fissile material or other information.","Test a ""step forward"" in North Korea's nuclear ambitions, says Chinoy .
U.S. likely to push for tougher sanctions, he says .
China's reaction to nuclear test will be key .

"(CNN) -- A pregnant woman has gone missing on the picturesque Hawaiian island of Maui, spurring a search that has led to her torched SUV -- but not her. Maui police first issued a missing persons alert for Carly ""Charli"" Joann Scott on Wednesday, two days after her mother reported her missing. The 27-year-old woman, who is 5 months' pregnant, was last seen around 8 p.m. local time Sunday at her sister's home in Haiku. She left there in her silver 1997 Toyota 4Runner. The missing woman's mother, Kimberly Scott, said it ""is very unusual for Carly to just up and leave without telling anyone,"" according to a police statement posted on Maui County's Facebook page. Authorities were able to track down her vehicle in the Peahi area on Wednesday. While it was burnt, police said that its vehicle identification number was legible and tied it to Scott. The next day, a member of the search party looking for the Hawaii resident found what police only described as ""possible evidence."" ""We are asking anyone who is assisting in the search to call the (police) department if they find any suspicious items, however, please do not touch, move or recover the item as it may be evidence in this case or another case that the department is investigating,"" the police said. CNN affiliate KGMB/KHNL reported that Scott's ex-boyfriend -- who said he loved her and that the two ""occasionally hooked up"" -- told them that he'd been with her last Sunday night. The two were following each other on a road, but then he claimed he lost track of her. The ex-boyfriend claimed that he'd assisted in searches for Scott, though her family had become ""hostile"" to him lately. Scott's stepfather, Johnny Pipkin, told the same affiliate that the family was riding a roller coaster as it did everything they could to find the woman they called ""Charli."" ""It's moment to moment,"" Pipkin said. ""Up, down. Up, down. Tired ... Frustrated.""","Carly ""Charli"" Joann Scott, who is 5 months' pregnant, was last seen last Sunday in Maui .

"(CNN) -- Formula One driver Jenson Button insists McLaren will bounce back from a disappointing start to 2013, but the Briton has written off his team's chances of competing for the world championship this season. The 2009 world champion started the year in confident mood after finishing the 2012 by winning the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix. But the current campaign has been a miserable one for the British team, with Button languishing 10th in the drivers' standings after finishing 14th and out of the points at the recent Canadian Grand Prix. However, Button is confident McLaren, one of the most successful teams in F1 history, will restore its reputation in the year's remaining races and in the coming seasons. ""Clearly, we'd hoped for more success this season, especially after last season, during which we won seven grands prix, including two of the last three,"" the 33-year-old told the sport's official website. ""So, going forward, as I say, we'd hoped for more this season, but I firmly believe that there'll be good seasons ahead for us."" A fifth-place finish is the best Button has been able to muster in seven races this season. There have also been reports of friction between Button and Mexican teammate Sergio Perez, the 23-year-old known as ""Checo"" who arrived as a replacement for Lewis Hamilton, now at Mercedes. ""Checo is a very nice lad,"" said Button. ""Maybe he's a bit too forceful sometimes, by his own admission, but he's undoubtedly quick, and he's still learning because you never stop learning in this game. ""He's trying to make his mark -- but I think that's how it should be. ""Your teammate is never going to be your best friend, because people will always compare your performance with his and inevitably you want to emerge positively from that comparison, but Checo and I get on well -- and that is more than you can say about some teammate relationships these days! Button is hoping McLaren's impending partnership with engine supplier Honda -- set to come into effect from 2015 onwards -- can propel the team back towards the front of the grid. Originally partners between 1988 and 1992, McLaren and Honda won multiple drivers' and constructors' titles with legendary names like Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. ""In 2004, McLaren won only one grand prix, but it won 10 grands prix in 2005, in 2006 McLaren won no grands prix, but it won eight grands prix in 2007,"" explained the former Brawn driver. ""So I think history shows us that McLaren will win again, well and often, and, as I say, I reckon the next McLaren-Honda era could be very exciting indeed."" Earlier this year Button said he intends to stay with McLaren until he retires, although he is not considering when that may be. ""I've had a great career,"" he added. ""I've won 15 grands prix and one world championship. I intend to do quite a bit more winning in the future. As to how many years that future may reach forwards to, I haven't decided yet. Wait and see.""","Jenson Button backs McLaren to recover from a low-key start to 2013 .

"(CNN) -- When you're on a roll, you generally get all the breaks. And when you're a top football club like Bayern Munich, you make the most of them. The European champion came from behind to win 2-1 at Hoffenheim Saturday, equaling the German Bundesliga's record run of 36 matches unbeaten. Pep Guardiola's team can claim sole ownership of that milestone next weekend at home to lowly Augsburg, moving past the mark set by Hamburg 30 years ago. However, the Bavarians will face a slightly tougher test before then in Tuesday's Champions League trip to Viktoria Plzen, having won the home encounter 5-0 against the Czech side. ""It certainly wasn't our best performance, but we've won it,"" Guardiola said after his team regained a one-point lead at the top of the table. ""Not everything was perfect, and we'll need to correct the way we're playing. Meetings with Hoffenheim in recent years have always been close, but we did have a little bit of luck today."" The pressure was on Bayern following second-placed Borussia Dortmund's 6-1 hammering of Stuttgart on Friday. The home side had scored more goals this season than any other in the Bundesliga, and extended that when 18-year-old defender Niklas Sule became the youngest player in Hoffenheim history to find the back of the net. However, Bayern equalized before halftime when Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic deflected in Franck Ribery's low free-kick for his eighth in the league this season, and the Frenchman was also involved as Thomas Muller scrambled a second-half winner from close range. ""We gave a good account of ourselves against the best team in the world,"" said Sule, who capitalized when Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer failed to deal with a corner. ""We held them off well and we had chances of our own. But Bayern have the quality you need to go on and score the winning goal."" Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen dropped four points behind Bayern, losing 1-0 at bottom club Eintracht Braunschweig thanks to an 81st-minute goal by Congolese striker Domi Kumbela. Braunschweig joined Nuremberg on seven points from 11 games after Bayern's local rival lost 3-0 at home to Freiburg -- which moved up to third from bottom. Borussia Monchengladbach stayed fourth with a 2-0 win at Hamburg, as striker Max Kruse scored in each half to go to seven this season. Wolfsburg moved up to fifth with a 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt, while sixth-placed Schalke won 2-0 at Hertha Berlin, two points back in seventh place.","Bayern Munich returns to top of German league table with 2-1 victory at Hoffenheim .

"(CNN) -- Looking for that perfect book that takes you from your reading chair to the high seas of adventure? Look no further than our list of some of the best sea stories of all time. Whether you want a classic tale of survival against the odds, or to be taken on a journey to find secret treasure, this list has got you covered. The Perfect Storm, Sebastian Junger . Based on true events, ""The Perfect Storm,2 is a tale of man versus nature. In 1991 a series of weather systems collide to create an all-powerful storm off the Nova Scotia coast. A crew of fishermen on the Massachusetts-based trawler ""Andrea Gail'"" were caught unawares in the storm, and were left to battle waves that reached up to 100 feet high. ""The Perfect Storm"" gives an insight into the extreme dangers of the lucrative business of deep-sea fishing. It tells of the courage of men at sea, and the difficulties faced by loved ones left behind. The book was later adapted into a Hollywood blockbuster, starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg. The Old Man and the Sea, Ernest Hemingway . Following the publication of ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" Hemingway received the The Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. The novel tells the story of an unlucky old fisherman in Cuba who has gone months without catching a fish, but eventually battles it out with a large and valuable marlin. The exercise leaves him exhausted, and fruitless. It's a tale of overcoming defeat, and persistence in the face of failure. Hemingway is widely regarded for his eloquent way with words, which is excellently displayed in ""The Old Man and the Sea."" Moby-Dick (or The Whale), Herman Melville . The classic American narrative ""Moby-Dick"" is an old favorite that has been re-told in cartoons, television series and film. The legend is told through the eyes of Ishmael, who sets sail on a whaling ship under an erratic captain. The captain is seeking out one whale in particular, Moby-Dick, who in an early encounter injured the skipper, leaving him with a wooden leg. The book shows us the depths people will go to seek revenge. Master and Commander, Patrick O'Brian . The first in a series of books that focuses on the relationship between the captain of an English navy ship, Jack Aubrey, and ship surgeon Stephen Maturin, ""Master and Commander"" is set in the 19th century. Aubrey is promoted to captain as Britain is at war with France, led by one of the greatest military leaders in history, Napoleon Bonaparte. Their ship, ""HMS Sophie,"" is aging and the crew's experience lacking, but despite the odds they continue to seek adventure and ultimately victory against the enemy. This story was also given the silver screen treatment, with Russell Crowe starring in a movie adaptation of the novel. Treasure Island, Robert Louis Stevenson . The ultimate adventure on the high seas -- full of pirates, a mutiny and of course a treasure bounty. Characters of ""Treasure Island,"" such as Long John Silver, have become household names. Jim Hawkins, the son of owners of a seaside English inn, finds a map where the notorious Captain Flint has hidden his treasure. But when a crew is assembled to find it, it soon becomes apparent there are enemies within. This novel was first published in 1883 as a children's book, but that hasn't stopped adults of all ages appreciating it for centuries. Have we missed one of your favorites?

"Chhukha, Bhutan (CNN) -- Bhutan is the last of the Himalayan kingdoms. The small country is situated in the nooks and crannies of the highest mountain range on earth. It's a special place that didn't have paved roads until the 1960s, was off-limits to foreign tourists until the 1970's, and didn't have television until 1999, the last country in the world to get service. The altitude and scenery are enough to take your breath away. In this country the environment is cherished. The kingdom lists environmental protection as one of the four pillars of happiness, a state of mind the country takes so seriously that ""gross national happiness"" is considered more important than gross domestic product. Still, Bhutan is modernizing and looking at how to use its resources responsibly. Water is one of its most abundant resources. ""Some people tell me that it's the 'moving gold,' "" Sherup Tenzing, the executive engineer for Druk Green Power Corporation in Chhukha, said. ""Since the river patterns in Bhutan are naturally designed in such a way that it can produce huge amount of energy -- that is also clean energy."" Bhutan is tapping into that clean energy on a massive scale. Hydropower is the sole source of electricity in the country and experts say the country is only using about 5 percent of its potential right now. ""After 2020 we have a target of accomplishing 15 additional power plants and 3 are already under construction and they have achieved good progress,"" Tenzin said. Bhutan's very first hydropower plant was set up in Chhukha, about a two-hour drive from the capital Thimphu. The dam that harnesses the water is a spectacle in and of itself. It is beautifully painted with Buddhist deities, including the water goddess. Even in the belly of the plant, the most utilitarian space has a wall covered with a colorfully painted mural depicting the life of Buddha. The mural adds beauty to what would normally be quite drab and dank. In Bhutan hydroelectricity has become big business; actually, the biggest business. The clean energy created in this small country (it's about the size of Switzerland with a population less than that of San Francisco) is being sold to one of Bhutan's power-starved and highly populated neighbors: India. ""More than 60 percent of our GDP comes from hydro-power,"" Bhutan's Prime Minister Jigme Thinley told CNN. He says the clean energy business is a perfect fit for the country. ""Bhutan is ecologically a very fragile region, being located in the vulnerable Himalayas. And in fact, even with respect to hydropower, we are engaging in its realization only because it is ecologically friendly, these are all run-of-the river schemes with minimum or no damage to the ecology,"" the prime minister said. Not everyone is convinced. Government adviser Dasho Paljor J. Dorji worries too many dams may harm the creatures that live in the water. ""It's a shame that so much of our rivers are being tapped. The aim is good. [But] it happens so quickly. I thought that, perhaps, we might be able to leave some of our rivers, still pristine with its natural beauty instead of damming them all,"" Dorji said. Still, Dorji is well aware of all the benefits from an energy source that doesn't pollute the air. Eighty percent of the country now has electricity and the goal is to have the entire nation electrified by 2013, all of it provided by hydropower. The clean energy has changed many lives in Bhutan. Farmer Zangmo, who uses only one name that is typical in the country, got electricity for the first time in 2000. ""Earlier, when electricity wasn't there, we faced a lot of problems. We had to depend on firewood for everything. Everything was dark, back then,"" Zangmo said. Electricity has helped increase the family income too. Earlier, after backbreaking work harvesting rice in the fields, the family would have to spend their days beating the husks off the rice. Now Zangmo flicks a switch and the electrical machine does the de-husking, making work more efficient and faster. She says she doesn't know how the electricity is made but she is thankful for it. In fact, many of the people benefiting from hydropower have no idea that the pristine water in their rivers is generating the lights in their homes and businesses. When we told Zangmo that running water was helping create the electricity in her home her eye opened wide and she said: ""We didn't know that water could produce electricity. It is unbelievable.""","Hydropower is the sole source of electricity in Bhutan .

"(CNN) -- Champagne, Pele and FIFA. It sounds just like another soiree for those who run international football. Yet it's fundamentally different this time for the Champagne in question is a certain Jerome, the 55-year-old who launched his campaign to dethrone FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Monday. Once one of Blatter's closest allies following his work as FIFA's deputy Secretary General between 2002 and 2005, the former diplomat is now eying the top job itself ahead of the presidential elections in June 2015. He is the first candidate to throw his hat into the ring, although both Blatter and UEFA president Michel Platini are also expected to stand -- albeit without declaring their intentions yet. Adding sparkle and fizz to the opening of Champagne's campaign was the backing of former Brazil star Pele. ""I cannot stay away from a debate which is so important for the future of football and thus, I support Jerome Champagne and his vision,"" the 73-year-old said in a video message. Pele said that the pair became friends when he was Brazil's Minister of Sport and Champagne was working at the French Embassy in Brazil. However, Champagne -- who worked at FIFA for 11 years before leaving football's world governing body in 2010 -- chose London and the site where the English FA, the planet's oldest, was founded in 1863 to launch his bid. Image Problem . In a wide-ranging reform program, the Frenchman outlined his support for greater use of technology in football, a desire to see orange cards and the use of a sinbin to be used between a yellow and red card while also calling for more transparency in the running of FIFA. ""I have to recognize there is an image problem that we need to reconcile,"" Champagne told CNN. ""If we want to tackle the challenges of the game in the 21st century, we need a FIFA that is more proactive, regulating and democratic -- and that comes with transparency and accountability."" Campaigning under the banner ""Hope for Football, Hope for All"", a man who helped Blatter stand for a successful reelection in 2002 also expressed a desire to redress global imbalances, believing in major disparities in the power of certain leagues, countries and continents. ""FIFA is no different to the rest of our society,"" he told CNN's World Sport program. ""We see a growing wealthiest 1% controlling more of the game, and the middle and less favored classes suffer from that situation. Football is a universal vehicle, and that's why we need to protect it so that it can connect people and nations together."" In a move likely to find favor with many football fans around the world, Champagne also backed an ongoing investigation into how Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup. ""The World Cup is the largest, most followed sport event in the world. We need to go to a World Cup with total tranquility and serenity,"" said a man who is bidding to become the first French president of FIFA since Jules Rimet, the founder of the World Cup, in the 1950's. ""If something (improper) has happened, we need to know and if nothing has happened, we need to know as well."" The decision has proven highly controversial, especially with the mooted suggestion that the tournament will now be played outside of the traditional months of May-July for the first time in World Cup history because of the intense heat during the Qatari summer. Funding his own campaign, Champagne needs the support of five national associations to be eligible to stand for election. He believes this will be possible because of his consultancy work with a number of FA's around the world since leaving FIFA in 2010. Televised Debate . He may need to work on his campaigning style though, after telling reporters on Monday that he was not sure he could beat Blatter when asked if he could depose the man that has led FIFA since 1998. ""No, I don't think so. He is someone of relevance and we'll see but it's a very hypothetical question,"" he replied. ""A lot can happen."" Nonetheless, Champagne seems as though he will be happy if he can make how the game should be run into a global conversation. He wants all the presidential candidates to take part in live televised debates whereby both viewers and fans can ask questions. ""At the very least I want to open up the debate so these issues are examined properly,"" he added. Should he perhaps surprise even himself and emerge victorious in 2015, Champagne would not have to move far -- since he already lives in Zurich, where FIFA is based, with his wife and children.","Jerome Champagne launches bid for FIFA presidency .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Secret Service report on Chris Brown's alleged assault on a man in Washington on Sunday offers insight into the singer's possible defense strategy. The document obtained by CNN suggests that Brown's bodyguard will take the rap for a man's broken nose, while lawyers could question the creditability of one of the police officers who investigated the case. ""I was on the (tour) bus when I guess someone tried to get on and my bodyguard handled it,"" Brown told a Secret Service officer investigating the incident on a sidewalk in front of the W Hotel just a few blocks from the White House. The incident happened around 4:25 a.m. Sunday, hours after the singer hosted a party at a nearby nightclub. ""Christopher Brown committed no crime,"" his attorney Danny Onorato said Monday. ""We understand that his security acted to protect Mr. Brown and his property, as he is authorized to do under District of Columbia law. We are confident that Mr. Brown will be exonerated of any wrongdoing."" Brown bodyguard Christopher Hollosy -- who stands 6 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs 240 pounds -- told investigators he punched the man in the face because he tried to follow Brown into the tour bus. The man was trying to get to Brown, so he ""was just doing his job"" as a bodyguard when broke his nose, he said, according to the report. Assault charge against Chris Brown reduced . Brown's weekend arrest in the District of Columbia threatens his freedom in California, where he is serving felony probation for the 2009 domestic violence conviction in his attack on ex-girlfriend Rihanna. Beating the simple assault charge in Washington would help his lawyer persuade a Los Angeles judge not to find him in violation of probation rules, which require him to stay out of any legal trouble. Brown, 24, checked himself into a ""rehab facility"" Tuesday in an effort to ""gain focus and insight into his past and recent behavior, enabling him to continue the pursuit of his life and his career from a healthier vantage point,"" his representative told CNN. It is unclear if Brown's rehab stint will cause him to miss two court dates next month -- including a November 20 probation hearing in Los Angeles and a November 24 preliminary hearing on the assault case in Washington. Prosecution of the assault charges against Brown and his bodyguard is based on statements given to investigators by the alleged victim -- identified as Isaac Adams Parker, 20, of Beltsville, Maryland -- and a woman who is a friend of Parker. Cop's credibility questioned . The woman, who is not identified in the police reports, told a Secret Service officer that the violence started when she and a female friend were standing on each side of Brown, posing while the singer's bodyguard used her cell phone to take a photo. When Parker ""moved in"" and tried to take his own photo with Brown and the women, she heard Brown tell Parker, ""I'm not with that gay s--t,"" and then ""I feel like boxing,"" according to the Secret Service report. Brown then punched Parker in the face with a closed fist, she said. Parker also told the Secret Service officer that when he tried to get into the photo, Brown said ""I ain't down with that gay s--t,"" the report said. Another witness told the officer that he saw Brown chase Parker and swing at him, but he couldn't see if Brown's punch landed on Parker. But Brown's lawyers could raise questions about Parker's credibility -- or at least the credibility of one of the investigating police officers -- based on what the Secret Service officer reported. Chris Brown fast facts . A friend of Brown's says that a Metropolitan Police Department officer told him that Parker said Brown never hit him, the Secret Service report says. The report says the officer denied to other detectives that he had spoken to Brown's friend. However, the Secret Service officer contradicts him. ""A uniformed Secret Service officer approached detectives and verified that he overheard the MPD officer"" telling Brown's friend that Parker said Brown never hit him, the report says. Parker ""denied he ever told anyone"" that Brown had not hit him, according to the report. Anger management rehab? There has been no indication that Brown has a substance abuse problem. The behavior that has landed him in legal trouble over the past several years has been anger management. Brown's brutal attack on Rihanna on the eve of the Grammys in February 2009 resulted in a felony domestic violence conviction that carried a lengthy probation period. A judge found him in violation of that probation in August because of discrepancies in proving he fulfilled the court-ordered 1,400 hours of community labor. He imposed another 1,000 hours of work. The Los Angeles County district attorney appears in no mood to cut Brown any breaks, which suggests that prosecutors will ask for jail time for him because of the arrest early Sunday in the shadow of the White House. While the simple assault charge in Washington is a misdemeanor, it could trigger a probation revocation. Hit-and-run charge against Chris Brown dropped . Brown is in a vulnerable position. The Los Angeles judge overseeing his felony probation could order him to complete as many as four years in prison for the beating of Rihanna if he is found in violation of probation. Prosecutors have declined to comment on if they will seek to put him behind bars. Brown spent 36 hours in a Washington jail and was taken to court in shackles Monday afternoon. He was released and ordered to report to his California probation officer within 48 hours. He checked into an undisclosed California rehab facility the next day. The probation officer's job is to prepare a report for the Los Angeles judge who will decide if Brown will be found in violation of his probation. Going to rehab could allow Brown lawyer Mark Geragos to argue that the entertainer is getting proper help for his core problem. The statement from Brown's representative did not disclose how long he intends to stay or what might be a ""healthier vantage point"" for him. CNN's Greg Seaby and Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","Brown's bodyguard says he ""was just doing his job"" when he hit the man, report says .

"(CNN) -- Arizona surgeons repaired a hole in rocker Bret Michaels' heart Monday, a hospital spokeswoman said. The hole, medically known as a patent foramen ovale, was discovered last April while Michaels was being treated for a brain hemorrhage at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix. ""Without treatment for the PFO, Michaels could be at risk for developing blood clots and additional stroke,"" hospital spokeswoman Carmelle Malkovich said. Michaels, 47, delayed the surgery until this month to allow him to complete a concert tour and appear on the season finale of the reality show ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" which he won last summer. ""Doctors will insert a catheter into a vein in the groin and guide wires and a PFO closure device into the heart with imaging assistance to close the PFO,"" said a hospital statement issued prior to the surgery. ""The device will remain in Michaels' heart permanently to stop abnormal blood flow between the two chambers of the heart."" The hole is believed to have caused a ""warning stroke"" Michaels suffered in May during his brain treatment. The singer felt the left side of his body growing numb, prompting him to return to the hospital that treated him for a massive brain hemorrhage in April, his publicist said at the time. His doctors concluded that Michaels had suffered a transient ischemic attack, or warning stroke, that was prompted by a hole in his heart, Malkovich said. The heart problem was probably not related to Michaels' brain hemorrhage, said Dr. Joseph Zabramski, the neurosurgeon who treated his brain hemorrhage. Michaels was the lead singer for the '80s glam-metal ""hair band"" Poison. He became a reality TV star by headlining the VH1 show ""Rock of Love With Bret Michaels"" as well as appearing on ""Celebrity Apprentice."" His ""Roses & Thorns"" tour with the Bret Michaels Band was interrupted when the singer was stricken by an excruciating headache on April 22. Doctors at the Barrow Neurological Institute, a part of St. Joseph's Hospital, diagnosed him with a rupture in his brain, but they never pinpointed the cause. Michaels was released from the hospital 12 days later.","The hole in Michaels' heart was found last May .

"(CNN) -- The gunman in the Reno, Nevada-area medical center shooting that left one person dead has been identified as longtime Plumas County resident Alan Frazier, 51, Sheriff Greg Hagwood said Thursday. Frazier had no serious run-ins with law enforcement before Tuesday's shooting, which also left two victims injured and Frazier dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Without elaborating, police said Wednesday that the attack did not appear random. Dr. Charles Gholdoian, 46, was killed, and patient Shawntae Spears, 20, was wounded, Reno Deputy Police Chief Mac Venzon said at a news conference. Dr. Christine Lajeunesse is in critical condition, but conscious, a spokeswoman for the city told CNN on Wednesday. Spears and Lajeunesse suffered single gunshot wounds. Spears also is in critical condition at Renown Regional Medical Center. The investigation, which includes interviews with 29 witnesses, indicates Frazier walked past the front desk to a patient exam room area and fired five rounds from his 12-gauge shotgun. He later killed himself with the weapon, Venzon said. The shooting occurred at the Urology Nevada office on the third floor of a medical building near Renown, leading investigators to believe it wasn't random, Venzon said. Asked to explain, the deputy chief said the shooter passed the first and second floors, and making ""his way to the third floor of the building would indicate to me this is not a random event."" He further said that it did not appear the shooter had a relationship with any of the victims, but the matter is still under investigation. Police don't have a motive, but according to a statement from the City of Reno that summarized comments from Reno police Lt. William Rulla, the shooter's focus might have been on physicians at the office. He had had surgery in 2010 and claimed he was having adverse symptoms because of it, Rulla said. As part of their investigation, detectives served a search warrant at Frazier's home. They discovered a letter there that indicated his intent, as well as other firearms and notes suggesting the shooting was to be his final act, the lieutenant said. Kat Raco, an ophthalmic technician who works on the second floor of the Nevada Advanced Medicine building, told CNN that she heard at least two large booms and then the sound of scampering feet above her. Raco said she and others in her office were seeing patients when the shooting occurred and first thought someone or something had fallen. Police were there quickly, she said, telling them to lock the doors and not let anyone in. About 10 minutes after that, more police escorted everyone on the second floor to a catwalk between the building and a parking garage. A plainclothes officer asked questions before staff was allowed to leave about 45 minutes after the shooting. ""The police handled it in the best way possible,"" Raco said. ""They were very professional and calm. Everyone (in the office) stayed pretty calm."" Raco said there are no armed guards in the building. The medical center describes itself as the only Level II trauma center in that region of Nevada and is home to the area's only Children's Hospital, its website says. The facility also offers the region's largest number of clinical research trials. Last month, there was a hospital shooting in Wisconsin when police shot and wounded an armed man on the neonatal intensive care floor of a Milwaukee-area children's hospital, authorities said. Milwaukee police had gone to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to arrest the man on a felony warrant and found him holding a child in the intensive care unit, authorities said. Instead of surrendering, the man took out a handgun and fled down a hallway, prompting police to shoot him. Colorado school shooter planned larger attack, Sheriff's Office says .

"(CNN) -- In his 11 years in charge at Goodison Park, David Moyes never witnessed an Everton victory at Old Trafford. At least now he can scratch that off his 'to do list'. A 1-0 home defeat by his former employer courtesy of Bryan Oviedo's 86th minute strike means Manchester United is now 12 points adrift of league leader Arsenal after just 14 games of the season. ""I'm very disappointed,"" United manager Moyes told Sky Sports following Wednesday's game. ""We needed a bit of good fortune and we didn't get it. Everton kept at it and showed us what a good team they are. ""We didn't defend the goal well enough so it was our own doing. We had some chances as well, as did Everton. they have been playing well and that's why they are up near the top of the league. ""It wasn't about me tonight, I was fortunate to manage Everton and I'm fortunate to be managing Manchester United. It's a big catch up for us now."" Moyes was left frustrated after his side, which included former Everton midfielder Marouane Fellaini, failed to fire. It was Everton's first success on the red half of Manchester since 1992 but it could scarcely have come at a better time for Roberto Martinez's side. When Moyes left Goodison to replace Alex Ferguson at the end of last season, much of the talk was how United would move forward. Instead, it is Everton which has moved on -- climbing to fifth in the table while playing a far more expansive brand of football. ""It was a big battle today,"" Martinez told Sky Sports. ""We were outstanding at playing Manchester United eye-to-eye. ""It is fair to say we did expect United to have their chances, but we were very confident with Tim Howard and our defenders. ""As an away team, you normally feel you will have only one or two chances maximum. But with our ambition, we created many, many chances. ""If you look at the overall position we deserved all three points and that is an incredible statement."" While Everton was busy pulling off a stunning win, Merseyside neighbor Liverpool was also in the midst of something special as Luis Suarez scored four times in his side's 5-1 mauling of Norwich. Suarez, who has now 11 goals against Norwich in four appearances, including three hat-tricks, took his career tally to 51 Premier League goals. Raheem Sterling rounded off the scoring to leave Liverpool in fourth -- seven points off the top. Elsewhere, Arsenal remains four points clear at the top of the table following a comfortable 2-0 home win over Hull City. Nicklas Bendtner gave the home side an early lead before Mesut Ozil sealed the win in the second half. Arsene Wenger's men sit above Chelsea which earned a 4-3 win at Sunderland. Eden Hazard scored twice and Frank Lampard was also on target in a seven-goal thriller. Manchester City remains in the hunt following a 3-2 win at West Bromwich Albion. City, which is currently third, survived a late fightback after sailing into a three-goal lead with Yaya Toure's double adding to Sergio Aguero's opener. Elsewhere, Tottenham claimed a 2-1 win at Fulham, Aston Villa beat Southampton 3-2 while Cardiff claimed a point at Stoke following a goalless draw. France . In France, Paris Saint-Germain suffered a shock 2-0 defeat at Evian as it failed to equal the record for its longest unbeaten streak in the top flight. PSG entered the contest unbeaten in 26 previous league matches, one short of the record set by the title winning side of 1993-94. It had also hoped to equal the overall run of 36 games without defeat in all competitions -- a streak which does not include the penalty shoot-out defeat by Evian in last season's French Cup. Again it was Evian which proved to be PSG's undoing with Clarck Nsikulu and on-loan Marseille winger Modou Sougou doing the damage late on. PSG is now just a point clear of Lille at the top of the table and two clear of third place Monaco. Germany . Bayern Munich booked its place in the last eight of the German Cup with a 2-0 win at Augsburg, despite losing winger Arjen Robben to injury. Robben, who opened the scoring after just four minutes, was forced out of the tie following a collision with Augsburg keeper Marwin Hitz. The Dutchman's replacement, Thomas Muller, scored his side's second 12 minutes from time to seal the win. Elsewhere, there were wins for Bayer Leverkusen, Eintracht Frankfurt and Wolfsburg.","Manchester United beaten 1-0 at home by Everton .

"(CNN) -- Not knowing. It's the hardest part. That's the truth facing the loved ones of slain or missing Americans. So when a 19-year-old Pennsylvania woman already facing murder charges told a newspaper reporter that she'd killed before -- over and over again, from Alaska to North Carolina -- loved ones couldn't help but sit up and take notice, said Kristy Dyroff, a spokeswoman for the National Organization for Victim Assistance. ""Anyone hands them the least glimmer of hope, they latch on to it,"" she said. ""The biggest difficulty for victims is they have no control, and they're trying to regain some by doing something proactive."" Murder suspect's bombshell claims raise questions . On Sunday, the Daily Item newspaper in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, published a jailhouse interview with murder suspect Miranda Barbour in which she claimed a string of killings dating back six years -- to when she was 13. ""I would lure these people in,"" the Daily Item quoted her as saying. ""I studied them. I learned them and even became their friend. I did this to people who did bad things and didn't deserve to be here anymore."" Barbour took credit for more than 22 but fewer than 100 killings, Daily Item reporter Francis Scarcella told CNN affiliate WNEP. Authorities haven't verified her claims, although they are investigating. Barbour and her husband, Elytte Barbour, 22, do face murder charges in the 2013 death of 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara, who police say was strangled and repeatedly stabbed by the couple before being dumped in a yard. If her other claims are true, Barbour would be one of the nation's most prolific serial killers. Gary Ridgway, known as the Green River Killer, pleaded guilty to killing 49 women in Washington state in the 1980s and 1990s. Randy Steven Kraft may have killed as many as 65 young men in the 1970s and early 1980s. Based on the numbers she gave Scarcella, Barbour would have had to kill on average somewhere between every three weeks and every three months. For six years. Without leaving a trace. Yet in the 2013 killing, police documents show Barbour told police she and her husband couldn't clean up all the blood LaFerrara's killing left in her CR-V, and that one of the ways investigators traced the killing to her was her own cell phone. The last number dialed on LaFerrara's phone led to Barbour, according to police. Even the prosecutor who hopes to convict the couple, Northumberland County District Attorney Tony Rosini, said he discounts Barbour's other claims. ""We have been in contact with other law enforcement agencies where she has lived and haven't received any information verifying what she said,"" Rosini told WNEP. That means little to loved ones of victims clinging to a desperate need for answers -- and there are plenty of people in that situation. The FBI estimates more than 87,000 people were missing in the United States at the end of 2012. And in just the last five years, more than 26,000 killings have gone unsolved. In North Carolina, where Barbour and her husband lived before moving to Pennsylvania, advocates for families of missing persons and crime victims have already heard from some people asking about possible links to the case. ""Anytime anything like this happens, we start getting e-mails and phone calls. I started getting texts last night,"" said Monica Caison, the founder of the Wilmington-based Community United Effort Center for Missing Persons. ""It sends everybody into a panic mode -- a hopeful panic mode,"" Caison said. ""They want to be one of those, but they don't want to be one of those. They want their nightmare to end."" Some people, those whose loved ones are still missing, take notice of such cases not out of hope the trail will lead to a dead body, Dyroff said. Instead, they want to keep hope alive. By finding out that a professed killer's claims are false, they can continue believing their loved one is still alive, she said. And most of the time, stories such as Barbour's do turn out to be concoctions, retired FBI investigator Keith Lanning told CNN. ""A lot of these individuals, particular some of the adult survivors, have emotional and psychological problems, and a lot of their motivation is to get attention and forgiveness for various problems in their lives,"" he said. Some just want to try to cash in on a fragile connection to a case in hopes of working themselves out of trouble with the law, said Dyroff. Whatever their motivation, it ends up leaving victims hurt all over again, Dyroff said. ""When you can't get any of those pieces to fall into place, it's very hard,"" she said.

He's Patrick Pope, a Los Angeles-based Web producer who moonlights as P'Trique, the star of the viral videos, ""S**t Fashion Girls Say."" Since they debuted in February, the videos have had a combined 3 million views. P'Trique has come to New York Fashion Week, at CNN's invitation, to spend the day with me at the Tents. ""Can I just tell you something,"" he says, ""I am CHO-tally into you right now."" Giggle. In the nearly nine years I've been covering fashion for CNN, I have never seen anything like this. We don't even make it across the plaza at Lincoln Center before we are mobbed by fashionistas, street style bloggers and the merely curious, angling to get a photo with fashion's latest celebrity. Once we're inside, it instantly becomes clear that P'Trique has a fan club in the land of the double kiss: Fern Mallis, Carlos Souza, Ken Downing -- big names in fashion, bowing to the man in the pink vintage dress. ""You look so chic,"" says Fe Fendi. Derek Blasberg, editor-at-large at Harper's Bazaar, even had a cameo in ""S**t Fashion Girls Say at New York Fashion Week."" He says, ""What I love about him is that he's the full package. He looks ridiculous. He says ridiculous things. The response has been ridiculous."" But looking good takes time. ""How long does it take to get ready?"" He answers, ""Most of the time about two hours... and a team of about four."" What's fashion week without taking in a show? We're here to see Carlos Miele and we're sitting front row. In order to secure the highly sought after seats, we give Miele's team P'Trique's real name, Patrick Pope. ""One thing I love about Carlos is he's from Brazil, so you know that he has taken into consideration the backside of a lady because Brazilian women got that donkey-donkey."" You're kidding me, right? The lights go down and the music begins. It's showtime. You haven't been to a runway show unless you've had P'trique sitting next to you whispering commentary. ""Wow, she's like a butterfly. I feel like this whole collection is very land and sea, kind-of meets under a night sky,"" and adds, ""I love those pants. I see those pants and I think sexpot."" P'trique also loves to model himself and worships the tall, leggy creatures on the catwalk. ""She looks nice,"" he says. After the show, I take P'Trique backstage through a crush of editors and retailers to meet the man himself: designer Carlos Miele. Turns out, P'Trique's commentary was right on target. What was Miele's inspiration? ""A Chinese butterfly,"" he says. Fashion Week can be grueling, but this was a total joy. In an industry some say takes itself too seriously, Blasberg says P'Trique, ""is a breath of fresh air."" We double kiss and say goodbye ... for now.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- I've been to Africa many times in my career, but nothing could have prepared me for a trip that would turn into this moment. As the energetic crowd of South Africans and numerous world leaders surrounded me Tuesday inside Johannesburg's FNB stadium, I wanted to minister through song and lift my heart toward the memory of Nelson Mandela. But just days before, I would have never thought I'd be there, performing in the rain, participating in history. It was a moment I'll never forget. About six months ago, my team booked me for a run in South Africa. We were scheduled to hit Johannesburg, Durban and Kimberley. I was very excited to come minister to the people of South Africa and as soon as I landed on Thursday, I became so grateful to be in the presence of these amazing people within this beautiful country. Upon arriving at the hotel, I sat glued to the TV as the news broke of the passing of Africa's favorite son and global role model. Not wanting to miss an opportunity to embrace a culture most African-Americans never experience, I asked to go to Mandela's home in Johannesburg. As I arrived, there was a huge crowd outside. I stood in the streets and danced with my people, hugged my people and tried my best to embrace their loss. Honestly, I wish I could have learned more about him when I was younger. I wish that I was more familiar with how it felt when Mandela was released from prison when I was 24. I could have learned a lot more about forgiveness. For only a heart modeled after God's hands could embrace the same hands that embarked pain. So standing in the rain today, preparing to perform right before the President of the United States addressed the world, I took a deep breath, said a prayer and reminded myself ""this is not about me."" This is for all of the men and women who've passed on and never saw this dream come true for their homeland. I imagined them embracing him, the souls of the beaten, the hurt and the martyrs who finished their race before Tata's and welcomed him home like a proud soldier. My mom is there in that number as well, and I hope that I, too, made her proud today. My 13-year-old son wants me to teach him everything about Mandela when I come home. He better get ready, because his dad has now been to class! I pray my presence on stage today will reflect the love I have for this country. I know their struggle, but I also know that they will have victory as long as they embrace the heart of their hero. MADIBA!

"(CNN) -- Last week, the president of The Sugar Association complained on CNN.com that he is ""frustrated"" by bad science that he says is ""misleading consumers"" about the negative health effects of sucrose, sometimes called table sugar. Fair enough. It is true that too often, the news media and others either overreact to, or misinterpret, studies that portray sugar or other sweeteners in a negative light. The makers of high fructose corn syrup -- my members -- are often the victims of alarmist studies or reporting, too. But just sentences later, after bemoaning the unfair treatment of sugar, the author takes aim at high fructose corn syrup. He attempts, once again, to blame high fructose corn syrup uniquely for health issues, such as rising obesity rates, while giving sugar a pass. He claims sucrose is a ""natural product,"" but somehow nutritionally equivalent high fructose corn syrup is not. So, hold on a minute. The sugar industry can't have it both ways. Either you are on the side of sound science and truly educating consumers or you are just another commercial interest trying to deflect criticism and take pot shots at another sweetener. Opinion: Don't believe everything you hear about 'sugar' Opinion: The sweet secret that could kill you . Moreover, one would assume by the author's high-minded appeal for a ""credible discussion"" about sugars in the diet would mean that the sugar industry supports consumer education. For example, facts espoused by the American Medical Association and other leading health authorities show that table sugar and high fructose corn syrup are nutritionally equivalent. They have the exact same amount of calories. Many consumers don't know that. But when our industry communicated that message, the Sugar Association and its members sued us. A judge ruled that parts of their lawsuit were a SLAPP, meaning a ""strategic lawsuit against public participation"" -- an attempt at censorship, pure and simple. Sugar not only makes you fat, it may make you sick . And when respected physicians have published peer-reviewed research, concluding that sugar and high fructose corn syrup are nutritionally equivalent, the sugar industry has attacked them personally. So much for supporting a ""credible discussion."" Unlike the sugar industry, the position and practice of the Corn Refiners Association and the makers of high fructose corn syrup is not to blame scientists, the news media or other sweeteners for the challenges associated with, in some instances, too much consumption of sugars of all types. Nor is it to try to silence others who are attempting to get consumers the facts. We believe that Americans need to practice moderation in their consumption of all calories, including those that come from sucrose and high fructose corn syrup. Ideally, that is part of an active lifestyle in which calories consumed are in balance with calories burned.

"(CNN) -- When I heard the news of Dr. Abbas Khan's death, I was saddened and for the first time throughout my rather terrible experience with the Syrian conflict I felt bitter and angry. I followed his case keenly and was hoping that he would have a chance to come back safe to his family and tell us what has happened. His testimony would have been more credible than any other hearsay accounts we hear every day. Mind you credibility is no longer important in making up your mind about the Syrian regime's action but somehow it comes in as a handy excuse for the international community to justify inaction. Doubt over British doctor's Syria suicide . Death has become so normal in Syria that most people fail to notice it and acknowledge it by much more than a roll of the eyes and mumbling the words ""such a terrible situation."" We, the Syrians, see on a daily basis horrific scenes of torture, brutality and savagery that it takes a particularity nasty way of dying to attract our attention. This doesn't mean we are no longer compassionate -- we are simply emotionally drained. Syrian doctor: I've lost count of amputations . But, as a Syrian, you can notice few details others perhaps won't see. For example: I don't need any ""clarifications, explanations, justifications, or elaborations"" on the reasons behind the death of Khan. I know the regime killed him because the pattern of events is so typical we can almost accurately predict the regime's next course of action when it comes to similar cases. Many regime officials have been assassinated in the last four decades and we were told that they committed suicide. You can also ask the Lebanese, for they can bear witness at the regime's skills in shooting somebody four times, then saying they did it to themselves. Gun gesture at head . I will never forget the look on the face of a prominent Syrian official who was particularly angry at the Assad regime's response to the event in the Syrian city Daraa in the very early days of the revolution. He asked me why Bashar (al-Assad) failed to make his cousin, who was the mayor of Daraa, then commit suicide? He then made a gun gesture and pointed it at his head. He indirectly admitted that the regime did this before. Khan didn't commit suicide using his pyjamas because Syrian prison inmates are not allowed to wear clothes. They are usually stripped down to their underwear and any garment that may pose danger to the prison guards is removed. Even if we did accept that there might be a slight chance he was given pyjamas to wear and that he somehow had the energy and the power to climb to one of the metal rings in the ceiling -- very popular in the Syrian prisons for their effectiveness in bearing the weight of young men when they are left hanging upside down by tying only one leg and leaving the body to swing around under extreme beating during ""investigations""-- he physically couldn't have been able to tie the pyjamas around his neck then on the ring because they are usually too high. The alternative option of hanging himself from a window is also eliminated because currently Syrian prisons don't have windows. If Abbas truly killed himself, then he was driven to it by the extreme conditions he was in. Who would kill themselves two days before they are granted a new lease of life, your pass out of true hell? Look at the picture of one of the Syrian prisons. This is a ""single person"" cell. Plight of Syria's prisoners . Abbas's death will not add anything to the regime's reputation for brutality but it will attract, hopefully, the international community's attention to the prison inmates in Syria. I feel they became the lost ghosts that nobody is trying actively to help. The pain and horrific torture they go through should be enough for the entire world to try to help but somehow the politicians are busy reading between the lines asking questions about al-Assad's degree of control. Who cares if he is the one in control or not? This regime unleashed a killing machine almost three years ago using every trick in Hitler's guide on how to kill many in one go, and it has the all means to continue until some drastic measures are taken. Al-Assad or not, Abbas's death should not raise questions about the power game within the Syrian regime; it should raise questions about how the world can help those suffering just like Abbas did before he was killed. Syrian government agencies have yet to comment on Khan's death. In Syria, searching for loved one taken away .

"(CNN) -- Welcome to the new cool. The dreadlocks. The headphones. The beats. The fist-bumping. Forget pumped up, chiseled athletes focused on nothing more than winning. If snowboarders were the Olympics' introduction to a younger, hipper, ""slacker"" generation of competitors, the next wave of adrenaline junkies has taken it back to the new old school. ""It's like playing,"" Jamie Anderson said after winning gold in inaugural women's slopestyle snowboarding event in Sochi. ""We're pretty much snowboarding on a playground up there."" Slopestyle, which also has a ski discipline, is one of 12 new categories at 2014 Winter Games -- eight of which have their origins in extreme sports. It's part of the International Olympic Committee's bid to attract younger audiences, a mission shared by its broadcast and advertising partners. Short-track speed skating was added in 1992, and snowboarding came six years later. But forget the idea of 10,000 hours of repetitive practice -- as Anderson says, these new sports are all about playing. All playgrounds have their own vocabulary, and expressions like ""stoked,"" ""corked"" and ""stalefish"" are rapidly becoming part of the sporting lexicon. As is the idea of fun, which the winner of the men's slopestyle skiing event, Anderson's fellow American Joss Christensen, was keen to reference. ""I didn't try to put any more pressure on myself, I just tried to ski a normal contest and just do my best and have fun with it. I thought it worked out,"" said the 22-year-old in trademark understatement. His comments underplayed the reality that the U.S. team annihilated the competition, claiming all three men's medals to end Canada's monopoly of freestyle golds at these Games. Christensen had never won a major competition, and only qualified for the Olympics two weeks ago. ""I am shocked,"" he conceded. ""I am stoked to be up here with my friends. America, we did it."" With Gus Kenworthy and Nick Goepper winning silver and bronze, it was a historic moment -- the U.S. had previously achieved such a clean sweep of medals on just two occasions: the 2002 men's halfpipe snowboard competition, and the 1956 men's individual figure skating singles. But there was a serious undertone for Christensen, who has been mourning the loss of his father last year. ""I hope I made my father proud,"" he said. ""Through all the injuries I've had, he's always supported me and never said stop. I hope he's looking down and smiling. Did it for him."" As part of the slopestyle ""playground"" there is a ""kiss and cry"" area, where the competitors wait to see their results. Not that there was any signs of tears at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park on Thursday. All the competitors look relaxed as if they were hanging out with their friends on the slopes of their backyard ski resort -- which is not so far-fetched, given they train together and meet at events several times a month. The glory and seriousness of the Olympics seems something of a culture shock to these new Olympians. Their main event, the X Games, is all about showing off new tricks in fairly relaxed, showbiz atmosphere. And it's not just spectators and television viewers who have been impressed by their performances. ""It looks very spectacular,"" IOC president Thomas Bach told reporters after Christensen's win. ""I just met the three medalists and they are cool guys."" ""They found it (the competition) cool and now they wait for the party. When you win you have the party."" Perhaps the Winter Olympics' new breed is best encapsulated by Henrik Harlaut. The 22-year-old Swede might not have made it up on the podium, but he definitely garnered plenty of attention with his very, very low-cut pants -- which, by the end of his run, revealed much of his colorful underwear. Along with the incredible tricks, style is a big part of these competitions. ""I don't think skiing with my ski pants so low is an issue,"" Harlaut insisted. ""I have been skiing like this for 10 years now. It is my style and has been for a while. I feel really comfortable."" Not everyone has been impressed by the tricks and a more relaxed of sporting competition . ""I think the president of the IOC should be Johnny Knoxville, because basically, this stuff is just 'Jackass' stuff that they invented and called Olympic sports,"" commentator Bob Costas said on NBC said before the Games began, referring to the comedic daredevil who was known for crashing into things. That's not a view shared by the U.S. Olympic Committee, which has specifically targeted invested in these new sports, primarily because they deliver medals for America. ""We've been able to really customize and drill down where we can have the greatest impact,"" Alan Ashley, the USOC's chief of sport performance, told the Washington Post. ""I'd like to try to get as many athletes as possible opportunities to become Olympians, then become successful Olympians as well."" So behind the cool exterior, there is some bottom-line accounting going on.","Eight of the 12 new events at the Sochi Olympics have their origins in extreme sports .

"(CNN) -- A Washington state middle school boy was arrested after he brought 400 rounds of ammunition, multiple knives and a handgun to his school, intending to shoot another student who he thought was bullying his friend, police said. The 11-year-old was booked into a juvenile detention facility Wednesday after the incident that caused the lockdown of Frontier Middle School, Vancouver Police said. No one was injured. Authorities were alerted by the boy's mother, who called the school concerned that her son may have taken kitchen knives with him that day, according to a probable cause document. The boy was patted down by school resource officers who found the weapons and ammunition. The boy told school officials that ""a voice in his head was telling him to kill"" an 11-year-old classmate for calling the boy's friend gay, according to the probable cause document. ""He stated a voice told him killing (the classmate) was a good idea; however he planned to just shoot (the classmate) in the arm and then shoot himself in the head,"" the document said. The boy is being held on charges of attempted assault, unlawful possession of a firearm and possession of a weapon at school. He earlier faced a charge of attempted murder, but prosecutors did not immediately find sufficient evidence to support the charge. However, Kasey Vu with the Clark County Prosecuting Attorney's Office left open the possibility that the attempted murder charge could return when prosecutors receive more information from the investigation. The school in Vancouver was locked down for about two hours. Students were sent home with letters alerting parents of the situation, said Kris Fay, a spokeswoman for Evergreen Public Schools. The incident comes on the heels of several school-related violent incidents around the nation. On Monday, a math teacher was killed and two students wounded by a boy who then killed himself in a Nevada school. On Wednesday, a math teacher was found dead in the woods northeast of Boston; her 14-year-old student is accused of killing her. Three California students injured after gun on police motorcycle discharges . Teacher slayings hurt view of schools as safe havens .

"Washington (CNN) -- The man behind a lavish General Services Administration conference in Las Vegas that critics have lambasted as a waste of taxpayer money and emblematic of government excess has left the agency, a federal spokesman said Thursday. Senators encourage GSA to 'clean house' Jeff Neely, a regional commissioner, had been placed on administrative leave in March for his part in organizing a 2010 conference in Nevada that cost $800,000. As of Thursday, he is ""no longer employed with GSA,"" said Adam Elkington, deputy press secretary for the agency. Who's on first? Hearing shows GSA's dysfunction . What exactly led to Neely's departure was not immediately clear. But a GSA official who asked not to be identified discussing personnel matters noted that federal employees have the right to retire as long as they have accumulated the required years of service. The U.S. Department of Justice could still implicate Neely in its criminal investigation, though, even after he has left the agency, the official added. Neely has been asked to reimburse the government for a private, in-room party that he hosted, the official added. Earlier this spring, Neely -- who was famously pictured in one photo in a bathtub in a Las Vegas hotel room, with wine glasses nearby -- cited his Fifth Amendment rights in refusing to testify before Congress. Rep. Darrell Issa, the California Republican who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, chided Neely for leaving ""many questions unanswered"" even as he stressed that issues with the GSA go well beyond him. ""Mr. Neely's conduct certainly diminished his ability to continue as a senior public servant,"" Issa said in a statement. ""In fact, the problems at GSA may far exceed his involvement in the waste of taxpayer dollars that has outraged Americans."" Another House Republican, John Mica of Florida, cheered the news that Neely no longer works for the GSA. He added that he will push legislation aimed at forcing federal employees to answer questions from Congress -- as Neely refused to do before not just Issa's committee but also the House Transportation Committee helmed by Mica -- or else risk being fired. ""In order to deal with this type of situation in the future, I plan to introduce legislation that will allow the immediate termination of senior level (government) executives who violate their oaths of office by refusing to cooperate with congressional investigations or to testify before Congress,"" Mica said in a statement. Describing the billions of dollars in contracts and services handled by the GSA as a source of temptation, senators from both parties last month called for the agency to clean house as it roots out corruption. The scandal came to light earlier this year when GSA Inspector General Brian Miller released a final report shedding light on the Las Vegas conference as well as violations of travel and spending rules. Among other details, the report explained how Neely, and presumably others, avoided strictures against supplying food at government work conferences such as the Las Vegas event by creating joke awards in order to hold ceremonies at which food would be allowed. The controversy, which includes allegations of personal travel under the thin guise of government business and an employee award program that exceeded spending limits, so far has focused on one of 10 regions of the GSA -- an agency with a multibillion-dollar budget and more than 12,000 employees. The revelations have prompted taxpayer indignation and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the GSA, which handles government real estate and other nonmilitary procurement. Coming in an election year, the scandal has become a political focal point, with Republicans seeking to frame it as a reflection of big government abuse and criticizing the fact that Neely took more trips on the federal dime after the release of Miller's preliminary report last year showing spending and travel abuses. Democrats, meanwhile, say the problem predated Barack Obama becoming president and involved a few bad players rather than a rotten system.","Jeff Neely organized a GSA conference in Las Vegas that cost $800,000 .

"(CNN) -- The pilots of a Southwest Airlines jet that landed at the wrong Missouri airport this week were not directed there by air traffic controllers, and should have known they were landing at the wrong location, U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt said on Thursday. ""The federal employees involved did what they were supposed to do. The airline employees involved did not,"" the Missouri Republican said in a conference call with reporters. Related: How could this happen? Blunt said he had talked with Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Huerta about the incident. The FAA oversees air traffic control for commercial airline travel. Southwest Flight 4013 from Chicago's Midway Airport with 124 passengers was scheduled to land at Branson Airport in southwest Missouri on Sunday night. Instead, the Boeing 737-700 touched down at Taney County airport - about seven miles away, and with a runway significantly shorter. The National Transportation Safety Board is looking into the incident as is the FAA. An industry official previously said the FAA had reviewed the matter initially and it appeared there had been no issue with controllers. The Taney County airport was not staffed by controllers, but they were in touch with air traffic centers along the way. The two pilots have been placed on paid leave.","Southwest Flight 4013 was headed to Branson, Missouri, airport, but landed at one nearby .

"(CNN) -- The little boy sits proudly next to his snowman, and smiles. He has no coat, gloves or hat to protect him from the freezing cold, but for a moment he is distracted from the harsh reality of life inside a makeshift refugee camp in Lebanon. We do not know his name, but he is one of 842,000 refugees the U.N. says are spending the winter in Lebanon after fleeing a brutal three-year civil war in Syria. They thought that life could not get much harsher. But that was before winter storm ""Alexa"" moved in, bringing snow, rain and freezing temperatures across the region. Despite the miserable conditions, for many children in refugee camps, the snow was a novelty. The snowman photo above was captured by CNN cameraman Christian Streib as he toured the U.N.-run Arsal transit camp in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, now home to 40,000 refugees. ""I saw the snowman in front of a tent and thought it would make a good picture,"" he said. ""Then the boy appeared, and smiled as I took his photo. Then he looked away, distracted as more people arrived. We were in a rush to finish filming so I never got to talk to him."" ""But just look at the smile. So innocent. The snowman symbolizes so much too. Everyone can relate to a snowman. All of us have built a snowman. And this one -- while built out of very little -- puts a smile on the face of a boy with meager means."" Streib said he was amazed by the dignity of the children, even though they were hungry and cold. The majority had their naked feet in plastic slippers, he said. ""Kids are everywhere in the camp, just roaming, with time on their hands, but they'll always find something to play with."" Khadija and her brother Amjad are from Aleppo, which has suffered some of the heaviest bombardments during the bloodbath in Syria. CNN Correspondent Mohammed Jamjoon recalled how the children were determined to have fun, despite the freezing conditions. ""Clinging to any remnant of childhood abandon they could, they decided to build a snowman,"" he said. ""This photo was taken on the same site where Christian got the picture of the boy and the snowman. ""It's very moving: You want to give, but you feel helpless. You're the outsider with the big camera, but they just want to explain their situation,"" he recalled. ""And every conversation finishes with the same sentence: I want to go home."" That's not going to happen soon. The child refugees in Lebanon are unlikely to see their homeland again before reaching adulthood. Lebanon has absorbed the highest number of Syria's refugees. The U.N. predicts there will be more than 1.5 million in the country by the end of 2013. Lebanon's population is only 4.2 million. This Syrian boy launched into a snowball fight in Arsal on Monday. Mohammed Jamjoom said: ""We watched at least six boys play and enjoy themselves while aid was being distributed."" Syrians would go to any lengths to reach Lebanon, Jamjoom said. That's despite the horrific conditions they found when they arrived. He recalled the scene as he and cameraman Chris Jackson accompanied medics and aid workers as they immunized children aged five and under on a previous visit to a camp in the Bekaa Valley. ""It's absolutely heart-breaking,"" he said. ""These people are effectively living in an open sewer. They are walking through filth, through human waste."" Yaacoub lives in the UNHCR-tented transit site in Arsal. This picture was taken on Monday as the U.N. delivered blankets, clothes, fuel vouchers and stoves to refugees. He told Jamjoom he was extremely happy that aid was being delivered, but they need much more. The younger children - aged eight and under -- are better able to endure the harsh conditions in the camp, Jamjoom said. ""These are kids walking around sockless with sandals despite the cold -- but they would still come up to me asking me to take a photo. They can cling to any remnant of childhood because they are resilient."" But children two or three years older had more mixed emotions, he said. ""They are still young, but there is anger at the realization of their conditions,"" said Jamjoon. ""Everything around them is forcing them to become adults."" Syria's children: Another year of horror . And for the parents, seeking to provide order amid chaos for their children, life is no easier. ""They are still shocked their children are living in such conditions. When the weather gets bad, the water seeps under the tarpaulins of their tents. They need concrete bases. The moms say: 'If we could only make some money. If only our children could be educated ...'"" Ghazi is also in Arsal. ""He asked me to take his picture and was very curious about what we were filming,"" said Jamjoom. ""He misses home but has friends here. He's cold but thinks it will get better and was glad that his family was happy that winter weather gear was being distributed."" These Syrian children should be at school. Instead they are forced to help their parents in the desperate battle for survival with thousands of others in the camp. ""I met one boy aged 12 who had arrived from Syria in the Bekaa Valley with only one thing, which were his school certificates,"" Jamjoom said. ""He now works gathering eggs or on construction sites."" Syria's brutal war within a war gains momentum . In urban areas, children help their parents by selling tissues or shining shoes. ""In Beirut I saw 10 kids, all them aged under seven, begging with their mums. The U.N. warns of a lost generation, but I see it happening before my eyes. All of them say: 'We want to go back to Syria, but we can't return because of the war.' ""The U.N. has asked for $6.5 billion just for humanitarian needs, but is finding it hard getting donations even though it's apparent how much suffering there is. ""It's a dire humanitarian crisis -- and it's getting worse by the hour."" Impact your world: How to help .","More than a million children have fled the brutal three-year civil war in Syria.

"(CNN) -- Fall TV can be so hit ... or miss. And like it or not, it doesn't take long for both viewers and networks to make the call. There have already been some surprise hits such as ""Sleepy Hollow"" as well as some casualties: Both ABC's ""Lucky 7"" and CBS' ""We Are Men"" were canceled after only two episodes, and there are surely more shows to follow. UPDATE: Since this story was first published, there have been some developments. According to Deadline, CBS has ordered full seasons of ""The Crazy Ones,"" ""The Millers,"" and ""Mom."" Meanwhile NBC has canceled ""Ironside"" and ""Welcome to the Family,"" The Wrap reported. Let's take a look at how some of the network shows are faring: . Hits . • ""Sleepy Hollow"" (Fox) -- This is one hit few saw coming. Fans appear to love it, and USA Today called it the ""best new show."" • ""The Blacklist"" (NBC) -- James Spader is killing the game as a master criminal in this new drama. The show might also be benefiting from its lead-in, ""The Voice."" Either way, people are watching. • ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" (ABC) -- This widely anticipated Joss Whedon production had a huge premiere but has slowed just a tad in recent weeks. It's still big though, especially with the DVR set. • ""The Goldbergs"" (ABC) -- So far, so good. Ratings have been decent, and this comedy might just swing a second season. According to Deadline, more scripts have already been ordered. • ""The Crazy Ones"" (CBS) -- Mork and Buffy make a killer ratings combo, it seems. This sitcom starring Robin Williams and Sarah Michelle Geller appears to be pretty solid. The Salt Lake Tribune says it looks like a winner. A full season has been ordered. • ""The Millers"" (CBS) -- Lucky show. Its lead-in is the ratings juggernaut ""The Big Bang Theory,"" so, yeah, it's doing well. Like ""The Crazy Ones,"" CBS was pleased enough to order a full season. • ""The Originals""  (CW) -- The ""Vampire Diaries"" spinoff is getting respectable ratings and has had additional scripts ordered. CNN's Fall Entertainment Guide . Misses . • ""The Michael J. Fox Show"" and ""Sean Saves the World"" (NBC) -- These two are grouped together because they have much in common: the return of two beloved actors, Michael J. Fox and Sean Hayes, and the fact that both, surprisingly, appear to be struggling. Variety listed them on their ""10 Coldest TV Shows of the Fall."" • ""Hostages"" (CBS) -- This one does not have the ratings tied up. Don't look for it to make a second season. ""Betrayal"" (ABC) -- Proof that not every show built around a mistress will work. According to TV Guide, ratings are down, and some critics wonder if it will be the next series to be canceled. • ""Back in the Game"" (ABC) -- Not every movie actor's foray into television is going so well. We are going to go ahead and list this one starring James Caan as ""dead show walking."" • ""Welcome to the Family"" (NBC) -- If you didn't get to know the family it's too late, as NBC has announced its cancellation. • ""Mom"" (Fox) -- All the elements are there. The comedy stars Anna Faris and Allison Janney and was created by Chuck Lorre, the mind behind hits such as ""Two and a Half Men."" So why is it not working? Still, CBS has ordered a full season. • ""Ironside""(NBC) -- The reboot of this classic series with Blair Underwood starring as a paraplegic was called the ""worst new drama"" by one critic. Viewers seem to agree. NBC recently decided to cancel the show. So-So . • ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" (Fox) -- This one feels very ""Parks and Recreation."" It's a critical darling, but ratings have not been overwhelming. We are rooting for you, Andy Samberg. • ""Once Upon a Time in Wonderland"" (ABC) -- This one has us a little worried. The big budget fairytale series occupies the Thursday 8 p.m. slot, which puts it opposite CBS' popular ""The Big Bang Theory"" and NBC's fan favorite ""Parks and Recreation."" That time slot could spell doom. • ""Super Fun Night"" (ABC) -- It should have been a surefire hit, coming after ""Modern Family."" And while lots of viewers tried it out initially, declining ratings in week two indicate they weren't too impressed. No bueno for star and creator Rebel Wilson. • ""The Tomorrow People"" (CW) -- The paranormal series is hanging on ... for now. • ""Trophy Wife"" (ABC) -- Critics seem to love it, but ratings have not been overwhelming. ABC has said the show recently pulled in 1.3 million more viewers than Fox's ""The Mindy Project"" (2.8 million), and the network has ordered more scripts. That's good, as it probably needs more time. • ""Dads"" (Fox) -- This live-action Seth MacFarlane comedy has been called racist and sexist, but the controversy has not stopped the network from ordering more scripts. Tell us what your favorite -- and least favorite -- shows have been so far?","""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""The Blacklist"" are among the season's hits .

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is back on the grid after more than a month without making a public appearance. The President suggested that reports of her demise had been greatly exaggerated by political opponents. And she said she wasn't happy about the way the media covered her absence. ""I was reading in the newspapers this morning headlines that said, 'Cristina reappears.' And I said, 'What is the opposite of reappears? Disappears. ... They wanted to give it a touch of Hollywood,'"" Fernandez said during a national television broadcast as she announced a new program targeting the South America country's youth. Fernandez went on medical leave in October so doctors could perform emergency surgery to remove a blood clot on the surface of her brain. She officially returned to work in November and appeared at a series of events in December. Her temporary exit from the public stage sparked widespread speculation about her health and questions from critics about who was running the country. ""If we hadn't had the President's illness just a few months ago, one would discard it. But the problem is the rumor has been established, and the sense of uncertainty of not knowing why,"" Orlando D'Adamo, director of the Center of Public Opinion at the University of Belgrano in Buenos Aires, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol last week. ""Is it a political strategy? Is she making room for a new candidate for 2015? Is it because she does not want to face difficult situations for the government? We do not know."" CNN's Jose Manuel Rodriguez reported from Buenos Aires. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.

"Longmont, Colorado (CNN) -- Sue Frederick says she can see your dream job and is ready to help you find it. Unlike traditional career counselors, Frederick uses her ""intuition"" to help her clients. ""I've been called a clairvoyant and a medium because my skills fit those skills,"" says Frederick. She says she only amplifies the intuition that each of her clients already has: . ""You have all the answers you need inside of you and all the gifts you need to make it happen."" What she does is much more than just gazing into a crystal ball or reading someone's palm. ""I help people first see the big picture, then I bring it down to the concrete baby steps,"" she says.  ""Everyone needs to have a baby step action plan, or they are paralyzed ... so we break it down."" Here's how it works: Clients who are usually in some sort of job crisis, laid off or unhappy with their work, get in touch with Frederick, usually by phone, and give her their date of birth. ""If you take your date of birth and digit it down to a single number, you come up with the energy of what you have come to be in the world through your path, your work,"" she says. ""I help people see what that means in their life."" Next, Frederick meditates about the client's case and says she has visions of the right career move for her clients. ""I see images and pictures of people doing their great work in the world,"" she says. At this point, many people roll their eyes and write Frederick off -- but she says a better job and a better life await those willing to make the leap. ""The first step is to understand more about your soul's mission,"" she says. ""There's always a deeper story when people are unhappy with their job or they are afraid -- it's time for a reinvention point."" It's at that point, she says, that people are willing to ""pull back and look at the bigger picture of their life."" These reinvention points, according to Frederick,  come as part of nine-year cycles. She uses numerology to pinpoint where her clients are on those cycles and when it's time to change she helps people move in a more fulfilling direction. ""The next step in everyone's career journey is to a higher expression of their gifts and what they've come to do in this world,"" she says.  ""So it becomes more meaningful work, more financially successful, more fulfilling in that they think they are bringing more of their true self to the world through their work. "" But she emphasizes that this doesn't mean taking a vow of poverty to teach yoga or live on an ashram. ""Here's the myth: We're told that either we can pick work that we love and be poor and starve or we can have the job we take for benefits and security and be unhappy,"" she says.  ""We're told that those are our two choices, and that's not true at all."" Frederick, 59, made her own career change a decade ago.  She says she has been aware of her psychic powers since she was a little girl but was reluctant to share them. After a career as a journalist and magazine editor, she decided to become a career counselor and use her intuition. She has worked with thousands of clients who pay $250 for a one-hour session with her, usually over the phone. She shares a large house outside of Boulder, Colorado, with her husband and teenage kids. Statues of the Hindu god Ganesh mingle effortlessly with baseball gear and running shoes. Frederick -- who also hosts seminars and has written a book, ""I See Your Dream Job"" -- says she is booked six months in advance. She says that while the current economic downturn is difficult in the short term, it is presenting people with the opportunity to change and find a better career and a better, more fulfilling life. ""This economy means people who have been unhappy with their job but just took it for the benefits and the paycheck are finally getting shaken out of those jobs,"" she says.  ""Now they finally get the opportunity to reinvent. ""Now when you laid off and can't get a job in your old path, you finally get to go, 'OK, maybe I can take a baby step in a new direction.'""

"(CNN) -- While all about him were losing their heads, Roger Federer kept his cool. In a week when grand slam champions have been falling like flies at the Australian Open, the old master survived a fourth-set fightback to defeat world No. 4 Andy Murray 6-3 6-4 6-7 (6-8) 6-3. Federer's win means he advances to the last four in Melbourne for the 11th year in a row, with his archrival Rafael Nadal standing between him and a sixth final. Top seed Nadal had beaten Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov earlier on Wednesday to continue his bid for a 14th grand slam title. Federer and Nadal met in the semifinals two years ago, the latter emerging victorious, while the Spaniard holds a 22-10 winning record over the Swiss star having won the last four matches between them. ""He's been tough to play against, no doubt,"" Federer told reporters when asked about Nadal. ""I'm happy I get a chance to play him in a grand slam again. I don't remember the last time we played."" Federer recently recruited six-time grand slam winner Stefan Edberg to his coaching team, with the Swede set to spent 10 weeks working with the former world No. 1 throughout the season. With Edberg now onside, Federer is hoping he can reverse his fortunes against Nadal. ""The head-to-head record is in his favor,"" the 32-year-old told reporters. ""I'm looking forward to speaking to Stefan, because when we spoke together, you know, when he came to Dubai and we spoke about the game, we clearly spoke about playing Rafa, as well. ""He thought he had some good ideas, so I'm looking forward to what he has to say."" Nadal narrowly avoided joining second seed Novak Djokovic -- beaten by Federer's compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka on Tuesday -- on the sidelines, eventually overcoming Dimitrov, the Bulgarian's cheering section and a nasty blister on the Spaniard's left palm. The world No. 1 prevailed 3-6 7-6 7-6 6-2, saving three set points in the third set. ""I was so lucky,"" Nadal said in an on-court interview. ""I felt anything could happen in the third set. ""A lot of Bulgarians here today. Thanks everyone for supporting -- it was a great atmosphere. I hope you enjoyed it. I suffered a lot."" Nadal said the blister, which troubled him in the previous round, particularly affects him on serve and he duly struck three double faults in one game. But it was Dimitrov -- the man, now to his dismay, still being compared to Federer because of their similar styles -- who faltered on the key points. He missed a makeable forehand and return on two of his three set points in the third. His backers were frequently out of their chairs chanting his name throughout the three-and-a-half-hour encounter, prompting one fan to counter, ""Shut up and sit down."" Dimitrov left the court in tears and then became emotional when speaking to reporters. ""It should hurt, and it does hurt,"" said the Bulgarian.","Roger Federer beats Andy Murray to reach the semifinals of the Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- What happens when you give a 2-year-old a camera? For Toronto toddler Henry Shakyaver, his imagination runs wild in a good way. Portrait and wedding photographer Alex Neary has been Henry's nanny for the past year and a half. One day, during a visit to the park, they were sitting in a sandbox and Henry leaned over a toy dump truck. '""Take a photo of me like this,"" Neary recalls him saying. Then he asked her to mimic his pose and let him take her photo. She showed him how to hold her iPhone and push the shutter button. The results were delightful, if not a little blurry. Neary started compiling the images on her website in a photos series Henry's Concepts that's catching the attention of blogs and local media. Neary has been photographing Henry since she became his nanny, so his mother wasn't surprised to see him show an interest in getting behind the camera. ""The irony is that he won't sit still to take a picture for me,"" Lorri MacDonald said. McDonald thinks the project teaches her son observation skills and inspires him to be creative. ""He's learning to see the world through a different lens. I think he's aware of his surroundings more through this project,"" MacDonald said. Neary has also learned a thing or two from the project, which continues on her site. She shared with CNN some wisdom and tips for teaching children photography skills. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. CNN: What are some of Henry's interests? Neary: He loves dinosaurs. We go to the museum a lot. The aquarium; he loves underwater life. He loves trucks, trains and building ramps. He's a really hands-on, energetic kid. CNN: I'm amazed these are all shot with an iPhone. Neary: With the iPhone, doing indoor shots with him is tough. I'm trying to teach him how to focus, but he doesn't quite get that. Some of the photos are blurry and not quite right. I don't know if I'd be able to do this if it were a real camera. But because it's an iPhone, it's so light and small enough for his tiny little hands to hold. He can hold it and slide his thumb over to take a photo. CNN: How many times does it take to get a picture before turns out? Neary: Sometimes he gets it on the first go. Sometimes it takes three or four times. Usually I get in a pose, then he takes the photo, then I have to take a look to see if he got the shot. If he didn't get it, I'll get back in the pose and we'll try again. Sometimes he only gets my legs in it, or my head and sometimes his thumb is over it. CNN: What has Henry learned in doing this project with you? Neary: I don't know if he's learned anything really, but he's taking interest in taking photos of other things in the location that we're in. I think it's starting to bring out an interest in photography. I don't know if he'll grow up to be a photographer, but I think he'll definitely do something creative. CNN: What are your tips for other parents or people who want to try having their kids take photos? Neary: If they show an interest in it, and you feel comfortable and safe with them using the camera or phone, teach them the basic skills, like this is the button to push. When you see what you like in the screen, tap the icon. I think it's more about getting them to have an interest in photography and having them interested in seeing things with a photographic eye. Be game for what they throw at you. Kids have crazy imaginations. You just have to be ready for whatever they throw at you. Be ready to laugh at yourself and make a fool out of yourself. CNN: What has Henry taught you through this project? Neary: The poses he chooses, I would never make my clients do that. More than anything it's just brought me a lot of happiness. There's really no age limit to photography and creativity. If you have a creative mind at such a young age, then just embrace it and try to bring it out. Just let him do his thing. He's starting to get really smart with this. I was getting him ready for his nap and he said, ""How about before nap time we do seven different poses?"" He's using the posing as a way to stall things that he just really doesn't want to do.

"(CNN) -- Iranian security officials say they have arrested an MI6 spy in southeastern Iran's Kerman province, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported Saturday. ""The spy was arrested after several months of complex intelligence activities,"" ISNA quoted the head of Kerman's revolutionary court, Dadkhoda Salari, as saying. The accused spy visited with British intelligence officers 11 times both in and outside Iran and has confessed to his crimes, Salari reportedly told ISNA. The MI6 is Britain's foreign intelligence agency. The UK Foreign Office told CNN it did not comment on intelligence matters. Relations between Britain and Iran have warmed somewhat in recent months. An Iranian envoy this week made the first visit to the United Kingdom since all Iranian diplomats were expelled in 2011, following an attack by protesters on the UK Embassy in Tehran. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said this week that relations were improving ""on a step-by-step, reciprocal basis."" The reported arrest of an MI6 spy also comes in the same week as reports have emerged in the United States that former FBI agent Bob Levinson, who went missing on a trip to Iran in 2007, was working there for the CIA, the U.S. intelligence service. The State Department and Levinson's family have denied he was working for the U.S. government ever since he disappeared. The Associated Press and The Washington Post first reported the CIA angle on Thursday. Officials have maintained that Levinson was conducting private business in Iran. At the same time, a bipartisan group of senators in Washington has been discussing possible legislation that would impose tougher sanctions on Iran. However, it is not clear whether the Democratic majority would bring such a deal up for a vote. White House: Bob Levinson not a government employee when he made Iran trip .

"LONDON, England -- Formula One drivers spend a lot of time talking about the gym and going jogging. Toyota's Timo Glock has to spend a lot of time in the gym to be fit enough to race. Even when they're on holiday there is a gym close at hand -- in fact many list fitness as a hobby, which is a little on the sad side. However, they're exercise obsessed for a good reason: without being in peak fitness they would not be able to handle the stresses of driving a Formula One car at 350kmh. It's perhaps the one situation where sitting down for up to two hours is actually very, very tiring. According to Toyota, their drivers -- Jarno Trulli and Timo Glock -- would not last a race without getting sweaty in the gym. ""The highly-efficient carbon brakes slow a car down so rapidly and the downforce generated by current aerodynamics is such that a driver experiences a peak of around 5Gs under braking and in high-speed corners,"" the team said. ""This affects the whole body but has its most dramatic consequence on the neck and chest."" The team said for a ""typical person"" the forces were almost unimaginable, the closest comparison they could make was with a rollercoaster -- though that is some way off. During a race, most drivers had an average heart rate around 170 beats per minute -- higher than most other athletes -- with a peak of 190, Toyota said. Moreover, this season -- with traction control removed -- the drivers heartbeats had increased up to 10 beats a minute. Glock said Formula One was unique when it came to the fitness requirements. ""I would say it's completely different to any other sport because you have a heartbeat average of 170 over an hour and a half and you never see that in another sport,"" Glock said. ""That makes it completely different. That's the reason why you have to be really fit as a Formula One driver."" Toyota team doctor Riccardo Ceccarelli said the drivers had to have a very high aerobic fitness level. ""They go jogging, cycling, all sports that involve aerobic area. The second part of the training is specific for the neck. They need a very strong neck because every corner puts a load of around 20-25kgs on the neck, and obviously a strong upper body and forearms."" Ceccarelli said keeping the brain in top condition was also important. ""The brain is just like a muscle and you can train it."" He has developed computer simulations which could test -- and improve -- reaction times, multi-tasking and spatial awareness. Trulli said he used the above to ensure he was mentally prepared for a race. ""We do mental preparation with some of these simulations which have been developed through the years. I can easily do them at home or even during the Grand Prix weekend using my computer. ""It's all about keeping concentration and trying to be fit and concentrated for a race distance, which is not so easy in a Formula One car because obviously it's very quick."" Ceccarelli said studies had shown a marked difference between how racing drivers and normal people responded to the tests. ""The difference is that the driver is much more economical in managing this performance, so his brain is working in an economical way compared to a normal person. ""That means he is able to carry on this performance for a longer time compared to a normal person. That is the important point we have to consider in the training.""","Formula One drivers' hearts beat up to 190 times a minute during races .
Heart rate is above most other athletes, making aerobic fitness very important .

"(CNN) -- Former teen tennis phenom Jennifer Capriati is off the hook after accusations that she stalked and punched an ex-boyfriend last Valentine's Day. Battery and stalking charges will be dropped now that Capriati, 37, has completed 30 hours of community service and four hours of anger management counseling, the state attorney's office in Palm Beach County, Florida, said. The alleged quarrel took place on February 14 at a gym in North Palm Beach. According to a police report, the ex-boyfriend claimed Capriati started screaming at him before punching him with a closed fist four times in the chest. The ex-boyfriend, Ivan Brannan Jr., said he was eventually able to lock himself in the men's locker room, according to the police report. Four days later, he went to police headquarters and outlined what he said were ""seven other incidents pertaining to Capriati stalking/harassing/following"" him. Brannan said he'd dated the American tennis player from May 2011 to February 2012. Capriati's camp has denounced the allegations. ""The current facts being circulated by Mr. Brannan are an overexaggeration and the police report is one-sided in (his) favor, since they failed to get Ms. Capriati's side of the story,"" read a statement attributed to the ex-tennis player's legal representative last year. Capriati burst on the tennis scene as a teenager, breaking into the sport's ranking of top 10 players by 14 and advancing to the semifinals of the French Open in 1990. She remained a force on the tour into the early 1990s, highlighted by a gold medal win at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. But Capriati's star status faded the next few years, a time that included widely reported arrests on shoplifting and marijuana possession charges. She remained off the court into the late 1990s. The New York-born tennis player came back strong at the end of the decade, and in 2001 won the Australian Open and the French Open on her way to becoming the world's No. 1 player that year. Another Australian Open title came the following year. The 2004 season was Capriati's last. Eight years later, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Capriati's ex-boyfriend said she punched him four times at a gym .

"(CNN) -- As the globe has become increasingly outfitted with wi-fi hotspots and cell phone towers, the skies have long been the last refuge from constant connectivity. That's changing, however, as more airlines are realizing wi-fi's earning potential. By its own estimate, one of the fastest-growing companies in America is Gogo, which was the first to successfully hook up planes with internet. It has since installed systems on several U.S. carriers, including Delta, American and US Airways. According to its CEO, Michael Small, Gogo's profits grew from $37 million in 2009 to $112 million in the first six months of 2012. ""We're now on over 1,600 commercial aviation jets, which is nearly half the U.S. fleet. We've done that in four years, which is extraordinarily fast,"" says Small. ""In just a few more years, it will be done in America."" Watch video: In-flight wi-fi takes off . Though airlines pay to install the equipment, they also reap the rewards; Gogo charges the customers for internet usage -- between $5 and $20, depending on flight duration -- and shares its revenue with the carriers. ""More travelers are aware of our service, and many of them want it,"" says Small. ""One in five say they will switch a flight to get our service."" The drawback with Gogo's system is that it uses an air-to-ground network of cell phone towers it built across the United States -- each with a 250-mile radius of coverage -- meaning its wi-fi isn't available when flying over water. Internet on Gogo-outfitted planes is therefore limited to domestic flights. This is where California-based firm Row 44 swoops in. Row 44 also installs wi-fi on airplanes, though unlike Gogo, it relies on a satellite system, meaning passengers can access internet even when flying over the ocean. ""This is a distinct advantage, given that two-thirds of the planet is covered in water,"" notes John LaValle, Row 44's CEO. Also, satellite systems give passengers more options, due to better bandwidth. ""Air-to-ground has certain inherent limitations in terms of the amount of data that can be processed through the network of cell towers on the ground -- for example, live TV really is an impossibility,"" says LaValle, whose company also offers that service as part of its package. ""In a satellite environment, you're able to get much more data through the pipe."" See also: Airplane phone calls to become standard? But the satellite system is substantially more expensive than using cell-phone towers, and has the added drawback of taking longer to install. As airlines lose money for every day a plane is out of commission, this can make the process rather costly. Some carriers, however, find it's worth the price. Mango Airlines and Southwest are among the airlines using Row 44's service, with Icelandair soon to follow. What's more, Norwegian Air Shuttle, which has also joined the fray, has just this month started offering wi-fi to passengers free-of-charge -- the first airline in Europe to do so. ""We had a trial period where we offered it free to passengers, and we saw increases on those routes; it went up volumes,"" notes Boris Bubresko, head of business development for Norwegian Air Shuttle. ""After that, we decided to keep it free."" At the moment, connectivity is a perk; airlines that provide wi-fi or mobile services on board stand out. This will change, though, as customers increasingly start to expect the amenity, rather than merely appreciate it. LaValle feels that era has already dawned. He says: ""I was on a plane recently that wasn't wi-fi equipped, and this guy sitting across the aisle opened up his laptop and he couldn't find the hotspot. He slammed it down and said, 'I can't believe this, I really needed to get a lot of work done on this flight!' ""I think we're already at that point where everyone fully expects connectivity."" Is it time for all flights to offer wi-fi? Would you pay for in-flight wi-fi, or should it be free? Leave a comment below.

"(CNN) -- New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio may look like the privileged white male so many Americans have come to associate with the face of, and in many cases the problem with, American politics. But as his 19-year-old daughter, Chiara, told a crowd at an August fundraiser, de Blasio is not just ""some boring white guy."" And the truth behind that statement -- not to mention the young woman who made it -- probably won de Blasio the race to become the city's first Democratic mayor in 20 years. Throughout his campaign, de Blasio campaigned on a progressive platform: more jobs, better schools, affordable housing and inclusive city politics. But what kept his platform from being rhetoric per usual was the undeniable strikingly visual proof that de Blasio was different in a very modern and appealing way. De Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray, is black; their two children, Chiara and Dante, are biracial. Throughout the race, the de Blasio family unit was at the forefront, making frequent campaign appearances, starring in TV ads, choreographing a bizarre but charming dance and otherwise creating many adorable moments, from their family embrace and quirky wardrobe choices on the cover of New York magazine right up to Chiara's surprise Election Day visit home from her California college to vote. Direct mail pieces introduced ""Bill & Chirlane,"" the ""Brooklyn family who's fighting to change New York,"" with a picture of the foursome drinking juice and playing Trivial Pursuit. It was a picture so very ordinary and yet not: Where some other boring white guy's white wife might sit is Chirlane, her hair in locs; next to her is Chiara with an eyebrow piercing and gauged earlobes. Sixteen-year-old Dante's 6-inch Afro became a favorite topic among the media. Telegenic family helps lift New York's mayor-elect . On ""The Daily Show,"" Jon Stewart donned a bushy wig and asked the de Blasio family to consider adopting him; President Obama told Dante he had the same hairstyle in 1978. The hair eventually earned its own hashtag on Twitter, embodying the power it came to symbolize: #fromentum. Opponent Joe Lhota, meanwhile, kept his family largely out of the spotlight, saying they prefer privacy and suggesting on ""Good Day New York"" that de Blasio was ""using his family because he has no policies."" Even if that assertion had been true, what Lhota discounted was the enduring importance of family in politics and the power of the promise of change and diversity. Although de Blasio's family might have made him unique in such a major political race, it is far less so when you look at America as whole. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, interracial and interethnic married couples grew by 28% over the past decade, from 7% in 2000 to 10% in 2010. Among unmarried couples, the numbers rise still: Eighteen percent of opposite-sex unmarried couples, and 21% of unmarried couples, are interracial. Among American children, the multiracial population has increased almost 50%, to 4.2 million, since 2000, while the number of people of all ages who identified themselves as both white and black climbed a whopping 134% since 2000 to 1.8 million people, growing faster as a group than those who identified as a single race. De Blasio's election doesn't necessarily symbolize a universal or even New York City-wide acceptance of interracial marriage. But mixed-ethnicity pairings have served other candidates well. Consider Jeb Bush's marriage to Mexican-born Columba Gallo and, of course, President Obama's own racially mixed background. At the same time, it was only a few months ago that a commercial for Cheerios featuring an interracial couple and their daughter caused such intense backlash on YouTube that the comments section had to be closed. Still, studies have showed that showing affection for family of any color or makeup helps humanize, and differentiate, a political candidate. A 2007 Gallup poll found that three in four Americans view ""family values"" -- which they identify in the context of a political campaign as the family unit, family structure or strong families -- as extremely important in determining their vote. This, of course, is the reason the overwhelming majority of elected officials are married with children. De Blasio was smart to call on his family, interracial or not. Was it a political move? Perhaps. And the fact that it worked ultimately says far more about the voters than it does the candidate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Peggy Drexler: Future NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio's family is all-American in a striking new way .
Drexler: His wife is black and two children are biracial, and they are charming and fun .

"(CNN) -- Wall Street Journal reporter David Bird left his New Jersey home Saturday evening, hoping to take a quick walk before it rained. He hasn't been seen since. For the past several days, authorities and dozens of volunteers have been scouring the area around Bird's Long Hill home to find the missing 55-year-old father of two, who was known to walk the trails around his house. Bird was a recipient of a liver transplant nine years ago and requires medication twice a day, his sister-in-law Chris Fleming said. ""We have every reason to believe that he just wanted to go for a little stroll,"" longtime family friend Jacquie Petras told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey. ""There's nothing pointing to anything else."" Bird is an energy markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal. Fleming described him as a great guy who wrote a letter to the family of his liver donor every year. ""He felt very thankful to the donor family for giving him his life that their loved one allowed him to live,"" Fleming said. ""Life was a gift, and he was very, very grateful."" The investigation is being handled by the local police and prosecutor's officer as well as the FBI. Wall Street Journal managing editor Gerard Baker called Bird a ""longtime member of the Dow Jones newsroom."" ""Our thoughts are with his family and we are working with the Long Hill Township Police Department as they continue their search."" Media reports have said that Bird's credit card was reportedly used Wednesday in Mexico, but Fleming said the family is baffled by these reports. Police are still following up on any and all leads, Fleming added. ""There is nothing in his background that shows any indiscretions,"" Chief Michael Mazzeo of the Long Hill Township Police Department told CNN affiliate WABC. Residents around Long Hill have been asked by police to check their properties for signs of Bird, in case he sought protection from the rainy weekend weather. ""It just doesn't seem real,"" Fleming said. ""We just want to bring him home.""

"Moscow (CNN) -- Wigs, dark glasses, a compass and a large bundle of foreign cash -- it's the stuff of any Cold War-era spy novel. That's the ""spy arsenal"" Russia's counterintelligence agency says it found with a U.S. diplomat when he was caught allegedly trying to recruit a Russian special services staff member. The diplomat in question, Ryan Fogle, third secretary of the Political Department of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, was declared ""persona non grata"" Tuesday. Russia's Foreign Ministry has demanded his ""early expulsion."" Former CIA officer casts doubt on Russia's allegations . Fogle was detained overnight Monday to Tuesday ""during an attempt to recruit a representative of one of the Russian security services,"" the Foreign Ministry statement said. He was briefly held before being handed over to the embassy, following formal protocol, Russia's counterintelligence agency, the FSB, said earlier. ""The 'spy arsenal' that was found with him -- as well as a big sum of money -- not only expose a foreign agent who was caught red-handed but also raise serious questions for the American side,"" the Foreign Ministry said. ""While the presidents of our countries reaffirmed their readiness to expand bilateral cooperation, including the cooperation of intelligence agencies in fighting international terrorism, such provocative actions in the spirit of the 'Cold War' does not contribute to building mutual trust."" The U.S. diplomat had ""special technical devices, written instructions for the Russian citizen being recruited, a large sum of cash and means of changing his appearance,"" state news agency RIA-Novosti quoted the FSB as saying earlier Tuesday. Read more: Why Russia and the U.S. still spy (2010) An image released by the FSB shows what it says are his belongings, including two wigs, a knife, two pairs of dark glasses, a map and a compass. Another shows what appears to be a large quantity of high-denomination euro currency notes. The man, with short brown hair and wearing a blue-and-white-checked shirt, is also pictured apparently being detained by security in the street and seated at a desk for questioning. A photograph of the man's ID card released by the FSB identifies him as Ryan Fogle. Nikolai Zakharov, a spokesman for the FSB, said the Russian approached by Fogle was free and that there were no charges or accusations against him. The Russian report of what happened makes the case sound closed, but a former FBI counterintelligence officer cast doubt on that account. ""I very much doubt that a highly trained CIA operative is going to be walking the streets of Moscow wearing a really bad blond wig. It's poor trade craft, and it looks like a setup to me,"" said Eric O'Neill. He suggested that the Russians likely planted the material on Fogle for dramatic effect, perhaps to stir up anti-American sentiment, achieve a political objective, or distract attention from some other matter. The Russian Foreign Ministry said it had summoned U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul for an explanation. The embassy did not comment Tuesday. U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell told reporters in Washington that an officer at the Moscow embassy was briefly detained and released. He declined to comment further. It's not the first time in recent years that Russia and the United States have traded claims about alleged agents, in episodes reminiscent of the Cold War era. In 2010, the two nations carried out a ""spy swap"" in Vienna. The United States exchanged 10 Russian agents who had been expelled for intelligence gathering for four individuals who had been incarcerated in Russia. CNN's Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow, Nick Paton Walsh reported in London, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

"(CNN) -- Russia's prime minister tried to reassure the world about the safety of the upcoming Olympic Winter Games on Tuesday as security forces worked to clamp down on potential threats far from the Black Sea resort where the games will soon begin. A suspected militant leader died in a shootout with police in the restive Caucasus republic of Dagestan, hundreds of miles east of the Olympic venues in Sochi, the state news agency RIA Novosti reported. The news agency said Russian special forces were engaged in other operations in the same territory. And in Sochi and in Rostov-on-Don, a nine-hour drive to the north, police handed out posters of women they suspect may be planning terrorist attacks. In an interview set to air Wednesday on CNN's Amanpour program, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said ""there are always some threats"" to public events, ""not only this country but also in others."" But Russian authorities are aware of those threats and are planning accordingly, he said. ""I am referring to the mobilization, build-up, of police forces, and a huge number of policemen will watch the progress of the Games,"" Medvedev said. Russia has been battling a low-level Islamist insurgency in Dagestan and the North Caucasus region for more than a decade, and militants have vowed to strike at the Games. Over the weekend, as President Vladimir Putin told reporters his government has a ""perfect understanding"" of the threat and how to stop it, a video posted online warned that the insurgents had ""a present"" for Olympic visitors. U.S. may share counter-IED tech with Russia . Andrew Kutchins, the head of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Putin made a ""brazen bet"" by bidding for the Games in Sochi. ""He sees one of the historic roles he has played as being to stabilize the North Caucasus. Unfortunately, the North Caucasus aren't as stabilized as he would like, and by holding the Sochi Olympics in such close proximity to, in effect, a conflict zone, he's taking a big risk. If things don't go well all of his claims about the stability he has brought to the North Caucasus -- and in a way, more broadly, to Russia -- are going to be diminished."" Kutchins said it would be ""very, very difficult"" for militants to pull off large-scale attacks in Sochi, but he said they don't have to hit Sochi itself to hurt the Games. A series of attacks like the Vologograd bombings in the surrounding area ""would raise the terror level in the country and in the international community to such a level that the Games themselves would be imperiled,"" he said. Amid the concerns, the top U.S. military officer discussed sharing high-tech equipment to counter improvised bombs with his Russian counterpart Tuesday, a Pentagon spokesman told CNN. The matter came up ""on an exploratory level"" in a meeting between Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Russian Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Dempsey spokesman Col. Edward Thomas said. The United States developed portable and vehicle-mounted jamming systems after radio-controlled roadside bombs took a huge toll on American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. A U.S. official with knowledge of the discussions said military staff from both countries will now look at whether the U.S. technology is compatible with Russian systems. Fears of 'black widows' as Games near . In Sochi, police have handed out fliers at hotels warning of a woman they believe could already be in the city and planning a terrorist attack. One flier, dated January 15, asks workers to be on the lookout for Ruzanna ""Salima"" Ibragimova, described as the widow of a member of a militant group from the Caucasus region. Ibragimova may be involved in organizing ""a terrorist act within the 2014 Olympic region,"" the flier warns. Authorities received information about Ibragimova's possible arrival in the region last week, it states. CNN obtained the notice from security staff at a hotel in Sochi. Photos of Ibragimova have flooded television and social media reports from Sochi, and some describe her as a ""black widow"" -- a group of women who have carried out high-profile suicide bombings after their insurgent husbands were killed by government forces. Security experts stressed Monday that Ibragimova was probably one of many suspects that authorities are trying to find. But former FBI agent Don Borelli said protecting the Games will require ""multiple layers"" of security. ""If somebody's already on the inside -- if she's already, let's say, has a job at a particular event or has special access, then she's already bypassed one of those layers of security,"" Borelli said. ""Hopefully, now that this warning has taken place, they'll find her, if in fact she's in the region."" Another flier handed out by security forces to hotels in Rostov-on-Don, in southwestern Russia, names three women it says could carry out a suicide attack planned by militant groups between January 21 and 24, during the Olympic Torch Relay. One of the three, Zaira Nizamudinovna Alieva, was killed in a gun battle over the weekend in Dagestan in which seven militants reportedly died. She had been trained to be a suicide bomber, RIA Novosti cited terrorism officials as saying. The other two are named as Djannet Kurbanismailovna Tcakhaeva and Oksana Albertovna Aslanova. Pictures on the flier show two of the three women in Islamic head coverings, but the text warns that the women may not be dressed that way. ""Suspected terrorists may use regular clothing without any Islamic elements, e.g. no long dresses, no hijab, which makes it easier to blend into a crowd, and makes it easier to get access to large gatherings without being noticed,"" it says.

"(CNN) -- Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde is known as the Queen of Nollywood, Nigeria's booming movie industry. Since her 1995 film debut, the actress has appeared in some 300 movies, selling millions of videos and establishing herself as a Nollywood icon. A prolific film siren, Jalade-Ekeinde has also carved out a successful career as a singer and reality TV star. But there's more to Nigeria's beloved celebrity than her glittering entertainment career. Here are 10 things to know about Jalade-Ekeinde. She's an icon: Last year, she was named as one of the top 100 influential people in the world by Time Magazine, in the Icons category. ""I think that's what gives me more satisfaction,"" she says. ""The fact that I wasn't just recognized as an artist but as an icon -- I'm very grateful for it."" She is an activist: Jalade-Ekeinde uses her stardom to speak out about social issues affecting various African countries. An ambassador for the United Nations and an activist with Amnesty International, Jalade-Ekeinde has been on missions to Sierra Leone and Liberia. She's a family woman: Jalade-Ekeinde is married to an airline pilot and is a mother of four children. The story behind ""Omosexy:"" Her popular nickname, ""Omosexy,"" was given to her by her husband -- and it has caught on. ""That's my husband's pet name for me,"" she says, ""and the fans love it and now people call me Omosexy almost more than Omotola."" Her fans love her: Jalade-Ekeinde has amassed a large following -- in 2013, her Facebook page has surpassed 1 million likes. Today, it's 1.2 million, and counting ... Her road to stardom was paved with childhood tragedy: Jalade-Ekeinde lost her beloved father in her early teens. She started working at 15 to help support her family, her first job being a model. Her mother didn't like the idea of her young daughter acting and initially forbade Jalade-Ekeinde from doing so. Finally, she gave in after a film director, joined by the entire movie crew, went to her house to beg her to allow Jalade-Ekeinde to appear in the ""Venom of Justice"" movie. She is part of ""New Nollywood:"" Keen to improve the quality of Nollywood movies, Jalade-Ekeinde is now building a film studio -- what she calls a ""Village."" ""I've come to a place where I realize I have to leave something,"" she says. ""I have to have a legacy. ""We need infrastructure; that's what we need now in Nollywood. We have the fans, we have the figures, we have people chanting and calling your name but we don't have infrastructure ... We need studios, we need film villages we need schools and that's exactly what I'm doing right now."" Cameras follow her around: Besides gracing the covers of several lifestyle magazines, the leading actress is also the first Nigerian with her own reality TV show, ""Omotola: The Real Me."" She can sing too: Jalade-Ekeinde always loved music but decided to launch her singing career after she became an activist and started working with the U.N. World Food Programme. ""I started going on all these missions and I came back and I saw so much I wanted to sing about it,"" she explains. ""I've always wanted to sing all my life anyway, but that was the motivation I needed."" Read this: 10 things to know about Lupita Nyong'o . Read this: Netflix of Africa' brings Nollywood to world .

"(CNN) -- From the outside, the DC-10 jet parked on the airport runway looks like any ordinary plane. But if you step inside, you'll notice something is not quite right. Instead of rows of seats, you'll find a fully equipped operating theater; rather than uniform-clad flight attendants, you'll see a group of doctors in blue coats gathered around a microscope. This is the world's only ""Flying Eye Hospital"" -- a converted plane that has been landing at airports in the developing world for the last 30 years. Its mission is to treat people suffering from blinding diseases -- many of whom are children. But it's not just about treatment; the plane is also designed to train local ophthalmologists. Cameras inside the operating room broadcast eye surgeries to a 48-seat classroom at the front of the plane, where local doctors watch to learn new skills and techniques. A two-way audio system lets the observers ask the surgeons questions while they operate. Inspiring students . In October 2013, the Flying Eye Hospital landed in Cameroon, and its doctors visited the Yaounde Central Hospital in the country's capital. It was a revealing experience for everybody present, said Dr. Emilienne Epee, senior lecturer of ophthalmology at the University of Yaounde. ""Officials, lecturers and senior staff were exposed to what is available and what can be done in a realistic way, easing the advocacy for ophthalmologists,"" she said. Epee added that the visit got many medical students interested in ophthalmology, and she hopes that this will increase the number of ophthalmologists in Cameroon. However, the country still faces many problems when it comes to eye health. ""Equipment is an issue and for the time being we do not have the latest or high-tech facilities in our services,"" said Epee. ""Nevertheless we can attend to the basic need and avoid blindness with what is available to us."" Read this: Birth advice by text message . ORBIS, a U.S.-based non-profit organization that works in developing countries worldwide to prevent blindness and treat visually impaired people, is the organization behind the remarkable plane. ""It's truly remarkable to see people regaining their eyesight every day,"" said Flavia Draganus, communications manager on board the Flying Eye Hospital. ""When we take the patches off after the surgery we see them smile because they can see again, although they thought they'd never be able to."" An estimated 285 million people worldwide are blind or visually impaired according to the WHO -- 90% of them live in low- and middle-income countries, yet 80% of them could be treated or cured with the right medical care. Flying Eye Hospital doctors treat blinding diseases like cataracts, glaucoma, trachoma and diabetic retinopathy; many of them are easily treatable with the right medical care, which developing countries often lack. During their stay, doctors also leave the plane to go to local hospitals to train doctors with the hospitals' existing equipment. Bruce Johnson, director of aircraft operations at ORBIS, said: ""The main deficits in the eye care industry in the developing world are a lack of ophthalmologists and the right equipment as well as very few specialist hospitals. Also, often parents can't afford the surgery for their children."" Johnson has been with ORBIS for nine years and has been on dozens of overseas programs. ""We can take our hospital anywhere to reach people in remote regions that don't have access to the right eye care treatment,"" he said. The organization says the Flying Eye Hospital has so far carried out 925,000 surgeries and trained 92,000 doctors. Local knowledge . It is the training that offers long-term hope for better eye care. ""There is a huge appetite for training among doctors in the developing world, as we've recently seen on a trip to Cameroon,"" Draganus said. ""We leave knowledge behind and make sure that these doctors sustain the skills even after we left."" ORBIS has been asked to build a pediatric eye care unit as part of the planned Yaounde Vision Institute. The institute would mark a step forward for eye health care in Cameroon, but a lack of training nationwide remains a challenge. Dr Henry Nkumbe is an ophthalmologist based in Yaounde, and secretary general of the African Ophthalmology Forum. He said: ""No center in the country has the necessary skills set and equipment to regularly perform corneal grafts, advanced glaucoma surgeries. So Cameroon, through out-of-pocket payments by patients or covered by the Ministry of Health budget, spends a lot on medical evacuations abroad, for specialist eye care services currently not available in Cameroon."" Nkumbe added: ""At present at most 25% of people needing cataract surgery in Cameroon do indeed get it."" More than 30 years ago, the American ophthalmologist Dr. David Paton created ORBIS based on the idea of using aviation to deliver medical education around the world. In 1980, United Airlines donated a plane to the project and after it was converted into a fully functional teaching eye hospital, it went on its first trip to Panama in 1982 and has so far visited 78 countries worldwide. A program in each country lasts around two to three weeks and there are up to 24 people on board including doctors, nurses, anesthesiologists and aircraft mechanics. In 2010, FedEx donated an MD-10 aircraft, which is currently being turned into the next flying hospital. Johnson said: ""I never imagined that there are so many people out there that need treatment and whose blindness can easily be prevented, with just the right care.""

"(CNN) -- A couple of years ago, I came across a film about London's East Street market which in the 80's was a regular Sunday outing for my family. The memories flooded back, I sent the link to my brother and we vowed to visit soon to buy cheap greetings cards and show our support. And then another film grabbed my attention. A young Afghan girl learning to drive allowed us a slice of her life. It made me sit up. MyStreet  is the website hosting these films and many others -- encouraging the use of digital tools to open up the experience of making and sharing your own 'story'. Both local and global audiences can tap in -- a connection to something familiar or a learning of something unknown. 50 new tech tools you should know about . Anthropology as the 'science of humanity' has broadened, and the idea of the anthropologist has evolved. Like with many professions, the baton has passed from trained individuals to you, to me, to a big wide world. These days, user generated is the norm, online communities have the power, and social media allows us to create a running commentary of our lives. In the 1930's, the Mass Observation project was first carried out to provide a fair representation of life in the UK. Over 500 untrained volunteer observers and investigators were enlisted to record man-in-the-street conversations, keep diaries, and complete questionnaires. Today we continue to do the same, only now using our own personal devices to create our own updates - and comment on everyone else's. The woman using social media to predict future . MyStreet was created in the Anthropology Department of University College London by Dr. Michael Stewart, as an international online film archive that incorporates a strong sense of collaborative anthropology. Films are submitted from all over the world, linked to a postcode, town, street, appearing as pins on a geo-tagged map. Its global context is important and growing - our stories are placed alongside each others', all just as valid, with workshops being carried out on the ground to teach basic filmmaking skills. It runs an annual UK competition with the actor Jeremy Irons chairing the jury, for which the deadline is May 31. As an arts producer I initially saw it as a film channel - a platform for short documentaries - curated, so not a free-for-all YouTube. And then when catching wind of the map element, it became a heartfelt version of Google's Street View. Healing the world through film . These are not documentary films made by experienced professionals. Some are admittedly beautifully shot, some made on mobile phones, some by 12-year-olds. Some have a simple story to tell, some a major issue to get across. It is used as a citizen journalism and campaigning platform, and there's an obvious home for activism here. MyStreet is a modern day Domesday Book, a moving image census - a consolidated archive that can be looked upon in 100 years time showing 'that's how they lived.' But it makes everyone's voice important, and all those who contributed can call themselves anthropologists. They made the most of the digital tools we have available to tell their story. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Olivia Bellas.","MyStreet is a website where people can tell their stories by uploading short films .

"(CNN) -- Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza may have called a radio show nearly a year before his rampage, drawing parallels between a Connecticut chimpanzee that mauled a woman in 2009 and a ""teenage mall shooter or something like that,"" according to a report published Thursday in the New York Daily News. The newspaper identified the caller as Lanza, based on Internet postings and confirmation by two of the late shooter's friends. CNN cannot confirm that the recorded voice is Lanza's, but if it is his, it could provide previously unknown insight into the mind of the 20-year-old, who killed 26 people at the Newtown, Connecticut, school before killing himself as police closed in. ""This is (him) saying, 'Hey listen, there is going to be another shooting, there is going to be another outbreak of violence,'"" clinical psychologist Jeff Gardere told CNN, assuming the voice is that of Lanza. Continuing with what he believed the caller meant, Gardere added, ""But it's not as random as you think it is. There's a reason that these things happen."" The 2011 call to the show ""AnarchyRadio,"" which broadcasts on a University of Oregon campus station and streams on the Internet, focuses on the story of Travis, a chimpanzee shot to death by police after he mauled his owner's friend at the Stamford, Connecticut, home where he lived. The friend suffered devastating, albeit not life-ending injuries in the February 2009 attack. The chimp -- who had been featured in TV commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy -- was shot multiple times by Stamford police as he tried to enter a cruiser before returning to the house and dying inside, police said. Chimp attack 911 call: 'He's ripping her apart' In the nearly seven-minute segment, the caller -- who identifies himself as ""Greg"" and speaks in a low, clipped monotone -- laments perceptions of the chimpanzee after the attack, which he said didn't happen ""simply because he was a senselessly violent, impulsive chimp."" ""Immediately before his attack, he had desperately been wanting his owner to drive him somewhere, and the best reason I can think of for why he would want that, looking at his entire life, is some little thing he experienced was the last straw, and he was overwhelmed by the life he had and he wanted to get out of it by changing his environment,"" the caller said. ""And the best way he knew how to deal with that was by getting his owner to drive him somewhere else."" After the owner's friend arrived, the chimp ""knew that she was trying to coax him back into his life of domestication,"" the caller added. ""He couldn't handle that, so he attacked her and anyone else who approached him,"" he said. ""And dismissing his attack as simply being the senseless violence and impulsiveness of a chimp, instead of a human, is wishful thinking at best."" That primate's story can inform how humans act, and sometimes snap, the caller speculated. ""His attacks can be parallel to the attacks, the random acts of violence, that you see on your show every week, committed by humans which the mainstream also has no explanation for,"" he said. ""An actual human, I don't think it would be such a stretch. He very well could be a teenage mall shooter or something like that. ..."" Police release final report on Newtown school shooting . The show's host, John Zerzan, said Thursday the idea that he might have been talking to someone who would massacre young children was ""really chilling."" At the time, though, he thought the caller seemed rational in making a valid point about how anyone -- whether they are animal or human -- can feel pushed over the edge in modern society. ""This guy ... was beyond the pale and yet, I think, he made an accurate point (about) these flipouts,"" Zerzan -- who bills himself as ""an anti-civilization theorist"" -- told CNN's Don Lemon. ""Anyone who reads the paper now and then would have noticed that is happening. And maybe we should try to find out why, what it's telling us about the society."" While saying such conversation on a program called AnarchyRadio might not stand to most, Gardere said psychologists like himself might spot ""red flags"" like the caller's ""very robotic"" and controlled voice and his referring to ""society"" and ""humans acting out, not to mention the mention of mall shootings. Criminologist Casey Jordan, a professor of justice and law administration at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, said she sees parallels between this call and Lanza's later rampage. ""I think the subtext of what he is saying is that violence is innate and instinctual to humans and really should not be punished because it is their natural basis,"" Jordan said. ""That's the message he's trying to get across, and the parallel to himself is obvious. ""He feels possessed by this need, this compulsion to commit violence.""

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A Japanese diplomat was wounded when armed men tried to kidnap him in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa on Sunday morning, three Interior Ministry officials said. The diplomat resisted and was stabbed by the assailants, the officials said. The kidnapping attempt took place outside the diplomat's residence. The Japanese embassy in Sanaa confirmed the attempted kidnapping and said the diplomat is being treated for minor wounds in a Sanaa hospital. The attackers fled the scene, the Yemeni Interior Ministry said. While kidnapping has long been a problem in Yemen, with tribes often using foreign nationals as a bargain chip in their dealings with the central government, the past 24 months have proven even more dangerous for foreigners. Europeans are considered especially high-value targets. Al Qaeda has been running kidnapping bids for well over a year, targeting foreigners.","The diplomat was stabbed outside his home in Sanaa .

"(CNN) -- Security forces killed seven militants in a counterterrorism operation in Russia's southern republic of Dagestan, security officials said Saturday, according to the country's state news agency RIA Novosti. The six men and one woman were killed after a siege in Makhachkala, capital city of Dagestan, Russia's Anti-Terrorism Committee said in a prepared statement, RIA Novosti reported. The operation came after 16 people, including several police officers, were injured Friday in explosions from a grenade launcher and a car bomb targeting a restaurant in Makhachkala, the news agency reported, citing investigators. The investigators said that the seven killed Saturday included a local militant leader and the widow of a dead militant preparing for a suicide attack, RIA Novosti added. Some of them tried unsuccessfully to break out while a house was under siege overnight, state-run Itar-Tass reported, quoting security and law enforcement officials. The latest incident follows years of unrest linked to an Islamist insurgency in Dagestan and the North Caucasus region. It also came as Russian security forces have tried to address security concerns before next month's Winter Olympics in Sochi, which is perhaps a 12-hour drive from Dagestan on the other side of the Caucasus range. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that his government is doing ""everything possible"" to make sure the Olympics will be secure. What it will not do, he insisted in an address broadcast by several television networks, is shudder in the face of the threats. Concerns about security in Russia were heightened after twin bombings on public transit that killed more than 30 people in the southern city of Volgograd at the end of last month. Just Wednesday, another four militants and three Russian security force members died in a shootout in Dagestan. CNN's Nic Robertson and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","Seven militants are killed in Dagestan's capital, Makhachkala, Russian state media report .

"(CNN) -- Lady Gaga -- the flamboyant and provocative New York-based pop singer -- has been removed from a Chinese government blacklist, allowing her chart-topping new album ""ARTPOP"" to go on sale legally in China. But Chinese censors have placed conditions on the album art, inflating a large ball between her legs to cover more of the naked singer's body and adding a pair of black tights to the singer's bare legs. The cover of her latest album was designed by the American artist Jeff Koons, who specializes in garish and kitsch representations of the banal and everyday. Chinese officials also changed one song title, transforming ""Sexxx Dreams"" to ""X Dreams."" Following a multi-platform promotional blitz -- which included Lady Gaga wearing a ""flying dress"" made from a large hovering drone-like contraption -- ""ARTPOP"" shot to the top of the US charts in November, selling 258,000 copies in its first week. But in China, the pop diva's songs had been on a blacklist since 2011, when the Culture Ministry deemed her work to be ""creating confusion in the order of the online music market, and damaging the nation's cultural security."" Singling out songs from her album ""Born this Way,"" Chinese authorities identified six Gaga tracks -- ""The Edge of Glory,"" ""Hair,"" ""Marry the Night,"" ""Americano,"" ""Judas"" and ""Bloody Mary"" -- as among 100 foreign songs to be placed on a blacklist. Katy Perry's ""Last Friday Night"" and the Backstreet Boys' ""I Want It That Way"" were also included in the sweep. The ministry at the time said that foreign songs would be subject to the same censorship requirements as domestic artists. All albums for release must be screened by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. Lady Gaga last week responded with enthusiasm to the lifting of the ban on her Twitter feed. ""China has been given the go ahead singer I'm so excited!!!! The Chinese Government approved 'ARTPOP' to be released in China with all 15 songs! Next I hope I can come to perform!,"" she said on her Twitter account. While copies of the album have been available in pirate form on the streets and in Beijing's Sanlitun district -- identified by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) as a key location for the distribution of counterfeit films and music -- Lady Gaga's distributor Universal Music China was coy about the ban. ""I don't think ban is the way to put it,"" a spokeswoman told CNN. ""All Lady Gaga's albums are on sale in China. The newest one is already on sale."" Posters on China's lively social media site Sina Weibo were typically mordant about the lifting of the ban. ""'X Dream' implies the 'China Dream',"" said one poster, in reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping's slogan about the country pursuing the 'Chinese Dream.' ""That must be why those high up in the administration have given it a special pass."" Others, however, were more direct in their criticism. ""Can't stand it, can't believe the black tights, has China become a Islamic country?"" said one poster labeled Shen Qiaozi.","China removes Lady Gaga from a blacklist slapped on foreign artists in 2011 .

"(CNN) -- When a Vatican cardinal presented a message from Pope Francis to the World Economic Forum, it might have been the first time a papal message actually has been read out in Davos, but it certainly wasn't the first time a Pope has spoken out on economic justice. Read more -- Pope to Davos elite 'Do more for poor' Beginning in the late 19th century, almost a dozen Popes have issued a long series of documents devoted to defense of the poor which are known as ""Catholic social teaching."" All that moral leadership, however, has not produced a notably more just world. A recent estimate by Oxfam, a UK-based charitable group, claims that 85 people on earth control as much wealth as the bottom half of the world's population, despite 120 years of papal exhortations. Is there any reason to believe that Francis could make a difference where so many of his predecessors haven't? The surprising answer is yes, just maybe. To begin, the first Pope from the developing world brings a degree of credibility on matters of economic justice that other world leaders lack. That's not merely because of his origins, but because of his lifestyle choices in favor of simplicity and humility. This is the Pope, after all, who famously spurned a papal limo to take the bus after his election with the other cardinals, who wears the same brown shoes he sported in Argentina, and who rejected the papal apartment in favor of a modest room in a Vatican residence for clergy. His aversion to ostentation is already the stuff of legend, so when Francis talks of a ""poor church for the poor,"" people take him seriously. Francis also has amassed massive deposits of political capital over his first 10 months in office, with approval ratings around the world that politicians and celebrities have to view with unalloyed envy. That's why, for instance, political leaders these days are beating a path to the Pope's door. Francis recently welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin, he'll meet French President Francois Hollande on Friday, and the White House announced today that U.S. President Barack Obama will make a pilgrimage to the Vatican to meet Francis on March 27. What's the subject for the Obama/Francis summit? According to a White House statement, it's ""their shared commitment to fighting poverty and growing inequality."" In many ways Francis has become the new Nelson Mandela, meaning the world's leading source of moral authority. The difference in the Pope's case is that he combines personal charisma with the institutional authority of leading the world's largest Christian church, with more than 1.2 billion followers in every corner of the planet. Catholicism is also the only world religion with its own diplomatic corps, as the Vatican is a sovereign state with bilateral relations with 180 nations. That gives the church a unique platform to act as a voice of conscience in global affairs. In other words, Francis has some serious cards to lay on the table in the high-stakes poker game of global economic reform. It's easy to say that no one person -- even a Pope who's also one of the most popular figures on the planet -- can bring down entrenched systems of power. Of course, that's what people said about Communism too, before Pope John Paul II set the dominoes in motion in Poland that led to the collapse of the Communist system in 1989. Whether Francis will have the same luck defending the poor remains to be seen, but it's certainly not obvious that the smart money is against him. Read more: Egypt's dream in the wrong hands .

"(CNN) -- A new peace conference aimed at ending Syria's civil war convenes Wednesday in Switzerland, where the international community hopes to apply a tourniquet to the Middle East's worst open wound. Here's a quick thumbnail guide to the conference: . What's at stake in Geneva? Ending a war that has killed more than 100,000 people, spread to Syria's neighbors and become an increasingly sectarian proxy battle among regional powers. Nearly three years since the beginning of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the war has fueled new rounds of violence in neighboring Lebanon and Iraq. In Syria itself, secular and Islamist rebel factions are battling each other in the country's north. What are the prospects for a deal? Under the circumstances, few appear to expect much to come out of the talks. ""We have little hope that the Assad regime would come with good will to these negotiations,"" coalition spokesman Louay Safi told CNN. Al-Assad's government ""is not interested in a political solution, and they will continue to kill the Syrian people."" The relief group Save the Children urged the parties to at least agree on steps to help the youngest victims of the conflict -- allowing aid to reach children, protecting schools and health facilities and stopping the use of explosives in populated areas. Save the Children says 11,000 children have died and another 4 million are in danger. ""Even if they can't agree on the big picture, surely they can agree on this one fundamental thing, which is that children should not be targeted in war,"" said George Graham, the group's humanitarian policy director. Middle East expert Rami Khouri told CNN that he expected limited results from the talks. ""It may have a very small incremental gain, step by step -- humanitarian issues, refugee issues, something else,"" Khouri said. But he added, ""It is worth being there to test it out."" Haven't we been here before? Sort of, yes. This is the second Geneva conference on the Syrian war, the first having been held in mid-2012. What's now called ""Geneva I"" in diplomatic shorthand didn't end the war, but it produced a framework for a settlement that calls for the establishment of a transitional government and eventually, free and fair elections under a new constitution. Who's coming this time? Along with the Syrian government, those invited include the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain, France, China, the United States and Russia, Syria's biggest backer -- and more than 25 other countries. Representatives of the Arab League, Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the European Union are coming as well. The leading Syrian opposition movement, the Syrian National Coalition, agreed to attend only Saturday in a vote that exposed deep rifts within its ranks. One of the groups under the coalition umbrella blasted it for agreeing to join the talks at all, accusing it of heading to Geneva with ""a folder of concessions and withdrawals."" The late addition of Iran to the guest list created a new hurdle Monday, since the Islamic Republic hadn't agreed to a set of goals laid out in 2012. The National Coalition called Iran's participation a ""deal-breaker"" and threatened to leave the talks. The United States urged U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to withdraw the invitation unless Iran signed onto the Geneva I goals. Iran eventually announced that it would not agree to any preconditions for the conference, and the United Nations rescinded its invitation Monday evening. What's on the agenda? The talks are expected to focus on the Geneva I plan for a transitional government, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said last week. But al-Assad, whose forces have regained momentum against a now-fractured opposition, has said he's not looking at the talks as a way to transition out of power. Syrian officials have talked instead about the conference as a way to arrange a cease-fire in Syria's largest city, Aleppo, with hopes of extending that truce to other parts of the country. Over the weekend, al-Assad told the French news agency AFP that the conference should focus on fighting ""terrorists"" -- his government's usual description of rebel forces -- and the outside powers he said provide them ""political cover."" ""Any political solution that is reached without fighting terrorism has no value. There can be no political action when there is terrorism everywhere,"" he said. Then what's the point? Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNN the conference could offer ""at least a pathway"" to bring an end to the killing in Syria. ""It is essential, however difficult and however challenging, that people try to come together and try to set out at least some broad principles for a framework that allows us to move from here,"" Blair said in an interview that aired Tuesday on CNN's Amanpour. How did this all start again? Protests against al-Assad, who took power after his father died in 2000, began in March 2011. In the wake of the ""Arab Spring"" revolts around the Middle East and North Africa, residents of the southern city of Daraa turned out to criticize the government's treatment of 15 children arrested for painting anti-government graffiti on the walls of a school. Syrian authorities responded by opening fire, killing dozens. Demonstrations spread to other cities, mass arrests unfolded and tales of torture spread across the country. While al-Assad tried to dismiss the protests at first, his government soon was dispatching police and troops to put down what had become a full-fledged revolt against his rule. The war has drawn in Syrian allies Iran and the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah; a variety of Islamic jihadist groups, who have battled government troops and other rebel factions; and Iranian rivals across the Persian Gulf like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which are believed to be providing arms to rebel forces. By 2013, the United Nations estimated more than 100,000 had been killed. Large portions of Syrian cities have been left in ruins, more than 4 million have been left homeless inside the country and nearly 2 million have fled Syria altogether, U.N. officials say. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh and Samira Said contributed to this report.","What's at stake? Ending a bloodbath in Syria and capping a spread of violence to neighbors .

"(CNN) -- While UK politicians seek to distance themselves from Europe's troubled continent, rail operators are doing their best to bridge the gap. The Channel Tunnel -- a favored travel route for those flitting between London and Paris -- is expanding its reach into mainland Europe by opening its doors to Deutsche Bahn. The German operator's access to the Channel Tunnel upsets the monopoly held on the route by high speed train operator Eurostar since 2004, and will boost traffic by 4 million passengers. Read more: Pampering cows the Wagyu way . Jacques Gounon, chief executive of Eurotunnel -- the company that operates the Channel Tunnel -- told CNN the company was recovering from the crisis, when traffic fell by 20%. ""Now it's up year after year at 3 to 4% gross rate,"" Gounon said. ""Deutsche Bahn will come from Germany and Netherlands... it's quite clear that this will be an incredible increase in our revenue.""

Deutsche Bahn will begin its undersea rail operations as soon as the Intercity Express trains -- manufactured by German technology company Siemens -- are ready for service. The move will break Eurostar's near-two decade dominance over the Channel Tunnel, but the high-speed operator is making expansion plans of its own. Speaking to CNN last month, Eurostar CEO Nicolas Petrovic said the company is planning to launch a ""state of the art"" fleet that can carry passengers to the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. Read more: How's your confidence in the euro . Petrovic said Eurostar would ""grab the opportunity of open access in Europe"" while trying to wrestle market share from airlines. Eurostar tickets for an adult traveling from London to Paris cost Â£69 ($104) for standard class to Â£250 ($378) for business class. Petrovic told CNN that the company is looking ""very carefully"" at pricing, adding that the biggest cost to Eurostar's business is the levy on using the Channel Tunnel. Meanwhile, Eurotunnel is expanding more than just its train business. Last year, the Paris-based company launched a ferry service called MyFerryLink, for large vehicles and passengers who prefer to travel by boat. The business has already gained 11% of the market share, according to Eurotunnel. Gounon said: ""People who want to have a different way to cross the Channel, perhaps to pay less... We believe that the ferry business is a compliment of our main core business.""","Eurotunnel shuttles 400 trains a day through the Channel Tunnel on average .

You should turn your attention to Valdosta, Georgia, where authorities are claiming up is down, water isn't wet and a 17-year-old black athlete suffocated to death after he ""accidentally"" rolled himself up in a wrestling mat at his high school. How about those ugly numbers involved with income inequality? That affects people of color more than anybody. According to a study released this week from British humanitarian group Oxfam International, the world's richest 85 people have as much wealth as the poorest 3 billion. And, goodness knows, most stop-and-frisk victims are darker than Rush Limbaugh. As for this Sherman thing, puhleeze. I mean, if you decide to look and sound like a crazy person on national television, you likely will receive a bunch of responses from yahoos that won't be kind. Sherman: Rant was 'immature,' reaction 'mind-boggling' Those yahoos will view you as the yahoo. That's not to excuse the use of racial epithets against Sherman. And to his credit, he apologized (with a mighty push from Seahawks coach Pete Carroll) for his rant on Sunday after his Seahawks reached the Super Bowl in the final seconds when he tipped away a potential game-winning pass to his arch-nemesis, Michael Crabtree, a star wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers. Sherman celebrated the moment by getting in a verbal spat with Crabtree, delivering the choke sign toward the 49ers bench and telling a Fox reporter on live television ... well, it wasn't good. So here's the bottom line surrounding all things Sherman: Nobody with a clue needs to watch his apologists flash frowns of concern before saying why they believe he is misunderstood. They say he really is an intelligent guy working on his masters at his undergraduate school of Stanford. They say he is doing much of his trash talking before the nearest camera, microphone or reporter's notepad only for show. They say this is another example of why the rest of us just need to loosen up, because despite the way it appears (you know, that Sherman is absolutely out of control and needs a good spanking), he is being persecuted as a 25-year-old black male with dreadlocks trying to keep it real. Yeah, well. Sherman's persona is dangerous, along with the shallow-thinking folks who support him and his ever-flapping tongue. Here we are, 21 years after one of the most unfortunate commercials of all times, and many folks still haven't learned that Charles Barkley blew it. Back then, when he was a player for the Phoenix Suns instead of the analyst that he has become for NBA telecasts and other entities, Barkley looked into a camera for Nike to deliver six infamous words: ""I am not a role model."" Well, there were lot of things wrong with that. For one, we all are role models -- regardless of intellect, occupation, age, creed, color, education, gender and social or economic status. Whether we like it or not, somebody always is studying us. And the more visibility we have in life, especially when it comes to the fields of athletics and entertainment, the more responsibility we have to present ourselves in a way that will influence others for the positive. I know what Barkley said he was trying to say. He said he was trying to say youth in general and black youth in particular shouldn't look at athletes as their role models. He was trying to say they should try to emulate their parents. Sounds good, except as a person who has dealt up close and personal with black youngsters for decades around Atlanta -- ranging from speaking in elementary, junior high, high schools and colleges to teaching teenagers in Sunday School and leading youth groups -- many of them don't have two parents. Plus, according to statistics released by the U.S. census in May, 68% of black women who gave birth in the previous year were unmarried. Not a lot of role modeling going on there. Consider, too, that a large percentage of black youngsters raised by single women are latchkey kids, which means they come home to an empty dwelling to fend for themselves over long stretches of time. So many of those youngsters get their idea of how to survive and prosper from older folks in the neighborhood. Either that, or they look toward the most visible people they see on television. Actors, rappers, athletes. Which is why Barkley was a role model back then to millions, and which is why he remains one today -- whether he likes it or not. The same is true of Sherman. And on that score, he was a loser on Sunday. So Sherman deserved what he got in the aftermath. The youth watching it all deserved better, period. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Terence Moore.","Terence Moore: Richard Sherman deserved criticism for his rant about Michael Crabtree .

"(CNN) -- It appears to be mere coincidence that a California lawmaker's bill to ban the defense of ""affluenza"" comes the week before the television debut of ""Rich Kids of Beverly Hills."" Assemblyman Mike Gatto, D-Los Angeles, introduced a bill in the state Legislature on Tuesday that would outlaw the defense at trial or during post-trial sentencing, according to a news release from Gatto's office. Affluenza snared national headlines late last year when Texas teen Ethan Couch received 10 years of probation after slamming into a parked car south of Fort Worth. The struck car then slid into another vehicle moving in the opposite direction. Four people were killed, and two people riding in the bed of Couch's pickup truck were tossed and severely injured. Prosecutors wanted Couch sentenced to a maximum of 20 years behind bars, while the 16-year-old's defense team argued that Couch's well-to-do parents should share the blame for the crash because they never set limits and gave him everything he wanted. A psychologist testified that Couch was the product of affluenza and told the court that the teen's life could be turned around if he were separated from his parents and placed in a treatment program. A judge agreed, saying that if Couch violated the terms of his probation, he could face up to 10 years of incarceration, according to a statement from the Tarrant County, Texas, Criminal District Attorney's Office. ""Perhaps the notion of personal responsibility seems antiquated to some,"" Gatto said in a news release this week. ""But I think the majority of us believe that people should own up to their actions, and that criminals should not be able to use their wealth or privilege to lessen the severity of their sentences. Spoiled children shouldn't be able to spoil the chances of victims to obtain justice when a criminal act has occurred."" Gatto's legislation, AB 1508, ""would forbid a judge or jury from reducing the sentence of a defendant who claims that being raised in a wealthy or excessively lenient household somehow explains or absolves that defendant's guilt,"" according to the news release. The bill specifically states, ""Circumstances in mitigation of the punishment prescribed by law shall not include the fact that the defendant may not have understood the consequences of his or her actions because he or she was raised in an affluent or overly permissive household."" CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","California legislation would ban ""affluenza"" as defense or during post-trial sentencing .

"(CNN) -- A Chinese journalist jailed for eight years for leaking government restrictions on reporting is now free. Shi Tao's early release was announced by the writers' organization PEN International on Saturday -- 15 months before he was scheduled to be freed. Shi is a member of Independent Chinese PEN Center, which advocates for freedom of speech. Shi made headlines in 2004 when he sent the media restrictions to a human rights group -- an act that China said amounted to ""leaking state secrets,"" PEN said. What's more, Internet giant Yahoo played a part in his conviction. In a widely criticized move, Yahoo handed over Shi's e-mail account information, which the Chinese government used in the case against Shi, according to court documents. The reporting restrictions were over the coverage of the 15th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, in which hundreds of pro-democracy protesters were killed in a government crackdown. Chinese soldiers followed orders to open fire on unnarmed civilians. Official Chinese government figures said the death toll was 241, including soldiers, with 7,000 injured. Rights groups have said the number of dead was likely in the thousands. Early release . Shi was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2005. It's not clear why he was let go early. The U.S. Congress led a probe into the case after his conviction. Yahoo lawyers defended the move to hand over information, saying not doing so would have jeopardized the company's own employees. ""I cannot ask our local employees (in China) to resist lawful demands and put their own freedom at risk, even if, in my personal view, the local laws are overboard,"" attorney Michael Callahan said in 2007. Yahoo settled with Shi's family for an undisclosed amount. But the late Rep. Tom Lantos had harsh words for the company. ""It took a tongue-lashing from Congress before these high-tech titans did the right thing and coughed up some concrete assistance for the family of a journalist whom Yahoo had helped send to jail,"" Lantos said at the time. Lingering questions . Shi was apparently released on August 23, but Marian Botsford Fraser, who heads up the Writers in Prison Committee for PEN, says her organization just learned of it. Botsford Fraser said Shi hasn't communicated directly with PEN but he has spoken with a affiliated group in China. Botsford Fraser said Shi is currently living with his mother and is in good spirits. But, she added, he has no desire to speak publicly. Botsford Fraser emphasized that while her organization welcomes Shi's early release, it has many unanswered questions. PEN can only speculate, Botsford Fraser said, as to the timing and rationale of his release. Also unknown is why Shi recently began to receive better treatment in prison. Of late, authorities even allowed Shi to write, Botsford Fraser said. In October 2010, when he learned that Liu Xiaobo, a Chinese dissident, received a Nobel Peace Prize, he composed a poem which read in part: . ""October . Comes from afar, but not to end . October . Will become a festival for all the unfortunates and their friends."" Shi's release was not covered by Chinese state media. CNN's Emma Lacey-Bordeaux contributed to this report.","Shi Tao was sentenced to 10 years for leaking government restrictions on reporting .

"Washington (CNN) -- The pilots of Southwest flight 4013 say that Branson Airport was correctly programmed into their on-board computer Sunday, but that they ""mistakenly identified"" another airport as Branson when they saw its bright lights, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The explanation, aviators say, is an example of ""confirmation bias,"" the tendency of people to confirm their beliefs, and dismiss conflicting information. The captain, a veteran with 16,000 hours of flying experience, had never before flown into Branson, investigators were told. The first officer had flown into the airport on one previous occasion, but during daylight, investigators said. Southwest Airlines suspended both pilots following the incident, pending the outcome of the investigation, which is continuing. According to the NTSB, the pilots told investigators that the approach had been programmed into their flight management system. But that they first saw the airport beacon and the runway lights of M. Graham Clark Downtown Airport, located in Hollister, Missouri, about seven miles away. The pilots ""mistakenly identified"" it as Branson Airport, the NTSB said. They cited the bright runway lights at Clark Downtown Airport and the fact that the runway was oriented in a similar direction. They told investigators they flew a visual approach into the airport and did not realize they were at the wrong airport until they had landed. They confirmed that they utilized heavy braking to bring the aircraft to a stop and then advised the Branson Airport tower that they had landed at the wrong airport. The NTSB said it has downloaded information from the plane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder and are analyzing the data. The cockpit voice recorder shows air traffic controllers informed the Southwest crew that that they were 15 miles from their intended target, which was Branson Airport. The crew responded that they had the airfield in sight and controllers cleared the aircraft for a visual approach and landing on runway 14 at Branson Airport. According to the cockpit voice recorder, the landing was uneventful and it was not until shortly after touching down that the crew realized they had landed at the wrong airport.","The NTSB releases new information on last Sunday's wrong airport landing in Missouri .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A blast killed 20 Shiite pilgrims and injured another 25 in Pakistan's troubled southwestern Balochistan province Sunday, a senior administration official said. Militants targeted three buses of Shiite pilgrims in the Dringarh area with a car bomb, said Tufail Baloch, deputy commissioner of the Mastung district. One bus was destroyed in the attack, and the other two were damaged, Baloch said. He said buses were carrying Shiite pilgrims from Quetta to Iran. The pilgrims were from Pakistan's Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces. Baloch said authorities found a timed device at the scene that indicates the blast was controlled remotely. It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack. But in the past, Sunni militant group Lashkar e Jhangvi has targeted buses of Shiite pilgrims. Shia Islam is a minority sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim country, and its members face persecution from extremists. On November 24, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a blast that killed seven people, including three children, during a Shiite religious procession.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The judge who presided over the Michael Jackson wrongful-death trial last year issued a final rejection of the Jacksons' request for a new trial on Monday. The six-month-long trial ended in October with a victory for AEG Live, the concert promoter Jackson's mother and children had claimed was liable for his death because it hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death. Lawyers for mother Katherine Jackson argued that the verdict form used by the jury was faulty and that the judge erred by refusing to let them pursue a negligence claim independent of the hiring case. Their motion for a new trial filed in December included sworn statements from four of the 12 jurors saying they feel cheated by the outcome, which they blame on a misleading verdict form. Jackson died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol on June 25, 2009, which Dr. Conrad Murray told police he used to treat the pop icon's insomnia as he prepared for a tour produced by AEG Live. Los Angeles County Judge Yvette Palazuelos issued a tentative ruling earlier in January saying she did not err in her decisions on the verdict form or with the dismissal of the negligence claim. She heard oral arguments on January 3 and filed her final decision denying the request on Monday. Jackson lawyers have indicated they will appeal the jury's verdict. AEG Live lawyers filed statements from seven other jurors saying they were not confused by the verdict form. The jurors cited by the Jackson motion used the words ""stunned,"" ""upset"" and ""shocked"" when they were told they had to stop deliberations after a majority agreed the answer was ""no"" to the second question on the verdict form: ""Was Dr. Conrad Murray unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired?"" One juror called the question ""a trap that prevented us from deliberating on the real issues of the case."" ""After sitting through almost six months of the trial in this case, I believed that Mrs. Jackson had proven her case against AEG LIve,"" another juror said. ""Despite this fact, I had no way of voting in favor of the plaintiffs because of the way that the verdict form was worded."" Jackson lawyers, in their arguments for a new trial, contended that Palazuelos erred by denying their request to add the words ""at any time"" to the second question.","Michael Jackson's mother wants a new trial for the wrongful death suit .

"(CNN) -- The threat of increasing loan rates on future college students has become the newest political cudgel. It shouldn't be. Lowering interest rates on subsidized student loans does little to address the real problems of higher education: rising tuition costs and diminishing returns. First, let's remember how we got here. After taking back control of Congress in 2007, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi passed legislation that temporarily lowered the interest rates on the federally subsidized Stafford Loans from 6.8% to 3.4%. The extension would last until July 2012, when the rates double to 6.8%, partly as a budget trick to offset the original costs. The Washington Post's editorial board called the whole ordeal ""a campaign gimmick that Democrats cooked up to help them retake Congress in 2006. ... It's expensive, it's poorly targeted and it diverts attention and money from bigger problems facing federal support for higher education."" With the rates set to expire in the middle of this election season, Democrats knew full well they could use the threat of rising interest rates against Republicans. They've done exactly that. ""Today you've got Republicans who run Congress, and they're not saying whether or not they're going to stop your rates from doubling,"" President Obama said at the University of Colorado last week. Feeling the political heat, House Republicans as well as Mitt Romney agreed to extend the low interest rates. That's unfortunate. Republicans need not be on the defensive. How does the president plan to pay for the $6 billion subsidy? And how will it help control tuition costs? So far it hasn't. In 2011, costs at the average public university rose more than 5% for in-state students, or about $1,100. The average tuition at public universities rose more than 8%. By comparison, the rate of inflation was 3%. Furthermore, only about a third of undergraduates have subsidized Stafford Loans and the interest rates for existing loans won't be touched. The average student with Stafford Loans graduates with about $13,000 in debt, much lower than the national average of $25,000. If the current rate doubles, they would pay about $2,600 more over 10 years. The effect of doubling the rates from 3.4% to 6.8% is minute when compared to the lifetime earnings of a person with a bachelor's degree (approximately $2.27 million) to a person with just a high school diploma ($1.3 million). Perhaps most important, extending the low interest rates will not lower tuition costs for the students who need it most. The Stafford Loans largely fund the tuition of middle- and upper-class students on the backs of taxpayers. Pell Grants, the federal assistance to the poorest students, should be the real focus of discussion. If Congress continues to subsidize low interest rates, they are handing the problem, and the mountain of debt, to future generations. In fact, they are passing on the debt to the very group of people they are trying to help: college students. With the federal government backing low interest rates, colleges have no incentive to lower tuition. Instead, the rates should be variable and tied to the market, not set by the government. The real problem here is the colleges and their unholy alliance with the federal government. Here's what the president should be saying: The college system is largely failing students and taxpayers. Colleges continue to raise their prices despite record increases in federal subsidies. Between 1982 and 2007, college tuition and fees rose more than 400% (about four times the rate of inflation) Today, the average student loan debt exceeds $25,000 and total student loan debt exceeds $1 trillion. Less than 60% of college students finish college in six years or less. One out of every two college graduates today are unemployed or underemployed. The system overspends and underperforms. It's unlikely that President Obama would ever say this. After all, he holds the system in his hands. Last year, in one of the most underreported political moves of his term, the Obama administration took over the student loan industry, cutting out private competition from banks. Taxpayers are now directly responsible for higher tuition costs and the resulting large amount of defaulted student loans. In 2010, total student loan debt exceeded credit card debt. It may not be long before this bubble bursts, hurting the very students who need help the most. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: Lowering interest on student loans doesn't bring down college costs .
Bennett: The issue has become the newest political cudgel .
He asks: How does President Obama plan to pay for the $6 billion subsidy?

"(CNN) -- A newly found pharaoh's tomb in Egypt has historians scrambling to rewrite the chronicles of the ancient kings of the Nile. Researchers with the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology recently discovered intricate and vibrantly colored pictures in the tombs of Abydos in the Egyptian desert, and what they read in the pictographs astounded them. The team leader found the name of a previously unknown pharaoh who ruled the area 3,600 years ago, and the first proof of the suspected but shadowy Abydos Dynasty. Josef Wegner, working with the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, discovered a previously looted tomb that unusually still had its pictures and writing in tact. The pharaoh's name is Woseribre Senebkay, described as the ""king of upper and lower Egypt."" ""It's exciting to find not just the tomb of one previously unknown pharaoh, but the necropolis of an entire forgotten dynasty,"" Wegner said in a statement from the Penn Museum, where he is associate curator in the Egypt Section. Tomb raiders had looted the chambers of any valuable gold and left the bones of the pharaoh's mummy scattered about. That gave the team the opportunity to reassemble most of the body, along with his funeral mask. It turns out Woseribre Senebkay was 5 feet, 9 inches tall and died some time in his mid-40s, the team determined. The discovery shows that during a fractured period of time around 1600 B.C. during which the north and south of the Nile were split into rival kingdoms, there was a middle kingdom that may have survived for several generations. Wegner suspects there will be much more evidence to uncover at the sprawling site buried under the hot Egyptian sand. ""Continued work in the royal tombs of the Abydos Dynasty promises to shed new light on the political history and society of an important but poorly understood era of Ancient Egypt,"" said Wegner.

"Mount St. Helens, Washington (CNN) -- A climber who fell into the crater of Mount St. Helens volcano on Monday has been found dead, an official said Tuesday. A U.S. Naval helicopter lifted the body of Joseph Bohlig, 52, from the south crater wall at 2:45 p.m. local time and flew it to Carson, Washington, for transport to the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office for autopsy, said David L. Cox, undersheriff of the Skamania County Sheriff's Office. Bohlig, of Kelso, Washington, was at the edge of the volcano's crater Monday when the cornice on which he was standing crumbled, causing him to plunge 1,500 feet down its ice- and rock-covered inner wall, authorities said. ""The snow gave way, the cornice overhang gave way as he was standing there and he essentially fell the distance that he did,"" Skamania County Sheriff Dave Brown said. ""Nobody saw him after he went over the crater rim, didn't see where he landed."" Fellow climber Scott Salkovics told CNN affiliate KGW that Bohlig had handed his camera to another climber and was about to pose for a picture with Mount Rainier in the background when he turned around and took a final step on the cornice. ""Boom, it busted off and I saw him clawing for the edge with a startled look on his face, and then he disappeared,"" Salkovics told KGW. ""I was looking right at him, he was only 10 feet away ... then he just disappeared."" KGW: ""He was only 10 feet away ... then he just disappeared"" Bohlig was a veteran climber, CNN affiliate KATU reported. Salkovics and Bohlig had recently returned from a climbing trip in Ecuador and thought it would be fun to do a trip on Mount St. Helens, KGW reported. Warnings about unstable cornices on the crater rim are posted, according to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest Web site. Every year, thousands of climbers trek to the rim of the active volcano, according to the Web site.

"(CNN) -- Declaring that ""Equality is the prime rib of America,"" pop star Lady Gaga urged Maine's two U.S. senators to help break a Republican filibuster on legislation that includes a repeal of the military's ban on openly homosexual service members. ""My name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta. I am an American citizen,"" the singer told a Portland, Maine, rally organized by the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network. She urged Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, both Republicans, to support the repeal of the Pentagon's ""don't ask, don't tell"" rule and share ""the greatest cut of meat that my country has to offer"" with gays and lesbians in the military. ""Shouldn't everyone deserve the right to wear the same meat dress that I do?"" asked the singer, who caught flak for showing up at MTV's Video Music Awards in a dress made of raw meat. ""Repeal 'don't ask, don't tell' or go home."" The 24-year-old singer also drew cheers by proposing a new law, titled, ""If you don't like it, go home,"" which would remove homophobic straight soldiers from the military instead of gay soldiers. ""If you are not honorable enough to fight without prejudice, go home,"" she shouted. Opponents of the 1993 ban have urged Snowe and Collins, both of whom oppose the policy, to join Democrats and help shut down a Republican-led filibuster of a defense authorization bill that would repeal the restriction. Democrats are unlikely to muster the 60-vote supermajority needed to get the bill to the Senate floor without their support. But in statements issued Monday, both senators indicated they would vote with GOP leaders and block the measure. A key procedural vote is set for Tuesday afternoon. In addition to speaking at Monday's rally, Gaga has used her online presence to rally her fans -- nicknamed ""Little Monsters"" -- in support of repeal.

"(CNN) -- The wife of a minister in India has died after a public controversy in which she reportedly accused her husband of having an affair with a Pakistani journalist, authorities said. Delhi Police spokesman Rajan Bhagat confirmed Friday that Sunanda Pushkar, wife of Minister Shashi Tharoor, has died, but he couldn't confirm a cause of death until a postmortem examination is conducted. Her death comes just days after CNN-IBN and other Indian media reported that she had hacked into her husband's Twitter account and tweeted that he was having an affair with a Pakistani journalist. That journalist, Mehr Tarar, however, dismissed the affair allegation in an article on the New Delhi Television website. On Thursday, a day before Pushkar's death was revealed, Tarar described Pushkar's purported tweets as ""wild allegations."" ""Her tweets to me are so crazy that all I can do is laugh,"" Tarar said. After Pushkar's death was announced, Tarar expressed shock on her Twitter account on Friday. ""I just woke up and read this. I'm absolutely shocked. This is too awful for words. So tragic I don't know what to say. Rest in peace, Sunanda,"" Tarar tweeted. Tarar spoke to CNN Friday, expressing grief and sorrow over Pushkar's death. ""I have been up the whole night, frozen in one spot, unable to eat or even have a sip of water,"" Tarar said. ""She had a Twitter fight with me, and then she died. I didn't even get a chance to call her up, and clear the air,"" she added. ""She seemed larger than life, always smiling, and the manner in which she died would haunt me for a long, long time."" Tarar also said the allegations of an affair were false. ""I had met the minister twice in my entire life and always in the presence of other people,"" Tarar said. ""We were in touch until June and then it was reduced to an e-mail or two in weeks. "" Pushkar, a businesswoman from Dubai, and Tharoor married in 2010.The couple was active in New Delhi's glamorous social circles. On Thursday, Pushkar and Tharoor issued a statement, saying they were ""happily married,"" but that Pushkar had been hospitalized this week and was resting. ""We are distressed by the unseemly controversy that has arisen about some unauthorised tweets from our Twitter accounts,"" the couple said in the statement, which was linked to Tharoor's Twitter page. ""Various distorted accounts of comments allegedly made by Sunanda have appeared in the press. It appears that some personal and private comments responding to these unauthorised tweets -- comments that were not intended for publication -- have been misrepresented and led to some erroneous conclusions,"" the couple said. On Pushkar's Twitter account Wednesday, a tweet accused Tarar of stalking Pushkar's husband: ""@MehrTarar leave us Indians alone and stop talking to my huband and pleading with him its digrading respect youself (sic) as a woman."" Another of the tweets purportedly from Pushkar said: ""@MehrTarar the audacity of a woman desperaely (sic) in love with an Indian 'please shashi dont make me go i pleaded and begged i love u Shashi.' "" CNN-IBN reported that Pushkar died in her room in a five-star hotel in New Delhi. The couple were staying at the hotel for a few days, said Abhinab Kumar, an aide to Tharoor.

Caluori is charged with making threats against the president and assaulting a federal officer, according to the affidavit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Seattle. Texas judge warns of civil war if Obama reelected . Molnar wrote that the e-mail, received by the FBI earlier Tuesday, said, ""I will kill the president !!!!!"" and ""You can't afford to call my bluff."" The message said that dying ""isn't frightening ... it's peaceful ... you will see..."" and spoke of a ""cop killing spree ... just over the hill,"" Molnar said. The e-mail included an address and challenged authorities to ""come and get me."" A database check confirmed that Caluori lived at the address in the e-mail,"" Molnar said in his affidavit, and the username of the e-mail account appeared consistent with his name. Molnar said he and Federal Way police officer Andy Hensing went to the apartment complex at the address, where an employee told them Caluori was a ""hothead"" with a ""temper"" who lived with his mother. The officers knocked on the apartment door twice with no answer. The third time, a man later identified as Caluori opened the door, Molnar said. ""Caluori was wearing a black bandoleer filled with 12-gauge shotgun shells around his torso. Attached to the bandoleer at chest level was a large black fixed-blade knife. On his ankle, Caluori was weaving a revolver in an ankle holster. Caluori's right hand was placed out-of-view behind his back,"" the affidavit said. The officers commanded the man several times to ""show us your hands."" At first he didn't comply. But then he ""moved his right hand from behind his back revealing a stockless black pump-action shotgun with a pistol grip,"" the affidavit said. After he raised the firearm, the officers scuffled with Caluori. By the numbers: Guns in America . ""Officer Hensing and I were able to take Caluori to the ground. Caluori continued to struggle and would not comply with our commands,"" Molnar said in the affidavit. ""Ultimately, Officer Hensing and I together were able to restrain Caluori and disarm him."" More Federal Way police arrived. Molnar said one of them asked Caluori if there was anything in the apartment that ""would hurt"" law officers and he replied, ""There are things inside that go boom."" The bomb squad was called to the scene and the residence and other apartments were evacuated. But police found no explosives. The shotgun Caluori pointed was ""loaded to capacity, including a round in the chamber. The safety was not engaged,"" the affidavit said. The pistol on his ankle was loaded with ""five hollow point .38 special caliber rounds,"" it said, and about 50 12-gauge shotgun rounds were recovered from the shotgun and the bandoleer. A search of the apartment produced an AK-47-type rifle, a .45 caliber pistol, a Bushmaster AR15 rifle, more ammunition and a laptop computer, Molnar said. Caluori's mother, identified as R.B. in the affidavit, said Caluori ""spends a lot of time on the computer"" but she ""does not know what he does on it."" According to the affidavit, R.B. said Caluori has ""negative views of President Obama and in the last few days, most recently that day, has made negative statements about the president."" After reading Caluori his Miranda rights, Molnar asked him if he knew why the police were at the scene. ""I think I do, but I don't want to say it,"" he said. He was shown a copy of the e-mail to the FBI and, asked if he wrote it, said, ""possibly,"" Molnar wrote. Asked if he had any ""issues with the president,"" Caluori replied, ""You don't have a high enough security clearance. Call the CIA or run it up the chain of command,"" Molnar said. Threatening the president is punishable by up to five years in prison and assault of a federal agent is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, the U.S. attorney's office said. ""Recent national events are a stark reminder that we must take these threats of death or violence seriously,"" U. S. Attorney Jenny A. Durkan said in a news release. ""This case had all the troubling ingredients: threats of violence and explosive devices, multiple weapons with hundreds of rounds and even brandishing of a weapon at law enforcement."" ""The United States Secret Service takes all threats against its protectees seriously. This situation is indicative of how a routine investigation can very easily turn violent,"" said James Helminski, special agent in charge of U.S. Secret Service in Seattle. ""We appreciate the professionalism of the Federal Way Police Department in defusing this potentially volatile situation and in the ongoing investigation."" Caluori is in custody at the Federal Detention Center at Sea-Tac, Washington. A detention hearing has been set for Monday, the U.S. attorney's office said. His attorney, Kyana Stephens, would not comment on the case or the charges. CNN Poll: Gun control opinions following shootings .","The arrest took place in a Seattle suburb .
